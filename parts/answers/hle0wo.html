		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One way is to search for the oldest stars we can observe. We can determine their elemental content via spectroscopy and compare that with models of stars. Depending on a stars generation and age, it will have different ratios of metals, fuel, etc..</p>
<p>Another way one can do this is by measuring the expansion rate of the universe. From this one can build a cosmological model incorporating that observation and extrapolate the present time.</p>
<p>We can actually see the phase transition of the early universe that's been cosmologically redshifted into the microwave background radiation. This provides quite a bit of information about the universe roughly 300,000 years after the big bang.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As some others have said, there are a few ways to determine the age of the universe. The most simplified way is to take Age = 1/H_0, H_0 is the Hubble constant. This however only works if the Hubble constant is indeed constant (doesn’t change over time), not to mention there is still tension in the measurements of H_0.</p>
<p>As far as finding the “center of the universe”, you’re looking at it! Extrapolating backwards puts all matter and energy in the universe together into one point. The Big Bang didn’t occur somewhere and expand <em>into</em> our universe, the Big Bang occurred everywhere in our universe and our universe expanded, allowing the primordial soup to cool down and allow structures to form.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most basic calculation is:</p>
<p>age of the universe = 1 / Hubble's constant</p>
<p>When you solve General Relativity for a universe, you end up with the FLRW metric. All you have to do then is plug in the numbers for the observed amount of matter, radiation, and dark energy and you can derive the age of the universe. Or you can use the Friedmann equations along with the equation of state to get a similar expression as above:</p>
<p>age of the universe = F / Hubble's constant, where F is measured to be 0.956</p>
<p>Most of our data to get F comes from looking at the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
