		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So pi is a special number in maths.  It's defined as the ratio of the circumference (edge) of a circle by the diameter (length across the middle).  This is a nice tangible definition, but pi crops up in loads of places.  Really, this is because there are a lot of places where circles are hiding in the background, and pi is like the key number of circles.</p>
<p>Euler's constant, e, is a bit like this.  It crops up in loads of places.  These areas might seem to be unrelated, but there's something linking them all together.  The difficulty is that where e comes from isn't as simple as a nice shape.  e is to do with change.  How quickly things change, and how this rate of change changes.  There isn't something as tangible as a circle.  But it crops up enough that we notice it, and so we give it a special name.</p>
<p>The number is roughly 2.72.  If you plot a graph of y=e^x and then you measure the slope at any point along the x axis, you'll find the slope is exactly e^x .  This is the only number that does this.  It's sort of the key feature of e.</p>
<p>When mathematicians try to work out the slope of a line, we use something called differentiation.  There are a bunch of rules you can use to do this, but e^x is the simplest, because of what I said above.  It's its own slope.  So, if we can find a way to sneakily change a function to have an e^x in it, we can make our lives a whole lot easier.</p>
<p>Edit: thanks :)</p>
<p>Edit 2: double thanks :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People have explained what e is, so here's a couple places where e shows up in math.</p>
<ul>
<li>You're a trader using a camel to transport hay bales. If the camel tries to carry more than 1 kg of hay, its back will break. You load up hay bales onto its back one by one, and each hay bale has a random weight between 0 and 1 kg. On average, how many bales will it take to break the camel's back?
<ul>
<li>The answer is e.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>On a game show, you are presented with n boxes of cash. The boxes have different amounts of cash. The rules are: You can open them one by one in any order you'd like. Once you open a box, you must then choose whether to take the box of cash or not. Once you open another box, you can no longer choose any previously opened box. In the case that you have opened all the boxes, you will need to pick the last one you opened. You can only pick one box to go home with. What is the optimal strategy to win as much money as possible?
<ul>
<li>The answer is to first open n/e boxes, reject them all, and then choose the first box which contains more cash than any of the first n/e boxes you opened.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>n people are playing Secret Santa. They choose who will send a gift to who by putting all their names in a hat, then having each person pick one out randomly. What is the probability that nobody will choose themselves?
<ul>
<li>It turns out that as n gets larger and larger, that probability approaches 1/e.</li>
</ul></li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's say you go to a bank that offers 100% interest per year. You deposit $100. After a year, you check your balance, and you get $200.</p>
<p>But then you see an offer at another bank. 100% interest, compounded every 6 months. So 50% interest at 6 months, another 50% on the new balance at the 1 year mark. You get $50 and then $75 for a total of $125 in interest, or $225 total.</p>
<p>Not to be outdone, the first bank offers you monthly compounding. (100/12)% per month. After the end of the year, you end up with $261. </p>
<p>The second bank goes back and offers you compounding weekly. 52 compounding periods of (100/52)%. You end up with $269 after the year. That's more, but not as big of a jump as before.</p>
<p>The first bank tries to get you back, they offer daily compounding. 100/365% interest every day. You end up with $271.</p>
<p>Not to be outdone, the second bank offers you per-minute interest. 525,600 compounding periods. After a year, you get... $271. The pennies might have changed, but nothing more is really happening. We've reached the limit.</p>
<p>That's where it stalls out. You can generalize the formula we were using to be (1+1/n)^(n). As <em>n</em> got bigger, we got more compounding periods, but for a smaller amount. As <em>n</em> gets bigger, the equation approaches <em>e</em>. This is the natural growth of the exponential function.</p>
<p><em>e</em> shows up everywhere in basically everything dealing with exponential functions. This is especially true because every single exponential function can easily be changed to work in form of e^(x) (more accurately, y=b^x = e^(ln b * x)).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other answers here are great, but I want to give a completely different answer just in case it’s relevant.</p>
<p>If you ever see a number written like 6.02e23, that is <em>not</em> the transcendental number e=2.71... but a way to denote very large numbers called “engineering notation “.  It’s equivalent to 6.02 x 10^23 , and means you should shift the decimal place on the first number over by the number of places given by the second.  That is, 602000000000000000000000.</p>
<p>Since many people see this system in computer programs that deal with large numbers, I thought I’d mention it because the other answers will be really confusing if this is the context which prompted the question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One element I haven't seen mentioned is that e tends to imply infinite feedback of some sort. That is, when you see a result that includes e, there is almost certainly some underlying process whose output is fed back into the input and you're looking at the steady state of a potentially infinite process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
