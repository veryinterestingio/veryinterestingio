		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The throbbing is due to the slightly increased blood flow to that region of burnt skin. After the burn, your skin receptors become a bit more sensitive in that locality and so you tend to sense that pulsating blood flow easier. </p>
<p>The body sends more blood there to fight infection, begin wound healing, stem any blood loss,  etc </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Burns kill nerves.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Growing nerves is painful.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The heat source is exciting your healing cells. Injured/healing cells are more sensitive. You are feeling your heartbeat (throbbing) and pain because of the healing process.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If you persist in introducing heat to your burn, it will begin to blister worse and worse (almost as if the body is slowly trying to drown the fire burning you)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Third degree (full thickness) burns kills skin nerves- this makes it numb. These likely do not grow back.
Cutaneous nerves often grow back but generally do not cause pain unless they malform into a neuroma</p>
<p>Burns destroy varying thickness of the epidermis (skin). This mounts an inflammatory response. This causes pain, redness, swelling.</p>
<p>Exposing an area to a heat source- dilates blood vessels in the area- causing more pressure which may cause  throbbing and more pain. It can increase swelling as well, but unlikely in short bursts as described </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simplest explanation I can think of is that any injury usually results in swelling as fluids like lymph and blood accumulate and try to heal the injury. The throbbing is possibly your heart beat thatâ€™s more obvious because of the swelling. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
