		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body is a jerk. A hypnic jerk. When you are asleep, your bodies voluntary muscle control is restricted in order to prevent you from hurting yourself and moving around in your sleep. However, in certain situations like falling out of your bed, being suddenly woken, etc, you need to move quickly and so your body can snap out of it but there is a bit of a muscle contraction as this happens if you aren't relaxed as it happens. For instance if you're balancing your head on your hand and falling asleep at your desk, if your head starts to drop, you may jolt awake thinking your falling, because your brain thought you were. </p>
<p>Usually this inability to move only happens after you're asleep, and ends before you're awake. When it happens while you're semi awake or fully awake, you're either having a hypnic jerk, or a night terror (where you are awake but can't move)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
