		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pilot here with the alternative answer as many others have given you your expected answer.</p>
<p>I'm going to assume you have, without an aircraft or other pressurised container to protect you, somehow accelerated to a speed above 761mph, the speed of sound at sea level (Assuming 20°C or 68°F ambient temperature). Let's call it 800mph.</p>
<p>Long before you even got anywhere near the 800mph mark, you would be dead. The faster you accelerated to the 800mph mark, the quicker you die, but die you would. Screaming would not happen. The how will vary greatly depending on the speed of your acceleration but many of the principles will be the same.</p>
<p>The first thing to kill you is debatable and again, dependant on your speed of acceleration but at a moderately slow acceleration in my opinion the first thing to send you off this mortal coil would be breathing resistance. As you accelerated somewhere beyond the 400mph mark, the air pressure forcing against you would be too great for you to intake and expel air out of your lungs, even by turning your head away against the wind. You could wear a helmet of some kind to prevent this but then the air around your mouth is moving with you and thus breaks the rule of the question.</p>
<p>But turning your head at this point in time is kind of moot. Because you wouldn't be able to. As you go faster and faster through earths atmosphere, you begin to bump up against air, because even though you can't see it, air has mass. The faster you go, the faster you bump up against it and eventually the air in front of you can't get out of your way fast enough. So the air starts to feel a lot more solid as it compresses. At 600mph it's pretty hard indeed. Too hard.</p>
<p>Although there are many people who have ejected from fighter aircraft at speeds in this range and even higher, many of them suffer from horrendous injuries and most pilots will attempt to eject in a way that minimises their forward velocity if they are able to. <a href="https://theaviationist.com/2015/03/17/sr-71-mid-air-disintegration/" target="_blank">The fastest ejection ever to succeed took place at three times the speed of sound but the pilot had many aids to ensure it was possible</a>. Most jet jockeys of slower aircraft don't have what he had. </p>
<p>However even when they do eject, the air resistance slows the ejected pilot down pretty quick. But your not slowing down, your still accelerating to our magic 800mph. Bumping against that air faster and faster, the air cannot get out of the way any more so it does what a gas does when it can't move. It compresses. That makes it harder. And as it gets harder, it begins to get harder for whatever is compressing it to move through it. In this case we will assume your flying like superman, so it's your head on the firing line. It will be subject to around 3g of force (Three times the force of gravity). This doesn't sound like much but it's a constant force. This isn't a huge problem unless you move your head even just the tiniest little bit, in which case your neck snaps like a twig as you pass somewhere around the 650mph mark from the air resistance, which is too great for a human spine to endure (If your accelerating really fast, this will likely kill you first).</p>
<p>Except you might not feel it because you might have cooked to death a few seconds before, and if you haven't then it won't be long before you will. Because when you begin to go so fast that air can't get out of your way fast enough, the side effect of it compressing is that it begins to heat up and it gets hotter the faster you go and the more it gets compressed. This is the same reason that spacecraft return modules and the shuttle will heat up to extremely hot temperatures as they return to earth, and why most comets and asteroids burn up in earths atmosphere.</p>
<p>Now your not going anywhere near as fast as most spacecraft are when they re-enter earths atmosphere, but at 800mph the temperature is still going to be hot enough to kill a human. Aircraft use special composites and design techniques to bleed the heat off but at 800mph it's not too hot for an airframe to handle. It's definitely too hot for a human though. It's tough to give an exact temperature as it would depend on a huge range of factors but it would be somewhere between 200°F or around 93°C if not hotter. You would only survive a sustained few moments of that at most.</p>
<p>How fast all this happens depends on how fast you accelerate but there's no doubt at 800mph your screaming days are over. If there was any screaming to be done, you did it involuntarily long before you broke the sound barrier.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a pressurised compartment or spacesuit or something, the air between your mouth and ears isn't moving relative to you, so things are normal. If the air is moving past you faster than the speed of sound, (either you or the air can be moving) the sound from your mouth may not be able to travel through the air to your ears.<br />
You might still hear something due to sound waves propagating through your bones, but it's more likely that you'd not because the air around your head would be pressurised by ram pressure and probably deafen you.
This reasoning may well be invalid because air behaves differently when it is hitting your face at hundreds of metres per second to when it is unimpeded.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer is: your voice will propagate only within limited directions behind you. It will not propagate in front of you.</p>
<p>The long answer is:</p>
<p>If you traveling faster than speed of sound, at first, you will have the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhlxH9XDW_A" target="_blank">bow-shock wave</a> in front of you. Second if you scream, the sound wave (which is the small perturbation) will propagate only inside <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/machang.html" target="_blank">Mach cone</a>, where the cone slope depends on your velocity and equals to sin(alpha) = c/v, where &quot;c&quot; is the speed of sound and &quot;v&quot; your velocity. Number v/c is called Mach number.</p>
<p>Edit: add short answer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Is there a density level where the speed of sound is slow enough and the friction of the air is low enough that it is possible to experience it?</p>
<p>Edit. If we can bare 100 mph wind speeds at sea level could we tolerate 0.1 atmospheres at 1000mph?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, nothing special. If you clapped your hands, you'd be displaced far enough that the sound will never reach your ear. If you screamed, some of the sound would reach your ear so it would be muffled.. This is assuming you weren't deaf from the air blowing past your face.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
