		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cruise can often be sold to be used in less profitable routes. For example as more of a passenger ferry between countries. Some may also be converted into ferries by opening a deck for vehicle parking and cutting a hatch in the side of the ship. But eventually the ships do end up being scrapped. Nowadays this usually happens in low cost countries more or less following environmental laws. The ship will be stripped of parts that is needed elsewhere. The interior is often torn down piece by piece and each piece is sold separately. But you do occasionally have hotels, bars and restaurants under construction buy up large parts of the interior. Especially if there are lavish themed rooms where each individual item would look out of place on its own but everything fits well together the entire room may be torn down and reconstructed elsewhere. But most of the items from ship will end up getting melted down, burned or thrown in a landfill.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
