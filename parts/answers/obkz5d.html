		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The original theory was that the surface area could never decrease, but since the discovery of Hawking radiation it has been modified to instead say that the surface area can not decrease through &quot;classical&quot; processes. It can decrease through quantum effects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as I am aware, the Hawking Area Theorem actually doesn't say anything at all about the black hole losing mass. It's all about the black hole gaining mass. The issue that the theorem was designed to solve, at least according to my own reading of the literature, is that some circumstances that cause a black hole to gain mass, like a collision of two black holes, also increase the black hole's spin. The increase in spin can &quot;compress&quot; the event horizon, cancelling out the increase in surface area provided by the additional mass and even, according to some theories prior to Hawking, causing the black hole's area to decrease after a collision. Hawking's Area Theorem states that this will never happen. When a black hole gains mass, no matter how much spin the object falling into it had, it will never increase it's spin enough to make the new black hole resulting from the collision smaller than the original black hole. If a black hole and a star or two black holes collide, the end result will never be a black hole with a smaller event horizon, regardless of the spin of the two objects.</p>
<p>So this is why it doesn't seem to jive with Hawking Radiation. The Area Theorem doesn't really state that a black hole can &quot;never get smaller&quot;. It says that it can never get smaller while increasing its mass. At the time the theory was proposed, there was no mechanism for a black hole to lose mass, so saying that black holes never get smaller was a valid way to interpret it. In reality, like most things in science, the situation is a little more complicated. Better to say &quot;The surface area of a black hole's event horizon can never decrease, so long as the material inside of the black hole does not decrease.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This response addresses the logic rather than the science.</p>
<p>All theorems are &quot;if-then&quot; statements. If <em>p</em> is true, then the theorem shows that <em>q</em> <strong>must</strong> be true. (Note that <em>p</em> can consist of multiple conditions that must all be true for <em>p</em> to be true.)</p>
<p>The area theorem says &quot;If <em>p</em> is true, then then the area can only increase.&quot; The Hawking radiation results shows that <em>p</em> is not true.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's just ordinary thermodynamics. If the entropy of the resultant radiation is higher than the change of the area, there's no reason why a blackhole won't shrink. The positive area change is only applied is specific circumstances like black hole mergers</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
