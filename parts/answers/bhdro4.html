		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That isn’t experienced by everyone. I certainly don’t have anything remotely like a movie playing in my head when I read, all I see is the words and their meaning. </p>
<p>r/aphantasia is populated by people who cannot “see” pictures in their head at all. </p>
<p>People think and conceptualise in such a wide variety of ways. Pictures, sounds, words, spatialisation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People have already discussed the variation in &quot;imagination&quot;, I'll simply chime in to point out that the brain is highly modular. The part of your brain responsible for processing visual information is completely distinct from the part responsible for comprehending words. So reading while creating imagery is possible because the two functions are being performed by different areas.  </p>
<p>As for why we are able to do it, self-defense. If we can visualise a dangerous situation and experience it hypothetically, we can develop a better defense, should we ever encounter it, as well as understand and predict the various outcomes; should I fight or should I flee?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not everyone gets this sensation. It has to do with your ability to see images and recall them afterwards, even being able to manipulate them in your mind. This ability is known as spatial intelligence, and it's something everyone posesses to some degree. Some people are more naturally gifted at it than others, and it can be honed and trained.</p>
<p>I personally have a very strong spatial intelligence and have sometimes even confused my memories of a book for memories of a movie. Another interesting personal anecdote about spatial intelligence is that it can be expanded into four or five dimensions, although with much difficulty as there is nothing one can observe that would hone that ability.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually get frustrated at my inability to visualise what's going on in most books. And I'd say I have a reasonably good imagination, but it just doesn't happen for me.</p>
<p>About half way through a book I'll tend to start losing track of who's who, where they are etc. Perhaps it's because I tend to read more complex sci-fi when I actually do read. Some writers make it easier than others.</p>
<p>I do see the value in books, but this is why I will always prefer a good movie or series.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
