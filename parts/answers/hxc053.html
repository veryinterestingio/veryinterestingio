		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>mining nickel is fairly easy and efficient depending on whether it is mined in a open cut mine or a underground mine ( underground mining tends to be a lot more expensive and slower due to ground support needed ) . Depending on ore types, processing into nickel concentrates can be very simple and efficient or can be horrendously complicated and expensive but still very efficient .  Refining nickel into metal is the difficult and expensive part due to the  amounts of processes and materials needed  to turn nickel concentrates into metal and treating and reprocessing the wastes from refining is the inefficient part that all refining company's are always looking to improve .</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It would actually be really interesting for Mr. Tesla to invest himself in a mining company because mining co's are fairly slow to innovate and he would add an interesting new approach. But the challenges of opening a new mine are staggering. The fact is that building a new mine is not a very safe investment for many reasons. Much riskier than starting an electric car company.</p>
<p>Let me give an example.</p>
<p>When Tesla builds their car factory, they have by then built many prototype cars, many prototypes of all of their parts and components, designed their assembly process exactly, established all of their quality requirements and their chain of supply to get the needed components in suitable quantities, price and quality. While it may be questionable if the factory will be able to sell as many cars as they claim, or be profitable doing so, is still in question. But the fact that they can build the car they say they can build with this factory is fairly certain. After completing the factory, if Teslas were not popular and did not sell well, there is still the possibility to retool to make a different car, or a better version of a Tesla.</p>
<p>Now consider a company that owns the rights to a large metal deposit that begins several hundred feet below the ground and extends some 500m down. They have drilled holes down to explore what is under the ground, many, many holes in fact, and they think are confident they know the extents of the ore body, ie it's rough physical dimensions, how the mineral content changes within that to some extent, how they can mine it, etc. They have already spent maybe a billion dollars buying the rights to this when it was a less studied deposit, and maybe a few hundred million doing engineering studies, drilling campaigns, environmental studies, permitting studies, etc. This has taken 10-15 years thus far. NOW after all that work, the company has to apply for their water permits, their environmental permit, file their reclamation plans, operating permits etc. They have to go to public comments and spend years convincing the public that they CAN do this safely, and they WILL meet and exceed the legal requirements, and they will go above and beyond to protect the environment in ways that no other mining project has yet done. This can go years, and may or may not be successful. Even if they DO get their permits to operate, and have sufficient cash or investors to spend the next billion dollars over 3 years to actually build and start up the mine, there have been many cases of citizens groups filing a lawsuit and a judge revoking the permit and sending them back towards the beginning of that process somewhere. (There is an argument of course that diligence is important here and I don't argue that- but we can't shift the rules so dramatically at the end of the game if you know what I mean). </p>
<p>Anyway, even if they HAVE successfully gotten through all this, and built and opened their mine, they have continuous technical challenges. Their mine plan might not work as expected. They might have planned to use an open pit mine but the ground is not as stable as expected. They might have planned to mine underground but the rate of productivity in preparing the underground workings to access the ore body is crippled by rock instability they couldn't foresee from their drilling (see <a href="https://www.mining.com/rio-tinto-faces-1-9bn-cost-blowout-further-delays-at-oyu-tolgoi-copper-gold-mine/" target="_blank">Oyu Tolgoi mine in Mongolia, happening now</a>). The ore could have harmful inclusions that were not detected in drilling that interferes with separating and concentrating the valuable minerals in the milling process on the surface. Or that contaminant could render their concentrate product unsaleable (for example too much arsenic in a copper concentrate makes it unsalable, or too much silica in an iron concentrate, too much copper in a nickel concentrate, too much lead in a zinc concentrate). The ore could simply be lower in grade than expected or harder to process with sufficient metal recovery. Or, maybe they don't have any such problems... but in the several years it takes between starting to build the mine and mill and getting it started up in production, commodity prices have dropped and they don't make enough money to stay in operation. </p>
<p>Putting the example of building a Tesla factory in the context of the mining example, this is like if Tesla decided today they have done all the correct diligence to build a factory and economically build and sell Tesla electric cars. They think it will take them 2-3 years to build that factory but it actually takes them 15, because they have to fight off 10 lawsuits and rejected construction permits along the way. Once they successfully build the plant and start it up, it turns out that many of their electric motors that were supposed to be a particular size are not actually the size they though they were, and there's nothing they can do about it. The batteries they are building, which in their sample runs reliably yielded about 100 kWh, actually only produce 20-50 kWh in half of cases. They thought they would have 19&quot; tires but it turns out they can only get 15&quot; tires. And they thought they could sell a Tesla for $75k but now it turns out the market price for the commodity electric sports car is only $50k due to tradewars between the US and China causing an excess inventory of electric cars on the market.  In the real world, for Tesla, most of these problems are quite far fetched and if they arose are solvable by R&amp;D and improving/correcting problems. In the case of a mine, you are stuck with what you have in the ground. You can't change your supplier, it is what nature gave you. </p>
<p>By the way Tesla also doesn't have to worry at their factory so much about attracting their workers to a far away remote place (maybe even fly in/fly out in 2 week shifts), keeping them safe in a fairly hazardous operation, and protecting the environment from disaster. (not to downplay safety of workers but this is much easier to manage in a factory than in a mining environment).</p>
<p>A good recent example is <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/quebec-lithium-mine-s-bankruptcy-flags-canadian-market-obstacles-analysts-say-58533815" target="_blank">Nemaska Lithium in Quebec</a>. Everyone thinks lithium is a slam dunk moneymaker, surely, what with electric cars.... Well Nemaska Lithium got all the way through this process to the point of having all their permits, having the mine ready with their process plant in construction and having bought much of their equipment. But, they burned through their cash more quickly than expected due to engineering and construction delays, defaulted on their first supply contracts that they weren't ready to sell product for in time, and went bankrupt. Lithium prices were dropping anyway too. Before that, Quebec Lithium, a different company and different mine, got alllll the way up into operation, but couldn't produce any product successfully, and they also went bankrupt. I believe that operation was since bought up, restarted, and gone bankrupt again, just in the last several years.</p>
<p>The same kind of rushes are taking place in graphite mining, also related to Tesla and electric cars. See this video (which I really love btw...)   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEgxEfXdbng" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEgxEfXdbng" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEgxEfXdbng</a></a> </p>
<p>I hope this at least provokes some thought for y'all. Cheers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because 1st world nations eschew mining developments due to nimbyism leaving mining to happen in 2nd and 3rd world countries that don't give a shit about efficiency or the environment. There's lots of good nickel mining in USA and Canada but new mining will tend to happen in less regulated regimes, because while people will gladly say no to mining in their area, they will not say no to the goods they want that ultimately get made anyway by getting the materials elsewhere. Out of sight, out of mind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
