		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nerves don't feel things in the way you are describing. They act purely to transmit a physical sensation, in this case, of light touch. The pleasant emotion you are referring to is a construct of the brain. The nerves from the penis end up stimulating multiple areas of the brain associated with feeling good. They also act on other areas of the brain that go on to stimulate the various processes of orgasm and ejaculation.</p>
<p>Incidentally, there are other nerves that purely transmit the physical sensation of pain and many other types of physical sensation. These pain nerves will stimulate areas of the brain associated with negative feelings. </p>
<p>The relationship between emotions/feelings, and the physical sensations we connect to them, is the job of the brain, not of the nerves themselves.</p>
<p>As for why those glans nerves end up stimulating pleasure centres of the brain more than say, touch sensitive nerves in the arm do, that's down to the evolution of the brain. It was evolutionarily beneficial to make sex feel good, so that organisms want to do it more!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is possible to retrain other types of sensations to cause an arousal response. Typically this is done in conjunction with erotic touch and whatnot but it is absolutely possible to get your brain to conflate a totally benign sensation such as a arm touch, or the smell of cinnamon, with sexual arousal</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it has more to do with how they're wired to the brain as opposed to being a different type of nerve. I know they are more densely populated in certain areas/erogenous zones.</p>
<p>Again though, I think it's just how their wired. Same with nerve cells in your throat triggering a cough, eyes triggering a blink, etc. I guess if we could figure out how to wire the nerves in your pinky toe to the right part of the brain you might be able to accomplish what you're trying to do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
