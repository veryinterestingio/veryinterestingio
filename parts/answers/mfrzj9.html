Whether it counts as &quot;a large number&quot; is up to you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Spiral galaxies have 3 main components. The disc, the bulge, and the halo. The disc is the flattened spiral part. The bulge is an inner, relatively very dense, spherical distribution of stars. The halo is a diffuse spherical distribution of stars and stellar clusters that extends out basically as far as the disc does, if not farther. The interesting thing about the halo is that it is proportionally older stars (population 2) that exist out there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure if <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2018/08/30/our-motion-through-space-isnt-a-vortex-but-something-far-more-interesting/?sh=7c3bf8d7ec2b" target="_blank">this</a> is what you're looking for. But our solar system rotates at about a 60 degree angle to the plane of the galaxy. </p>
<p>This angle is what helps or hinders our ability to see other solar systems, depending on what method is being used. If another solar system rotates perpendicular to ours, we can't see any dimming of the star as planets pass in front of it because from our vantage point, they're never going to eclipse their star. But this is one orientation that permits us to see some of the exoplanets easier.</p>
<p>However, if a solar system is rotating parallel to ours, we can see the star dim as objects pass between that star and us. </p>
<p>Or, are you asking a different kind of question. If you imagine the galaxy as a dinner plate, are you asking if any stars are going instead of around the surface of the plate, it would instead go in a circle over the top and circling around under the bottom?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There can and do exist stars that orbit on highly inclined, even retrograde orbits in spiral galaxies. They are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_star" target="_blank">halo stars</a>.</p>
<p>These stars did not form as part of the their parent galaxy. Instead, they generally formed in dwarf galaxies that are swallowed and torn apart by a larger spiral galaxy. The swallowing and shredding of the dwarf galaxies completely quenches star formation, all gas clouds or dust are captured in the spiral disk. No new stars are formed in the halo, and the stars are generally very old. They are not common. As per wikipedia, only about 1% of a galaxy's stellar mass resides in the galactic halo.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Maybe 0.1-1% of total stellar count or mass. Something along the lines of 0.1-10 million stars at least.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Milky Way contains something on the order of 100 billion stars. 0.1-1% of the stars translates to 100 million to 1 billion stars. The Milky Way is very big.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
