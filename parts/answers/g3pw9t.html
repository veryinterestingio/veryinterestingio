The handle has to conduct heat from the rest of the pan through a small isthmus and has a much larger surface area in contact with cooler air. So it is going to take more heat and time to heat up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cast iron is not that great of a conductor of heat. That's one of the reasons it takes a long time for the pan to heat up. This is also why it's great for cooking. It will also retain that heat once it has it.
Your handle stays cool because of this </p>
<p>Aluminum is a great conductor of heat and it loses its heat rapidly too making it a not so great cooking material.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, metals are not all equally great conductors of heat (or electricity, for that matter).  They're just generally better than (typical) insulators.</p>
<p>Some pure metals, like aluminum, copper, gold, silver, are very good thermal conductors indeed.  Others, like titanium, lead, and yes, iron, are not so great.  In addition, metal alloys (like brass, stainless steel) tend to be poor, and your cast-iron pan is not pure iron... it's got impurities that make it an alloy.  This is why some stainless-steel pans have copper or aluminum on the bottom or sandwiched in between the stainless-steel layers, to spread the heat.</p>
<p>The thermal conductivity of a metal depends on how many electrons it has to help transfer the heat, and how &quot;clean&quot; the lattice is in which those electrons are flowing.   Adding impurities (ie making an alloy) makes the lattice irregular, so the electrons have more stuff to bump into.</p>
<p>If you want to test this out, take a pricey or old silver spoon and put it in your hot tea, along with a stainless steel spoon, and see which handle gets hot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
