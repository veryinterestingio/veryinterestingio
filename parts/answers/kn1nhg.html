		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Air is not good at absorbing radiation, which is evident from the fact that you can see very clearly in the air. This is possible because light waves pass through the air with little interference. The same is true for infrared radiation, which is what heats up Earth mostly. Rather than being absorbed by the air it’s absorbed by the Earth’s surface. The surface, in turn, heats up the layer of air next to it. This down-to-surface air then rises up, because warm air is less dense than cold air, making that colder upper air settle down somewhere else. This process causes most of what we call weather, by the way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The atmosphere consists of different layers, composed of different gases. Depending on conposition, these layers will absorb different radiation at different wavelengths. </p>
<p>You have definitely heard of this already in the context of UV/ozone - most hard radiation is absorbed by the upper layers, which is necessary for life on land.</p>
<p>Due to this, there are indeed layers that heat up a lot - the thermosphere, the top layer, will heat up to 1700°C (although it has very low density - almost a vacuum - so it wont burn things passing through it). </p>
<p>The lower layers, however, will let most of the light that reaches them through. The light is converted to heat when it hits the ground, and (mostly) leaves the ground in the form of radiation again. Thats why in the lower parts of the atmosphere, the temperature drops the further you are from the ground.</p>
<p>Btw: there is a &quot;hole&quot; in the absorption spectrum of the atmosphere around visible the visible spectrum. This means that the wavelengths we can see pass through almost unhindered - thats the reason we evolved to see those wavelengths.
Incidentally, those are also the wavelengths which the suns emits most.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but the majority of the heat makes it to the surface of the earth rather than heating up the layers of air it passes through. Especially at higher altitudes, the density of the air is really low (hence why we can't breathe, airplanes can't fly etc) that there aren't many particles for the rays to hit and heat up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sun is a light that radiates in certain colors more than others (most of the light coming from the sun is ultraviolet which means our eyes can’t see it but there’s a lot of it!)</p>
<p>The atmosphere is like a big filter that only blocks some of the sun’s colors.  Fortunately it blocks the ultraviolet colors (and the even more energetic stuff) very well.  This happens at the top, which is quite hot!  (It doesn’t feel hot to the touch though because it’s really really thin air, but it is absorbing a lot, and we’d be dead without it).</p>
<p>But once that top layer is done, the rest of the light pretty much passes through (clouds are an exception).   The leftover light barely interacts with the atmosphere at all and so doesn’t heat it up.  The light comes straight to the ground.</p>
<p>The earth absorbs it and then actually re-radiates it back to space, but now it’s a completely different color (still not visible to our eyes, but infrared rather than ultraviolet).  The filter of the atmosphere is really good at blocking this color of light, so it does warm up.  But it warms from the ground up.  This is a good thing too because if that heat were lost to space, earth would be about -18C.  (This is the greenhouse effect!)</p>
<p>So hot but thin at the top.  Warm and dense at the bottom, and mostly nothing in the middle (except clouds).</p>
<p>By the way the inflows and outflows are mostly in balance but certain gases are super good at blocking the light of the color that the earth (not the sun) emits.  Increasing concentrations of those gases makes less heat go back out to space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Don’t the top layers technically have high heat, but produce a low temperature due to density?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
