		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Teeth are attached to the skull.  They are not fused to the skull.  But then none of your bones are fused together.</p>
<p>Your skeleton is connected by ligaments, not bone.  When you die your ligaments dry out but keep your bones connected for awhile, eventually they turn to dust.</p>
<p>Your teeth are also held to your skull by ligaments, the periodontal ligaments.  And the roots of your teeth (which are part of the teeth) go into holes in your skull.  So your teeth are held to your skull much more than the rest of your skeleton is held together.  And your teeth will remain attached to your skull much longer than the rest of your skeleton will remain together.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One piece of the story that I haven't seen mentioned yet: mechanical retention.  </p>
<p>Tooth roots are rarely perfectly straight.  In order for a tooth to come out it needs a path through the bone to do so.  If the root is curved or flared, in essence it's mechanically locked in place the same way a dovetail joint holds wood together.  </p>
<p>True ELI5:  Put your hand (tooth) in a bucket.  Surround your hand and arm with plaster (bone) and let it set.  Now try to take your hand out of the plaster.  You can't because there isn't a pathway to pull your hand out due to the differences in shape and sizes of your arm, wrist, palm and fingers.  </p>
<p>Extra info:  when getting a tooth removed, you might hear the dentist/surgeon talk about feeling &quot;pressure.&quot;  We're literally expanding the bone around the tooth to make space so it has a pathway come out.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember when j got to Navy boot camp, I had my four wisdom teeth pulled at once. It took sixteen numbing shots and local anesthesia to make it as painless as possible. I can’t remember whether it was the top or bottom teeth, but one side pulled out fairly easily while the other required splitting my teeth into quarters. The dentist said to prepare for crackle and pop, which accurately describes how the teeth sounded as they were being jerked out. It took a few days to fully heal and socket rinsing with a syringe to clear out after meal food particles. Flushing them out and seeing the amount of food that got packed into the sockets were always a surprise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So teeth are set into sockets of the skull and jaw. They can be pulled because the don’t fuse into one but they are attached by tissue. This means that most of the time teeth stay with the skull of most species after decomposing. This also mean we have a lot of toothed skulls that fossilized. It is pretty useful in paleo zoology actually. Mostly because teeth tell you a lot of what the animal eats</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
