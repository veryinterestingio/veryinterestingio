		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok, a lot of people are anthropomorphizing the body a little bit with these answers. The body doesn’t “recognize increased pressure/wear.” Actually the pressure itself damages the lipid shells of skin cells causing them to interlock and mesh together more strongly. Then when they die they are more tightly bound to neighboring cells and do not slough off. This process repeated over and over creates a crust of dead skin bound tightly to itself and the living skin underneath. It’s sort of a passive process rather than the active one most people are describing.</p>
<p>Edit: Wow first gold, silver, etc. thanks guys, and also “slough”</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am by no means a medical expert and am answering from about 15 minutes of Google research.</p>
<p>A callus is pretty much the body protecting itself when it notices that an area of itself gets more friction or pressure than usual.  Basically the body saying &quot;hey I'm gonna grow some more layers of skin here to protect myself from the outer layer of skin getting rubbed completely off or from blisters forming.&quot;</p>
<p>They're like nature's work gloves. Your body notices that section of skin gets used a lot more so it forms additional layers of skin to protect it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
