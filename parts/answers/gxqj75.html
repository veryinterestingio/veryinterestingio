		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The dark pigment absorbs the light so the cells don't.<br />
Since the pigment is absorbing the light, the cells don't get their DNA damaged by the UV light, and don't turn cancerous or self-destruct.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Wait until they start putting on sunscreen and see the difference. Then also wait until they show people of color and how they already essentially have sunscreen built in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like a shield, it absorbs more of the energy so less of it gets through the skin to damage it/burn it.</p>
<p>Because its light a lot of people think mirror, but if you think of it like tiny laser rays/bullets then it makes sense that you want to put up a shield to stop them, and thats what melanin is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have pointed out, it doesn’t do much have to do with what absorbs the most energy (from a physics point of view) but rather what type of melanin nest blocks uv light. </p>
<p>But the next question then becomes, why aren’t we all dark? After all more protection is better right?</p>
<p>Turns out, the darker melanin type, while offering better protection, is also worse at producing vitamin D. Whereas light melanin is worse at protecting you from uv light, but better at producing vitamin D. Making light skin better in places with less sun.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
