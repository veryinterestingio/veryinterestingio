		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TLDR: Filling seats costs money, and call flows vary throughout the day.</p>
<p>The call center I worked at had a contract that was for 80% handle time within 5 minutes. That means that 80% of calls had to be answered within 5 minutes. This sounds like a lot, but that translates to just under 5 hours of insane queueing every day. Most of the 80% quota was filled on the overnight shift when we had few calls.</p>
<p>Part of the science and statistics of running a call center is understanding when you can expect certain amounts of call volume and staffing accordingly.</p>
<p>It's all about using the minimum number of staff to run the facility effectively.</p>
<p>They also know how long people are willing to wait on hold so they can tolerate a certain amount of calls in queue. One hour the queue will be high, and the next hour there won't be any queue. So why pay to have seats filled for staff that do nothing for most of the day?</p>
<p>It's better to fill the seats expecting average/predicted handle times and tolerate a queue during the busiest periods.</p>
<p>Did I mention outsourced call centers have a tendency to treat their staff like cattle?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Call centers figure out about how long people are willing to wait for someone to come on the line.  Then they staff according to that - if they have enough people to answer calls as they come in, they consider that overstaffed and thus a waste of money.</p>
<p>The line about unusually high call volumes is thrown in to generate sympathy and reduce anger on the part of the callers.  Kind of like the button at most crosswalks doesn't actually change the light any faster, but it gives pedestrians something to do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just a quick response: Most major Call Centres will be using Erlang calculations which stem from queuing theory:</p>

<p>Major driver is, What percentage of calls do you want answered in how many seconds?</p>
<p>Increasing the % requires more staff, decreasing the seconds requires more staff, and the reverse of these will require less staff.</p>
<p>Edit: You also need to accurately &quot;Forecast&quot; your call demand, which is sometimes more art than science.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>CS work-from-home call taker here.  </p>
<p>When calls drop to a certain level, they start putting CS people on stand-by where they're not getting paid.  See, sometimes you get paid by the hour, or by the calls you take.  </p>
<p>The idea, for the managers, is to keep just enough people on the phones, taking calls, to keep up with the flow and keep wait times to 5-10 minutes.  That keeps your people busy and calls get answered in a timeframe that we'll tolerate.  Any more than that and people get answered immediately and that tends to create the expectation of instantly answered phones.  It also costs more money to keep too many CS people on the phones.</p>
<p>tl;dr version: They short the number of CS people on the phones to save money and to keep us used to waiting 5-10 minutes for a CS person.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's probably some degree of <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/the-inspection-paradox-is-everywhere-2ef1c2e9d709" target="_blank">inspection paradox</a> here as well. You happen to call at times that lots of other people happen to call (holiday afternoon, or when there's a service interruption, etc.).</p>
<p>Could also be some degree of expectation-setting. Even if these are very typically call volumes, you have no way of knowing that, so you may be less likely to get frustrated with the wait if you believe it really is a high-volume situation (and not just chronically low staffing to cut down on costs).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
