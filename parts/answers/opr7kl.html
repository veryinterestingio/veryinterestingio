		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nothing.  It is expanding in an internal relative sense.  Any two points are getting further from each other as time goes on.  It isnt and doesnt need to expand into anything.  </p>
<p>To put it another way it's a question that doesnt make sense because the universe is all of space and time and there isnt a space externally in which it exists.  Our inability to visualize this is a result of our brain which evolved to percieve medium size things moving ar medium speeds.  The very large, the very small and the very fast dont work in a way that we can intuitively visualize.  The expansion of space is just like that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If the universe is infinite, which a lot of people believe, then it doesn't need to expand into anything because it has no edge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One interesting analogy is that of a party balloon being filled. Imagine you take a marker and dot the balloon all around, randomly. Then, as you start inflating the balloon, the dots all start moving away from one another uniformly. Just imagine the universe is that balloon's surface. From your perspective, it isn't really expanding into anything, it's just expanding everywhere. The very fabric of the balloon is the one stretching, since the &quot;outside&quot; and &quot;inside&quot; of the balloon are irrelevant, and might not exist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
