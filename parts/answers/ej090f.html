		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This Feynman video does a great job of why explaining physical concepts is hard:   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1lL-hXO27Q&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1lL-hXO27Q&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1lL-hXO27Q&feature=youtu.be</a></a>  Things are the way they are and while scientists have come up with theories that allow predictions and work very reliably, they require concepts that you cannot always relate in everyday life. I mean, action at a distance is spooky!</p>
<p>One additional interesting thing about gravity is that its charge, mass, has implications in non-gravity as well, e.g. Newton's second law: F = m * a (the heavier the ball the harder you gotta throw it). That's distinct concept than gravitational mass there is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass#Inertial_vs._gravitational_mass" target="_blank">no experimental difference found</a>.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good question. We don't have an answer. At least, for the moment. Why does electric charge cause attraction/repulsion? Photons? Because it just does? At some point, the answer becomes &quot;because we observe that it does&quot;.</p>
<p>As for how mass effects gravity in a numerical sense, the acceleration that any object feels towards any other object is determined by GM/r^2 where G is the gravitational constant (a very small number) and M is the mass of the object that's doing the attracting, while r is the distance between the centers of the objects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>imagine holding a big tissue paper loosely on all four corners but such that the tissue paper is flat. Then you put a blueberry in the middle. The tissue paper sinks slightly. Now you put a plum, and the tissue sinks more. Now an orange, and the tissue sinks even more.</p>
<p>Leave the orange there and put the blueberry just where the tissue starts to curve in. The blueberry rolls to the orange.</p>
<p>Enjoy your fruit while you read this part.</p>
<p>The tissue paper is called the spacetime fabric. It's in space and it's everywhere. Everytime you put something on that fabric, it distorts the fabric slightly and attracts things towards it, like how the blueberry rolls towards the orange. That is gravity or at least what the best theories explain it to be. Of course on earth the blueberry rolls because of earth's gravity. But you can imagine it in space where there is no gravity. You can substitute the orange and blueberry with the sun and earth, the colors are already there. </p>
<p>The earth is only in orbit because of the sun's gravity. It is slowly pulling earth towards it only being held back by the forward momentum of the earth. <del>However, the sun is not pulling the earth towards itself because the sun is burning trillions of tons of gas every day and is therefore losing alot of mass</del>, which brings me to next part. Things with less mass have less 'gravity' or a lower tendency to pull things towards it. </p>
<p>You can use g=GM/rÂ² to find how strong the gravitational field strength of an object is. G is a gravitational constant which doesn't change, m is mass and r is the radius of said object. So the higher the mass, the stronger the gravity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think Steve Mould has a few videos on visualising gravity. The current theory is that gravity is the distortion of spacetime around an object - the more massive the object, the greater the distortion. For example, if you place a bowling ball on a sheet of fabric, it'll cause the fabric around it to stretch as it pushes downwards. Imagine that, but on three dimensions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mass = the ability to distort spacetime, the more you distort it the more gravitational pull you will have. They are less 'attracted to each other' and more 'falling into each other' like a marble circling a drain. The deeper the drain the faster the marble will fall to the middle, the shallower the slower it will fall. The more mass an object has the deeper that drain will be. That is, incidentally, why they call it a gravity 'well'. Everything has it but when you are talking about something that has the mass of the sun the well is deep and long so planets as far as pluto are caught in it. That is a super-simplified idea but it might get you thinking in a way that makes more sense.</p>
<p>The simplified definition of gravity is the distortion of spacetime and or the result of differing velocities between bodies. GR is hard to teach to a 5 year old but SR isn't, and that is where you get the idea of gravity really being the result of motion. An accelerating train feels on your back exactly how gravity feels on your feet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
