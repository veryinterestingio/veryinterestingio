		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ol>
<li>Tools:  Primitive humans could sharpen a stick to make a throwing spear, and build sharp points from things like flint, wounding or killing an animal from a distance.  Also: Slings, throwing rocks, building traps, and fire.  There is a place in Alberta, Canada called (charmingly) &quot;head smashed in buffalo jump&quot;  which is where ancient native americans would chase herds of buffalo off a cliff, where they would fall to their deaths.  Then the natives could just walk around to the base and collect meat, hides, and all the other resources at their leisure.</li>
<li>Endurance:  No other animal on earth can run as far a human.  World champion race horses have to rest for days to recover from a single race.  Humans can routinely run marathons, 42km, with training.  There are several cultures that still exist that use endurance chases to corral prey animals into traps or kill zones.</li>
<li>Stealth:  It's hard to imagine for a &quot;civilized&quot; person, but humans can be extremely stealthy in the wild with proper training.  Getting close to an animal allows you to kill it before it has a chance to run.</li>
<li>Teamwork:  Just as a pack of wolves or lions can bring down much larger prey, ancient humans could co-ordinate better than almost any other animal using perhaps our best tool: language.  Surrounding an animal, tiring it out, and only when it's weak going for a kill allowed ancient peoples to bring down huge animals, like mammoths.</li>
</ol>
<p>I would like to add that hunting predators like bears and wolves is rare, because often they don't run AWAY but fight back.  Also generally the meat of predators isn't great to eat anyways.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most animals can outrun humans, but only for short distances. Humans run slower, much slower, but we can go forever. There is no marathon running in the animal Kingdom, but if there was humanity would be champ.</p>
<p>Ancient humans would track animals through the bush, the animal would run away, and the primitive humans would just lope after it. The animal would get scared run, and the humans would run after it again. We also had the brains to track it.  Rinse and repeat after 6 hours and that fast gazelle is too tired to continue anymore. It's now dinner.</p>
<p>Basically, it's like zombie movies, but to animals we're the relentless zombies.</p>
<p>Later on, as our brains developed, we did as humans do and use our brains to save on effort. Why chase an animal when you can set a trap?  Later on still, clever humans discovered animal husbandry.  Now we only use our long-distance skills to hunt 26.2 stickers for our Priuses.</p>
<p>Edit: when I say &quot;we&quot;, I refer to humanity. I am not <em>personally</em> optimized for running.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Three main factors.</p>
<p>1) as stated by others, we outlast them.  We're are the terminators of the animal kingdom.  We will keep on coming, sand rubbing after them until they drop from overheating.</p>
<p>2) ambushes.  We sit, and wait by watering holes and trails, and dens until they pop out.  Then when.. Dinner.  Most predators do this.</p>
<p>3). We can throw things.  We can throw very well, and at high speeds.  This is a trait no other animal has, and is very effective even if you're just chucking a pointy stick.  Once we got better with tools (bows, slings, etc) it's game over</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
