		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To some extent, passing water through any absorbent material will reduce the amount of pollutants in it, but the extent depends heavily on how porous the filter substrate is and how finely ground it is.</p>
<p>Charcoal filters work by having incredibly high surface area to volume ratios, and the carbon actively bonding with pollutants, so compared to their ability to capture things coffee's effect is negligible.</p>
<p>It's more likely that the reason you don't taste the chemical taste of treated water in your coffee is that the taste of coffee is so strong it masks it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m not entirely sure about other pollutants, but I can tell you that you need a granulated activated carbon (GAC) filter at the least to get PFAS out. Unfortunately it’s going to be up to your city to treat PFAS if it’s in your water supply and there is little to be done to treat it for your personal supply at home</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My coffeemaker has a Granular Activated Charcoal cartridge that removes a bunch of stuff, including chloramines, from the water before brewing.  However, GAC flow-through filters are not effective at removing short-chain PFAS, and unless you are diligent about changing the filter, effectiveness drops.</p>
<p>The reason short-chain PFAS are not filtered by GAC systems is that there is too much space between the particles.  One method to overcome this is to use powdered activated charcoal, but then you also need to filter that out or clarify by other means.  </p>
<p>The point is that coffee grounds will not absorb PFAS.  I mean, if you were to roast them all the way to charcoal with an activator, then they would -- especially if powdered -- but at that point you just have activated charcoal :</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
