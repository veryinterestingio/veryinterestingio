		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When attempting to retrieve a memory, it can often be helpful to attempt to block other stimuli that may trigger superfluous memories which could interfere with older memory retrieval by looking away.</p>
<p>Short term memories have a tendency to dominate over long term memory in day to day interactions, so looking away and/or closing our eyes can sometimes help us to focus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Scientists have two guesses for why we do this. </p>
<p>The first idea suggests that people move their eyes around because moving eyes to certain areas helps our brain do certain things better. For example, moving our eyes straight to the right matches our brains wiring for constructing memories dealing with sounds and images. While this idea is cool and all, a bunch of experiments have failed to give it any real merit. </p>
<p>The second and more likely idea that answers your question is concentration. Basically, we as humans are really, really bad at doing a multiple things at once. So when we really need to focus on one thing, itâ€™s helpful to divert our attention away from anything that could distract us. Since things that could distract us are generally right in front of us, our brain looks elsewhere (up or to the side) so we can solely focus on remembering.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Reduction of distractions. Humans read the faces of other humans. That takes brain power, and its not something we can really turn off. So by looking away, we can more clearly focus on remembering.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
