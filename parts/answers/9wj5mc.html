<p>Contrast that to most oils, which are <em>not</em> water soluble and will separate into distinct layers based on density.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because alcohol is soluble in water. It would partially separate over a few months if left covered. Take a liquor bottle that’s been in your cupboard for a while and tap the top part that has liquid in it with a coin. Listen to the sound.
Shake the bottle and tap the same spot with a coin, the sound is different</p>
<p>Alcohol will very slowly rise to the surface over time. </p>
<p>It’s why I drink beer quickly</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water and ethanol are miscible, meaning they mix in all proportions. It also means they will not separate or form a distinct layer no matter how long they sit. </p>
<p>Having said that, here’s an article describing a study that showed alcohol and water never completely mix on a microscopic level:</p>
