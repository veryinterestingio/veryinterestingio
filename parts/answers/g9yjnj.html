		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lets say you're stressing about your weight. You spend a good portion of your day thinking about how you should lose weight, how you've been putting it off, how it's going to get worse if you don't do something about it now, etc. This primes your brain on the topic.</p>
<p>You meet up with your friend Phil for lunch. He makes a decadent menu selection and mentions: &quot;I know I should be watching my weight, but I'm going to treat myself this once.&quot; Since your brain was already thinking about all the reasons why you should lose weight, it's rather easy to rattle them all off on Phil. In fact, Phil is a much easier target to vent those frustrations on since telling someone what needs to be done is worlds easier than doing so yourself.</p>
<p>As another example: You're cheating on your spouse. Because of this, you're extra mindful about all the techniques for hiding an affair. Your spouse then announces she's going out with her friends later, and this makes you more suspicious than you would be otherwise because you thought of using that exact excuse to cover up your cheating.</p>
<p>Mental priming is one possible pathway for projection to occur. I understand it would be rather difficult to test if this is in fact the case, but it's what I find most plausible.</p>
<p>I think it's worth noting that the thought &quot;This bad thing I'm doing must actually be pretty common&quot; helps sooth guilt over doing the bad thing and create the perception that the activity is more prevalent than it actually is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&#x200B;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>It's all in HOW you think of the world.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Cheaters tend to think it's easy to cheat and therefore think that everyone else thinks like them. That means that when a non-cheater does anything the cheaters have used before to cheat (even if it's perfectly innocent) that's where their mind is going to go.</p>
<p>People who believe the worst of others or believe that others have bad qualities often HAVE those qualities. Because when we try to think of how others think, we only have ourselves as a reference.</p>
<p>2) <strong>If everyone's a dick and they only think of themselves, then you're only defending yourself in a crapsack world. This feels good and is easy. Realizing you need fixing and doing it is hard.</strong></p>
<p>When you believe everyone is only out for themselves, it gives you permission to be out for yourself, and everyone else who pretends otherwise is doing the same as you--performing goodness so as not to be caught out as selfish.</p>
<p>We all have that friend who says everyone is a bitch or an asshole or all the men/women they have dated are insane, while they don't seem to notice what all those mean people have in common is THEM. Therefore they protect their own ego from the realization that it is them, and not the rest of humanity/all women/all men.</p>
<p>3) <strong>Just because you think everyone is great/nice/really good at heart/in love with you, doesn't mean they are. This too, is a failure at empathy.</strong></p>
<p>There are plenty of people out there who project good qualities or positive feelings on everyone they meet. These are the people who say &quot;All mothers love their children&quot; or &quot;I just know he cares about me because he texted me that one time.&quot; Note that this does not make you a pure and good person. It can make you a stalker...</p>
<p>4) <strong>Everyone projects to some extent. (Though not always in the clinical sense of the word). It would be insane not to.</strong></p>
<p>When humans want something from other humans, they try to gauge what those other humans are feeling. When you put yourself in someone else's shoes, you're still YOU, reacting to what you think their life and situation is. When that attempt at empathy goes wrong, you'll believe that their reaction isn't warranted or you'll think that you have a bead on what they are feeling and how they are thinking when you actually do not.</p>
<p>This is part of survival. Because one of the most dangerous things to humans is...other humans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's only one person on the planet whose head you can look into; yourself. Now, imagine you observe certain internal factors manifesting themselves in certain ways in your behaviour. Now, imagine further you see others display that behaviour. If you don't have any deeper knowledge on all the factors that might be in play when a person displays that specific behaviour or simply don't think about it too hard, naturally, the most obvious assumption would be 'must be for the same reason as with me'.</p>
<p>You only draw conclusions about the world from things you know and, if you're a chronic cheater and your spouse suddenly starts acting all secretive, what do you think what possible explanation would come to your mind most immediately? Probably not that they must be planning a birthday surprise.</p>
<p>I think it's a mistake, however, to assume that all forms of projection must always be direct results of the 'projector', if you will, trying to deny a flaw in themself or to distract from it. It's really just an outgrowth of our constant efforts to understand others by checking against the database of our own experiences.</p>
<p>Projection doesn't even always necessarily involve any negative traits at all.</p>
<p>Say someone tweets about their mother having passed away and receives messages of condolences. But, as it turns out, it was more of a celebration tweet than one done in mourning since the mother in question was an abusive piece of shit. There you have an example of the exact same psychological mechanism. The person going &quot;so sorry about your mother. thoughts and prayers&quot; simply inferred from their own experiences what is most likely. Or, more simply put, they projected their own love for their own mother onto this other person who they had no reason to think doesn't share that particular trait.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simplest way I've ever heard this described is this:</p>
<p>You judge others by their actions, and yourself by your intentions. </p>
<p>It's easy to justify yourself by assuring you had good intentions for what you might have done, but seeing as how we can't read minds, we only see what others do, not their intentions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Im no exp3rt here but what i noticed is that people who do that are usually one of two types. First type belongs to the ones that are not so smart so they cant view it in other persons perspective, naturally falling back on their own vission as a consequence. The other feel like you should buclkle under preassure and accept their point of view so they project in the atempt to convert you. But imo both stem from ego any way since the ego is responcible for their lack of empathy so they treat you like an inferior beign. Every other type of person not covered by my awfull generalisation wants to do this but checks their ego and decides not to do it. All and all i think it is a mechanism that allowed our ancestors to assert dominance in leadership possitions so they passed it down more offten then not. Am i right?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
