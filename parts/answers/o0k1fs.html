		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In general, a liquid can not have a rough surface (at small scale, not counting wind, etc.), as the surface tension in the liquid smooths out any irregularities, leaving a locally flat surface.  And this &quot;flat&quot; surface gives you the shiny (specular) reflection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Liquids tend to have comparatively smooth surfaces when compared to solid surfaces. So you're likely to get specular and not diffuse reflection off of a liquid interface: liquids look shiny.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not for being liquids, but <strong>smooth surfaces</strong> (like metals, ceramics, varnishes, ...). Non-smooth surfaces trap light or reflected it at odd angles (wood, fabrics, dirt,...) due to its irregularity at both the macro or molecular level. Smooth surfaces will reflected homogeneously, which will overexcite the receptors in your eyes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The order in which light reflects off a surface matter. When the light reflects in the same order it hit the surface it shines and creates a mirror effect. When light hits a surface and reflects in all different directions it diffuses and you lose the shine. How orderly light can reflect depends on how smooth and uniform the reflection layer is hence metal and liquids can reflect an image because it tends to be smooth and reflect uniformly.</p>
<p>So you are semi correct in that it has to do with motion or arrangement of the particles. It actually has to do with the motion and arrangement of the photons. As long as the photons can maintain the order/arrangement that they hit the surface with they can shine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
