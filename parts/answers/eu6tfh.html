		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Populations with low infant mortality, women's education, and birth control drop to replacement levels across all cultures -- we are now below 2.5 children per couple worldwide and the population will stop growing at 10-11ish billion around 2100 (when all the current people have replaced themselves).  That means some couples still have lots of children, some couples have none.  The stability across all demographics is impressive.</p>

(22 minutes in is where we see why we have 11 billion from zero population growth today)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Edit Disclaimer: I am not an expert on fertility, I am only citing how I understand my readings. :)  </p>
<p>Hey, coincidentally I am studying populations at the moment in my masters program.Yes, women around the world, and especially in western countries, are opting to have kids later and later in life.</p>
<p>If you want to do research on this look up: Age of First Birth.</p>
<p>This can usually be attributed to; better family planning, longer life expectancy, education and better career opportunities for women</p>
<p>Really, the attitude on kids hasn't shifted so much, or at least none of the readings I have done would suggest that. More so the opportunities to have kids has become more difficult. 20-30 are prime years for furthering your education and career. Having a child, while possible during this time, can really hamper and slow most people down. Not to mention some companies would rather fire you than wait for you to deal with your pregnancy.</p>
