		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I hope I got your question right. </p>
<p>There is no agreed upon definition of how people fall asleep exactly. However researchers know this for sure:</p>
<p>When we are awake we get lots of different inputs (visuals, sound, taste, smell and touch) and our brains are processing these all the time. When we turn off the sound (or hear a monotonous/relaxing sound which doesn't give a lot of stimuli) and close our eyes the brain slowly starts shutting down. </p>
<p>Imagine you are constanty stomping in a water puddle and by that you constantly produce lots of waves. Then you start stomping less hard and less frequent. Now we're in stage 1 of falling asleep. The brain produces so called &quot;alpha waves&quot; which means we are yet in a wake state but in deep relaxation. </p>
<p>If you gradually stomp less hard and less frequent you enter stage 2: The brain mainly produces so called &quot;theta waves&quot; which means it already shut off all surroundings, but is interrupted by short bursts of activity (the alpha waves) which quickly cool down again. There's only little waves produced by wind and you frequently stomp a little again from time to time. </p>
<p>Think of a time you dozed off while watching a movie: You remember bits and pieces of scenes before you finally fall asleep completely . These activity &quot;beats&quot; beat further and further apart until they completely stop. This is the moment we drift into Stages 3 and 4 (which is when we start Dreaming) - the deep wave phase. The surroundings are completely shut off. </p>
<p>Now you've completely stopped giving it input and the only little waves produced are by the wind. The rest of the night we cycle between stages 2, 3 and 4.</p>
<p>I hope this is not too confusing.
Cheers!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In English, &quot;unconscious&quot; means two different things.</p>
<p>It can either mean &quot;lacking conscious thought&quot; or &quot;lacking conscious thought and unable to be returned to conscious thought through stimulus.&quot;</p>
<p>When we sleep not in REM sleep we lack conscious thought, but we can be returned to consciousness through stimulus.</p>
<p>When we are unconscious due to drugs or trauma we cannot be returned to consciousness via stimulus.</p>
<p>To put it simply, unconsciousness through trauma or drugs, the brain is &quot;off&quot; disconnected from stimulus and inactive. Unconsciousness through sleeping is more about the muscles being off and the brain in low power mode, with stimulus being able to switch it on. And the brain doesn't remain in unconscious mode while sleeping, as dreams (almost a fake consciousness) fill the mind periodically while we sleep.</p>
<p>The neocortex, which controls high brain function, is quiet during non-rem sleep, called deep sleep or slow wave sleep with relatively low conscious brain activity. Studies have shown that interrupting this phase of sleep harms memory and learning consolidation.</p>
<p>What quiets the neocortex to enter low conscious sleep mode? (Well the neocortex doesn't go completely quiet... It's patterns just change to be rhythmic while in deep sleep, while it is less rhythmic and more active during conscious wakefulness or &quot;conscious&quot; REM sleep.) Other neurons and chemical release, seem to put the neocortex into the rhythmic unconscious state.</p>
<p>It should be noted that neurons and chemical release control almost all bodily functions so what matters are which neurons and which chemicals are released that put the mind to sleep. To understand that is to leave the ELI5 world and enter neural biology and chemistry: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3103062/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3103062/</a> But it's a specific combination.</p>
<p>TLDR: Other parts of your brain signal the parts the brain that do conscious thought, via nerve signals and chemicals, to fire rhythmically in an &quot;unconscious&quot; pattern while you are in deep wave sleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body releases a chemical called melatonin to help you fall asleep. The chemical is produced in the brain(I think) and goes into the bloodstream. Not sure if it causes you to sleep, or helps to get to that point. Someone else can add to this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1 key aspect for the body to initiate sleep is to drop the body's core temperature, by 1 degree (I think?). I believe this works alongside the body's release of melatonin to help transition the body into a sleep state. </p>
<p>The drop in temperature explains why it's harder to go sleep in a hot environment (Summer), than a cold one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
