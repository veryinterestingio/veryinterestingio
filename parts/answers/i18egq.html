		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sure and we have (though they are not all technically hydraulic presses, some use other mechanisms of generating force besides hydraulics). There is an entire branch of geology, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_petrology" target="_blank">experimental petrology</a>, which uses devices like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_anvil_cell" target="_blank">diamond anvil cells</a> to generate temperatures and pressures sufficient for metamorphic reactions to occur, and in fact, well above that, as depending on the rig, these can get to pressures of up to ~700 gigapascals (or 2x the pressure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_inner_core#Pressure_and_gravity" target="_blank">of the inner core of the Earth</a>). Experiments done in these devices are the primary means by which we can understand how different materials behave at extremely high temperature and pressures and are critically important for all of our numerical simulations of large scale geologic processes (e.g. mantle convection, subduction, etc).</p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks to /u/darthjab for highlighting that newer diamond anvil cells have pushed into &gt;1 terapascal of possible pressure.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: The &gt; 1 terapascal examples is not a sustained pressure in a diamond anvil cell per /u/mfb-, but these are still able to sustain pressures of 10s to 100s of GPa (which are sufficient to simulate conditions throughout most of the Earth).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We have been making synthetic diamonds  from carbon with a HPHT process (high pressure high temp) for decades.  These are 5 GPa at 1500Â°C.  It is not the only process for making diamonds though, CVD is another.</p>

<p>It's crazy, it's a cubic press that compresses a cube, which only shrinks a little bit- you can see the seams where the jaws went past  the sides.  It goes much faster than geologic processes, of course.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I worked on one of these rigs and designed the control system and data display for it. </p>
<p>It was a Griggs hydraulic press which pressurized the sample and then used a highly geared electronic ram to displace the sample while simultaneously heating it with about 400amps of current using a toroidal transformer.</p>
<p>Not sure of the exact specs off the top of my head anymore but it was awesome. The scientists using it were basically generating stress v strain curves for various materials and rock samples to determine how they acted in the earth's mantle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This has been done since the 1950's and has led to increasingly higher pressures and temperatures typical for the Earth's crust and upper mantle.  Major steps to achieve even higher pressures and temperatures came with the development of the diamond anvil press, in which small samples are compressed between two large diamond single crystals and high temperatures are achieved by laser heating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
