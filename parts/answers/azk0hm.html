		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s estimated 7 billion rats, 200 million alone in Britain, who knows how many mice.</p>
<p>Two rabbits can have 184 billion rabbits in 7 years accounting for no death.

<p>I don’t know the total number of rabbits in the world but I wouldn’t be surprised to see it in the billions.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rats (specifically brown rats) would be the most common and outnumber people, but there's no accurate count for most rodents.</p>
<p>Something like Mexican free tail bat has large range and there are caves with millions of them, but total number is unclear (like many species with large population). e.g. <a href="http://www.batcon.org/our-work/regions/usa-canada/protect-mega-populations/bracken-cave" target="_blank">Bracken cave</a></p>
<p>For what is well understood it's only domesticated animals that are over (or around) a billion - cattle, sheep, pigs, goats, dogs (although estimates here too vary). <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_mammals_by_population" target="_blank">Wikipedia lists</a></p>
<p>For non-fish vertebrae, it's birds that are the most numerous. Chickens outnumber people 2 to 1. For wild animals, estimates of passenger pigeons were 3 to 5 billion.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the replies have focused on number of individuals, where humans are easily rivaled by small rodents. However by biomass humans are a candidate for the greatest mammal population ever. Currently 36% of mammal biomass is human, a remaining 60% is livestock, and only 4% is wild mammals. However, cattle probably have humans beat by a nose: they embody 0.61 Gt C compared to 0.6 Gt C embodied in humans, though the calculations are rough. It's unlikely there's ever been a time when only a couple mammal species so dominated the biosphere, so it's hardly out of the question that the situation is unprecedented.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
