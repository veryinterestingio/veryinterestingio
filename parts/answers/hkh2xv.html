		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I always thought that some of the backlash towards vaccines came from the fact that the people having children had never experienced any of these vaccine-able diseases at their height.  Do you think that a vaccine for COVID-19, when it becomes available (hopefully), will be different?  Or do you think only a certain portion of people will bother with it?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am researching and writing about the COVID-19 clinical trials. Part of that has been proposing we standardize how we run antiviral clinical trials so we can easily compare their results and fill in report cards that cover all of the key outcomes. From a toxicology standpoint I am used to seeing set times for animal studies (e.g., 28 days) and set outcomes (e.g., viability).</p>
<p>But I just see a much messier situation with human trials where the follow-up times are relatively random and key outcomes often get completely ignored. </p>
<p>Since most vaccine trial results do not get posted on www.clinicaltrials.gov I expect many of the current COVID-19 trial results will similarly go unposted.</p>
<p>Do you think it is realistic to expect to get people to believe more in vaccines and their safety and efficacy when www.clinicaltrials.gov makes it so easy to see just how many vaccine trials have completed without results being posted? </p>
<p>How do you argue against misinformation effectively when there is so much missing information and what is available is so messy? </p>
<p>Do you think those of us who support the use of vaccines should do more to force sponsors to post their results and to make those results easy to compare?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Do you believe that we will develop a effective vaccine to COVID19 in light of the new studies showing that antibodies drop off after a few months?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
