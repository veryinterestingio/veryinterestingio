		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're built a little more sturdy, with reinforced airways and such. Additionally, they don't simply hold their breath the way humans do (with full lungs and all).  </p>
<p>As they dive, their lungs collapse which forces air away from the gas exchange (between blood and lungs) organs.  </p>
<p>So how can they stay underwater for so long if they don't store oxygen in their lungs during a dive?  </p>
<p>They have massive specific blood volumes....about 3-4 times what terrestrial mammals do (so per kilogram of weight, they have 3-4 times as much blood as humans). In addition, they have about twice the concentration of hemoglobin (the oxygen-transport protein in blood) as humans do. Lastly, they have an absurd concentration of myoglobin (oxygen storage protein in muscle), about 10 times more than humans.  </p>
<p>Add that all together and you have a creature whose body has a significantly higher ability to store oxygen per pound of mass <em>even if not stored in the lungs</em>, than terrestrial mammals are capable of.  </p>
<p>They can effectively push all the oxygen out of their lungs, but still have a much higher capacity for holding their breath than humans attempting to do the same thing.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Air compresses with depth. At 33 feet below sea level, the air in their lungs is like half the volume of sea level. So buoyancy goes down a lot with changes in depth. Once they’ve gone down a short amount, the buoyancy of the air in their lungs becomes negligible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
