		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Spiders eat their own webs, digest them and re-spin them later.<br />
They do this because their webs become less sticky over time.<br />
They contain/take a lot of protein, so just leaving them would likely result in the spider starving to death.<br />
So they eat it, and squirt it out all sticky again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have two Orb Weavers that live in my front yard. Both make huge webs that go from the ground to the branches of my trees. Then they sit in the middle and wait for insects. Every morning they will take their webs down and go fuck off for the day. Then come night they remake the web. I have a timelapse i made of one. Shows him creating the web and then taking it down. I will post link in a while.</p>
<p>EDIT: I have to get my old laptop guys! I will try my best to get it done today. I just woke up to a full inbox, and a message from reddit saying they noticed suspicious activity on my account. I will probably just post it on a subreddit instead of linking it here.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Spiders are true master builders. They are little engineering geniuses with the webs they build. This is hard to explain but I once lived at a house with one of those tall lamp posts on the lawn next to my drive way. A spider had constructed a web below the lamp. It was a brilliant place to put it because the light would attract god only knows how many insects to it. The fact that the spider had somehow figured this out was the first brilliant thing it did. The second was how this web was constructed. The lamp was at the edge of the lawn so there was nothing near it. There was a hedge of arborvitaes across on the other side of the driveway. This spider knew that he had to find something to attach one side of the web to otherwise it would not work. The web would have been really small and effectively useless. What this spider did truly astonished me. It somehow spun a single spool of web from the lamp clear across the driveway to the other side where it was attached to a branch of one of the arborvitaes. It was a distance of about 10 feet. This created a kind of “top beam” from which he was able to construct a triangle shaped web. One side was mounted against the lamp while the other was strewn across this “top beam” created from stringing it to the arborvitae. Unbelievable. I really hope I’m explaining this right and that someone can appreciate the skill this spider showed. I know they’re creepy and all but you have to admire their skills. I know I do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
