		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Obligatory &quot;I'm on mobile&quot; warning. Advanced formatting apologies.</p>
<p>Growing up, I wanted nothing more than to be a scientist. Specifically, I desired to work in research and development in biology. What you're all doing is what I imagined game-changing science to be. True sci-fi, manifest. I cannot begin to put into words how dangerous and beautiful and terrifying and hopeful I find this new field of study to be...</p>
<p>Two questions, if you'll indulge me:</p>
<p>Do any of you have any advice for a 30-something who always dreamed of being a scientist, but was derailed from their life plan by circumstances beyond their control?</p>
<p>What, if any work is being done within this field involving telomeres or telomerase?</p>
<p>Thank you all for forging the future. In a time where I feel like science itself is being attacked by large swaths of society, it brings me great comfort knowing the strides that are being made.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In what aspects do you think 3d printing a scaffolding to be repopulated by cells is more effective than using a decelularized organ human, animal or vegetal?
Seems like animal or vegetal have a strong availability of resources and that using vegetal tissue as scaffolding can allow to produce most shapes through sculpting like some researchers have done using apple to produce cartilage with the shape of an ear for example, in what aspects of the process is 3d printing an advantage?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
