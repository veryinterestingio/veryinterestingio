		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A wave is a transfer of energy, the energy is coming from the movement of water from the main body of the sea. There's no force coming FROM the land, so there's no real waves coming from there.</p>
<p>The exception is when you see a wave hit a wall and then you see the wave going out, as the force goes out, usually crashing into the next wave. This doesn't happen on a beach because the force is exhausted pushing water up an incline rather than redirected with the equal and opposite reaction from the wall.</p>
<p>Edit: I'd you dropped a giant boulder into the middle of the Pacific the waves would just travel away from the impact, it wouldn't matter which way shore was. </p>
<p>But say you drop it a mile west of the coast. There's no real waves coming from the east, because land is there  so there isn't much force from wind or tides etc bringing waves from that distance. So your boulder produced waves headed east can continue and hit the shore. But going west from your impact, your wave will eventually come into contact with waves and forces from the sea, since there's all sorts of forces with a lot of distance to build up, again, not being interrupted by waves coming the other way. So your wave heading west will likely disrupt a wave coming eastwards and then dissipate, followed by thousands more waves coming eastwards, because they're not interrupted by anything coming the other way.</p>
<p>Edit 2: and this answer from someone else here explains why they tend to hit dead on and not at an angle etc <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/o7mqdl/why_do_waves_always_move_towards_the_shore/h2zq5jy" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/o7mqdl/why_do_waves_always_move_towards_the_shore/h2zq5jy</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a wave travels, the part of it closest to land begins to slow down in shallower water. This essentially &quot;bends&quot; the wave toward the shore. It is difficult to picture without a visual, but as each part of the wave slows down, it changes the direction of the entire wave. It is the same reason that light changes direction (the technical term is refract) in a prism.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Summary of theories weâ€™ve got so far:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Waves are caused by wind which blows toward land due to pressure effects. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_breeze" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_breeze</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Waves travel in one direction until they hit shore. So at the shore you can only observe those travelling towards you. Those travelling in other directions will move towards different edges. </p>
</li>
<li>Some kind of refraction. As waves encounter shallower sea floor they are bent towards shore.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a body of water completely surrounded by store line, yes.  In the open ocean the waves typically move in the direction of the wind.  Where the sea floor approaches the surface, and doesn't go above it, then it may seem as if there are large waves in the ocean for no reason, because the shape and severity of waves is really caused by the sea floor.  If you look up &quot;big waves&quot; on YouTube you will be digitally transported to parts of the world where the waves are quite large.  Where I live on Florida gulf coast the waves are really small.  This is all a factor of body of water size, under water typography and depth, wind, and currents.  Because the shore is the edge of a body of water there will always be at least small waves lapping the shore, but if the physics of the situation changes many variables, then waves will go any direction.</p>
<p>Another effect I have seen is wave reflection.  Near my house there is a sea wall.  It is very hard to boat near it, because incoming waves are reflected back out.  If you study waves dynamics, then you will see that waves can amplify each other, and cancel each other out.  Because the waves don't stop coming in, and they are all being reflected off the sea wall, then this creates huge bumps where they amplify each other (stacked on top), and it also creates weird lulls where they cancel each other out.  This means for a boat there are stacked waves, and sudden holes where they cancel.  It's impossible to predict and move the boat into different positions fast enough, so avoid being close to reflective sea walls!</p>
