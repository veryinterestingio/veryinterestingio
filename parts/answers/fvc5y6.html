A crushing will close off most major vessels initially for example. Also, shock, it can be quite surprising the lack of arterial spurt due to shock.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, this depends on the vessel size and where it is. If a large blood vessel in your chest, like your aorta, were to rupture it can leak a lot more blood in less time than a number of smaller vessels in your limbs put together. Second, your body has the ability to “shunt” blood from the outer parts of your body to your core to save the most vital parts of you. When you cut off a limb, if it is relatively clean, the vessels themselves will constrict to help slow down blood loss and the body will use that “shunting” ability to slow down blood movement to your extremities, keeping blood for your heart and brain. This shunting ability is also the reason why most bicyclist and motorcyclists quickly come to know that the warmest gloves in the world will not keep your hands warm and nimble, unless your core is also warm.  The body will always redirect blood flow from your hands to keep your core warm, unless those body parts are addressed first. Lastly blood loss from your extremites is more likely to be quickly detected and controlled. Internal blood loss from a vessel can go on for awhile before producing shock and any physical signs. In fact, most of the signs will be fairly general. When my wife’s appendix burst, she initially reported general abdominal pain and a feeling of uneasiness. Obviously, if her arm had been missing she would have called for an ambulance a lot sooner. Most of the bruising that appears from an internal rupture is considered a late sign of internal bleeding.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Having a limb severed causes the arteries and veins to retract into the body, allowing the compression of whatever body part they retract into to slow the bleeding down. Having a sliced artery in place allows free flow of large amounts of blood.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's still incredibly serious if you lose a limb, not really as black and white as you make out.</p>
<p>Don't read on if you don't like gory detail, and <em>definitely</em> don't Google photos, some of which are very graphic - </p>
<p>Alex Zanardi is a racing driver who previously competed in F1, but in 2001 was driving in the CART series. On Sept 15 2001, there was a race at the EuroSpeedway Lausitz (incidentally, the first major sporting event worldwide after 9/11) and as he came out of the pits, lost control, and was t-boned by a car doing 200mph. The main impact was the front of the cockpit. Any higher up the cockpit, and he'd have been instantly killed. Photos of the accident show chunks of his legs flying through the air in the debris. When the medics arrived they kept slipping over as the climbed the banked circuit to get to the wreckage of his car. They assumed it was oil - it was actually blood. The chief doctor on the scene described it as like &quot;punching two holes the size of a quarter in a bucket holding all your blood&quot;. He lost 3/4s of his blood volume, and not surprisingly, nearly died right there at the track. Amazingly, he recovered after much medical intervention and surgery, and despite losing his legs, still races today in sports cars, using specially modified hand-controls.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is kind of true - You can die from losing a limb - it's all related to blood loss vs time. The same reason it's &quot;more effective&quot; when you cut your wrists - cutting straight across allows the vasculature to temporarily constrict, so if the vessel is cut open like a canoe it's unable to constrict effectively. Once your blood pressure drops low enough you won't be able to get enough blood to your brain or your heart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
