What do you think is the timeline for reaching people like me for vaccination? </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a computer programmer, when I hear about people having a hard time signing up for vaccines (and hear about vaccines going to waste because people sign up then no-show) my mind immediately says, &quot;a centralized, online sign-up database could solve this!&quot;</p>
<p>However, the answer never seems to be a Federal, centralized online database. Do you have any insight as to why technology seems to always be an afterthought for Federal programs and it is so often left up to the states?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in supply chains for batteries and we have to pay attention to all stages, from raw material acquisition, to manufacturing of each component, to assembly, transport, and distribution. If one step is broken, the whole process is delayed. What are the steps for vaccines (e.g., raw materials, glass vial and needle mfg, vaccine production, safe storage, giving the shots....)? Which parts are set up well and which ones are creating delays? And are you finding that industry is being helpful or wanting to talk control?</p>
<p>Thanks from a fellow systems person for all youâ€™re doing!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm CEO of an independent pharmacy in a major metropolitan area in the State of Florida.  We serve primarily minority HIV/AIDS patients (Many over the age of 65).  While we have been prepared to vaccinate over 1,000 of these patients for many months, we have been unable to procure ANY doses of vaccine for our patients.  Due to our high level of specialization (dealing with HIV/AIDS patients) we are not part of any of the &quot;Retail&quot; pharmacy groups the White House announced will be getting vaccine on the 11th.  How/When do we get vaccine for these patients??</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
