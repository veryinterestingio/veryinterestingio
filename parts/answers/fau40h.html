		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pneumonia isn't a single illness, it's an umbrella term for an infection of the lungs. Pneumonia can be caused by a wide variety of infectious agents: bacteria, viruses, fungi.</p>
<p>Consequently, there is no single &quot;pneumonia vaccine&quot;. Vaccines exist that help against some of the causes of pneumonia (for example the flu vaccine), but not all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pneumonia is a general term for consolidation (essentially liquid) forming in the lungs due to infection or insult (like aspirating vomit).  This is an inflammatory response. It prevents oxygen from diffusing into the blood stream.</p>
<p>The vaccination against a specific bacteria, streptococcus pneumoniae. It can prevent some cases of pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis.  </p>
<p>COVID19 is a virus and has nothing to do with streptococcus pneumoniae.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If anyone has a compromised or weakened immune system due to diabetes, heart disease, COPD, etc. or are over 65, they should get the pneumonia vaccine. While it won't protect from the flu or other viral respiratory infections, it will help prevent secondary bacterial infections in the lungs or reduce the severity of the infection from most types of pneumococcal bacteria. For even generally healthy adults there are no downsides to the vaccine and it may be beneficial in the long run since it's a lifetime vaccine (with booster shots).</p>
<p>This has been a standard recommended practice for years but like most adult vaccines it's voluntary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can have viral, bacterial, chemical, metallic and at least a couple other types of pneumonia, one of which you only get from whale tusks if you're a scrimshaw artist.  The vaccine only protects against one specific type of virus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most older people in the US get the pneumonia vaccine at age 65. In conjunction with the yearly flu vaccine, it provides pretty good coverage. The real danger of Covid 19 is that it appears in the CT scans, both lungs and all chambers are affected. Most of your typical flu viruses normally attack 1 to 2 lobes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
