		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When we (geologists) talk about the geologic history of a place, England for example, we are talking about the history recorded in the rocks that currently lie in England. This means that different parts of this record reflect when the rocks were formed in very different paleoenviroments and paleogeographic locations. For example, if we are discussing rocks in England that are <a href="http://scotese.com/cretaceo.htm" target="_blank">Late Cretaceous</a> (so ~94 million years ago), these would reflect rocks formed in England's paleogeographic position at this time, so in this case at the eastern edge of a much smaller Atlantic ocean and a bit further south than modern day in terms of its paleolatitude. Moving further back, <a href="http://scotese.com/newpage8.htm" target="_blank">Triassic</a> (~235 million years ago) rocks in modern day England would record the presence of a large mountain range and record a portion of that range further south still. Go back another 160 million years to the <a href="http://scotese.com/newpage3.htm" target="_blank">Devonian</a> and rocks in modern day England would reflect rocks formed in the vicinity of a subduction zone in the Southern Hemisphere. And so on. </p>
<p>Outside of specific contexts, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotspot_%28geology%29" target="_blank">hotspots</a> that are semi-fixed with respect to an outside observer, we are pretty much always referring to the paleogeographic position of a location which move through time as a result of plate motion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The only thing I would add is that when people speak about &quot;England&quot; 100mln years ago, they speak not about geographical position of England. They always mean physical rock which is British island, which is indeed drifting with Time. The British islands are geologicallly (temporally) dead and move together with Europe around 2.5cm/year.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
