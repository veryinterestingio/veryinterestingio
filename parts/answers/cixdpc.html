		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is basically part of my area of research so I will try and begin to scratch the surface of this problem!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The exoplanet community would also like to know! First I will say these gaps are absolutely NOT due to observational problems. Our observational issues are mostly towards the bottom right of the plot. Gaps such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Neptune" target="_blank">hot neptune</a> desert are well within our region of observations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The gap at sub 10 day orbit of Jupiter mass planets (on your plot that is &lt;0.05AU and 10-100 Mearth) is known as the Hot Neptune desert (actually most gaps in populations of astrophysical bodies get called deserts). We have no idea why this exists. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/282329-scientists-detect-hot-neptune-losing-atmosphere-at-an-extraordinary-rate" target="_blank">One theory</a> is that unlike their Jupiter mass counterparts, the hot Jupiters, they lack the mass to keep hold of their atmosphere from being stripped by stellar activity. This means they would travel down your plot to become hot super Earths. There are problems with this idea in that this process should take hundreds of millions to billions of years so we should actually observe a lot more of these than we do. Further the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.07843.pdf" target="_blank">desert transition is quite sharp</a>. I do not think this is likely to be the primary cause. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A second theory is that this highlights a difference in formation mechanism between hot super earths (mentioned in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.07843.pdf" target="_blank">this</a> paper linked before) and hot jupiters. This also has a problem that it assumes there is a single formation mechanism for HJ planets. People are finally starting to believe there may actually be more than one formation mechanism for HJs. So this gap would need to be explained by all valid formation mechanism (the various mechanisms are reviewed <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06117" target="_blank">here</a> but its a long read!). In particular in situ formation and disc migration mechanisms have a hard time explaining this gap (as well as the gap between hot and cold jovian planets at the top of your plot).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If (and I think this is unlikely due to observations of very young HJs, <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/nature18305" target="_blank">1</a> and <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01512" target="_blank">2</a>) the formation mechanism for HJs is high eccentricity migration then this gap is obtained for free as it could be explained by roche lobe overflow. This is that when a giant planet is in a highly eccentric orbit and passes its pericenter (closest to the star) the atmosphere breaches the roche limit of the star and experiences atmospheric stripping. As the planet continues to circularise it would rapidly lose atmosphere and become a hot super earth. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the bottom line here is that this one gap (which I believe is the most well studied) is not fully understood. A proper explanation (of all gaps?) will come once we have reevaluated planetary formation and migration mechanisms. We kind of had to throw the book of what we knew on this out the window once we started getting exoplanet observations! If I was to make an educated guess (I sure as hell wouldnt put money on this guess though as our understanding of formation and migration still has a lot of work) I would say it may actually be a combination of ideas 2 and 3 as they both can end up doing similar things (or be responsible for the upper and lower boundaries of the desert).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There have been a number of lengthy answers on this thread by people that, while they know what they are talking about, are still making some poor assumptions that are leading them to incorrect conclusions. In particular, I'm going to focus on the two groups of giant planets. The gap is due largely to the different surveys that were used to find the planets. Your plot include planets found mostly by 3 kinds of survey:
1) ground-based radial velocity surveys (RV)
2) ground-based transit surveys
3) space-based transit surveys (mostly Kepler, but also K2 and CoRoT)</p>
<p>RV surveys generally have a sensitivity that only weakly depends on the inclination of the orbit, and for the most part smoothly declines as the orbital period increases. These surveys generally are quite complete, and that completeness is a reasonably smooth function in the mass-period diagram. They only survey a relatively small number of the brightest stars, so only common types of planets will show up often.
Kepler is sensitive only to planets that have a small range of inclinations that cause the planet to transit, and the range of inclinations falls off as the period increases. But, Kepler continuously observed, so its sensitivity drops of quite smoothly with orbital period. Kepler monitored a modest number of stars, and the transit probability (due to random inclinations) is quite small, so it doesn't have that many rare types of planet, but does have lots of common planets.
Ground-based transit surveys have all of the problems that Kepler has (inclination etc.) and then some. They can only observe for ~8 out of 24 hours, have interruptions for weather, and also have long seasonal gaps in observations. This means that they only really have sensitivity to Jupiter-sized planets with orbital periods less than 10 days. Their major advantage is that they have surveyed millions of stars, so they can find large numbers of even rare types of planets in their sensitivity range will be seen.</p>
<p>The dense clump of Jupiters in short orbits can now be seen to probably a selection effect, because it is adding large numbers of planets from ground-based surveys that the other surveys wouldn't find.</p>
<p>I'd encourage you to remove the planets from ground-based surveys from your plot, and instead just plot planets from
a) the main Kepler survey alone
b) RV surveys alone
each of these plots will still be subject to selection biases, but much less so. I went ahead and made a version of your plot with radius vs period for Kepler only: <a href="https://imgur.com/1419bMq" target="_blank">https://imgur.com/1419bMq</a> (this is from the NASA exoplanet archive, which is a bit better than exoplanets.org in terms of completeness and data filtering options in my opinion)
You can see that there might be a hint of two groups of Jupiter radius objects, but its much less pronounced than in your plot. This plot is still massively mis-reprentative though because you should really account for the detection probability of each planet. This is roughly 0.3%/distance in AU just due to inclination (I'm assuming that for Jupiter sized planets, Kepler would have no other detection innefficiency). From Kepler's laws, period is proportional to semimajor axis to the 1.5 power, so the probability of a planet actually transiting its star is about 20 times less for a planet in a 100 day long orbit than a planet in a 1 day orbit. If you correct for this (by e.g., plotting extra fake planets to make up for the ones that are too inclined to be seen transiting), then you will probably conclude that there might not be two distinct groupings, but a more continuous distribution. Figure 4 of this paper doing an early analysis of a subset of the Kepler mission shows the kind of thing I'm talking about - there are more up to date versions of this, but I can't remember the reference:
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1103.2541.pdf" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1103.2541.pdf</a></p>
<p>Now, there absolutely are some gaps in the distribution, especially in the radius distribution at short periods - this was revealed by carefully accounting for how detectable the planets of each radius and period were:
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10375.pdf" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10375.pdf</a></p>
<p>But, the key point that you should take away is that you should be very careful about drawing conclusions from just plotting up every known example of things that are hard to find. The groupings may be due to some real physical effects, and its important to ask the questions that you are, but as you can see from other comments, even experts can make the mistake of not carefully accounting for varying detection efficiencies of different methods.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi! There are primarily two methods that people use to detect exoplanets: radial velocity (watching the stellar Spectra get redshifted and blueshifted due to the gravitational influence of the planet) and transit (watching the stellar brightness dip due to the planet passing in front of the star). </p>
<p>Both methods are biased (more easily discover) planets with lower semi major axes. The transit method is biased towards planets with larger radii (which is correlated with mass due to density) and the radial velocity method is biased towards planets with larger masses. </p>
<p>With that knowledge we can sort of identify the three groups you can see. The low mass, low semi major axis planets are probably at the edge of our detection methods (hence they're the most recently discovered). </p>
<p>The high mass, low semi major axis planets are pretty easily discovered so we see a bunch of those.</p>
<p>The high mass, high semi major axis planets are hard to be discovered, partially due to the weakness of the signal, and partially because once you get out far, you have to observe the planet for a long time to see multiple orbits (even Earth only orbits once a year, which would take a while to absorb). It's more common to observe these with radial velocity, which is why they were discovered early, since before the Kepler mission radial velocity was sort of the most-used method.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
