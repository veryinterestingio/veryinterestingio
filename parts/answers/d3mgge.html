<p>Bisacodyl is only slow acting if you take it orally. It is also a stimulant laxatives, but when taken orally it must be digested before the drug takes effect. If taken as a rectal suppository or enema, the drug acts much faster usually within an hour. Often as fast as 15 minutes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Caffeine and nicotine exert their effects after being absorbed from mucosal surfaces (stomach, lungs) right into the bloodstream. Which then reaches your gut within a few heart beats after absorption. </p>
<p>Most laxatives either bulk forming (fiber), osmotic (miralax), or even stimulant (senna) act locally from inside the gut. They need to reach your colon through normal slow peristalsis for the effects to be appreciated. </p>
