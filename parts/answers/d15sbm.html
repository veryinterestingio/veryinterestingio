		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This question was addressed in research of same-sex sexual behavior of 3,826 Swedish twins and found greater concordance between identical (monozygotic) twins than non-identical (dizygotic) same-sex twins.</p>
<p><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10508-008-9386-1" target="_blank">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10508-008-9386-1</a></p>
<p>In another article published recently in the journal Science attempts to further address this question. </p>
<p><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6456/eaat7693" target="_blank">https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6456/eaat7693</a></p>
<p>The research presented in this article identified several genetic variants that are associated with same-sex sexual behavior across 491,001 individuals. Therefore based on the conclusions presented in this paper it may suggest that identical twins have a shared genetic predisposed to same-sex sexual behavior, although this is not the whole picture due to environmental variables. The authors include in their discussion that interaction between genes and environment requires further study to explain this behavior.</p>
<p>Edit: It was brought to my attention that there was not clear distinction between the conclusions of the second article and my suggested implications of this research on identical twins. I have revised for clarity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If I'm reading this question right, I think a lot of the answers are misunderstanding the question.  OP you can confirm, but I think you intend to ask something like,</p>
<p>&quot;If sexual orientation is primarily or exclusively determined by genetics, then we would expect identical twins to have the same sexual orientation (NOT same sex sexual orientation, just the same one, i.e. both gay or both straight etc...) at a much higher rate than 2 other random people.  Are there any studies indicating that this is the case?&quot;</p>
<p>I don't know the answer, but it seems like a lot of people are reading your question to ask if there is a higher likelihood of same sex sexual orientation among twins than the general population.  I don't think that's what you intended to ask.</p>
<p>edit: Maybe random people isn't a good group to target as a comparison, but how about fraternal twins? or other non identical siblings raised in a similar environment?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
