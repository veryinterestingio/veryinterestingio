		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Moderna vaccine contains 100 Âµg of mRNA, with a length of about 4000 bases. This is equivalent to 4.7*10^13 copies (based on <a href="https://nebiocalculator.neb.com/#!/ssrnaamt" target="_blank">this calculator</a>).</p>
<p>Let's assume that 1% of that makes it into your cells and starts being translated. (If anyone has better information about this, please let me know.) That would be 4.7*10^11 copies. </p>
<p>The spike protein is 1273 amino acids long and mammalian ribosomes translate at about <a href="http://book.bionumbers.org/what-is-faster-transcription-or-translation/" target="_blank">6 amino acids per second</a> so it would take a little over 3.5 minutes for a ribosome to completely translate it. But another ribosome can start translating before the first one is finished. The number we really want is the translation initiation rate. This depends on the mRNA in question but a reasonable value is <a href="https://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu/bionumber.aspx?s=n&amp;v=1&amp;id=112745" target="_blank">1 to 3 times per minute</a>. The mRNA vaccine was engineered to be easily translated so I'll assume it's at the high end of this range (3 proteins per mRNA per minute).</p>
<p>Also, the Moderna mRNAs are stabilized so I'll assume they don't degrade over 6 hours. This would mean that each mRNA produces 1080 spike proteins in 6 hours.</p>
<p>Multiplying together, gives a final number of 5*10^14 Spike proteins. I'm not too confident about this but it won't be terribly far off.</p>
<p>For comparison, a single human cell <a href="http://book.bionumbers.org/how-many-proteins-are-in-a-cell/" target="_blank">contains about</a> 1*10^9 molecules of proteins (of course, depending on the cell type). The mRNA won't all be taken up by one cell, but this is still a useful comparison when counting numbers of protein molecules.</p>
<p><em>[note: an earlier version of this answer assumed 1 protein produced per mRNA per minute instead of 3.]</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to this, just because a ribosome translates the mRNA into protein doesn't necessarily mean it is properly folded. A unfolded polypeptide often needs a chaperone to help it properly fold, and this process <em>can</em> take some time. Translated but unfolded spike protein is likely biologically inactive - the immune response against unfolded spike protein will not provide you with prophylactic protection against COVID.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I learned that about 500 copies of protein are made from a single mRNA before it is degraded. I don't know if that's true or not, but it feels right to me. We just need to know how many copies of mRNA are in the shot you received.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
