		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Random mutation in one animal </p>
<p>That animal survives longer than others of its species </p>
<p>That animal is able to mate and pass on that mutation to its off spring </p>
<p>Over time, those offspring survive and produce their own young carrying that mutation </p>
<p>Over time, the animals carrying the mutation survive in greater numbers than the ones who don’t carry the mutation</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not really that there bodies know to but more natural selection.  One is born with a splotch on its back and has kids with the same splotch, over time with random mutations one might have splotches that look more eye shaped and the predators go for the ones without the markings so that eventually the whole species has markings after hundreds of years of this process</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Evolution doesn't &quot;know&quot; anything. It produces random mutations and if the mutation is part of a successful organism then it continues on.</p>
<p>I feel like most people that don't understand this about evolution underestimate the time frames in which evolution works.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
