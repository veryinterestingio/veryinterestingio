		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you touch something and it feels cold, that's because heat is leaving your body and flowing into the cold object. This is called thermal conduction, and different materials conduct heat at different rates. This is measured in Watts per meter Kelvin, and <strong>the higher this number is, the faster a material conducts heat</strong>. </p>
<p>Glass has a thermal conductivity coefficient around <strong>0.8 W/mK</strong>. Aluminum's is around <strong>239 W/mK</strong>. That's a big difference! If you measure the temperature of both liquids right out of the fridge, they will be the same temperature. But the one in metal feels colder in your hand because it is taking heat from you faster than the one in the glass bottle. This means that the drink in the glass bottle will actually stay colder for a longer period of time, since it will take longer for the liquid to absorb the same amount of heat. </p>
<p>Fun fact: this is also why the benches in saunas are made of wood, not metal. Wood doesnt conduct heat quickly enough to be uncomfortable or to burn your skin in the kinds of temperatures a sauna creates, but metal can.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>False premise. The temperature of the liquid is exactly the same given the same conditions.</p>
<p>Your hands perceive the Aluminum can as being colder because the aluminum more readily conducts temperature than the plastic or glass bottle</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plastic is a semi-decent insulator, and glass is an excellent insulator.  Aluminum, in contrast, is a very poor insulator.</p>
<p>When all three are put in the fridge, the aluminum will transfer the heat out of the soda very quickly, meaning that the can will cool very fast. Plastic will take a bit longer, as heat doesn't transfer as well to plastic, and glass will take a very long time, as glass does not transfer heat well at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
