		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dried tears form a clot of salt and mucosal proteins. It serves an evolutionary purpose of sealing your eye against moisture loss while you sleep. Without it, your eyes might dehydrate enough to damage your vision or permit an infection to set in and fester.</p>
<p>I am not an eye doctor, please correct me if necessary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some of it is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheum" target="_blank">rhuem</a>. This is a clear mucus like covering that keeps your eyes from leaking water.  This coating is pretty temperature sensitive and it starts to solidify if it drops much below normal body temperature. When people fall asleep it is pretty normal for their body temperature to drop a few degrees as well.  Which means, as we sleep, some of this cools off enough to turn to a solid crust that will collect along our eyelids. </p>
<p>The rest, as others say, is just the normal dust and grit that your blink away during the normal course of the day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>when you sleep your eyes build up dead skin cells and other extremities in the sides of your eyes so they can stay clean and they can also push other dead skin cells that’s near them. so technically your eyes and eyelids are a window washer and at night it’s just a car wash.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
