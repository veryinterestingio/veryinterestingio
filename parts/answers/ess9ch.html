		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First off, a lot of animals have wonky teeth! Some short snouted dog breeds have such terrible teeth the molars rotate 90 degrees because there’s physically no space to fit them. Horses often have malocclusion where the molars of the top and lower jaw don’t line up properly. That can cause severe problems because their teeth continuously grow, and if they don’t get filed down properly they can get painful spikes.</p>
<p>This brings me to the main point: evolutionary selection. An animal that doesn’t have properly lined up teeth will likely have more difficulty eating, making it less fit for survival and less likely to pass down its genes. Humans have basically 0 evolutionary pressure, and someone with an overbite etc has no disadvantage over someone with perfect teeth. Hence passing down the genes to wonky teeth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that humans in general have an overbite because we no longer tear our food with our teeth, we use cutlery instead.</p>
<p>You can actually date when ancient civilizations began to use cutlery by looking at when overbites begin to appear on the skeletons of it's people</p>
<p>An interesting article about it below - which, as a bonus, also talks about how cooking pots  helped extend the live's of humans beyond the point their teeth failed.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd say that teeth are much more important to other animals do catch food than it is for humans. Then natural selection takes care of selecting for good teeth in animals but not so much for humans. </p>
<p>Domesticated animals dont count in this because humans are doing the selecting for other features than teeth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One theory is as our diets have changed to include more processed food which is easily chewed as opposed to a of diet uncooked and unprocessed raw food that required more chewing and forward force upon the mandible. This has led to humans developing an overbite as the lower jaw simply hasn't needed to develop the musculature needed in the past.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
