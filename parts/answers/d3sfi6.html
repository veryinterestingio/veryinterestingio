		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think the &quot;why&quot;is well understood yet, but researchers are getting there.</p>
<p>Your brain has special neurons that tell you when you're thirsty.  Think of them as &quot;hydration fire alarms.&quot;  When you're thirsty, these alarms are going off in your brain, prompting you to seek out water.  So you start to drink, and eventually these alarms shut off.</p>
<p>UCSF researchers discovered that when the fluid is colder, these alarms shut off faster.   They still shut off with warmer fluids, but the colder it is, the faster they shut up.</p>
<p>That is what is happening, but again, the &quot;why&quot; is something I don't think is known yet. (I didn't look too hard though)</p>

<p>edit:  fwiw, I answered this under the context of &quot;refreshing&quot; and not &quot;hydrating&quot; as others are correct, warmer fluids are actually better for hydration, just not thirst.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cold water has the double effect of lowering body temp while hydrating. Your body seeks a certain temp to maintain so once youâ€™re heated up and most likely thirsty your body will get double the pleasure and double the fun from that cold water</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think this is in part cultural (and specifically, Western culture). In some Easten countries (e.g. China) people prefer hot or room temperature water. </p>
<p>I could speculate on reasons for those cultural norms to develop, but I don't know why specifically -- just to say that it seems to be cultural and not rooted solely in human biology.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
