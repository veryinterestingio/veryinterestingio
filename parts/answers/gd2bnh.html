		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's what you sound like. Not just blood but your organs, gasses trapped inside you, your bodily processes at work. These sounds are always present but are drowned out or unfocused on because of all the stimulation of the outside world. But once there's nothing left to distract you, you finally hear...yourself. And that's when you realize silence will never truly exist for you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
