		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your skin needs to be stretchy in order to accommodate all of the different types of movement that humans do.  If you think about it, when you change the shape of your hand (by making a fist, for example), you are changing the surface area the skin needs to cover. To avoid splitting the skin open when this happens, we need to have a way to make the area of skin adjust itself to the area that is needed.</p>
<p>One way to do this is to &quot;store&quot; the extra area in wrinkles and folds when it is not needed, like when you pull your fingers back towards your wrist.  Then when you need that area (like making a fist) the folds flatten themselves out to help the skin expand and stretch.</p>
<p>As to why we see triangles (or other shapes), the answer is because we need the skin on our hands to be able to stretch in all directions at once.  If you look at your inner elbow, you'll see straight lines instead, because the skin only really needs to stretch in one direction.</p>
