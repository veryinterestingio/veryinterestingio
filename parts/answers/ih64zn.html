		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The control center at Kennedy Space Center has operational control during the launch and ascent stages, but after the rocket is in orbit it doesn't matter much where the control center is. </p>
<p>The Houston Control Center dates back to the early days of the manned space program and was built not only to support space flights but also serve as a hub for R&amp;D, manufacturing, astronaut training and much more in support of the space program. Houston checked all those boxes due in part to its location and strong infrastructure available.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the control center for the rocket launch IS in Florida, at Kennedy.  Houston is in charge of the mission AFTER the launch succeeds.  This only applies to manned missions.  Unmanned missions are usually controlled from JPL in California.</p>
<p>The reasons for Houston are political, geographical, financial, etc.   Houston was picked when LBJ was a powerful Senator from Texas, and officially opened when he was Kennedy's VP.  It's located in the middle of the Continental US.  It was near a major university (Rice) and in an area that would be home to the growing oil &amp; gas business, providing a good pool of engineering talent.  The land was donated by the Humble Oil company.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not really an ELI5 question because it has a simple answer.</p>
<p>The control center was going to be big and employ a lot of people. So they needed land near a place where a lot of people could live. </p>
<p>Houston ticked the boxes. Nasa got a good deal on some land there. </p>
<p>The control center doesn't need to be near the rocket launch pad.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The launching site needed to be as close as possible to the equator, because the earth is rotating faster there, giving a boost to rockets leaving the atmosphere. So Florida was, scientifically speaking, the best location for the launch site. However, at the time they were exploring a site for the NASA headquarters, Sam Rayburn (from Texas) was Speaker of the House and Lyndon Johnson (also from Texas) was senate majority leader, then vice president, and finally, president, and they used their influence to get the space center moved to their state of Texas. They didn't <em>need</em> to move to Houston--prior to the establishment of the center in Houston, NASA was located in Virginia, where there were plenty of people to work there and space to do so. </p>
<p>Whether they would have chosen Houston without the influence of Johnson (who had been working to advance the space program since 1957, and became head of the Space Council in 1961 as Veep) is unknown. It was definitely a prize for any politician to have in their district or state so lots of politicians jockeyed to have their location chosen. JFK had wanted the space program to be centered in the Boston/Cambridge area, a perfect place for Harvard and MIT scientists, and they broke ground for some buildings. But ultimately Boston was passed over for Houston, despite JFK being the president at the time. </p>
<p>If you want more detail: the site of Houston was chosen while Johnson was Vice President and head of the Space Council, but he had been already working on advancing the space program since 1957, which was before JFK became president and declared his man on the moon mission. So there were a range of years where Johnson had a lot of power where NASA was concerned and he was able to use that to help push through what he wanted, but it wasn't until he became veep that the site was chosen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As other comments noted, control doesn't *need* to be near the rocket so they had free choice and there's lots of reasons Houston is a reasonable choice.</p>
<p>They *could* have built it in Florida but the space program was a huge multi-billion $ government program and they intentionally spread that $/jobs/prestige around. That's part of the reason you've got major facilities in California, Texas, Alabama, Florida.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
