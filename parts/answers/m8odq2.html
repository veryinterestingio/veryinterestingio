		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The goal of allergy shots is to slowly make your immune system switch from one type of immune response to another. In order to do that, they have to start with a super-low dose of the allergy trigger so that it flies under the radar of the allergy responders and instead gets the attention of a different type of immune cell. You slowly increase the dose of the allergy trigger to build on that process until your immune system turns down the allergy response and instead is more primed to use a different type of responder that doesn’t result in allergy symptoms. If you start with too high of a dose or jump to too high of a dose too quickly, the allergy responders will sense it and trigger an allergic reaction instead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your immune system is classified into two main categories: innate immunity which everyone is born with and responds quickly but only with broad, nonspecific mechanisms, and adaptive immunity which is built over a lifetime of encountering pathogens, is much slower but is highly specific.</p>
<p>When you encounter something for the first time, your innate immunity kicks in and attacks it at the site of infection. If it can't handle it on its own, some immune cells will take a portion of the pathogen to your adaptive immune cells and an adaptive immune response will begin. </p>
<p>The first time this happens, adaptive immunity takes 7-14 days to get going. At the end of this response when the infection is cleared, most adaptive immune cells (which are now specific to that pathogen) will die off but a small portion will undergo a process to turn them into &quot;memory&quot; cells.</p>
<p>The second time you encounter the pathogen, adaptive response time is shortened because instead of having to start from scratch, innate immune cells will activate your memory cells directly which then multiply and clear the infection. Immune memory, whether that's in the form of memory cells or antibodies, declines over time at varying rates so re-exposure through boosters strengthen and extend your memory response.</p>
<p>Edit: just saw the second half of your question. In injecting allergens such as dust mites or peanut powder, many small injections are needed because these cause immune &quot;tolerance&quot;. Your immune system decides what to attack based on what looks dangerous - in infections, a lot of tissue damage occurs which throws up a lot of danger signals, and activates the immune system. Repeated exposure to allergens, which don't cause tissue damage on their own, will eventually teach the immune system that they are not dangerous. However, since your immune system reacts to it, it does tissue damage itself and misattributes it to the allergen. This is why frequent repeated doses are needed - this tissue damage decreases over time and eventually your immune cells basically get bored of the allergen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Vaccine is like telling your system that a baddie exists and to fight it.</p>
<p>Immunotherapy is teaching your body that what it is convinced to be a baddie is not. It's like trying to convince a flat eather that the earth is round. Try too hard too fast and you will cause your body to fight it and reinforce it's belief that it is bad. Do it slowly and it may go &quot;finally it's not that bad, I can take a bit more of that&quot;. Eventually it will be desensitived enought to not be an issue anymore. But try too hard now and it will go &quot;WOAH BADDIES!!!!&quot; and you may need to start over...</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because whilst it’s important for your body to be able to learn new defensive techniques there is less of an evolutionary benefit to unlearning protective mechanisms. Outside of major anaphylactic shock from big allergies, most allergic reactions tell you to avoid a stimulus which in protects you and are better for you than the possibile consequences of the pathogen. Most of the time there’s little benefit from weaning yourself onto dangerous stimuli. There’s a hand full like peanuts we interact with on a daily basis but most dangerous toxins are best to be avoided as they aren’t ubiquitous or offer any benefits to us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
