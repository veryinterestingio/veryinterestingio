		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not Five Explanation: Trucks and buses generally have double wheels at the back to increase the area of contact on which their weights acts and hence reduces the pressure on the ground. It also provides the ability to replace one side if it is punctured, as well as being more cost friendly.</p>
<p>Five Explanation: two wheels is more stable, two wheels is cheaper than big fat wheel, two wheels is easier to replace if one side is broken. two wheel good.</p>
<p>Edit: Listen, I haven’t talked to a kid in years. I don’t know how smart they are.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it's easier to make it flat that way.</p>
<p>Anything pressurized wants to be round, but tires work best when they have a nice flat surface to meet the nice flat road. This problem gets worse as the tire gets bigger. That's why your bike tire can basically have a circular cross section and it's not big deal, it just squishes some as you roll on it. But if you do that with a really big tire at speed all that flexing in the sidewall generates a lot of heat and the tire fails.</p>
<p>A truck or bus is so heavy that you need a tire about about 2 feet wide to provide enough surface to take the weight from the axel, but a single tire 2 wide will bulge out way too much. Two skinnier tires side by side has almost as much surface but doesn't bulge nearly as badly because you have a sidewall in the &quot;middle&quot; to hold everything down.</p>
<p>You also have the advantage that if one goes flat the whole wheel doesn't drop.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you look up &quot;wide base tires&quot;  One fat tire is also an option.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One reason I'm not seeing mentioned here is snow and ice. In a truck, your fat ass takes a looooong time to slow down, even in perfect dry weather (take note, drivers, this is why you shouldn't swoop in front of trucks two feet off their bumper when passing). In snow? Your time to maneuver is effectively doubled.</p>
<p>What's the form of a snow tire? In its most simplest form, it's a tire with deeper treads that avoid being filled completely with snow, and softer rubber to help grip the road better in cold conditions, where rubber will harden. That first one is especially important, as deeper treads help get grip on packed snow and ice.</p>
<p>With dual tires, the space between them basically acts as one very deep tread, allowing greater control in the snow. Which if you're running super singles (which is what the &quot;one big tire&quot; would be called -- they do exist), you don't have.</p>
