		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rechargeable batteries use a reversible chemical reaction. In the normal discharge direction, they release electrons to one side of the battery and we flow those through the device to power it before we return them to the other side of the battery. When we recharge the battery we force electrons in the opposite direction, reversing the chemical reaction.</p>
<p>But...the reaction isn't perfect. The battery will physically change over time; some parts will degrade, some of the chemicals won't fully revert to their original form, some side chemicals will form. As you do this over and over and over the amount of chemical available in the right form to do the power reaction fades away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A modern phone battery (lithium-ion) has a crystal structure that allows it to hold a charge. Every time it is charged/discharged, it gets tiny cracks in the structure. After enough charge/discharge cycles the cracks become severe enough that it cannot hold as much charge. You can look up a technical manual for most batteries that can tell you how many charge/discharge cycles to expect out of the battery, which is more important than the battery's age alone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Used to work in battery tech. Lithium ion batteries have a cathode and  electrode plates in them. The ionic liquid that makes up the material between the plates is filled with positively charged and negatively charged molecules and free moving lithium ions. As the battery discharges the positive ions move towards the electrode which is offset by the electrons moving through the circuit. The ions get deposited onto the plates surface, so there is a physical change in the battery. Then when the battery is charged the opposite happens. But the process isn't 100% perfect and ions get deposited onto the surface and get stuck, so the overall capacity of the battery diminishes over time</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a herd of hungry anamals on some dry desert plains. On the edge there's a river that can't be crossed. There is a lush utopia on the other side that every animal wants to get to, but can't cross the river. Your phone is powered by the animals gratefulness, so you fly some animals over to the lush utopia whenever you want to browse the Internet. Pretty soon though, you run out of animals to be grateful, so you need to fly those animals back. When they get off the plane, they run towards the river because they miss the lush, lush greenness, and when they get to the waters edge, they kick a bit of dirt into the water. Over time, more and more dirt gets kicked into the water, and closer and closer to the utopia they can get. One day the dirt reaches all the way over the river and forms a narrow path that slowly lets animals pass over to the utopia. So you end up having to send more and more animals back to the dessert (charging) than you send to the utopia (powering your phone) and eventually that dirt path becomes so wide it doesn't make sense to fly animals anymore, so you throw them away and get a new utopia, river and desert full of hungry animals.</p>
<p>Edit: So the animals are electrons, the desert plain is the anode plate, the utopia is the cathode plate, the river is the electrolyte seperating the two plates, and the dirt kicked into the river represents the small amount of dissolved anode in the electrolyte as it recombines onto the anode plate as close to the cathode as possible, and that's what degrades a lithium battery. Plane rides to utopia are you consuming battery charge, while rides to the desert are recharging the battery.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, it's just a form of wear on the chemical structure of the battery. However, every single battery type operates differently so exactly how this wear occurs will vary depending on which rechargeable battery you're talking about. For example, lead acid batteries in a car stop working over time because the lead plates that diffuse particles in the acid and form a bridge for the current inside the battery are supposed to reclaim the lead inside the acid after the battery is no longer active. Over time the lead stops sticking to the internal plates and allows electricity to flow regardless of whether the car is on. This allows the battery to drain slowly into ground and be dead when you attempt to next start the car. Additionally, the plates are no longer properly equipped to hold charge and don't function as well for storage. There's also other small defects over time such as acid leaking out the terminals due to overcharging from the alternator, but the above is the primary reason for this battery type.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
