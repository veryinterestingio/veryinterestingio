		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Repetitive sounds... actually repetitive anything, gets tuned out by your brain. This is why alarms and sirens alternate their sounds, so that you dont tune it out. This is a big reason why we also tend to ignore our own body sounds. Things like chewing, breathing, snoring, heartbeat. Yes, you can hear your heartbeat pulsing in your ears at all times.</p>
<p>So, when you are falling asleep, you aren't, in any way, focused on sounds your brain recognizes. Any cognitive recognition of sounds or stimuli is focused on stuff that you don't immediately recognize, things that could be a threat, things that could possibly kill you. </p>
<p>So if your snoring isn't severe enough to close off your airways and make your brain force you awake (because it thinks it's dying, this is called sleep apnea btw). Then you'll never notice yourself snoring, because your brain doesn't care enough to pay attention.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
