		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you mean why is it fine flying/ falling a distance 50x it's height and be fine, compared to humans?  It boils down to the Square-Cube Law: If something gets 10 times bigger, it will become 1000 times (10^(3)) heavier, because height, weight, and length all increase by 10.  </p>
<p>This means that things that work in a small scale don't work scaled up:  compare ants to elephants.  Ants have super thin legs, even compared to their own bodies, and can lift 6x their weight! Elephants, on the other hand, need to have huge tree trucks for legs and can't carry nearly as much.  This allows insects to withstand comparative forces much higher than other, larger creatures</p>
<p>In addition, because these insects have this small weight to size ratio, their air resistance prevents their maximum velocity from being very fast, similar to trying to throw a feather as hard as possible.  This also limits how hurt insects can get.  </p>
<p>A way to remember this is a story I heard a story a long time ago:  If you drop different creatures down a well, a mouse won't notice, a cat will be stunned, a dog will limp away, a human will break, and a horse will splat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>They have such a low mass that their terminal velocity (maximum speed) cant be dangerous to them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
