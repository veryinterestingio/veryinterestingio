		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's not enough &quot;stuff&quot; in space to dirty the windows of the ISS naturally. However, departing and  incoming shuttle thrusters give off enough particulate to dirty the windows over time. Back in 2015, the Russians on the ISS did an EVA to clean the windows.</p>
<p>So yes, but very slowly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They have multi-layered meteorite armor shields that cover the cupola windows when they’re not in use, they’re only opened for relatively brief periods. Even tiny specks of paint or ice can do damage at orbital speeds, and the windows are essentially irreplaceable from a cost of repair perspective.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is going off on a bit of a tangent but I studied microbial contamination on spacecraft, and windows are one of many areas prone to biofouling: on the notoriously microbe-infested Mir space station some fungal species were seen to literally eat their way through a quartz navigation window, and a similar effect in the Soyuz transporter caused an &quot;etching effect&quot; in the glass. For the time being this seems to be a lower concern than other spacecraft areas, and is more of a problem on the inside than the outside (although fungi may survive on the exterior).</p>
