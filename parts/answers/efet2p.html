		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Perfume has to be one of the hardest things to market directly.  Let's compare it with food.  You can market food because even though you can't taste the food, the other senses inspire the memory of taste.
You can see how good food looks, you can see the juices run down a steak, or the fizzing in a bottle of Coke.  You can hear the sound of someone munching down on chips, or that &quot;aah&quot; exclamation someone makes after drinking a refreshing beverage.  All these sensory inputs will make us taste the food in our minds, without physically tasting it.  </p>
<p>Perfume has none of that.  It is a mostly clear liquid without any other essential characteristics.  The only way to market perfume is to try and come up with a visual experience with what perfume inspires.  Thus, these commercials look artistic and hip.  Perfume smells like what a beautiful person looks like, so they use good looking actors.  Perfume smells like romance, adventure, lust, so the commercials have those elements.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Don't think it's been mentioned: the point of advertising is to make you remember a name when you reach the point of sale. The ad just has to get you to make the association between some emotion, some memory and the name of the product.</p>
<p>Best example given above: the old spice ads. Maybe ridiculous, but everyone remembers them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
