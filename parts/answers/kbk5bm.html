		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bacteria does not produce alcohol. Fungi called yeast produces alcohol. </p>
<p>However, your point remains true, alcohol still kills yeast. It's all about concentration. Beers and wine can be produced by yeast, up until about 15%. Past there, it kills the yeast. To make a harder alcohol, you have to distill (basically purify by boiling) the alcohol yeast produces. </p>
<p>Why does yeast produce a substance that kills it? Well, because it's a waste product. It's exactly equivalent to asking why a large concentration of CO2 or urine will kill you. Because it's waste you are try it dispell, and if unsuccessful, it will kill you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yeast produces alcohol, but it's also pretty good at surviving in alcohol (to a point). Other microorganisms aren't. This kills off everything that isn't yeast.</p>
<p>Lactobacillus, the bacteria used in sauerkraut and other fun fermenter foods, produces acid. They're pretty good at surviving in acid, while other microorganisms aren't.</p>
<p>I think you can see the general strategy here: there's food, so let's change the environment so that only my species can eat it!</p>
<p>At least, that's one theory in the topic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We produce CO2 and CO2 in large enough concentrations will kill us. Same difference.</p>
<p>Also, it does kill them (yeast, not bacteria), which is why alcohol can only be fermented to a certain volume before it needs to go through distillation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually fungus produces ethanol.  This fungus is yeast.  Mostly the yeast you can use is Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. That means the sugar lover of the beer in Latin.</p>
<p>The yeast does slowly murder itself with ethanol.  That is why wine maxes out at 20% alchohol by volume if it's not fortified.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
