		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you're sick, your brain and body works together to fight off the bad guys. The defenses in your body is more powerful than you could ever imagine. Think of an important piece of land, with a castle fighting off bad guys. That is your body, that is you. Everything inside the land and castle, you. You have a king and queen inside, imagine that as your conscious brain, basically you right now. The trustworthy protectors of the king and queen orders and give instructions to people living inside to tell the knights and soldiers where to go and how to fight. The trustworthy protectors are your subconscious brain. Basically, everything that you don't think about, but still works hard to keep your body moving and under control, and what holds your memories and smartness to solve problems.</p>
<p>The knights and soldiers are your blood. Or rather, a type of blood called the white blood cell. They eat the bad guys, which are the germs in your body that causes you to be sick. Sometimes, the bad guys will invade too far into your land. The castle responds by catching the bad guys in a net, and launching them out of a cannon, very very far away. This is why you cough, to get the bad germs out of your body. The king and queen sees, feels and hears this cannon explosion everytime, so you always know you are coughing when you are awake.</p>
<p>When you sleep, the land goes dark and the king/queen sleep as well. However, the knights and soldiers and protectors are still fighting the bad guys which are trying to break into the castle. The same thing happens, and you cough to get the germs out. But this time, you don't know it is happening. After all, the king and queen are sleeping. But the protectors are still commanding every move to get you safe and healthy. Be proud of your body and its power! You are stronger than you'd think.</p>
<p>Once the king and queen wake up, they feel very blissful and relaxed. Why shouldn't they? They got a good night's rest without any distractions. After all, seeing and hearing the cannons going off at dark would be very annoying for you to try to sleep, so that's why you don't hear yourself coughing. It's only very big situations which forces the protectors to wake up the king and queen. In other words, things like your alarm clock that forces you to wake up and notice everything around you.</p>

<p>TL;DR: You do cough when you sleep, it's more so because you aren't conscious of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember my mum once waking me up when I was little – she was really worried and I didn't get it, but apparently I'd been coughing really badly in my sleep, so she woke me up to drink a glass of water (which, as we know, cures everything.) But I hadn't even felt like I'd been coughing, so I totally get that &quot;moment of bliss&quot; thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
