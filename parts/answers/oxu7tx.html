		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Suez Canal is an open cut between the Mediterranean and Red Seas, there are no locks or barriers of any kind. Therefore several species have been able to cross between them.</p>
<p>The Panama Canal on the other hand contains numerous locks, making it much more difficult for anything to cross over it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

They basically covered all the open water with a layer of oil and they were actually quite successful in eradicating essentially all mosquitoes in the canal zone. I can't imagine any of that was good for the local ecosystems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
