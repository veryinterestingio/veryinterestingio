<p>What it is though is the ice freezing and expanding, the increased volume of ice increases internal pressure and it ends up cracking itself!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When the ice cracks, it makes a sharp &quot;bang&quot;.  But a &quot;bang&quot; is really <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_analysis" target="_blank">a whole lot of different frequencies of sound added together</a>.  As the sound travels through the ice, the high-pitched sounds <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_dispersion" target="_blank">travel faster</a> than the low-pitched ones, so when they arrive you hear the high-pitched ones first, making a &quot;teeyoub!&quot; noise like a Star Wars blaster.</p>
<p>The same thing happens whenever sound waves travel through a stiff solid object.  For instance, you can hear this when you bang on the guy wires of a telephone pole ... which is what they recorded to make the Star Wars blaster noises.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>TLDR: The high-frequency sounds reach your ears first then the low ones. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Sweden we call it that &quot;the ice is singing&quot;. Like most have already pointed out its most commonly presented when you have the right conditions between cold and snow depth, making the ice expand and crack under internal pressure. That is why its most common during night or evening, when its colder outside. Kinda like when you heat glas up and then cool it quickly, it cracks.  </p>
<p>I am fairly sure, altho unconfirmed, the thickness of the ice and depth of the lake regulates the pitch of the sound. I live next to a very deep lake and we get a lot deeper sounds.  </p>
<p>This is not the only way you can create this sound tho. If the ice is thin enough you can physically crack the ice and recreate the sound. Here is a video of some people ice skating on thin black ice  </p>
