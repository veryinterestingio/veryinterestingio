		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The brain contains a lot of feedback loops so it can distinguish what comes from within itself vs. from the outside world.</p>
<p>Those who are ticklish often can't feel tickled by themselves due to one such loop that tells their brain that they themselves are inducing the stimulus.</p>
<p>In schizophrenia, there are not enough connections called synapses between neurons (types of brain cells).</p>
<p>The brain goes through at least two major synapse pruning in a person's life and in schizophrenia, the person's brain underwent too much synaptic pruning, resulting in underconnectivity.</p>
<p>This disrupts the feedback loops. The audio hallucinations that someone with schizophrenia hears is their own subvocal speech. Every one has subvocal speech but in healthy individuals, the brain is able to determine that these speech thoughts originate from within itself, and they get filtered out or presented to the person's consciousness as something they might want to say or as a thought.</p>
<p>In schizophrenia the brain cannot make this determination so instead of being filtered out, or said or acknowledged as a thought, they are interpreted as actual audio.</p>
<p>Edit: I corrected &quot;sublingual speech&quot; to &quot;subvocal speech&quot;.</p>
<p>Since many have asked. The original research on this was done by Dr. Louis Gould and the subject is further discussed in the book &quot;NeuroLogic: The Brain's Hidden Rationale Behind Our Irrational Behavior&quot;
by Eliezer Sternberg, and for those of you who don't care to read the book, also discussed in a Slate article he wrote.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also as a non-schizophrenic who has experienced auditory hallucinations in the past, the only real way you know they aren't real is from contextual clues. At the end of the day, what you hear is a result of your brain processing inputs from your ears, and a false input will sound basically the same as a true one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I experience voices coming from the people around me as auditory hallucinations.. it can get pretty wild when you feel as though people are speaking telepathically on another level around you and your voice is being drowned out.
Not sure what to do about it besides stay on antipsychotic medication to subdue the voices and tell myself theyâ€™re not real. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since schizophrenics sometimes experience auditory hallucinations with negative or critical dialogue, I've always wondered if there could be some kind of therapy using headphones with postive or reassuring audio (vocal) feedback to balance out or undermine the negative voices in real-time. Or is it such a rare occurance that it wouldn't be practical?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
