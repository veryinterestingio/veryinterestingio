		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6929e1.htm" target="_blank">study in Indiana</a> found 44% of patients with an active infection were asymptomatic. I've seen estimates of 20-80% of cases being asymptomatic, our understanding of the prevelance of asymptomatic cases could definitely be improved. </p>
<p>There was a <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2769235" target="_blank">very recent JAMA  study</a> comparing  viral load between asymptomatic vs symptomatic patients...there was no significant difference.</p>
<p>We don't fully understand why some people are asymptomatic and some people get very severe disease. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/07/20/893227088/growing-body-of-evidence-suggests-masks-protect-those-wearing-them-too" target="_blank">One theory</a> is the amount of virus one is exposed to impacts severity. Another factor could be <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2020283?query=featured_coronavirus" target="_blank">ABO blood type</a>: people with type A blood are more likely to experience severe symptoms, while patients with  type O blood experience milder symptoms. Another factor could be the <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/07/15/science.abc8511" target="_blank">types of immune responses</a> elicited by your body, but we don't know what drives those differences. There could be many other factors we don't know about though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly what you're asking about, but Radiolab recently had a very interesting podcast episode about how a large percentage of homeless seem to be coming down with COVID-19 but remain asymptomatic, possible due to having higher Vitamin D than the average population. <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/invisible-allies" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/invisible-allies" target="_blank">https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/invisible-allies</a></a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<ul>
<li>
<p>The study showed that 80% of seropositive people (those with antibodies) did not have any symptoms and 56% of seropositive people had not had any known contact with a COVID-19 patient. Thus only 20% of people with coronavirus antibodies reported having had a symptom of COVID-19, such as high fever, runny nose, nausea, sore throat, diarrhoea or chest pain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People tested were in two regions: 1) a disctrict in the capital; 2) an island with highest number of cases.</p>
</li>
<li>the prevalence of coronavirus among the people was 1.4% in the capital and 6% on the island.</li>
