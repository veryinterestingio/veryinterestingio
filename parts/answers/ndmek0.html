Use 6 digits, and the circumference of a kilometer-wide circle is less than a centimeter off the true value. That's already better than most measurement methods. And additionally to that, computers in general can't handle infinitely precise numbers.</p>
<p>If you do the right calculations, the error could stack up, but in this case you rather use mathematical tricks to simplify the calculations first, before using any hard-coded numbers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you want to see how many digits it stores, subtract the first number, then multiply by 10.  Repeat until it runs out of numbers.</p>
<p>eg. assume calculator actually had 3.1415, but it only showed 2 decimals at a time, so all you see if 3.14</p>
<p>3.1415     (calculator shows 3.14)</p>
<p>3.1415-3 = 0.1415.   (calculator shows 0.14)</p>
<p>0.1415 x 10 = 1.415. (calculator shows 1.42)</p>
<p>1.415-1 = 0.415 (calculator shows 0.42)</p>
<p>0.415 x 10 = 4.15 (calculator shows 4.15)</p>
<p>4.15-4 = 0.15 (calculator shows 0.15)</p>
<p>0.15x10 = 1.5 (calculator shows 1.5)</p>
<p>1.5 -1 = 0.5 (calculator shows 0.5)</p>
<p>0.5 x 10 = 5 (calculator shows 5)</p>
<p>5-5 = 0 (calculator shows 0)</p>
<p>And you are done.  Calculator only showed 3.14, but you can figure out the unseen numbers.   It can also be done more efficiently, a lot more efficiently, but I was trying to lay it out :).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other people have really good explanations, but I want to talk about error. </p>
<p>Using the first 2 digits is fairly accurate for most calculations. The error introduced by using is negligible (about 0.051% error) which becomes even smaller if you use pi approximations in trig functions like Sine, Cosine, Tangent, etc which you usually will be doing with pi.</p>
<p>Ex: sin(90) = 1, but sin(90.1) = 0.99999848. The error we willingly introduced (90.1 instead of 90) is about 1.1111% error, but the error in the output comes out to be 0.000152%. In general, introducing error into a system can compound itself as you carry that number further into your calculations. But the trig functions are a special case where they are not sensitive to error. Since pi is frequently used in the trig functions, the digits of pi don’t really matter in most cases. </p>
<p>An example of how much error is okay, think of 1/2 an inch of error and apply to context. Landing a spaceship on the moon and being off by 1/2 an inch in the landing is amazing. Building a patio with one side 1/2 inch short is acceptable if it was a DIY project, though you might notice it eventually. However, I’d start panicking if my dentist told me he was 1/2 an inch off in the root canal. </p>
<p>Source: I’m an engineer in training, so I am okay with errors and being close enough within context.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
