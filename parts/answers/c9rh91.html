		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Russia - unlike Australia and Spain - takes actions to antagonize the west is the principle reasons. Both those other countries probably could cause issues for the west if they were so inclined, but they are both friendly nations with a similar core values. </p>
<p>Russia is a historical enemy for the west, a legacy of the Cold War that has never truly healed. Some of the blame there can be attributed to the west, and to western assumptions made at the end of the Cold War. But Russia, or rather the Russian leadership, deserves the vast majority of the blame. </p>
<p>Russia may be a democracy on paper, but in the chaos of the aftermath of the fall of the Soviet Union, much of the countries wealth and power was sucked up by a tiny number of individuals – the oligarchs. These individuals have massive personal power. If you think social stratification is a big thing in the west (and it is!) then take a look at Russia to see the end game. Corruption is endemic, with public works projects being incredibly expensive as each person along the process shaves of a little extra. Life expectancy has plummeted amongst Russians. </p>
<p>Add to this, a lot of the countries that Russia regards as being within its sphere of influence, especially in eastern Europe, happily jumped ship into the arms of the EU and NATO. Russia again bears a lot of the blame here, and its hard not to see them as something of an abusive boyfriend shocked when their girl leaves them for someone else. But there was a failure on the part of Western politicians to think on how Russia would react to this perceived encroachment. </p>
<p>Russian leaders fear the west, and westernism. They have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrwlk7_GF9g" target="_blank">personally</a> profited [greatly]( <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-europe-35402707/how-rich-is-russian-leader-vladimir-putin" target="_blank">https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-europe-35402707/how-rich-is-russian-leader-vladimir-putin</a>), and the last thing they want is domestic Russians getting ideas about wealth redistribution (its notable that the 100 year anniversary of the Communist revolution in Russia passed with very little fanfare, despite a governmental willingness to make a big deal about Soviet leaders). To maintain this control, they continued the state tools of media control that had been developed during the Cold War. It’s very easy to control TV, Printed media, and Radio. The internet however, is a bit harder. That requires more effort to control, and you can see this with the way that Russian Social Media sites such as VK were snapped up by buyers linked to Kremlin leadership – something akin to the US government buying up Facebook. This mechanism of controlling online discourse was developed defensively – but a tool of defence can also be used offensively. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, two other events occurred. The Russian invasion of Georgia, which made other small nations, particularly Baltic nations, nervous and drove them further into NATO/EU hands, and more importantly, Ukraine. </p>
<p>The Russian invasion of Ukraine would probably have passed with only a few minor waves of sanctions if not for the shootdown of MH-17 in 2014, with the loss of hundreds of EU citizens. Suddenly the pressure on Russia ramps up, the sanctions get serious and relations between the Russia and the west go off a cliff, not helped by the Russian denial of the facts in the face of overwhelming evidence. </p>
<p>These sanctions are biting, especially with the dive in Oil prices. Russia is being stonewalled by European nations and the US. They don’t have the economy to challenge the united west in the way that China might be able to. They don’t have the military either, and a military action against the West would be massively counter-productive as it would inevitably cost more than it would gain.</p>
<p>So, they need a new way to fight back. It had long been the Russian view that while the West was basically unchallengeable in a direct confrontation, Russia could use its soft power apparatus to undermine the cohesion of the western alliance. Information was a vital weapon here, fanning the pre-existing flames of discontent and division. Those cracks in western society already exist, and to a certain extent they were pushing on an open door. People talk about fabricated Russian stories a lot, but as was seen with the MH-17 shootdown, it’s not that successful there. Its when it takes the real gaps in western society and works on those that it has success. </p>
<p>Money was the other great weapon. While Russia lacks the vast economies of the West (sometimes being called a “mafia gas station” posing as a state) it does have more than enough wealth to fund division within the west. </p>
<p>Russia hasn’t played the game perfectly – the Skripal case was botched (both the intended victims surviving) and the unity displayed by the West post Skripal did surprise them, and the sanctions remain. Putin is without a clear heir, aging, and the Russian elite are not loyal to him through love. He’s got a tough hand to play with.</p>
<p>But how they do it? Its very simple. When you are fighting an enemy, you don't fight them where they are strong, but where they are weak. Modern day globalism allows for foreign states to have great access to populations. That gives access, and access can be leveraged.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bots that spew out memes and robocalls to enrage people. They are filled with lies and half truths but apparently we in the west eat them up and pass them on. They are destroying us from the inside out. They are getting us to call the cops on neighbors and not trust each other anymore. You have to get out there and meet your neighbors face to face and realize that despite color or income, they are really just like you and have the same values. We have to get off our computers (written here on a computer). My excuse is that right now it's 96F and 99% humidity, but you can bet your ass, I'll be out after the sun goes down....</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They have nukes, which lets them get away with much more than another country in a similar situation would be able to without having to fear retaliation.</p>
<p>They also have all sorts of natural resources and raw materials in their really huge country which give them another bargaining power as an exporter.</p>
<p>Also the rulers instead of investing their fortunes to build up the country they rule mostly invest the money the stole from their people abroad by investing in foreign companies and stuff like real estate in London and bribes for foreign politicians.</p>
<p>This gives the ruling elite a lot power compared to the fortune of the average citizen compared to other countries.</p>
<p>You have rulers in places like Africa who get similarly rich by selling out their countries natural resources to the west, but if they get too uptty and try to take a too big cut from the money, western powers will simply help whatever local opposition there is to overthrow them and get a better deal. Russia doesn't have to fear that as much and can keep most of the money made from the oil and gas and minerals they mine. It won't make the average worker much richer or the infrastructure much better, but it makes the oligarchs a lot richer and more powerful.</p>
<p>Having leftover military assets from the cold war that you give minimal resources to maintain and update protects them from a similar fate as other countries.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
