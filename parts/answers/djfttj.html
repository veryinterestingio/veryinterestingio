		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ceramics and metals tend to repel neither water, nor oil, so soaps have an easy time time washing oils off of those surfaces. The issue with using soaps on plastics is that the surface of the plastic is slightly hydrophobic, so instead of forming a soap membrane around the oil spots, it more or less creates a thin film over the entirety of the surface, diminishing the effectiveness of the soap.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
