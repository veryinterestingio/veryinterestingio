		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It hasn't gone anywhere.</p>
<p>I have an &quot;item&quot;. You want it. I agree to sell it to you for $1.</p>
<p>The next day, a report is released saying that having this &quot;item&quot; has been conclusively shown to cure and prevent cancer. That was the last &quot;item&quot; I had; I desperately want it back. I negotiate buying it back from you for $1,000 to keep it on my person.</p>
<p>A day later, the news announces that the released report was a fake. Nobody wants my &quot;item&quot; anymore except for $1 again.</p>
<p>Where did the $999 come from? Nowhere. It was us agreeing that such and such thing was worth $1,000 instead of $1. We didn't create any actual money, we just paid each other different amounts to acquire the &quot;item&quot; at different points. Where did the $999 go? Again, nowhere. We would only be able to agree that it was worth $1 again. If I had kept it the first day I would have been able to sell it for $1,000 the next day and <em>realize</em> $999 in gains. If I had sold it the first day then bought it back the 2nd day, then sold it the 3rd day, I would be <em>realizing</em> $999 of loss. If I had kept it the whole time I would have gained or lost nothing, realized or unrealized.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Into different classes of assets, typically gold, government bonds, anything that investors view as more stable. That said, the <em>reason</em> markets are down is usually because of a sweeping price correction, ie: something people had <em>thought</em> was worth a lot of money suddenly turns out to be worth far less.</p>
<p>When times are &quot;good&quot; and everyone thinks they're getting rich, they'll be able to spend more money bidding up the price of investments, because that's generally the smartest thing to do with your money: Invest it into something which will earn you more money. The problem occurs when there's a new class of investment which appears to be &quot;too good to be true&quot;. Dot.com stocks in 2001, Mortgage-backed securities in 2008, are good examples of this.</p>
<p>John Maynard Keynes, the economist for whom &quot;Keynesian Economics&quot; is named, uses a metaphor to describe the stock market: The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_beauty_contest" target="_blank">beauty contest</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Keynes described the action of rational agents in a market using an analogy based on a fictional newspaper contest, in which entrants are asked to choose the six most attractive faces from a hundred photographs. Those who picked the most popular faces are then eligible for a prize.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, everyone is trying to guess what the most popular faces will be, not necessarily the faces they actually think are the most attractive. This phenomenon is how bubbles form. Many investors will put money into a bubble, on the undertaking that they're better off pumping their money with everyone else caught up in the enthusiasm, then dumping their position at the peak of the buying hysteria. Of course, that means timing is very important. Wait too long, and you can lose your stake on a wildly overinflated bubble, and fundamentally, the people holding bubble stocks are buying them on the hope they can find someone gullible enough to buy the stocks at their now-inflated price.</p>
<p>So, how does a bubble pop? Why can't everyone just keep trading back shares and making more and more money? Because investments are still tied to real things, and if those real things cease to exist, then the investment becomes worthless. So, if you have $100 in ABC stock, and ABC announces that they're going into bankruptcy restructuring because they're deeply in debt, suddenly your $100 worth of stock is worth much, much less, because it turns out the company you own is about to not exist.</p>
<p>This is what happened in 2008, and 2001. In both cases, the underlying asset people had bought shares in simply disappeared. The borrowers defaulted on their loans in 2008, and the dot.com businesses which weren't making profits closed, and the securities backed by these entities were suddenly worth nothing.</p>
<p>If this is an isolated company that's folding, no big deal, right? The people who are left holding worthless paper get hosed, but everyone else is unaffected. But when this starts to happen a <em>lot</em>, suddenly people who've been spending money based on overvalued assets are struck with a reality-check are unable to make payments. So, after your $100 worth of ABC stock vanished, you responsibly decide to stop your subscription for company DEF. In the next quarter, DEF reports that their revenue has dropped, and the putative value of DEF has dropped because it's now a less profitable company. Now the people holding DEF stock cut some expenses, and reduce the revenue of company GHI, and so on.</p>
<p>What's important to recognize is that economies are <em>reciprocal</em>. They call it the economic engine, after all. Your income is my expense, and vice-versa. When we all stop spending money, we all stop earning money, and suddenly everyone's cashflow gets tighter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok imagine shares are celebrities. I buy Chris Pratt 10 years ago for $20 and sell him today for $20m as he's skyrocketed in demand. However I bought Kevin Spacey 10 years ago for $8 million but today he's worth 50Â¢.
The guy I bought Kevin from has $8m but he's had millions wiped off his value and is now worth pennies so I have something in my possession that has dropped massively in value. </p>
<p>Nobody has physically taken the difference in money away but the perceived worth has changed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
