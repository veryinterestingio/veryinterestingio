		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>By the time a movie appears in theaters, almost all the money has already been spent.  Poor performance would lead to cutting future advertising, but that's a small figure.  If it doesn't make enough, then the investors lose money.</p>
<p>The business impact is that future movie decisions will be colored by &quot;{Title} bombed at the box office&quot;.  Ideas get pitched, like a DC comics universe parallel to the MCU, and then get shelved when a movie does poorly.  Ideas that seemed unlikely, like a Venom movie family, get green-lit when a movie over performs.  Both of these effects are business effects, as investors use past performance to gauge future risk.</p>
<p>Sayings like &quot;Get woke, go broke&quot; are coined to label patterns in this profit landscape, and directly impact future investment decisions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Someone, almost always a large company, loses money. </p>
<p>In the case of a movie produced directly by the studio, this is easy to see. Warner Brothers wrote checks to performers, advertisers, CGI studios, best boys, etc. Those checks are cashed, and you can't claw back the money just because the movie did poorly. Independent movies are a little different because they're usually financed by smaller companies (or even individuals!) then sold to the big studios at film festivals. The small companies get back their money when they sell the movie. The big studios are hoping to make even more if the movie is a hit.  This is generally a good system because it spreads risk out - a big studio doesn't go bankrupt when one movie flops, it just covers with the profits from a different movie - while simultaneously funding small, creative movies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The producers, studio, etc who funded it lose money. But it's sort of like VC funding or stock market investing where your business model assumes a portion of investments will bomb/lose money and you make your profits on the 80% that don't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am not sure about the details about the US film industry, but films are in many ways similar to a start up. Films have a lot more initial cost than a start up, though. But this get funded by financiers and investors. So like any start up, the company makes the product, and investor might buy a stake in the company for future revenues, and or dividends.</p>
<p>Traditionally in the film industry one producer would sell one film to one studio. The studio would cover most of the production cost, the producer would secure the rights, and probably fund the development and a script. In the old days the studios would often own the production company, distribution and the cinemas itself. So naturally this was extremely lucrative.</p>
<p>Today is a lot more complex. Plus there are lot more companies involved, and is a way to spread the risk. This also ensures that most companies won't go under if a movie tanks. Not sure how common this is in US, but film projects can also get incorporated as special purpose vehicle which protects the parent company. And what is already pointed out is that the studios make enough money to cover their losses on films that bombs. Plus studios of course consider how much money the movie must make in order for it to not be a loss.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes people involved might get fired, or a major setback to their reputation. Directors, writers, producers might not get funding for their next project - or a more difficult time to do so. Studio execs might get fired. Publicly actors might also suffer a blowback to their career if they are regarded as box office flops.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
