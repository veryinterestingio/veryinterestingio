		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your nervous system is constantly processing input from all your senses, as well as internal processes (e.g. memory).  It is very good at recognizing patterns - when it notices that a certain pattern of input can lead to danger, it remembers that.  When that pattern crops up again, it can create a sense of unease - even if the logical conscious part of your brain hasn't noticed/made a connection.</p>
<p>Without your conscious brain even being notified, your body starts making preparations.  Adrenaline production might increase; your digestive system might be put on hold.  These subtle physiological responses are noticed by you as a &quot;gut feeling&quot; (incidentally, since your gastrointestinal system is so tightly involved in the process, it often really is a feeling in your gut).</p>
<p>Sometimes, the cues are wrong.  If you're at the zoo and you go into the insect room and look at a terrarium with 50 tarantulas in it, it might set off your physiological responses, even if consciously you know you're perfectly safe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another piece to this that helps explain the &quot;more often than not&quot; piece of your question has to do with some other things our brains are really good at...namely confirmation bias and motivated reasoning.  It's likely that you get that feeling plenty of times and absolutely nothing happens, but that feeling primes you be looking for something bad, so much so that you might interpret something as uncomfortable or dangerous even if you wouldn't have otherwise.  That's the motivated reasoning piece.  The confirmation bias piece comes in because you pretty unlikely to place any significance on that feeling when nothing happens...so you probably won't t remember it...but when you have that feeling and it turns out it was right, that feels pretty significant so you're more likely to remember it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain does A LOT of work behind the scenes that you might or might not know about. A &quot;bad gut feeling&quot; is the result of what your brain assumes a situation is. Your brain knows what a &quot;dangerous&quot; situation is. Say you are walking in a dark alley at night, your brain should send you a few red flags saying &quot;This ain't right&quot;. Your brain gets these ideas from movies or news articles you read, and subconsciously processes whatever info your senses give it</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On top of the other responses here, I'd like to add that as someone with anxiety, the gut feeling definitely isn't always prior to a bad time - it *is* the bad time. The same is true for people with post-traumatic stress disorder. Your brain doesn't just get used to identifying patterns that may precede something uncomfortable; it also trains itself to respond that way to progressively dissimilar situations if the initial event is traumatic enough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
