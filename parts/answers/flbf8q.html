		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see some people saying yes and this is not a supported statement. Your immune system is activated upon interaction with a pathogen or with the recognition of a non-self antigen. This means your entire immune system begins to rapidly expand and proliferate. At the beginning of an infection this is dominated by your innate immune system (complement, macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, natural killer cells, ect). At this same time this is occuring T and B cells are interacting with antigen presenting cells in your lymphatic system. When a T or B cell interacts with its cognate antigen (the antigen that corresponds to its T-cell receptor or B-cell receptor) it undergoes a proliferative burst. B cells will create plasma cells and undergo somatic hyper-mutation. At this point the adaptive response overtakes the innate response and remains the primary response until; containment, clearance or host death.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So no, your immune system is not weakened as a whole. What does happen is the survival cytokines and other survival signals are sequestered by cells who have an advantage, such as the T or B cells who recognize the pathogen. HOWEVER other cells are still around and if you had your immune system recognize multiple antigens at a given time, they would all receive the same signal and compete for resources.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Interestingly, this is why the theory that you can develop an allergy during an immune response exist and why some researchers are looking into using broad immune system activating events to combat cancers.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>TLDR; When fighting off an infection your entire immune system goes into overdrive. Once the adaptive immune system is fully operational it sequesters energy from other parts because it has so many things pushing its activation.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's difficult to generalize since there are so many variables other than the disease itself that can effect how your immune system responds.  Probably the only generalization that can be made is that the &quot;average&quot; person's immune system will work harder than it does at baseline to contain the disease.  Whether or not it becomes &quot;stronger&quot; or &quot;weaker&quot; at the time largely depends on a wide range of preexisting factors pertaining to the individual's overall health.  That said, if your immune system successfully fights off the disease, then it's generally safe to assume that your immune system will become stronger as a result.  This is based on tons of high quality evidence showing that immunity is built over continual exposure to the environment.  For example, a large study on polio that was conducted during the 1950's (if I recall correctly) found that poorer children tended to be more resistant than wealthier children.  The scientists concluded that the poorer children had acquired more immunity through increased exposure to their environments, whereas the wealthier children tended to live more isolated and sterilized lives.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both, in a way.</p>
<p>It 'improves since it is active' in that the immune response engages several mechanisms to get the defenses up and make them more efficient. For example, the swelling and redness you see around a wound is due to the body directing more blood (and therefore more immune cells) into the site of injury. </p>
<p>Similarly, the whole reason 'flu-like symptoms' are so generic is that a good chunk of the symptoms is caused by the release of natural antiviral defenses - and as a rule of thumb, antiviral immune response is basically the Spanish Inquisition of immunology, which is why you don't want it running full tilt 24/7.</p>
<p>On the other hand, an infection stretches the budget for immune system. You can only put so many new blood cells through the pipeline per hour, and the old ones keep getting decommissioned even <em>without</em> anything else killing them. Then you also need to replace the cells where either side caused some collateral damage. All of that takes up raw material - energy, lipids, amino acids...</p>
<p>Even a relatively mild infection means diverting some resources towards killing off the present threat rather than a potential one. On top of that, the defense mechanisms also have a cost attached. Fever is the most obvious example - it's running the metabolism overcranked, and shivering is trying to convert your muscle power into heat, which takes up some calories, and loss of apptetite is a fairly common sickness response - which means there's less energy to spare for training any immune cells to deal with any other issues.</p>
<p>So overall, it's improved in that it's primed to fight whatever thing is plaguing you right now, but weakened in that it doesn't have time to spare to deal with less immediate threats - that's why you get stuff like opportunistic infections.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
