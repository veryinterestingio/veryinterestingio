<p>As part of the depressurisation cycle the ISS quest airlocks use pumps to pump air from the airlock back into the station. The pumps reduce air pressure inside the airlock to 5 psi (34 kPa), 1/3 of that in the station.</p>
<p>This reduced pressure is used to test the EVA suits for leaks. The remaining air is vented to space prior to opening the airlock.</p>
<p>Ideally you'd want to pump all the air from the airlock into the station, however it is extraordinarily difficult to pump a vacuum to the point where it's just easier and cheaper to ship extra atmospheric gas up to the ISS than try to build, launch, operate and maintain a set of pumps capable of producing a near vacuum.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>My description of the procedure isn't correct. See u/ninelives1 post below.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey, so my (eventual) job is to actually assist in this process via ground commanding. I even had a sim where I had to do this just a couple weeks ago.</p>
<p>There are 2 segments to the airlock. The crew lock and the equipment lock. The equipment lock is a large drum shape and (nominally) is not depressurized. The crew lock is where the 2 EV (extravehicular) crew members go in their space suits for the depress. They close the IV hatch (between crew lock and equipment lock) and then the depress pump starts pumping air from the crew lock, back into the whole stack. This is easier for the pump at first, but it eventually slows down. At 5.0psi, the pump is stopped to do a leak check. Basically they see if there's a leak across the IV hatch which would be recognized by an increase in pressure in the crew lock. Once the leak check is passed, the depress pump resumes, but this time, a vent to space is initiated to assist the depress rate. You will start losing consumables at this point, but not all of it. At 2.0 psi, the depress pump is stopped entirely and the rest is vented out. At 0.5 psi, the EV hatch (to space) can be opened and the EVA can begin! </p>
<p>So tldr, we try to recover most of the atmosphere, but not all of it for practicality and time reasons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Small correction for the other comments here. They are mostly correct, except you won’t have any kind of dramatic decompression for any leaks.</p>
<p>Space has 0 atmospheres of pressure. Sea level has 1 atmosphere of pressure. It’s not like Alien where you’ll get sucked through a tiny hole.</p>
<p>It will be a light breeze.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The modern moon rover has an innovative system called a 'suit port', which greatly reduces air losses when transitioning in and out of the vehicle:</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/nPSbOsOJ9Ro?t=1m10s" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/nPSbOsOJ9Ro?t=1m10s</a></p>
<p>The astronaut slips into the suit from the inside of the rover via a door built into the backpack, then a pair of seals close: one attached to the suit and one hinged on the interior of the rover.  This reduces the amount of contaminants that get in and the amount of air that gets out and eliminates the need for an airlock, which is quite bulky.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was a fascinating piece in the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w13xttx2/episodes/downloads" target="_blank">13 Minutes to the Moon Podcast</a>, that said that the astronauts on Apollo 11 hadn't equalised the pressure between the Lunar Landing Module and the Command Module then they decoupled, resulting in a 'champagne cork <em>pop</em>' sending them off faster than planned and ending in the LLM landing off course. I presume that left them with less air overall?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
