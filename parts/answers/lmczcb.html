		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I went to jail and they obviously had to fingerprint me. We spent 30 minutes on my thumb because it kept coming up wrong. </p>
<p>I wasn't really paying attention until I was getting impatient. I asked why we kept doing my thumb over and over and she showed me the print. I realized it was picking up a scar from a slicer probably 10yrs old at this point. I turned my tumb over and showed her 'yeah that's just how it looks' </p>
<p>We laughed about the extra time spent trying to understand the glitch only to realize the glitch was on my finger. I did not laugh about jail though</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It will if you have some type of scarring, as those tissues (collagen) are not the same as the original skin tissues.</p>
<p>That said, it is fairly rare that your fingerprint is altered beyond recognition. I worked in corrections when I was much younger and the computers even then could get accurate matches off of even the most mangled hands.  We commonly fingerprinted people who worked in the poultry industry and whose hands had been bit, scratched, etc to a great degree. It does change their print but typically the pattern is still recognizable by the computer on a clear print. Possibly less so by human analysis.</p>
<p>I fingerprinted thousands if not tens of thousands of inmates coming in and out of our facilities and not once did I see the machine make an inaccurate match regardless of the damage. There were a few rare cases where it couldn't match an old record but they could analyze and update it manually if there was a problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a person born with a pretty serious skin condition (everywhere, but mostly on my hands; they are maybe 30-40% scars), it does. I don't have fingerprints in my passport because they're too faint. I was so happy when smartphones finally started using face unlocking :D</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
