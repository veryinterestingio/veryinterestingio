<ol>
<li>And why isn't electrolytic cell of water with some amount of H2SO4 in it used in Vehicles?! It literally releases Oxygen in the atmosphere and consumes water(the saltier the better).</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ten years ago the DOE had the Hydrogen Storage Center of Excellence, which was looking into effective ways to store hydrogen.  (A leading option for this was ammonia-borane.)  Ultimately it didn't go anywhere for a variety of reasons, but the world has changed and some of those reasons might not be applicable anymore.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>What do you expect to be the dominant storage technology for hydrogen?  Are existing storage compounds, like sodium borohydride, sufficient to meet the needs without further development or is there a need to continue the work from the Hydrogen Storage Center of Excellence?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How and why can hydrogen be more sustainable in comparison to electric in port operations? </p>
<p>AFAIK, for electric motors, there is an aprox. 15 % loss of energy associated with charging and using batteries due to AC/DC conversions. The losses for hydrogen are in the order of 65 % due to losses in electrolysis, compression, and DC/AC conversion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
