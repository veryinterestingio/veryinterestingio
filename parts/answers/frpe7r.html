		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you dissolve an ionic substance (like NaCl) you actually no longer have NaCl what you have are Na+ and Cl- floating around in the water.</p>
<p>Since these pieces carry a charge, they can arrange to conduct electricity.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>EDIT: Since people keep asking why salt water tastes salty:</p>
<p>Your salty receptors detect the sodium cation (Na +).</p>
<p>In fact if you have salt in your mouth, it's at least partially dissolved so it would be a more interesting experiment to try eat a block of salt with no saliva and see if you taste it( not that that's actually possible)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a solution (e.g. in water) you have individual Na and Cl atoms free to move around. They both have electric charge, and moving charges can produce a current.</p>
<p>In a solid crystal they are in a fixed arrangement so they can't move around.</p>
<p>If you heat salt so much that it melts you make the atoms free to move around and then it conducts electricity, too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a classroom (crystal lattice) with boys (negative ions) and girls (positive ions), they are all arranged to sit so that no boy or no girl sits next to each other.  Until break/recess comes they dare not move from their spots in the classroom.  However as soon as the bell rings (the classroom is dissolved) each boy and each girl carries a charge (they have a full bladder and need to use the bathroom).  The boys go to the boys bathroom and the girls go to the girls bathroom.  They couldn't take their respective charges where they were supposed to go when they were in the classroom (a rock salt lattice), but could as soon as they were dissolved (freed from the lattice structure) at the time of recess.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's due to the ability of sodium and chlorine ions to move around freely when dissolved (ripped apart) by water, and geometrically arrange themselves in a way for electron transfer to happen. In solid salt Na and Cl are bonded to each other; Cl has Na's valence in its house, and as such both elements are stable and happy. All elements seek happiness and chemical reactions is how they get there. Neither element has any need for orphan electrons from the battery. They're a married couple where Na was the single dad and Cl isn't looking to have kids herself. </p>
<p>The caveat is, if the voltage from the power source is great enough, a charge can flow through just about anything. Think of it as the force foisting orphan electrons on to married couples.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pretty sure it technically depends on what solvent you’re using. </p>
<p>But in water, NaCl breaks apart into its positive Na ions, and negative Cl ions. These positive and negatives ions allow for the conductivity of electricity. </p>
<p>Solid NaCl is a bonded molecule in a fixed arrangement, which doesn’t allow electricity to pass through as easily.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
