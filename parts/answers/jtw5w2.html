		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hold a piece of paper with a dot on it, at an arm's length. Look at the dot. Now keeping your eyes focussed on the dot, bring the paper gradually closer to your eyes. Your eyes will get crossed and you will feel physical strain. You know why? Eyes have muscles too. </p>
<p><a href="https://aapos.org/glossary/anatomy-of-the-eye" target="_blank">https://aapos.org/glossary/anatomy-of-the-eye</a></p>
<p>These muscles have to be exerted harder when you are focusing on something at a closer distance. The father away you look, more relaxed these muscles get. </p>
<p>Staring in the void is essentially looking into infinite distance, which relaxes the eyes. You are not focussing on anything specific so your lens is also not under stress. </p>
<p>Additionally, your brain is not registering anything specific, because this viewing is aimless viewing. So, it relaxes your mental faculties too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends what you mean by void, it's been used in several different contexts. If void refers to the meaningless of human existence (nihilism) then it can be really peaceful I find, taking cognicance of the absurdity of existence can also feel empowering. However if void is referred to as the dark side of the mind (analytical psychology) well that's downright f***ing terrifying.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What do you mean by that?  Not the call of the void? You just mean staring at a wall and such?  Not sure I'd call that pleasurable as such unless you're high or something.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
