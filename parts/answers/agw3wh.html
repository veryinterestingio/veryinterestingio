		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The biggest quadcopters are comparable in size to the smallest manned helicopters. A quadcopter is based on very different principles of control and stability from other helicopters. Ordinary helicopters have a set of rotors linked together to balance the forces and then change the pitch of the rotor blades for control. This is a mechanically balanced system as any variable unknowns like the rotor speed have an equal effect on all components. However a quadcopter is a mechanically unstable system that requires constant corrections by the electronics in order to stay balanced. This means that you need motors that have a very fixed speed and can change speed very fast. So quadcopters need special electric motors. You can not build a quadcopter out of any electric motor or out of a combustion engine because these can not be controlled in the same way. This creates some issues when you attempt to scale the design. If you look at bigger quadcopters you will notice that they usually have more rotors then the four classical rotors. This helps with the scale although you can not just mount a hundred motors on a helicopter without issues.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is efficiency.    </p>
<p>The best way to make an example of this, is to use model helicopters.  (becuase they're the best apples to apples we can do..)  The common size quadcopter is a 250mm quad.  That's roughly the same size as a 130 class helicopter.  Your typical 250mm quad has a &quot;few minute&quot; flight time.  On a very large battery.  Lets be nice, and we'll call it 5 minutes on a 25 watt hour battery.    </p>
<p>A 130 size helicopter will fly 7 minutes, on a 2.2 watt hour battery.    </p>
<p>So why is that?  All powered lift aircraft need to grab big chunks of air, and throw them at the ground.  Getting a good grip on the air, is really controlled by how big of a wing (rotor, prop, whatever..) you have.  The most efficient part of a wing is the part furthest from the tip, and moving the fastest.  Helicopters get this right, by having long blades, and few rotor tips.  Multirotors get it wrong, by having LOTS of tips, and short blades.    </p>
<p>I&quot;m making a very strong case, against multirotors.  And for carrying people, large loads, and doing many tasks, they are really awful.  And when you start building a multirotor to carry heavy loads, fly long ranges, or have good flight times, they start looking a lot like normal helicotpers.  EG: a popular thing with the quad community is to build &quot;long range&quot; rigs.  Instead of the typical 4.5 or 5&quot; props, they're swinging 7&quot; props, more than doubling their effective swept area.    </p>
<p>Helicopters, are also &quot;human controllable&quot;.  That is, a meatbag at the controlls can fly it well.  To fly a multirotor, you need computers doing the work for you.  Multirotors also can't autorotate.  &quot;Real&quot; Helicopters can become a glider, and land safely in the case of an engine out situation.  Multirotors, if you unplug the battery, crash.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From the RC perspective, the single rotor RC helicopters came before the advanced sensors required to automatically stabilize and hold position. Once the technology came, there was no motivation to add it since the main purpose of those helicopters was to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PptMrBFAO-A" target="_blank">deliberately unstable for 3D helicopter flight</a>.</p>
<p>Multirotor drones by design requires the use of sensors just to be able to be flown by humans. The early ones were just as unstable as single-rotor RC helicopters and required constant input from the human controller in order to remain stable.<br />
Then, since the sensor technology was already there, people added automatic leveling, where if you let go of the controls the heli would automatically orient itself.<br />
The next step after that was to add GPS functionality, so the heli would be able to automatically correct slight drifting and remain in a single place.</p>
<p>Basically multirotor RC helis had most of the tech needed for the automatic stabilization anyways, while traditional RC helis didn't and were primarily intended to do unstable 3D flying anyways.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short version, human sized quad-copters or quad helicopters:  </p>
<p>more rotors = more engines, higher fuel consumption, more difficult design, more construction materials required, higher overall mass that does not necessarily translate into being able to lift more, bigger then regular designs, many more parts to maintain, more overall costs and an overall greater risk of failures and risk of the whole machine failing and crashing as a result, as it only takes 1 out of 4 engines/rotors/load bearing arms to malfunction to send it crashing down. (You could compensate for the loss of 1 engine/rotor/arm, but only so much...), then there's also the issue with auto-rotation being non existent on a quad-copter amongst other more complex topics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
