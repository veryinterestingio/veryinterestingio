		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. To help better understand why, you have to realize that gravity is an equal force being applied vertically to the Earth. There are minor differences based on altitude, but essentially itâ€™s uniform. When you fire a bullet, it travels quickly horizontally and can be faster or slower depending upon factors like drag. But these are horizontal forces. Gravity continues to be applied vertically along its trajectory. The dropped bullet, being shaped the same as the fire bullet essentially, is also being affected by gravity in the same manner.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it's true.  Both bullets fall to the ground just as fast.  It's just that the one fired from the gun also travels horizontally for a long distance.  Of course, this ignores the effect of any lift generated from movement through the air, but that's not a huge effect on something like a bullet.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuhMWdHJq_U" target="_blank">Snipers need to correct for distance</a> (and wind, etc.) and they do that by firing above the target and understanding exactly how far the bullet will fall vertically before it reaches the target.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Essentially, yes. This assumes several things; that the ground is perfectly flat, that you fire exactly parallel to the ground, that you drop the second bullet when the fired one leaves the barrel, that the barrel does not rise until after the bullet exits, etc. But the ELI5 version is; yes. The bullet falls just the same, no matter how fast it's going, because it has nothing to hold it up.</p>
<p>EDIT: for those unaware, the &quot;etc.&quot; in the above comment means &quot;etcetera&quot;. As in, this list continues. Yes, there are a whole bunch more assumptions you have to make; there's a vacuum, the earth doesn't curve (because apparently &quot;the ground is perfectly flat&quot; didn't make that clear), that you're even on the earth (or another body with gravity), that gravity exists, that the bullet doesn't fly under a gigantic electromagnet that pulls it up, and also that the scarlet witch, professor X, and Jean Grey are otherwise occupied and not influencing the bullet with their magical brain waves.</p>
<p>SECOND EDIT: Since &quot;scrolling down&quot; is hard, and I keep getting this reply over and over, here's the deal; the fired bullet is traveling very fast...HORIZONTALLY. As in, sideways. That has no appreciable bearing on its VERTICAL speed or acceleration. That's the entire point of the illustration. The horizontal motion of the fired bullet is radically different from the horizontal motion of the dropped bullet, but the VERTICAL motion (AKA &quot;falling&quot;) is the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you hold two bullets up next to each other, and drop them at the same time they'll hit the ground simultaneously. I think everyone can accept this as true.</p>
<p>Now do the same thing again, but as you release one of the bullets give it a little nudge sideways as well. It'll land a little further to the side, but gravity will still act on it downwards exactly the same as the other bullet and it'll hit the ground at the same time again.</p>
<p>Now do it again, but give it a harder nudge. It'll land further to the side, but it'll still fall the same distance downwards in the same time. Keep increasing the sideways motion until you get to &quot;bullet fired from a gun&quot; velocity, and it doesn't change the amount that gravity is pulling on it, the distance it has to fall downwards, or therefore the time it takes to fall that far.</p>
<p>Assuming a bunch of simplified variables, the most immediately noticeable one is that you're *only* adding force sideways. If you're pointing the gun slightly upwards then the bullet will land later because it starts gaining height and then has to decelerate before falling further. If you're pointing the gun slightly downwards then the bullet will land earlier because you're adding downwards force on top of gravity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
