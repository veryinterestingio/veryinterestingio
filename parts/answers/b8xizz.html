<p>No direct measurements have been made of planets outside the solar system, but models of gas giants have been made which explain the GP data.  These models provide predictions for other planets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So the basis of astrophysics has to do with light.</p>
<p>Gasses of different temperature and composition absorb light that passes through them.</p>
<p>If you say have a star with a known spectrum of light, and watch as it passes behind the atmosphere of a planet, the gasses of the planetâ€™s atmosphere absorb some of the spectrum and you can do some dauntingly complex math comparing that to your baseline measurement and learn quite a lot, including the temperature of the gas and what it is made of.</p>
<p>Once the temperature is known you can use that to help calculate things like pressure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know how you can feel something is really hot without touching it?  That is infrared radiation, a kind of light.  By looking at planets with this kind of light, we know how hot they are!  </p>
<p>Heavy things have more gravity than light things, so satellites of heavy things go faster than light things.  We can watch how fast the moons of Jupiter move to measure how heavy it is!  Once we know how heavy it is we know how much gas is being pulled down by gravity, so we know how much the gas must be pushing back up.  Gas pushing on something is pressure!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
