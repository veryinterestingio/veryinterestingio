		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Until the patient has time to get to a hospital and get good diagnosis, it is hard for anyone in the field to determine (other than gross external injuries) what actually is the most urgent issue. The patient is actually the best guide (location of pain, what happened etc) to assist them for immediate treatment. They will often want to know if the patient has any existing conditions, allergies or on medication as this informs them what they should avoid.</p>
<p>In the case of head injuries and internal bleeding, in particular, there might be very little external signs. But if the patient cannot maintain consciousness or follow simple instructions, it might be indicative that there could be trauma and this needs more attention. </p>
<p>Once a patient loses consciousness, a large part of this feedback mechanism is lost.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also to add to the other comments, if the patient is actively <em>trying</em> to stay conscious and cannot, that tells us things vs the patient maybe resting their eyes or relaxing and falling asleep.</p>
<p>We want to know if you just lost consciousness, and how difficult it is to arouse you - be it vigorous shaking, pain, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Where I work we are allowed to give ketamine in our protocols for severe trauma (such as an extremity that is snapped in half or a severe burn patient) or pain that is refractory to morphine, fentanyl and toradol. Ketamine is a strong anesthetic that will sedate patients. So rendering a patient with a traumatic injury unconscious is sometimes a path we can go down. Although, yes, in a perfect world the patient would stay awake to help provide information to the healthcare team at the receiving hospital.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
