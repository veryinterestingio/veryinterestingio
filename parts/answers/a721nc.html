		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because if it's an outlier, that's how you turn forest fire problems into flood problems. </p>
<p>Every tree you cut down reduces the amount of water that the forest drinks.  Watershed designers bank on the forest drinking up rain before spilling into creeks and rivers. </p>
<p>Fire breaks are wide enough that they'll also create some natural drainage paths for the forest too.  So now the forest drains even faster when it rains, which means the trees remaining get have less time to drink the water they do have access to, making the forest even drier and more susceptible to fire. </p>
<p>Basically, it's not that simple, and might make the problem worse. </p>
<p>Edit: Drought can make flooding worse.  Grass and shrubs hold down topsoil and drink water.  Without water, they die and thin out, and stop holding the topsoil down.  When a rainstorm does come around, the water sheets off the soil, turning it into a mudslide which is also bad.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Someone already mentioned the increased commonality of fires. The other problem is, embers can carry through the air. In order to properly firebreak all of the residential areas in Fire Prone areas, they would need to deforest far more of the state than seems reasonable. </p>
<p>Not to mention, the deforestation would cause other long reaching problems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is currently a big part of the California's Department of Forestry &amp; Fire Management's plan; to improve safety by protecting inhabited areas, mostly through fire breaks and observation.  This was adopted as part of a cohesive state-wide plan for 2010, and reaffirmed for 2018.  Implementation is left to individual jurisdictions and varies from place to place.</p>
<p>&quot;Jurisdiction&quot; varies greatly - in many places, the critical location for a fire break is on private land.  While it's possible that California or the federal government could flex Eminent Domain and force landowners to surrender their land and/or clear trees, in practice this is avoided as much as possible.</p>
<p>Floating embers are the leading cause of structural damage from wildfires in California.  Fire breaks don't work great against embers.  In these cases, building resistant structures is a much better strategy; again, this is left to private landowners in most cases.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What needs to happen is prescribed burns. These fires are happening only because fire fuel loads have gotten rather large due to years and yeara of fire suppression of an ecosystem that evolved with periodic fires. If we return the system to small, intermittent fires, wildfires would be far less catastrophic and more easily contained to wild areas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
