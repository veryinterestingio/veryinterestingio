<p>That said, I always assumed it was the muscle strains and tendon stresses as anchor points grew away from each other faster than the muscle and tendon could keep up with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Skin stretching hurts. I was in a wheelchair for 4 months + 3 more months on crutches before I could walk again. The months of not using them plus swelling made the skin super tight on my feet, so I had to work on stretching my skin back out. Not just by moving my ankles, but moving around the skin on top of my feet too. I lost all of the extra folds of skin on the knuckles of my toes, so I had to stretch the skin on each toe back out to be able to bend them again.</p>
<p>Shit hurt.</p>
<p>Skin is pretty stretchy though. Before long it had stretched back out and doesn't hurt anymore. I'm sure moving around for the first time as a baby hurts too, folding our knees and elbows for the first time, we just don't remember it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
