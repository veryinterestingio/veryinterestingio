		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because our eyes only detect three colours of light: red, green, and blue.</p>
<p>When both red and blue light reaches our eyes but not green, we perceive it as magenta (a bright pinkish purple color).</p>
<p>When both red and green light reaches out eyes but not blue, we perceive it as yellow - but what is interesting is that things that reflect <em>yellow light</em> will stimulate both our red and green receptors as well (just not <em>as much</em> for the red receptor as red light would) so yellow light also stimulates the red and green detectors, hence why it looks yellow.</p>
<p>In short, there are two ways to see yellow - from actual yellow light (which is between the wavelengths most detected by the red and the green receptors) and also from a little bit of red light and a little bit of green light both being detected at the same time.</p>
<p>But there is only one way to detect magenta, since there's no magenta wavelength! The wavelength between red and blue is just the green wavelength, but if you are detecting both red and blue but <em>not</em> green, it can't be a really bright green spilling into red and blue! So it must be something else. As such, our minds blend the colours smoothly as we add or remove various amounts of each colour, and this necessitates a ring-like structure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many of the answers here are inaccurate. I'm not sure I can really explain it well but I'll try.</p>
<p>The important thing to understand is that vision doesn't start with the spectrum, it starts with the three types of cones. Spectral colors don't matter evolutionarily. There is no benefit to seeing a rainbow in any particular way. Colors are for recognizing ripe fruit and predators and such, and our color perception is adapted to that. The colors we see in the spectrum are a side effect of color vision that evolved for more mundane purposes. That's why they look so arbitrary and nonuniform.</p>
<p>Not only does the spectrum not matter, evolution doesn't &quot;understand&quot; frequencies of light at all. We have three different pigments that are sensitive to different frequency ranges, but the pigments don't know what they're detecting and the later stages of the visual system don't know what the signals they emit mean. All the visual system really knows is that the color information from the eye is &quot;three-dimensional.&quot; Within the brain, those three dimensions are interpreted as light-dark, red-green, and yellow-blue. The red-green and yellow-blue pairs suppress each other (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opponent_process" target="_blank">&quot;opponent process&quot;</a>), meaning that you normally can't see a mixture of red and green or of yellow and blue. But all other mixtures are possible: red with yellow, yellow with green, green with blue, blue with red. If you see similar amounts of red and yellow, you see orange. If you see similar amounts of red and blue, you see magenta, and so on. That's where the hue wheel comes from.</p>
<p>Every part of the hue wheel is equally real, or equally imaginary I suppose. Every hue can be produced by real light striking the retina. It happens that not all hues can be produced by <em>monochromatic</em> light striking the retina, but that doesn't matter because monochromatic light rarely occurs in nature.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because we donâ€™t perceive color as a linear spectrum, but in ratios of how much they excite our 3 different types of photo receptors. As wavelengths get shorter, color goes essentially from red towards blue. Where purple/magenta come in is when the receptors at the high and low ends of the spectrum are triggered but not the ones in the middle. This is how the color spectrum we perceive is able to wrap around on itself. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that they don't. Spectral colors are those made by pure wavelengths, for example a laser: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_color" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_color</a> In the picture there it's an edge of a color space. Everything else can only be made from a blend of wavelengths.</p>
<p>The color wheel is by blending the 3 primary colorants, whether they are pigment (subtractive, traditionally RBY, now CMY) or light (additive RGB).</p>
<p>It's like trying to put noise into a musical scale. What single note is a cymbal crash? They're different kinds of sound and thinking about something general into something specific doesn't work. In the case of color wheel vs spectrum, they're two specific treatments of something more general, called color space.</p>
<p>Confused already? Impossible colors exist too: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_color" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_color</a> &quot;supposed colors that cannot be perceived in normal seeing of light that is a combination of various intensities of the various frequencies of visible light, but are reported to be seen in special circumstances.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
