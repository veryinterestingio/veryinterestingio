		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't really have anything to do with their mass, but rather, with what forces they can experience. </p>
<p>Because photons experience the electromagnetic force they interact much more readily with atomic matter thanks to the presence of charged particles. Because neutrinos only interact via the weak force and gravity their interactions are much more rare, since those interactions <em>have</em> to be mediated by the weak force.</p>
<p>But of course, the particle's energy counts for a lot too. There are plenty of materials that are opaque to one wavelength of light but allow another to pass without much effect (my window lets through a lot of visible light but blocks most UV, and my door blocks visible light but doesn't block too much of the wifi radio frequencies!). When a neutron star is forming in a supernova the neutrino energies are so high and the matter so dense that the neutrinos are effectively 'trapped' until the neutron star can cool enough that it becomes transparent to the neutrinos. It just so happens that all the neutrinos that are flying through the earth right now are generally at such low energy that the probability of interaction is next to nothing for any given one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
