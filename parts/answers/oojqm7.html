Someone may be able to explain why it may be stronger for some people though still. I'm curious to know as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has everything to do with the concentration and absorption. When you smoke (anything), most of the drug does not absorb into your body, and is exhaled. Which is why you can get high on second hand smoke. When you eat a properly prepared edible (one that is prepared a low temp and uses oil or other agents that bond to THC) the amount of  THC that make it into your system can be significantly higher. </p>
<p>Also, there is no immediate effect. When you smoke, you get a near instant buzz, which allows you to moderate your intake better. You know when you've had enough, and can stop there. When you eat an edible, you don't know how high you're going to get until it's too late to do anything about it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what I have heard from other people's stories they're SUPER terrible at dosing. Had a friend that gave a bunch of edibles to people that were dosed at like 1 gram hash per person which is insane for people without tolerance.</p>
<p>I told him he was insane for doing that at the time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
