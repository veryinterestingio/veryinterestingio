		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pharmacy student here, transdermal drugs are made inside  lipophilic vehicles in order to pass through the skin lipid layers.</p>
<p>The transdermal drug delivery system (TDD) offers some advantages being that its non invasive and skips hepatic first pass effect and protects some drugs against degradation by the gastric acidity and enzymes.</p>
<p>There are also newer approaches for TDD which include electrophoresis, iontophoresis, thermal ablation etc</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So finally something I can answer. I work in medical polymers and personally work with transdermal patch manufacturers and supply them with the carrier adhesives.. </p>
<p>Only medications that have a sufficiently small molecule size can be transmitted through the skin because of skin barrier properties. This will rule out a ton of medications right off the bat because they’re just too big at a molecular level. Drugs that can be used have to be purified significantly to remove larger impurities in the drug manufacturing process. Purity levels often reach 99.99%. </p>
<p>Once the drug is purified ultra concentrated doses of these drugs are delivered in two ways</p>
<p>1- loaded into a medical adhesive polymer that has direct contact with the skin. The drug will dissolve out of the adhesive over time and be absorbed in the skin and body. This is less common because it can only apply to very specific drugs that have melting points similar to the body temperature and because the release timing is less precise only to drugs that don’t pose a risk of fatal overdose.</p>
<p>2- The more common method is to secure a reservoir of the drug behind a porous release liner. Release liners have different release times  based on the size and patterns of the pores. Once the drug passers through the release liner it enters the medical polymer adhesives which are in contact with the skin and then are absorbed by the body via body heat or direct transmission. (There is also a version of this where the release liner is a polymer matrix loaded with drugs and no liquid reservoir)</p>
<p>Fentynal patches fall into category 2  which is why it’s become a problem for IV drug users. There is a reservoir of ultra pure drug that they can easily access. If someone doesn’t dilute it properly then they run a very high risk of overdose and dying. </p>
<p>Hope this helped!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>IV fentanyl will be dissolved in some kind of physiological saline solution and thus won't be rapidly absorbed, a quick wipe and a rinse with water will be fine. If it were in something more lipophillic (think vaseline and paraffin based creams + ointments) then it would be absorbed more readily and you may see some getting into the bloodstream, though even then it would take some time.  </p>
<p>fun and relevant story with opioids, they can active histamine release (you've heard about the itching I'm sure) and during my undergrad degree we did a practical where we injected morphine subdermally and measured the size of the weal and assessed pain response in the area. We did the same with local anesthetics and some other drugs. I was the volunteer. It was weird to have my fellow students inject me, but it definitely made it all stick in your mind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pharmacy student as well, surprised no one has mentioned Fick's Law here.  </p>
<p>A huge part of how transdermal patches work is defined by drug concentration gradient and surface area.  Transdermal patches actually hold about 10x the drug that actually gets administered because there must be a steep gradient for it to &quot;push&quot; through the skin &quot;membrane&quot;. After the designed administration time, about 90% of the drug remains and actually gets discarded.  That's why there are specific safety considerations for patch disposal.  </p>
<p>Skin &quot;membrane&quot; thickness is a very important consideration as well.  Patches are specifically designed for controlled release at certain skin thicknesses, such as why scopolamine patches are designed for application behind the ear, where skin thickness is minimal. Conversely, most patches will have little effect if you put them on your palm or heel.  </p>
<p>Lastly, surface area is directly proportional to the drug getting absorbed.  This is why you see higher strength Fentanyl patches increase in size.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While some drugs can be suspended in lipophilic vehicles (like hormones), others can't.  The limits are a function of molecular size (i.e., molecular weight), net charge, 3 more things i can't remember.  Anyway, to facilitate transdermal application, manufacturers sometimes include DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) in the vehicle, which permeabilizes cell membranes.  Weight lifters are familiar with this trick:  they use it for steroids.  Or they used to, don't know if they still do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
