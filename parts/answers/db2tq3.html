It’s not intended to be a backup supply. It’s intended to maintain pressure on the lines. The water in the tank cycles often enough that stagnation should not generally be a problem. </p>

Edit: Setting aside your specific examples, remember this is ELI5. There’s no need to document every variation on my explanation. Also, I held a PE license in water resources, so I actually know what I’m talking about and have designed water, sewer and storm systems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>How does water stay &quot;fresh&quot; and not stagnant?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Water towers aren't just for storage. Most towns have their water systems set up so that the water in the tower circulates regularly. At peak usage times, the tower drains into the system to contribute to the supply and keep water pressure up. When usage falls off, the tower's pumps kick in and refill it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 day? That's it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Generally, they do hold enough to supply the town for an average day. I doubt that's a matter of regulation, although it could be. I think it's just a standard engineering practice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some of them look so small!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most water towers hold at least a million gallons. For scale, a regular sized bathtub holds about 80 gallons when full to the top. So the tower holds enough water to fill about 12,500 standard bathtubs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Stagnation can actually be a problem for some water tanks.  In general the chlorine in the water counteracts any negative effect of &quot;old water&quot; but some tank designs are a problem and the water doesn't get mixed enough so steps are needed to be taken to counteract the problem, these might include installing baffles in the tank for better mixing or setting up a program where the water is occasionally just dumped on the ground to refresh the tank.</p>
<p>There are regulations for how much water a town needs to hold in reserve for fires or emergencies, it's usually not a full days worth of water. The tanks are to provide pressure in the system button also regulate the demand during the day and night cycle.  The tanks drop during the day while people are up and using water and ate refilled at night when most people are asleep. The system I work in, the plants need to run 24/7 to provide water and if they would stop they would be out in a few hours.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
