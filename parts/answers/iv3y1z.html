		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’ve read about how glaciologists have found that undercut seawater is leading to much faster calving and glacier melt. How much have these processes sped up loss mechanisms in glacier fronts?</p>
<p>Your paper in Nature discusses how most glacial loss happens due to the retreat of glacier fronts. Is there anything we can do to mitigate this loss? Either technology or process wise. </p>
<p>Lastly, I’ve heard some climate folks worry about the effects of melting glaciers, specifically those in Greenland, affecting ocean currents. Do you think it is feasible for a melting event to destabilize  thermohaline circulation? What would the effects look like on the globe? </p>
<p>Thanks for doing this AMA and for all the work you’re doing with our glaciers!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
