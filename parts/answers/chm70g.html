		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for doing this! I just watched <a href="https://youtu.be/InSIuGRDh_c" target="_blank">this excellent talk</a> by Jesse Jenkins at the University of Pennsylvania which talked about how &quot;flexible base load&quot; is the missing piece of our future energy grid and how pumped hydro is one of the few technically feasible options we have. </p>
<ol>
<li>what's the average % energy loss from the 2 transitions? (electrical &gt; gravitational potential &gt; electrical). Wikipedia says 70-80% efficient, so 20-30%?</li>
<li>what's the average cost / GW of installed capacity and does this have potential to drop dramatically?</li>
<li>Are the \~40 reservoirs isolated enough that the transmission losses there and back are significant? For example, I live in Québec, which uses (I believe) 765kV transmission lines to move the enormous amount of electricity from the hydro projects in the north. Many of these travel 2000km just to get to Southern Québec, and must travel another \~1000km to get to the NE of the US which I assume would be the primary market for hydro storage in a future high % solar/wind continental grid. </li>
<li>what's the realistic upper limit of pumped storage capacity in the US, Canada, and globally? (is your 22GW the number for US?)</li>
<li>what is the biggest limiting factor for potential sites? based on the formula, stored energy is related linearly to both elevation difference and mass (ie. volume). They must be at a high altitude, with a natural basin to reduce cost (I assume). It is possible to say, pick a high mountain range and place dams in the gaps? Assuming such a geographically perfect site existed and wasn't ruining a national park), would the hydrostatic pressure at the bottom just render the entire thing too expensive? I think what I'm getting as is - does the ideal reservoir have a limited depth but a large surface area to maximize total volume?</li>
<li>I assume pumped storage is the best energy storage solution we have with current technology. Are there any others which are promising (sodium-sulphur for example?)</li>
<li>when you say capacity of 3GW, do you mean GWh or GW? if it's GW, what exactly does that mean? that the pumps at that site have the potential to absorb 3GW of extra generation (so 3GJ per second or 3GWh per hour?). If so, what is the actual energy storage (not per unit time) and why do you use GW instead?</li>
