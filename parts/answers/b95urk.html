		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I worked as a carpenter on movies in Toronto. One time a crew of 5 of us made a 'tank' for RoboCop2 I think it was. So we take a bread van and wrap the outside with MDF and stuff like that to change the shape and make armored windows that go up and down (sound effects and a guy inside pulling on a string.). Anyway what with the original vehicle (no motor) and the time and labor over 2 weeks the bill looks like this: pay scale 40 bucks  an hour per carp times five is 200 an hour times 8 hours is 1600 a day times ten working days is 16000 dollars. for the prop.</p>
<p>And the prop was towed down a road on a wire then let loose to crash. (Towing and crashing extra) all to make about three seconds of movie run time. An average two hour run time has about twenty five hundred of these 3 second sequences.</p>
<p>Take one: camera operator, focus puller, sound man, boom operator, best boy, director, assistants, grips, key grip, and a whole buncha others gotts to get it all together so the 'talent' can try to remember the lines, and not wink, blink, sneeze, say the wrong line, say the right line for the next scene, giggle at the line, forget the line, and all sorts of other shit goes wrong.</p>
<p>Take two. scene one. Rewind the people back to the start line rearrange the set, stuff like that and shoot it again. Most of a location shoot is a bunch of highly trained experts in their fields trying to arrange a very short amount of time in a string of similar scenes so that when glued together in the cutting room, the output looks like a single stream of seamless story telling. A well run film can average a fifteen to one ratio of bad stuff (15) to good stuff (1).</p>
<p>And that's just the making of the film, not the cost of a big star which could run to the millions and even percentages of the take. Then there is the marketing and distribution and other legal expenses.</p>
<p>Before you know it the cost goes way over budget. The star breaks an arm, the co-star is in a drunk tank and gets arrested for coke possession, the list goes on.</p>
<p>THEN nobody goes to the movie because - it sucks,</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>even if you paid all non starring persons only ...let's say $50k,  just have 20 people means you're spending $1mil.    teams can be 5-10 people or higher.  and senior level people aren't going to be making only $50k.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>-Every person working on a major film is very likely at the top of their field. That means big, big paychecks, and not just for the cast.</p>
<p>-Equipment costs can be in the millions.</p>
<p>-Cost of special effects, props, and sets is easily in the millions.</p>
<p>-Marketing costs millions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On most movie sets you're paying for experts in whatever field they're in. whether it's carpentry for building sets or makeup artists or lighting directors. And you're also paying for speed. if you have a job to do on a movie set you have to be ready to do it fast at a moment's notice. And then there's also advertising and paying the actors. And do to Union you have to feed everybody who's on the movie set</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
