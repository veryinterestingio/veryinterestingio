		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two different reasons. Lips are pinker than the rest of the skin because the skin is thinner and the capillaries are closer to the surface. This gives them a pinkish color. Nipples are darker because hormones are more concentrated in that location and this triggers the melanin in the skin to darken.</p>
