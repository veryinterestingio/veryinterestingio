		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's been a few years since my aerodynamics classes, but let me have a go at this one.</p>
<p>the climb props and cruise props are shaped differently, have different cambers and pitches. The different shapes give the props different efficiencies at different rotational speeds and altitudes. </p>
<p>Efficiency here doesn't mean efficiency on the engine, or how much thrust you can get for as low an RPM as possible. It means aerodynamic efficiency,  or how effective the props are in terms of thrust at different rotational speeds. (coefficient of lift / coefficient of drag kind of thing)</p>
<p>So green prop gives you the most aerodynamically efficient thrust at lower RPM while the cruise gives you more aerodynamically efficient thrust at higher RPM.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe the graph is the speed of the aircraft, not the speed of blade/engine.  At slower speeds the climb prop will be more efficient until the aircraft approaches a higher speed and then the efficiency drops off.  Similar for the cruise prop, it's less efficient at lower speeds, has peak efficiency at higher speeds, but will max out it's efficiency as you go faster and drop off.  Variable just keeps adjusting for max efficiency, so maintains a steady line.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe everyone else is correct in their assessments.
I'd equate the two props to gears in a car if that's easier to understand. The climb prop your low gear. It can spin fast and gets the plane accelerating quickly, but has a low top airspeed. The cruise prop is the overdrive gear. It isn't good for accelerating quickly, but gives you the high airspeed at a lower engine rpm.
<strong>edit</strong> Trying to takeoff with a controllable pitch propeller in a cruise setting (high angle, blade is trying to take a large chunk of air), the engine will get bogged down. Trying to cruise with a climb setting (low angle, blade is trying to take a small chunk of air) you'll over-speed the engine. Just like trying to accelerate a car in 6th or cruise in 1st gears</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I haven't read all comments so pardon me if this has already been answered, but I believe a few of your understandings are off.</p>
<p>First, your assumption about different rpm is wrong, and the plot you mention is showing efficiency vs speed (of the aircraft) not rpm (of the prop). Most propeller on variable pitch prop have a constant rpm and for that reason are called &quot;constant speed propeller&quot;.</p>
<p>What you need to know to understand what follows :</p>
<p>an airfoil (wing or propeller) has an angle of attack  (aoa) at which it is most efficient. Let's say it's 10 degrees, and the coefficient of lift (CL) over the coefficient of drag (Cd) is maximum. Eg a wing will give 20 units of lift for 1 unit of drag produced, that would be called finesse 20.</p>
<p>Anything below or above that angle of attack will decrease finesse. You can see how finesse evolves on a Cl/Cd graphic of any airfoil that you want. Efficiency is lift produced over energy spent, so that would be lift over lift + drag. Cl/(Cl+Cd).</p>
<p>At 5 degrees aoa, you wouldn't produce much lift, so efficiency is poor, at 20 degrees aoa, lift wouldn't be so good as air would hit from below the airfoil, and drag would be atrocious, this is called a stall. </p>
<p>Now... </p>
<p>Imagine a plane standing still with it's engine running. The air is still. The blade hits it from the side. At every point along the prop. And pushes it to the back of the airplane (and also gives it a bit of a twist due to the drag part of the propeller aerodynamics). So you would set your propeller at around 10 degrees. But then the air would move slightly towards your prop so maybe you would set your prop at 11 or 12 degrees to account for that. </p>
<p>Now if the plane is moving forward at 100mph. Let's say one point (let's call it A) of the prop moves at 100mph and the tip moves at 200mph. The air hits the blade in A at 45 degrees angle (100mph from the front, 100mph from the side, equals more or less 140mph from 45 degrees). And the tip of the prop would meet the air at a lower 30 degrees angle (100 from the front, 200 from the side).</p>
<p>To maximize efficiency, you would twist your prop so that every point along it's length hits the air at the best efficiency (10Â°). So at point A the prop would be twisted at 55 degrees, and 40 degrees at the tip.</p>
<p>Notice how the prop that had best efficiency for the stopped aircraft wouldn't even work because it would have a negative aoa (set at 11 degrees, air coming at 30 degrees or more) </p>
<p>So people had to adapt and choose a prop that would work best at take off/climb, or cruise. You could vary the speed of the prop along the speed of your aircraft but then you would lose engine efficiency which depends on rpm. So we made prop with variable pitch (aoa). The most efficientest bestest ultra mega prop would also have a variable twist because not the same twist is needed at low speed vs high speed but that is hellishly complicated to do because the forces on a prop are huge, and the improved efficiency would be negligible. </p>
<p>The second point is that you assume that the engine slows down and we require less power/thrust at cruise. But this is already a long reply and I'll continue only if somebody is interested.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
