		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bourbon is not that bitter, it’s actually very sweet for a liquor, much sweeter than say a rye whiskey or scotch. To be labeled as bourbon, the predominantly corn-based whiskey must be aged in charred oak barrels. The charring of the wood allows the alcohol to better absorb the wood’s flavors. In the charring process, it degrades the oak’s lignin (a polymer found in plant cells) into its three chemical components: synapealdehyde, syringealdehyde, and vanillin, which imparts characteristic vanilla flavors.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Provided the recipes aren't calling for the variety of vanilla called bourbon vanilla, which I expect they are, it's vanillin from the oak aging process, which is part of why bourbon milkshakes, which definitely are supposed to contain the liquor, are a good combo. If there's really these recipes calling for actual bourbon with vanilla, I don't know them, please share.
I used artificial vanilla extract, which contains synthesized vanillin, in place of pure vanilla extract when mixing it with chocolate because I believe vanillin enhances chocolate better than real vanilla, even though I never use vanillin in recipes that are actually vanilla flavored primarily.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think I saw a documentary on taste once where the chemical profile of two ingredients somehow match (or compliment each other).
Its done on a machine that takes the ingredients and displays their taste profile on a graph.
In their example they showed how blue cheese and chocolate work together.
It might be the case in your example</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bourbon is very sweet, not bitter at all.  Rum has a similar flavor profile, very sweet, you will almost always find vanilla flavors in both in addition to other spices.  Their sweetness and flavor complexity lends them both well to desserts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
