		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For some cancers-huge gains. For some, not much change, and gains in fits and starts makes sense as we have a better understanding of underlying biology.</p>
<p>B-ALL, a leukemia, is night and day different because of CAR-T cells, anti CD19 (Blina) and other antiB cell targets. For non ALCL T lymphomas...honestly not much different. Switch organs: glioblastoma is still usually a death sentence, but about a year. For some DIG/DIAs, a new drug taken daily nearly shuts down growth for many, and the drug is mild in its side effects.</p>
<p>I diagnose blood / bone marrow /lymph node cancers mostly; these are called leukemia or lymphoma or myelo/lymphoproliferative disorder. There are, give or take, 100 different types. This doesn't count ANY of the other organs in the body. Sometimes a new drug will work on...a dozen or two? Of them, but not all. </p>
<p>TL;DR: in general, there's improvements, but it's fits and starts. Cancer is DIVERSE.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depending on your definition of &quot;chemotherapy&quot;, absolutely! New immunotherapies and cell therapies are being researched and brought to clinic every day. The single largest group of new drugs that were approved this last year were biologics - modified antibodies that can target specific markers of disease.
There are new traditional chemotherapies as well with bigger therapeutic windows - less toxicity with more therapeutic effect. The field as a whole is exploding in research.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chemotherapy has changed in the sense that we give less of it, as there are more targeted options for therapy (focuses on molecular alterations of tumors instead of where the tumor originated) in several cancers and immunotherapy (teach the immune system to fight cancer as it's supposed to do naturally) has taken the cancer treatment paradigms by storm.</p>
<p>The biggest change in terms of true chemotherapy is improvement in the anti-nausea medication combinations we use. They make chemotherapy much better in terms of tolerance.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chemotherapy can be a broad term but cytotoxic chemotherapy (the kind that just kills a ton of cells and hopes to get more cancer cells) is still around and generally just as crappy to go through. The big change is that now many kinds of cancers and mutations are able to be treated with newer drugs that are less toxic. Immunotherapy drugs use a patients immune system to fight cancer and while they do have a side effect profile it’s generally much better than classic “chemo”. Additionally there are a lot of newer drugs targeting specific mutations in specific populations of cancers that have far fewer side effects overall. Basically classic chemo where your hair falls out is still around and still sucks but there are now way more cases where you can use something other than these old school chemo agents. Cancer therapy is wildly variable by kind of cancer and specific mutations within kinds of cancer so it’s very hard to make more than general statements.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cancer researcher here. It depends on our knowledge about genetics and epigenetic regulation both on personal and population levels. Chemotherapy is non-specific, works by damaging the DNA of both tumor cells and the stroma. Usually, the DNA repair mechanism will try to fix the damage of both tumor and stroma. However, if there are key genes/molecules that would prevent the DNA being repaired then chemo would &quot;work&quot; meaning survival rates would be longer. Such as what happens with brain tumor patients who have MGMT methylated if they are given temozolomide. Their survival rates are much higher than non-MGMT methylated patients. This is because MGMT expression controls DNA repair and the absence of expression through methylation, helps tumors cells undergo cell death. </p>
<p>So to answer your question - yes and no. It depends on our genes and tumor microenvironment including the role of immune cells.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
