		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Hawaiian Islands sit above a persistent hot spot in the Earth's mantle where magma easily melts through the crust to reach the surface. In fact, the island chain exists because the tectonic plate is moving over the hot spot. The big island is where volcanoes are presently depositing new material, but as you move away, the islands become dormant and smaller, because time has eroded them away.  A new island will eventually displace the big island of Hawaii as the location of active volcanism over the hot spot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of the volcano as a sewing machine needle (upside down) and the pacific plate as the cloth. The volcano stays still and the plate moves over top of it as it periodically punches its way through and reaches the surface to create an island. Since the Hawaiian island chain trends NW then takes a bend and trends N then that means the plate was once moving N and then abruptly changed directions and started moving NW.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ALOHA! :)</p>
<p>Not only do we have earthquakes - we have three types of earthquakes!</p>
<p><strong>Volcanic</strong> - the magma is moving inside the volcano - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc9hM08uscM" target="_blank">Kilauea</a>, Mauna Loa, Hualālai (for example).</p>
<p><strong>Tectonic</strong> - the land itself is on a number of faults on the Pacific Plate - most well know is probably the Hilina Fault. (<a href="https://www.iris.edu/hq/inclass/animation/hawaiian_islands_origin_of_earthquakes" target="_blank">Amazingly good video here</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Mantle</strong> - this is due to the &quot;settling&quot; of the &quot;weight&quot; of the islands on the Earth's mantle.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The difference between the earthquakes can be determine by triangulating sensors that measure the depths of the earthquake.  Surface earthquakes are usually related to the movement of magma (usually lower magnitude as well).  Whereas the 2006 (6.9) Kiloho Bay earthquake was the result of a mantle one and the 1975 (7.9) and 1868 (7.7) earthquakes were tectonic ones.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you think about it, this means that there's a sub-structure system where hot spots remain stable and stationary while the tectonic plates move over them.  </p>
<p>What's down there that's hot enough and stationary that's causing repeated holes/volcanoes to form as the plates move above it?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
