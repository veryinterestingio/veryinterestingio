<p>In relative terms, the size of a human is about 1 m, the size of the Planck length is about 10^(-35) meters, and the size of the observable universe is about 10^27 meters (about 92 billion light years), so in relative terms we're closer to the size of the observable universe by a factor of almost a billion.</p>
<p>Put another way, there are far more Planck lengths in a human than human lengths in the observable universe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We could convert everything to meters and compare the numbers</p>
<p>One plank length equals to 1.61605x10^-35 meters</p>
<p>And 93 billion light years equals 8.798×10²⁶ meters</p>
<p>An average human male's hight is 1.7 meters (and 1.6 for women)</p>
<p>This way we can come to the simple conclusion that, one human is 35 orders of magnitude bigger than one plank lenght, and 26 orders of magnitude smaller than the diameter of the observable universe</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Answering directly to your question (in terms of orders of magnitude and fixing our unit to meters)
Observable universe has a size of the range 10^26 (number with 26 zeros) while planck length is in the order of 10^-35 (or 35 zeros after the decimal the decimal place before first significant digit appears).
So from what i understood from you question (maybe i understood wrong), Humans lean towards the size of the universe.
Or in other words two humans start shrinking and expanding at the same time and rate. The one expanding will reach the size of the observable universe before the shrinking guy reach planck length.
I hope this helps</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

However, IIRC, the living cell is not the geometric mean between the Planck length and the observable universe, it is the geometric mean between the Planck length and the dark energy fine structure constant (or something like that, I believe I am phrasing it incorrectly).  </p>
