I am reading that the virus size is large and droplets in the air fall to the ground or surfaces quickly, so it's not as contagious as if the virus were smaller and would stay in the air longer.  </p>
<p>Are people correct in saying this is very contagious? What is correct?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
