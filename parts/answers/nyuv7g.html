		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body's respiratory system does not just suck air in and push air out, it also regulates the amount of flow on those two activities because your air filtration system is only efficient at certain flow rate, so if you inhale while air is being blown at you your body will try to limit the speed of air flow proportional to the speed of the air being blown at you by involuntarily resisting how fast you suck air and it will make you feel as if inhaling is hard.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your diaphragm contracts and relaxes to let air in and out of your lungs. Ambient air pressure is what allows air to be driven into your lungs. According to the Bernoulli principle, air moving with speed has a decreased static pressure, so the faster the air is moving, the more your diaohragm has to work to inhale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mammalian Dive Reflex is a set of body responses that happen when the body thinks it's going underwater. Part of this reflex is stopping you from inhaling so you don't drown. The air blown on your face briefly fools your brain into thinking you are going underwater.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
