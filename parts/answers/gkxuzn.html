		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're called Moiré patterns <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern</a></p>
<p>It's caued by the interferance pattern between the pixel grid in your camera's sensor, the pixel grid on the screen your photographing and the pixel grid on your phone's screen (which is why they change when you zoom)</p>
<p>If you take a picture of window screen or other regular square pattern you can see the same thing. You can even see them in the real world by looking through two layers of wire screens (an apropriate distance appart)</p>
<p>(The reason they're curved is because different parts of the monitor are different distances from the camera sensor so the interferance frequency changes .)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’ve recognized this as a moire pattern but what I still don’t understand is why the pattern doesn’t change when I use my phone’s accessibility zoom feature. It only changes when I pinch zoom the whole image. And it only started happening with this new monitor I got (an HP Omen with 1080p and 240Hz) </p>
<p>It had me wondering if my phone was introducing a fourth “grid” in software. Maybe having to do with resolution scaling while I zoom the image. </p>
<p>I’ve always found moire patterns to be incredibly fascinating and moderately infuriating to deal with</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, I was going to say that the screens refresh rate (usually  60 cycles per second) differs from your shutter speed (for video) and a still image simply catches the screen refresh mid cycle.
If you need to film an image for video, set the shutter speed to 60fps and it should look seamless.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
