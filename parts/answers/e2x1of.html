		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Liquid is just a consequence.
When something is wrong, your intestine starts pushing stuff faster through itself in order to get rid of it as soon as possible. Usual culprits are food that went bad (potentially poisonous), food you cannot correctly digest (that should not stay there or will ferment and imbalance your gut bacteria), bad digestion (so that the food reaches the intestine with too much acid).</p>
<p>These are the culprits for pain: they all irritate the intestine walls.</p>
<p>Regardless the cause, poop forms from the stuff that leaves the stomach by moving slowly through the intestine, so that it has the time to leave water behind. If the process is faster, because you have diarrhoea, this does not happen, poop doesn't form and your feces are liquid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If the acid in your stomach can't come up.. It goes out the other end. And it frigging burns. Liquid shit tends to have a high acid content. If your asshole is still burning after a nasty shit, it's because the acid is literally still on your butthole. Use a wet wipe to remove it and stop the pain.</p>
<p>I'm on medication to reduce how much acid my stomach produces to reduce reflux (acid coming back up and burning away your throat). But you can also treat it by making your stomach empty faster.. Well I learned the hard way well that also just fires all that excess acid out the other end. Ouch.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like most people have mentioned, how quick it passes through and the acidity plays a big part. When things pass through too quickly, proper absorption of water and nutrients don't occur. Your intestines and bowels are incredibly sensitive. The best poops get stays in longer enough to be solid but still soft enough. It also gets coated with muscus for a smoother exit (Natural reverse anal lube). When the poop stay in too long, it's drier and that why it hurts when you are constipated. Too fast and liquidy, there is not enough mucus and structure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
