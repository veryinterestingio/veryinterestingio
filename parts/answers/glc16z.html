		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most last names come from people who had never thought of themselves as having a last name being asked to pick one. When asked to make up a last name, people typically choose an occupation, or some defining feature of their appearance or location.</p>
<p>Black likely comes from Blacksmith</p>
<p>White from Whitesmith, someone who works with tin</p>
<p>Gray and brown come from hair colours</p>
<p>Green likely comes from a variety of different sources, perhaps someone lived in the village green, or a has a penchant for green clothing.</p>
<p>Blue didn't really feature in people's lives much back then, so wouldn't have been good way to identify someone.</p>
<p>And &quot;orange&quot; wasn't even a word in old English, around the time most last names were defined.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
