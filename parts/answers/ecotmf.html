		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It can do so in the most straightforward method which is to borrow directly from banks or other lending organizations.</p>
<p>More commonly, a government issues bonds or notes. These bonds or notes promises a certain payment in the future. Essentially they are promissory notes (ie lend or 'invest' in me money now and I will promise to pay you back in the future')</p>
<p>There are also ways that are sort of like debt - for example getting another group some kind of rights (mining, logging, or oil extraction) in return for cash or infrastructure development. </p>
<p>All debt is just a concept of getting something of value now and giving a promise to pay that back (in kind or other forms) at some later date.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>That's how the government gets into debt and that's how they sustain it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your question is complex because &quot;debt&quot; means something very different to governments than to regular people, and gets people confused. Further, &quot;a government&quot; conflates very different financial situations governments can be operating in, which radically changes what debt means to them.</p>
<p>Consideration #1: is it a fiat currency system, controlled by the government in question? The US federal government is, whereas none of the 50 states are.</p>
<p>While you or I can go broke, the US federal government literally cannot go broke unless the government specifically chooses to. It does not have a piggy bank, nor a checking account, like we might. It's better understood as simply destroying money it receives in taxes, and creating money it issues when it wants to pay for things, such as federal employees' salaries. None of that creates debt, even if money is being taken out of the economy faster than put in (deficit spending, an unrelated concept).</p>
<p>100% separate from this, the federal government might choose to manipulate the amount of currency and economic activity in the US economy. A main tool for doing this is through treasury bonds, which is where we get to the US federal government and debt. Like before, these bonds can always be paid, 100% of the time, no matter what, unless the government chooses not to, for some arbitrary reason. A bond is a financial instrument that is sold on the market at some price, and eventually matures and gets converted into issued currency. Between its initial offer and maturity, it can be traded around, even bought pre-emptively by the federal government itself. Whoever holds the bond, the federal government is in debt to. People selling the bonds early is no big deal, and there's not really any such thing as the bond holders demanding their money early - that's a weird thing people say but isn't even a hypothetical problem.</p>
<p>That's what debt is like for the US federal government, which has a fiat currency it controls. So what about governments without that?</p>
<p>US states and local governments actually are a lot more like a regular person or household. They can't issue currency, and they do have money hopefully saved up in reserves. Running out of money is an actual possibility, and being tight on money happens regularly and causes all sorts of havoc sometimes. If they don't have the money, they can't do projects or pay salaries.</p>
<p>Just like people, sometimes it's worth it to borrow, and governments can issue bonds. (issue = create). All governments have their own proceedures for what makes this possible, but the general idea is if a bond is approved, the bonds get sold, and will eventually mature into a cash payment. But unlike the federal government, states need to actually have collected the specific money to issue in bond payments, such as through revenue from taxes, or if needed, issuing another bond. They do not automatically have the ability to pay them, like the US federal government. That said, it's still generally a good idea to use bonds to grow an economy faster than the interest rate of the bond.</p>
<p>What other ways do governments go into debt? Being weak or corrupt, when your neighbor is predatory: an example of China and its neighbors.</p>
<p>China is powerful compared to Malaysia. China offering to develop a Malaysian port sounds great at first, if you're Malay or an official benefitting from making the deal. But the deal is a contract with teeth. When it becomes more and more apparent that this whole project isn't going to materialize into something real and profitable for Malaysia, it becomes clear the powerful China will seek to get their due, even if Malaysia has not benefitted. This kind of situation, specifically with China, has been coming up, and is akin to owing a debt, though sometimes that debt is paid in ways such as leasing land or other political favors.</p>
<p>When a country is economically strong, it is less vulnerable to predatory deals that create this kind of debt. And likewise, the less there are corrupt officials looking to line their own pockets at the expense of their own people, the less likely they are to accept bad deals such as these.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the simplest, truest answer is that they don’t.</p>
<p>In a fiat currency system, government spending creates money. Taxes destroy it.</p>
<p>They can’t go broke, but they can mismanage the currency. Which would cause the currency to lose its value (hyperinflation). As long as this does not occur, they can print as much money as they like.</p>
<p>Keep this in mind the next time someone asks of any government policy: “How do we pay for it?” The answer is simple: we create money, by fiat. The question is: are there enough resources in the private sector for the money to buy?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
