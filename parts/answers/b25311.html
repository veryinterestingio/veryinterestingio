		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body goes paralyzed (atonia) when you're sleeping, basically to prevent you from punching a wall when you reach for a cup in your dreams. You also decrease blood flow to your extremities when sleeping, decreasing the available energy to them. It takes a little while to get the nerves to send full signals to the body after sleeping. They don't know exactly what the mechanism is that causes it though. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>All your joints have a jelly like substance called synovial fluid. When you are sleeping, the coolness of the air and lack of movement causes this fluid to thicken and so you feel the resistance of that thickened synovial fluid when you move your joint for the first time. This issue can be exacerbated if you have certain disorders like hypothyroid or arthritis, which also means your joints become inflamed during the day and stiffen up as well as less joint tissue to produce the lubricating synovial fluid in the first place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Copied from another thread I answered:
When we sleep, we release neurotransmitters called GABA and Glycine. These chemicals in our brain are thought to induce sleep paralysis. When we are in deep REM sleep, these chemicals basically stop our brain from sending signals to our muscles and causing us to be paralyzed in our sleep. This is so that when we dream, we are not moving and hurting ourselves. If you wake up during or immediately after REM sleep, you still have these chemicals lingering in your brain even though you are trying to fight against it. This makes it difficult to perform strong muscle actions like making a fist. After a while though, you should be fine. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
