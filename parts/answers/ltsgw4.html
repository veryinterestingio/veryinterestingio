		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The electricity spreads in all directions. The further you are away from the hit the less current reaches you. At the entry point several million Ampere hit the water. But just 1 meter away the same current is already spread over an area of 6.28m² (half a sphere with radius 1) and that area grows quickly so only a small fraction of the current hits you when the further you are away.</p>
<p>In a pool you can't be far away from the lighting strike, so you better leave the water.</p>
<p>Also the smaller you are the less of the current hits you, so small fish survive more easily than a human.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ocean is pretty big.  A pool is pretty small.  Plus, the stuff in the ocean tends to be underwater, whereas you in a pool need to go above water.</p>
<p>When lightning strikes a pool, the water gets heated up a lot from the electricity.  The ocean doesn't get heated in the same way because there is a lot more water to absorb that energy.</p>
<p>Lightning tries to find the best path to Earth.  This often involves striking something higher, like a building or statue.  If you stick your (wet) head above the water, it becomes an ideal path for the lightning to go through as it's a slightly shorter distance.  But aquatic creatures are underwater, so aren't extra-likely to get hit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The electrical charge dissipates (spreads out and gets weaker) after it hits the water - it's only really dangerous within about 50 metres (150 ft) on the surface of the water. A pool is generally smaller than 50m, so anything in the pool is at risk.</p>
<p>The ocean is MASSIVE, though, so most fish and animals will be far enough away to be safe. Any fish that are too close to the lightning strike will die, it's just that there won't be many of them in the danger zone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>your body is 60% salt water in a mostly freshwater pool.  Salt water is far more conductive than fresh water.  In a fresh water pool YOU are the path of least resistance..</p>
<p>Your head, sticking out of the water, is the highest spot in the pool.</p>
<p>Then after the blast, your stunned probably unconscious body is floating, probably face down, in a large pool of water that you can't breath in.</p>
<p>You will probably survive the lightening strike...... Then drown...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
