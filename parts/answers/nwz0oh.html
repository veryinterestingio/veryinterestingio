		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Military aircraft are equipped with radar warning receivers (RWR) which works just like a radar detector people put in their cars.  Radars work by transmitting a pulse of radio waves and waiting for the echo.  Based on the frequency of the pulse and the pattern it pulses at it can make a guess as to what kind of jet or surface radar it came from.  If you're an american F-16 and you hear the pulse from a french rafale you can assume he's not trying to shoot you down.  If you hear a pulse from a russian bult SU-27 you can assume it's not friendly.</p>
<p>When you lock on to an enemy jet the pulses coming out of your radar are much more frequent so you can assume the enemy pilot is trying to shoot you down.  Once the enemy has you locked up and fires a missile at you, if your jet is equipped with missile waring system (MWS) it can detect the flare from the rocket motor and warn you there's a missile inbound.  Not many jets are equipped with MWS though.  If it's a heat seeking missile you have no warning besides that; active radar guided missiles will have their own radars inside, once it's close enough the radar inside will turn on and you will get another warning once your RWR picks up the missile's radar.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you're in the dark with a flashlight. You're looking for someone, but you don't know what direction they're in, so you wave the flashlight around. </p>
<p>This is kinda like a normal radar sweep. you might see someone, but it'll be a second before you see them again, as your flashlight eventually comes back to them.</p>
<p>When you see someone you want to &quot;track&quot;, you point your flashlight directly at them (or, in the case of radar, you waggle your flashlight over a very small area)</p>
<p>But now imagine you're the one being looked for. If there's someone with a flashlight looking for you, they'll be waggling their flash light all over the place. It might pass over you once, but if it keeps going, it's probably just a normal sweep. If, however, if they start pointing the flashlight directly at you, and ignore everything else, it's pretty safe to assume they've got a lock.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Radar works as a transmitter that emits microwaves and is reflected back to the missile and it follows the reflection. So the aircraft have microwave receivers that detect when it is illuminated by a radar.</p>
<p>You can compare it to old searchlight where the crew can use their own eyes to see that they are being tracked. The radar warning is just it another frequency.</p>
<p>You tend to use different frequencies microwave frequency for detecting them with radar and for guiding a missile. It is about how excited you know the position vs how easy it is to scan large areas.
So the aircraft look at the frequency of the signal. So it can warn the pilot when a radar used to guide weapons is illuminating the aircraft.
An enemy radar lock on you is when they continually illuminate you with a radar beam.</p>
<p>So you can detect a radar-guided missile because there is active radar illumination of the target aircraft.
You can detect a heat-seeking missile the same way because it is passive and looks at the heat the aircraft emit by itself.</p>
<p>You can have a system on the aircraft that tries to spot a missile regardless of the guidance system.
They do not detect a missile that has locked onto you but look for a missile itself by detecting the IR or UV light the missile's rocket engine detects when it is launched. That is like if the pilot looks out of the aircraft and sees the missing getting launched but in a different frequency.</p>
<p>You can also have radar on the aircraft that detect enemy missiles by sending out microwave and there it getting reflected back</p>
<p>Missile launcher warning system is newer technology then warning for radar locking</p>
<p>You can have a radar-guided missile that uses an enemy radar and fly towards it. It is used to attack ground-based radars for air defense systems but to my knowledge not against enemy aircraft.  It is relatively simple to defend against, you just turn off your own radar.
That is good enough against the air defense system because if they can see you they can't fire at you, that is like they were not there in the first place.
It is not that useful against an aircraft, a attack aircraft can still fly with radar off to the target.</p>
<p>So you can get a missile launcher warning for any missile type but only a missile lock warning for radar-guided missiles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>depends on the missile. For a heat seeker, no you get nothing because there is no way to know. A heat seeking missile is totally passive. </p>
<p>For radar guided missiles you do get some warnings. The plane that is being attacked has radar detectors that let the pilot know they are getting hit by radar.
Now it's important to know that all radars are going to be a bit different. i.e a search radar vs fire control radar, vs the missiles own radar, assuming it has it's own not all do, look different to the detector. Fire control radar and the missiles own radar are what is actually used to guide the missile in for a kill. So when the plane is getting hit by fire control radar or the missiles radar you will get an alarm telling you that. These warnings do not necessarily mean you have been shot at, only that the attacker has you locked up and can shoot at any moment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
