		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The series of small bones and muscle situated behind your ear drum protect your audition by tensing up when exposed to loud sounds, and relax when they are not. Furthermore, the way sound is perceived happens mostly in the brain, which has a very complex way of handling sound that is dependent on a lot of factors (psychoacoustics) so yes your perception changes a lot if you're concentrated, rested, in a quiet environment, what kind of sound... There are different well known effects such as frequency masking (loud low frequency sound &quot;muddle up&quot; your perception of higher frequency content) and plenty others. It's quite complex.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some misinformation here.</p>
<p>First, the acoustic reflex. It is true that for most people, two muscles in your middle ear space flex when exposed the loud sounds, pull the middle ear bones inward and reducing the level of sound that gets transmitted to the inner ear. Is it protective? Maybe, but not very much. First, it’s frequency dependent, and most people don’t have the reflex above 4 kHz. Second, it decays, and releases after 10-20 seconds. Lastly, the effect is small, on the scale of 3-5 dB. The pain you get after noise exposure is not due to this but to excitotoxicity in the inner ear. </p>
<p>More specific to your question, the biggest adjustment our ears make to sound level happens in the cochlea, where outer hair cells modulate the level of neural transmission based in the input level of the sound. At very low levels, out hair cells are highly activated, essentially amplifying the signal on its way to the brain. It’s compressive, so at high levels the outer hair cells are much less reactive. This affects not only threshold and level perception, but also filtering, so at lower levels we are much better at picking out all the different frequency components of a sound than at high levels.</p>
<p>As mentioned, there are many other nuances to auditory perception- masking, squelch, masking release, streaming, object perception, localization, figure ground. All of these things depend on the signal and the hearing status of the listener. It’s interesting and complex stuff!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes!  Look up the worlds quietest room.  It is so quiet that a human starts to hear their own bodily functions, like digestion and it gets so loud that people can’t stand being in there.  People try to set records for how long they can stay in there.</p>
<p>Edit: digestion not gestation.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can open my estachian tubes, which equalizes pressure, and I hear it as crackling sounds. </p>
<p>I can also &quot;flex&quot; something inside my ears that attenuates sound quite a bit. It feels exactly like when you yawn and can't hear so well, and I typically also hear a tone (maybe an E or F above middle C) while I'm deliberately flexing it. In fact, even if I'm not tired, doing this long enough will induce me to yawn.  Yeah, physiology!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I worked in a daycare center while in college in the infant room. Infants sleep a lot, and we preferred it when they slept longer. By far they did so when there was a lot of ambient noise. They would wake up far earlier if it was effectively quiet and then some minor noise occurred. More noise was better for them sleeping longer by far. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
