<p>TL:DR<br />
&quot; An epileptic girl with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome had seizures triggered specifically by blinking, but not by other eye movements or by photic stimulation. Electrographic and clinical seizures were most reliably precipitated by repetitive blinking produced voluntarily on command, by reflex blinking on corneal stimulation, or by psychogenic triggers of blinking such as social stress or cognitive effort. &quot;  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tl;dr: Probably, but Photosensitivity would predispose self-inflicted seizure less than some other conditions such as emotional/musical/sleep deprivation sensitivity.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>from <a href="https://UpToDate.com" target="_blank">UpToDate.com</a> &quot;Some patients with epilepsy tend to have seizures under particular conditions, and their first seizure may provide a clue to their so-called seizure trigger. Triggers include (but are not limited to) strong emotions, intense exercise, loud music, and flashing lights [<a href="https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-the-first-seizure-in-adults/abstract/15,16" target="_blank">15,16</a>]. These triggers are often experienced immediately before the seizure.</p>
<p>Other physiologic conditions such as fever, the menstrual period, lack of sleep, and stress can also precipitate seizures, probably by lowering seizure threshold rather than directly causing a seizure. As a result, the temporal relationship to the presenting seizure is often less clear. Triggers may also precipitate nonepileptic paroxysmal disorders, especially syncope.</p>
<p>However, the majority of patients with epilepsy have no identifiable or consistent trigger to their seizures. In addition, triggers are the sole cause of epileptic seizures in only a very small percentage of patients.</p>
<p>Photosensitivity is a relatively uncommon seizure trigger, although it occasionally receives heightened attention in relation to particular television shows or video games.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
