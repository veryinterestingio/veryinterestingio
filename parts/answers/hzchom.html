		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fiber Optics has much higher range and deep sea cables are made specifically for the that purpose, the longest range Fiber Optics cable  you can have on land is about 120 km without amplifiers or repeaters.  </p>
<p>In the deep sea cables there are amplifiers about every 80km, this is also why it must be constantly supplied with electricity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are comparing very different cable technologies. An HDMI cable is a copper cable that have been built the cheapest way to conform to the standard. Similar with the equipment at the ends. But an ocean floor cable is a fiber optic cable with much stricter tolerances making it much more expensive and also with much higher quality and more powerful equipment at the ends. In addition to this the long transoceanic cables often have amplifiers on them at regular intervals. You can also get &quot;active&quot; HDMI cables with similar amplifiers to reach longer distances.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can I add something to this? I heard that mankind barely discovered the deep ocean because of its sheer depth.</p>
<p>So... are deep sea cables laid and attached on mellow parts that are discovered or are they just floating around in the sea?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
