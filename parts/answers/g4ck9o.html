<p>The hope is that it will be like measles. Measles is wildly infectious, and quite dangerous to the people it infects, but it hasn’t been a real concern in most countries for a long time. A reasonable vaccine, and decent vaccine coverage, should make COVID-19 similarly an afterthought.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The quote from the NYT was merely trying to illustrate that viruses evolve to become less deadly, and more asymptomatic to reach more hosts. Not vice versa. The exact virology of COVID-19 isn’t necessarily conducive to existing in a seasonal state like the flu, but it will evolve to become less deadly as time goes on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So to answer your question directly, from what I understand the 1918 Spanish Flu eventually mutated to be less virulent in that the Infection Fatality Ratio dropped from what people think to be in the 3% to far lower. It became the primary strain for seasonal flu until the 1957 Flu Pandemic. That strain subsequently became the dominant strain. This is why people freak out when new flu strains develop - the new strains have potential to be more lethal than a strain that's been with us for a while because we've developed some level of resistance to the old strain vs. a new strain. To put into context the 1957 Pandemic killed approx. 1-2million worldwide &amp; 70,000-116,000 in the USA. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1957%E2%80%9358_influenza_pandemic" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1957%E2%80%9358_influenza_pandemic</a></p>
<p>Infectious Disease Epidemiologists are hoping the disease gets less virulent over time. I have read that the basis for many diseases we have are hundreds of years old, like the common cold, and some believe this could have started as a much stronger illness that eventually lost its virulence and became endemic. </p>
<p>I don't think anyone is sure about the seasonality aspect but it's possible. The issue with the novel coronavirus is that it's novel, so it's really hard to say what will happen with it. There are too many variables that rely on human factors, but those are some thoughts on the topic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends whether post infection or post vaccination immunity is like a cold (a few months), like flu (a year or more) or chichen pox (life long).</p>
<p>The silver lining is that if SARS-Cov-2 needs and annual shot maybe the Anti-vaccine movement will fade.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's too soon to tell, but it most likely depends on the mutation rate of the virus. The flu has been around for so long because it changes so quickly, and has many variants.</p>
<p>Early evidence of covid-19 suggests it doesn't mutate as quickly, so one vaccine might be enough to eliminate it.</p>
<p>However there's no evidence to suggest it will be seasonal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
