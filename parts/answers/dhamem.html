		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a chemist in the field of plastics R&amp;D. What a lot of people on here are saying is trash. Two main points. </p>
<p>1) If we want to make biodegradable plastic, most come from renewable sources. However, in terms of use, you do not want your car parts to biodegrade or prosthetic hips for that matter either. Therefore, we need something to be robust and resistant. This means it doesn’t easily get absorbed back into the environment.</p>
<p>2) If we want to make all the different plastics from cellulose, that requires extensive chemical manipulation as cellulose and many common plastics have very different functional groups. What I mean by this is that if we want to make polyethylene (PE) or polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) from cellulose, we need to reduce almost all of the hydroxy groups on cellulose as well as introduce aromaticity. These are not environmentally friendly on the scale we would need to do them at to replace such ubiquitous products. Also, there’s just no way you’re going to get the physical/mechanical properties of PE or PBT with cellulose or other “green” chemicals. </p>
<p>TLDR: it’s not completely about money, it’s about the chemistry. If you want an advanced society, you need to accept that fact that there will be persistent plastics that don’t grow in farms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Disclaimer: I've had a very taxing weekend, so I'm sorry if the last part turned into mouth diarrhea, but I hope it makes sense.</p>
<p>The very short answer is: In regards to environment - yes. In regards to climate - no.</p>
<p>But it depends on what you mean by cellulose based plastics. If you mean plastics such as non-crosslinked PLA, cellulose acetate and thermoplastic starch, then the answer is no to both environment and climate hazards, as these plastics are both biodegradable over a reasonable timescale and they are derived from renewable resources (plants, milk, fermentation of biomass etc.).</p>
<p>But if you are simply talking about plastics that don't come from non-renewable sources, then the answer is different. Any type of plastic that we get from petrochemicals we can also make from regular biomass. This makes sense, since oil and coal are simply biomass that has been under certain conditions for a very long time. We have multiple chemical process pathways to go from chemicals we can get from renewable resources (ethanol, methane, phenolic compounds, cellulose etc) to chemicals we traditionally get from the petrochemical industry. two of these being hydrothermal liquefaction and pyrolysis, which can yield stuff that resembles raw oil and natural coal, respectively. The products from these processes can be an issue in regards to environment, since they will act as regular petro-based plastics, but in regards to  climate they will be somewhere between neutral and positive, since, instead of taking something from &quot;the (very) slow carbon cycle&quot; and possibly adding it to &quot;the fast carbon cycle&quot;. Whereas with hydrothermal liquefaction and pyrolysis, you re taking something from &quot;the fast carbon cycle&quot; and possibly adding it back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cellulose plastics (bio plastic) does not mean biodegradable, and some don’t degrade any better than petro based plastics.</p>
<p>Further, they still use hydrocarbons in their production (farm equipment operation, raw material transportation, energy needs for factory production, etc) and in some ways their production is more damaging than petro plastics (deforestation, water acidification, pesticide infiltration to public water supplies, loss of habitat, etc).</p>
<p>Further, they don’t meet the requirements of all plastic needs and make up a very small portion of the plastics in use globally (.2%) because of their lack of versatility.</p>
<p>In brief, Organics require organic raw material resources, and mass production and harvesting of organic sources is almost always highly destructive to the environment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
