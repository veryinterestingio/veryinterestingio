		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sebaceous gland produces sebum, which is an oily substance that moisturizes and protects the skin. Excess sebum production can block the sebaceous gland duct causing a comedo (a clogged hair follicle or pore), commonly known as a blackhead or whitehead. Unchecked a comedo can lead to an infection — acne.</p>
<p>In humans, sebaceous glands occur in the greatest number on the face and scalp, but also the shoulders, upper chest, and back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Human skin has pores that connect to oil glands under the skin. Follicles connect the glands to the pores. Follicles are small sacs that produce and secrete liquid.</p>
<p>The glands produce an oily liquid called sebum. Sebum carries dead skin cells through the follicles to the surface of the skin. A small hair grows through the follicle out of the skin.</p>
<p>Pimples grow when these follicles get blocked, and oil builds up under the skin.</p>
<p>It is unclear what role diet plays in worsening acne. Scientists have found that people who consume a diet that offers a good supply of vitamins A and E and of zinc may have a lower risk of severe acne. One review describes the link between acne and diet as “controversial,” but suggests that a diet with a low glycemic load may help.</p>
