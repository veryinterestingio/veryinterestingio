		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ooooo...I know this. I led a team of student researchers in college to develop a new shampoo that can be packaged in a water-dissolving film (like a Tide Pod) to reduce plastic waste.</p>
<p>Body wash and shampoo are very similar. They both contain a surfactant, emulsifier, solvent (typically water), preservative, foam booster and some type of fragrance.</p>
<p>Where shampoo differs is that they usually contain vitamins, proteins and/or essential oils. This is because the surfactant (typically sodium laureth sulfate or SLS) strips away all the natural oils (sebum) in the hair. The additional ingredients in shampoo I mentioned try to emulate sebum to leave the hair soft and manageable.</p>
<p>BTW, did you know that most shampoos contain 60-70% water? Also, the amount of plastic waste generated by Holiday Inn, just due to those little bottles of shampoo equals about 70 tons every day.</p>
<p>EDIT: Since people are asking about the waste generated by single-use plastic amenities in hotels, I thought I would shed a bit more light on our research and what hotel executives told us. </p>
<p>Research - In 2014-2015 my team and I visited over 100 different individual hotels in the Midwestern US (representing all the major brands) and we followed cleaning crews in order to better understand the scope of the problem. We collected samples of leftover single-use amenities (shampoo, conditioner, body wash, etc.) from nearly 1000 rooms (n=995), then weighted the samples. </p>
<p>We found that the average weight of total amenity waste per room was 6.5 ounces. Also, approximately 20% of all amenities that were to be discarded were completely full. The cleaning crews were instructed to throw away any leftover amenities. Additionally, any other amenities left by the occupant (i.e. bottles of shampoo brought with them) were discarded and not counted in the survey. </p>
<p>Results - We spoke to Director level and C-level executives for each of the top 9 hotel chains in the world. This included directors of sustainability, procurement and branding. We told them about our findings and the number one response in 7 out of 9 was, &quot;Yeah, we know, but there's nothing we can do.&quot; Additionally, they told us that they looked at switching to bulk amenities, but that it would detract from their overall brand. Essentially, guests really like having those designer amenities.</p>
<p>We eventually spoke to a decision maker from one of the largest chains who wanted to pursue our idea. They basically said, &quot;Can you take [designer shampoo] and reformulate it to work with your idea?&quot; We said, &quot;Let's find out&quot; and worked with their team to figure it out. Unfortunately, we were never able to come to terms on an agreement.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

All we did was take a shampoo formula, add a small amount of glycerin, a new color and fragrance, and called it body wash.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the brand and intent of each. Body wash tends to be harsher, and shampoo more mild. Shampoo also usually includes extra &quot;stuff&quot; for the purpose of keeping hair healthy. </p>
<p>Difference can be extremely significant, depending on your body. If you wash your body with shampoo and still notice body odor, you should probably use something stronger.</p>
<p>I personally have to use body wash or bar soap to eliminate BO. My wife gets away with just Shampoo.</p>
<p>Additionally, if this question came about because people who you meet in person are suggesting you try using Body Wash instead of Shampoo, they probably have a reason. Nothing destroys attempts at a social life like persistent body odor does.</p>
<p>Note: Shower Gel is closer to Shampoo than Body Wash.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>They are generally the same to be honest. However, the factor that probably differs the most is usually the percentage and strength of surfactants available. Typical surfactants in the market such as sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) and sodium laureth sulfate) are quite harsh due to their ability to very effectively remove dirt and sebum, but they are indiscriminate and hence can remove the essential nutrients and oils of the body as well.</p>
<p>One key thing is that the ingredients listed on the product are by decreasing amount, BUT they do not show the exact amount used, thus it's still best to purchase shampoo/body wash as labelled. Eg. A shampoo and body wash both contain 60% water which is the highest amount of ingredient used. However, the shampoo may contain 20% SLS while the body wash contains 10% SLS. These percentages are usually already the 2nd most ingredient, but because of the way labelling is done, both products will have the following list of ingredients, &quot;Aqua, SLS,....&quot; Hence to be safe you'd best purchase whatever they are labelled with, to minimize the possible damage to your skin.</p>
<p>Essential oils and extracts, along with certain other ingredients, are usually used as active ingredients. You can generally use them for both products depending on what claims you want, eg. moisturising, though there are some that are quite obviously not suited for the product (such as using anti-dandruff actives for body wash).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
