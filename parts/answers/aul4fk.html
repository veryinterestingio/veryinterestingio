		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wind howls when it’s broken up from passing through or around objects, such as trees. The gust of air will split up to move around the tree and then comes back together on the other side. Due to factors such as the surface of the tree and the air speed, one side of the wind is going to be stronger than the other when the currents rejoin. The mixing of the two currents causes vibrations in the air, which produce that ghostly howling noise that gives us the creeps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's due to a concept known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex_shedding" target="_blank">vortex shedding</a>. In short, it's a fluid dynamics effect that can happen within a range of Reynolds numbers when a viscous fluid flows around a disturbance. The sound you hear is related to the frequency of the vortices being shed. <del>It's also how all wind instruments work</del> (partially true). You can see slower examples of vortex shedding where water flows around a rock or behind a slow boat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Von Kármán vortices that form when laminar flow passes a roughly cylindrical object (such as a twig).  The characteristic frequency is (roughly, there are far more exact equations)</p>
<p>f = (1/5)(v[m/s]/d[m])</p>
<p>The vortices range in size and frequency from the small and audible to <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Heard_Island_Karman_vortex_street.jpg" target="_blank">global and visible</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know how a stick makes a sound when you swing it hard enough through the air?</p>
<p>Whenever Air hits an edge that edge starts to vibrate, this vibration is what you hear, you're ear basically works like a drum, only in reverse.</p>
<p>Thats the same principle as with a flute, or as you brought up, wind whistling.</p>
<p>This also scales quite a bit as you can see with this bridge here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mclp9QmCGs" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mclp9QmCGs" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mclp9QmCGs</a></a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
