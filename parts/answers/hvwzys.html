		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With enough heat and pressure rock starts behaving less like a solid and more like a very dense liquid. </p>
<p>Blasting a hole in liquid is not a plan that works. Blasting rock also requires drilling it and placing charges in the boreholes. Just throwing a bomb at a rock face doesn't accomplish very much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First problem is cost you need someone or some government to pay you to dig that deep and it is very expensive if you aren't going to be extracting something at the end of it. Dynamite in a hole is virtually useless as everything from the surrounding just falls into the hole, drilling is the only really way to go deep and you need to cool the drill and also replace the drill bit which means removing it from the hole which gets more difficult the deeper you go and more time consuming.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're 12.2 kilometres down, and blow away a few tons of rock, you're still 12.2 kilometres down and now stood on loose rock. To get rid of it, you have to push it 12.2 kilometres straight up to the surface.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We almost certainly could, given a reason and enough funding.</p>
<p>Drilling deep is extremely expensive (look up the costs of oil rigs for some hair raising numbers, and they're not going anywhere near the record).</p>
<p>Would it be cool? Yes. Are there cooler things we could do with the money? Also yes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
