		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no consensus. The two biggest philosophers of consciousness (Daniel Dennett and David Chalmers) have almost opposite views. Dennett believes that consciousness is not real, only an illusion. Chalmers believes that consciousness is everywhere, part of the fabric of the universe (panpsychism).</p>
<p>The most &quot;scientific&quot; theory is probably Koch's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_information_theory" target="_blank">integrated information theory</a>, which views consciousness as a product of information processing. This theory is a mild form of panpsychism, since it allows for consciousness in non-living systems.</p>
<p>Another scientific theory is Graziano's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_schema_theory" target="_blank">attention schema theory</a>, which views consciousness as a internal model created by the brain to allocate attention. This theory is more aligned with illusionism (Graziano believes that we <em>think</em> we have consciousness, but we don't really).</p>
<p>There's also Penrose's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestrated_objective_reduction" target="_blank">orchestrated objective reduction</a>, which tries to explain consciousness using quantum physics, and Hoffman's <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-evolutionary-argument-against-reality-20160421/" target="_blank">evolutionary denial of reality</a>, which claims that consciousness is fundamentally real while reality is an illusion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There aren't. There are many philosophical views of consciousness, mostly because it eludes data-driven science so much. They range from the idea that consciousness doesn't even exist, to everything being conscious, to consciousness being an emergent property exclusive to humans, to matrix-like theories. Then if you do even say, establish what consciousness <em>is</em>, there are very few neural correlates of consciousness we can measure that explain how consciousness and the brain interact (perhaps one of the most famous and interesting ones being <a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-abstract/106/3/623/271932?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank">Libet's experiments</a> that show that brain activity precedes conscious awareness)</p>
<p>Even if there were a consensus, research into psychedelic substances is shedding new light on the subject and could very well reshape theories of consciousness/brain interactions as well as our perspective of the nature of consciousness altogether in the coming years, for sure in the next decade if research isn't aborted like it was in the '60s.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most commonly accepted idea is that we don't actually have any concrete evidence of what our consciousness actually is. Closest scientific explanation would be that the human/homo sapien brain and intelligence was the driving force behind our species' evolutionary split from our other common ancestors. Consciousness would most likely be the product of our increased brain development/evolution through natural selection. Each generation was smarter than the last with primitive homo sapiens having their increased cognitive abilities being naturally selected for with their reproduction. This process was working for a long time, starting as early as early as 3.8 million years ago with our oldest common ancestor, and continued through around 300,000 years ago for homo sapiens to first appear. </p>
<p>It's thought (or at least assumed) that our egos and consciousness came about from the increasing improvements to the human brain structure as it evolved throughout the millennia. The part of our brain responsible for our own feelings of self is the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network#:~:text=In%20neuroscience%2C%20the%20default%20mode,cortex%2Fprecuneus%20and%20angular%20gyrus." target="_blank">Default Mode Network.</a> The DMN is a series of unique connections in the human brain that help link our different senses and experiences together. While this isn't completely unique to the human brain, it's significantly more developed than in any other species we've seen. We've seen how this part of our brain can be effected by clinical research and brain scanning of people experiencing different psychedelics that can make you experience &quot;ego death,&quot; (where you don't feel connected to yourself) because they reduce and suppress the effects and control the DMN has over your consciousness. </p>
<p>It is still one of the biggest mysteries in the universe along with why there is even a universe we live in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
