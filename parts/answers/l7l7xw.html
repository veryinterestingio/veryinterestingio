		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We have something called mirror neurons, which  some psychologists believe are involved in developing empathy. When you see someone sad, your mirror neurons will register the facial expression as sad, and then depending on your upbringing/nurture you will act based on that (maybe you ignore the sad person, maybe seeing someone sad makes you sad, etc) so for yawns it has been noted that these same mirror neurons are at play. Mirror neurons are key to survival, think “monkey see monkey do”. Without copying each other, we wouldn’t have survived. As for your little ones, ultimately while we have the “hardware” for empathy, it is still something that has to be nurtured and developed. Think about how many adults you know that seem to lack basic empathy. As for the purpose of yawning.. Some scientists think yawning is a way for the brain to get more oxygen, but as other people have stated as of yet there is no consensus. It’s very probable that yawning is multi-purpose.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
