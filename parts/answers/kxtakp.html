		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Metallurgy is.. complicated! There's a lot that goes into deciding how a metal behaves with respect to common properties like tensile strength, malleability, etc. but most of them come down to how defects/irregularities (material dislocations) in the crystal lattice that forms the material moves through it when stress is applied. When you bend and deform a material, what's happening is the stress is being relieved through movement of dislocations. </p>
<p>For example, the existence of impurities, such as carbon (the presence of which is what makes steel &quot;steel&quot;), can block dislocation movement. On top of that, stuff like microstructure, the microscopic arrangement of domains, impurities and different phases within the metal also affects it. You can refer to how heat treating a steel by heating it up and quickly cooling it in water can harden because the speed at which the impurities inside move as it cools affects which phases form. Basically you can describe most of the properties and behaviour of a steel member through the percentage of carbon, the presence of other metals to make it an alloy, and the heat treatment it has undergone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Metallurgist here! /u/LaVieEstBizarre's comment has done a lot of the heavy lifting, so I wanted to add a few precisions:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;mechanically stronger&quot; is a really fuzzy term because there are so many things it can mean. Do you want something that can withstand a lot of weight? Something that won't crack easily? Something that can deform under pressure or something that will stay the same shape until it cracks? Something with a hard surface, that you can't scratch? Something that won't corrode? Etc. All of these properties can be tuned and they tend to be interdependent - for instance, the higher the yield strength of a steel, the harder and brittler it tends to be.</li>
<li>Generally, there are three scales at which we can look into things: at the microscopic scale, (~micron or so) is where we look at inclusions, dislocations, and other impurities described in /u/LaVieEstBizarre's comment. There are many types of defects and they're all both good and bad at the same time... Quite frankly it's all very complicated, but if you have more pointed questions let me know! At the mesoscopic scale (usually from micron to millimeter) you get grains: when a steel solidifies from liquid, the atoms will start arranging themselves in neat crystals, but many of these crystals form at the same time and will compete for space. You end up with grains, regions of space corresponding to one crystal each. The defects, the composition and the cooling conditions will all play a role in that grain growth (size, shape, direction, etc.), and these grains (and their boundaries) have a massive impact on the final &quot;strength&quot;. Finally, you have the macroscopic scale, which is structural engineering, essentially. You don't get the same mechanical results when you compress a beam vs when you compress a plate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, here are the general rules for steels (and, as a reminder, basic steel formula is just iron+carbon):</p>
<ul>
<li>The strongest defining factor for a steel's properties is its carbon content. Adding carbon to steel makes it harder (i.e. its surface cannot be scratched easily, great for making knife edges for instance) but also more brittle (will break like a ceramic tile instead of bending). If you add a lot of carbon, you get cast iron, which is very hard but extremely brittle, so careful with that pan!</li>
<li>The other key element is heat treatment. All of the following parameters will have an impact: steel composition, starting temperature, end temperature, speed and/or duration of cooling/heating, size of the steel piece, whether it's in a mould and what kind of mould... Needless to say there's a lot we can do here. The general rule is that steels that were cooled very quickly (quenched, like that cool thing blacksmiths do when they punge a sword in water) become very hard and brittle, while a mellow, not-too-high-temperature heat treatment will relax the structure and make you gain ductility (opposite of brittleness). Heat treatments often have different stages.</li>
<li>A lot of steels nowadays have other alloying elements to improve durability, corrosion resistance, etc. The most common ones are chromium (for stainless steel), nickel, molybdenum, silicon. However, basic &quot;carbon steels&quot; (only iron+carbon+traces of other elements) still find their use for a lot of basic structural shapes, rivets, tubes, that sort of things.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mechanical implies a lot of different properties, so we're talking about a much vast matter.</p>
<p>To be short, steel varies his property on the amount of carbon, the crystalline structure and the inclusion of different atoms in his crystalline structure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can someone elaborate on how steel can be strong in the sense that it resists plastic deformation I.e. no permanent deformation but does yield to the applied stress then returns to its original shape after the stress is relieved ? It feels like in a way itâ€™s weaker yet in another sense stronger</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
