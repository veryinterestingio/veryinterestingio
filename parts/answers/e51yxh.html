		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This &quot;decomposition&quot; is really oxidation. Think of the oxidation like &quot;eating&quot;. Aluminum is like a hamburger so it's really really easy to oxidize, so easy in fact that if other metals weren't added to it, the can wouldn't make it out of the factory. Other things are added to keep it from being &quot;eaten&quot; so quickly. Plastics on the other hand are very complex molecules that are very hard to eat. They're big like a huge bowl of jellybeans but also complex, like each one is in it's own wrapper that's really hard to open, so oxidizing plastic is very hard. This is partly by design so that the plastic will last. We can make Plastics that are easy to decompose. Compostable plastics are available, do a Google search for them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aluminum is a metal that is relatively easily oxidized. In contrast, plastics are polymers made up almost entirely of C-C and C-H bonds which are among the most difficult to break. Just to give you a sense of this, ethane steam crackers operate at near 1000 C. Because of this bond strength, plastics are relatively inert - oxygen and/or water doesn't react with them the same way they do with aluminum. This makes them great for storage and packaging, but really bad from an environmental perspective.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>edit: I said bacteria, but its actually <em>fungi</em> that &quot;learned&quot; to break down wood</p>
<p>It's a similar situation to why we have coal in the ground. MIllions of years ago when trees first existed, nothing that lived on earth was good at breaking down and rotting wood. So when trees fell, that wood would just sit there and get buried... eventually time and pressure create coal</p>
<p>But then... some evolution happened. With wood sitting around, there was free food for the taking if some organism learned how to eat it. Eventually bacteria that could break down wood came to exist, and since it had plenty of food around, it did well. Today, a tree that falls will rot... because there is bacteria that developed around eating dead wood.</p>
<p>Plastic is relatively new. Just like trees were millions of years ago. And just like wood all those years ago, there is no bacteria specialized in breaking down plastic... so it doesn't rot. Yet.</p>
<p>It is likely that organisms will come to exist some day which thrive on breaking down plastics. But they need years and years and years of opportunity (trees.... or plastic sitting around) before something will coincidentally evolve to do it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is hard to describe it to a five-year-old, but it is an interesting question!</p>
<p>Some things are made of very tiny blocks we call &quot;atoms&quot;. Atoms are made of even smaller blocks, and depending on how those smaller blocks are arranged we call a big bunch of atoms &quot;an element&quot;. Iron is an element, so is Aluminum. They are made of a lot of atoms stuck together.</p>
<p>Chemistry has a set of rules about how atoms interact with each other. The rules sort of define a &quot;shape&quot; that atoms can have. Some shapes fit together and make big bunches of different atoms called &quot;molecules&quot;. For example, water is made out of atoms from the elements hydrogen and oxygen, and a water molecule has a kind of triangle shape. </p>
<p>Many metals have a shape that interacts in a weird way with oxygen atoms or molecules that have oxygen atoms in them. The atoms in the metal like to steal oxygen atoms from other things and make new molecules with that oxygen. For example, rust on most metals is actually what chemists call &quot;iron oxide&quot;, which means it's now a new molecule made out of iron and oxygen stuck together. Pretty much anything a chemist calls an &quot;oxide&quot; is something that's combined with oxygen and isn't the same anymore. Rusty things fall apart because iron atoms stick together a lot more strongly than iron oxide molecules do. So eventually, when a rusty thing has turned into enough rust, it's just a bunch of dust.</p>
<p>Aluminum and tin, which we usually make cans out of, are the same. They really like to form oxides, so they deteriorate pretty fast if they aren't kept very clean and dry. But they can even be deteriorated by the oxygen in the air! This is why we don't have an awful lot of cans from more than a few decades ago even though we've been making them for more than a century. It's too hard to keep these cheap, thin metals from deteriorating. We'd have to keep them in a vacuum!</p>
<p>Some metals, like stainless steel, have shapes that aren't so good at combining with oxygen. These metals don't really occur in nature, we make them in factories by combining metals together to get &quot;shapes&quot; of molecules that give us different combinations of strength, flexibility, and resistance to deterioration. Generally these metals have &quot;shapes&quot; that don't make it easy to make them thin or bendy enough to make cans, and since we have to combine metals to make them they're too expensive to make flimsy garbage with them.</p>
<p>We made plastic because we didn't like this. Plastic molecules are <em>really</em> complicated and designed so they don't really interact with many atoms found in nature. Since oxygen doesn't &quot;steal&quot; plastic molecules, it can go a very long time without deteriorating. I'm not exactly sure what causes it to deteriorate. I think it has to do with what kind of plastic is used. For example, plastic bags that are a few years old are brittle and break to pieces, but Tupperware from the 60s is still in pretty good shape. And even very strong plastic is very cheap compared to even flimsy metals. </p>
<p>So naturally, once we figured out how to make something cheap that never deteriorates, we proceeded to make everything we throw away out of it. A few people thought that might cause a problem, but we figured that's a problem five-year-olds like you can solve when you're a grownup, we won't be here anymore!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
