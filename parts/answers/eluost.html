		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of you guys are missing the eli5.</p>
<p>2000 calories is your body doing all the &quot;keeping you alive&quot; and it never stops and this is over 24 hours. </p>
<p>100 calories is you making the body work really fast but over a short period... 10 minutes say. If you keep that effort up for 24 hours, you'd be using err... 14,000 calories or so.</p>
<p>The difference you're missing is the time frame.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It takes energy to keep your metabolism goingâ€”maintaining an appropriate internal temperature, digesting, breathing, circulating blood, etc. The number of calories burned by being alive varies by person.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're not doing nothing.  Your heart is beating, your brain is processing, your eyes and ears are collecting information, your muscle tissue is idling, awaiting command.  You're maintaining a core temp of precisely 98.6F.</p>
<p>None of this is free, you'll consume 1500-2500 calories a day simply keeping the biological lights on.</p>
<p>We're highly efficient runners, and burn little energy to do so compared to many other animals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rough estimate, you burn 2,400 calories per day staying alive.  That is 100 calories per hour.  </p>
<p>You burn about 100 calories jogging for 10 minutes.  That means jogging burns 6x as many calories as just standing still.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
