		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The world emitted 36 gigatons of CO2 in 2014. A CO2 has a molecular mass of 44.01 g/mol, while carbon has a molecular mass of 12 g/mol, meaning that 27% of the weight of CO2 is carbon, meaning that that CO2 emission produces 9.8 gigatons of Carbon. If this was compressed into diamond it would still weight 9.8 billion tons</p>
<p>Diamond has a density of 3.51 g/cmÂ³ which means 9.8 gigatons of diamond would take up 2.8x10^15 cm^3 . How big is that? Pretty damn big. It's a cube about .8 of a mile or 1.4 km on each side. It would form a crystal basically exactly the same size of Mount Everest. It would be really really big.</p>
<p>EDIT: A lot of people are taking me to task on the Mount Everest claim. And I totally see their point. However, the references comes from Wolfram Alpha.. which is pretty reliable:</p>

<p>After trying to find some sources, I see that it's kinda difficult to really say what the volume of mount Everest is, as it's impossible to say where it starts. Certainly, the diamond will not have the same volume as an equalateral square pyramid with a height of 8.8km. I think a lot of the &quot;weight of Mt Everest&quot; and &quot;Volume of Mt Everest&quot; come from starting at base camp.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Love /u/NeuroBill 's answer, but here's another way of looking at it: if you're an average American, your personal diamond weighs 4.5 tonnes, and measures about 4 feet by 4 feet by 3 feet.  And you create a new one every year.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>While it doesn't exactly answer your question , I feel it's a close approximate. </p>
<p>So, he works in creating jewelry out of  air pollution, by creating cubes of compressed particulate matter and fashioning it into a ring. Albeit its not changing the allotropes / compressing hard enough to create diamond, it's still cool in my opinion</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
