		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's surprisingly cheap to run pineapple farms because they're very resistant to pests, disease, and long dry spells. They also grow very well in areas that are insanely cheap to live [in USD].  </p>
<p>According to <a href="https://farmbizafrica.com/profit-boosters/220-nandi-farmer-i-earn-sh20-000-in-a-week-from-pineapple-farming" target="_blank">this article</a>, it takes only about Sh5000 (that's Kenyan Shillings) of capital to start a farm....that's about $46 at the time of writing this. About 500 seedlings were planted and they took about 9 months to mature (not 3 years as you claim). They sold between Sh20-Sh50, lets say 100 were lost, that's still a total of Sh14,000...or about $128 for a $46 investment over 9 months.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Economies of scale! On a large enough property you can grow tens of thousands of these simultaneously. Although the first plant needs a long time to grow and produce its first fruit (a quick google search said ~2 years) the subsequent fruits take just over a year, since the plant is already there.
Also, your expenses are much lower with farming than with mass production of industrial or technological products because sunlight, rain and soil (to an extent) are free, and require very few workers</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
