		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>HCl stands for &quot;hydrochloride&quot;. It is because the cetirizine molecule is formed into a &quot;salt&quot;. There are a few reasons for choosing to use a salt instead of just the active ingredient molecule by itself; probably the two most common reasons are solubility (so that it can be more readily absorbed by the body) and shelf stability.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The active ingredient in such medicines are called amines, that are water insoluble. Converting the amine into a hydrochloride makes them water soluble, which means they dissolve in the gastrointestinal tract and are able to be absorbed into the bloodstream more quickly. </p>
<p>The HCl in such medicines refers to <em>hydrochloride</em>, not <em>hydrochloric acid</em>. Of cource, the HCl in the final compound is introduced by the reaction between hydrochloric acid (acid) and the amine (base), which produces the final hydrochloride (salt).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
