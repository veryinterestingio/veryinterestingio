		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In just war theory we can distinguish between <em>jus ad bellum</em> (right to war) and <em>jus in bello</em> (right in war). The first concerns itself with what are justifications for going to war, and the second with proper conduct when in war. Together these can be seen as the law of war. Over time there has been a number of sources for
law of war, most famously the Geneva convention. </p>
<p>One of the biggest concepts in international politics is sovereignty. All states have sovereignty, which means that whatever happens within their borders is their own concern, and other states can't violate this sovereignty.</p>
<p>Currently, in international law there are two main reasons when going to war is seen as legal and thus acceptable to the international community. First is self-defense. Second is if the UN Security Council permits it. Since the 1990s there is also the introduction of the concept of Resonsibility to Protect, which means that the international community should intervene in gross human rights violations, even if those are happening within a country and thus intervention violates the sovereignty of that country. R2P however is not something that states can unilaterally invoke, it should go through the United Nations.</p>
<p>Because of this, any act of war that is started without Security Council clearance and that is not committed in self defence is illegal under international law.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>You can declare war if you are going to get attacked imminently, war can be allowed by the UN Security Council, and you can engage your troops in a country that requested assistance and has accepted your intervention.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Going for the real ELI5 prize here.</p>
<p>Most of the world uses a thing called &quot;Just War Theory&quot; to decide what is a legal war and what is an illegal war. For a war to be legal, it has to abide by three sets of rules: one set of rules covers what happens before the war starts, one set covers what happens during the war, and one set covers what happens when the war ends.</p>
<p>The set of rules before a war is made up of six rules: 1) <strong>you must be a state</strong> to have a legal war, so the United States or North Korea can have a legal war but something like a company or a church or just a big group of people can't have a legal war, 2) <strong>you must tell everyone</strong>, including who you're going to go to war with, that you're going to have a war, 3) <strong>your goal must be to create a better, more peaceful world by going to war</strong>, so your goal could be to stop terrorism or genocide but not to gain more land or resources, 4) <strong>you have to have a good chance of winning the war</strong>, 5) <strong>you can only use a &quot;proportional&quot; amount of violence in the war</strong> so you can't just bomb everything, everywhere, you have to limit the violence only to what is absolutely needed to win, 6) <strong>you can only go to war after you've tried everything else</strong>, so you have to try all other non-violent options first like talking to your enemy to try to find a compromise.</p>
<p>Once you've done those things, you're ready to go to war! There are five rules to follow during the war for it to be a legal war: 1) <strong>you can only attack the enemy and no one else</strong>, so you can't attack people that aren't in the enemy's military and you can't attack them if they've already given up or have gotten too injured to keep fighting, 2) <strong>your attacks have to be only as rough on your enemy as is fair based on what the enemy has done</strong>, so you can't just use huge weapons unless the enemy is doing such bad things that that would be an equal response, 3) <strong>you can only do things against your enemy if it helps to win the war</strong>, so blowing up a factory that makes weapons for your enemy is okay but blowing up just a plain old office building is not, 4) <strong>you have to treat people from your enemy's military that you capture or that give up to you fairly</strong>, 5) <strong>you can't use evil methods</strong>, so you can't use things like rape, forcing your captured enemy soldiers to fight against your enemy, or certain weapons like nuclear bombs or poison gas. </p>
<p>Now that you've done all that and you've defeated your enemy, it's time to end the war! There are five rules left: 1) <strong>you have to have a good reason to end the war</strong>, so either you accomplished your goal you set in rule #3 of the first set of rules or you have decided you aren't going to be able to accomplish that goal legally, 2) <strong>your plans for ending the war can only include things like an apology from your enemy and getting your enemy to pay only for things that they messed up</strong>, so you can't just get whatever you want and take revenge on your enemy, 3) <strong>you and whoever you make the agreement with to end the war have to be the leaders of both sides and you have to tell everyone about your agreement</strong>, 4) <strong>you have to make it clear who was involved in the war and the causes of the war and who wasn't and you can't punish those who weren't involved</strong>, 5) <strong>your punishment for the enemy has to be equal to what they did wrong</strong>.</p>
<p>If the world believes you have done these things, the war was legal, and if you don't, then the world will see it as illegal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Legal wars have a declaration of war before people start shooting.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Legal war&quot; is basically defined as one where your neighbors decide that it was an acceptable idea. The crusades were &quot;legal&quot; because the rest of Europe decided that they were justified in their reasoning (wanting to retake Jerusalem) and thus didn't get angry about it.</p>
<p>When you have multiple sovereign states that exist near each other, and all of them have armies, they have to trust that their neighbors won't attack them. If a country only goes to war for specific reasons (you invaded me, you kidnapped my queen, you have a different religion than me) then their neighbors can feel confident that by avoiding these actions they can avoid being attacked.</p>
<p>If the country simply goes to war because they feel like it, or because of things that you can't control (I kill you because you have non-aryans) then it is declared an illegal war. When a country declares a war illegal, they are asking other countries ti help them stop it.</p>
<p>For instance, Ukraine is saying that Russia's aggression towards them is illegal. This doesn't necessarily mean they are breaking the law (they are breaking international law but that is not really something that can be enforced) but rather that Ukraine is saying &quot;they are bad dangerous people who can't be trusted to not attack their neighbors. Please help me beat them up so they will stop attacking their neighbors&quot;.</p>
<p>This also explains why we sometimes care about illegal wars (nazi Germany) and sometimes don't (Darfur). We only really care if a country is dangerous if they are dangerous to <em>us</em>. If not, then our concern over whether the war is legal or illegal is pretty small.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
