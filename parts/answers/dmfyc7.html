		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's an extension of curiosity. Disturbing images are of things that we don't frequently associate with or see. They're fundamentally unusual. Our brain interprets images as disturbing in the first place as a defense mechanism. Things that scare or unnerve us are things that it's usually best for us to not be around. For example, dead bodies are often found in places riddled with decay and disease, so its best not to stay near them too long. </p>
<p>However, when we're in a place we know is safe, such as when looking at google images on your phone on the toilet instead of doing work, your curiosity overwhelms your sense of danger, and so you keep looking because your brain is trying to figure out what the hell's going on here. Curiosity is driven by a state of uncertainty and a need to rectify that, but disturbing images are disturbing precisely because they cause uncertainty. Your brain is going to keep looking at it until the state of uncertainty is rectified or until it realises that this is going to remain unnerving no matter how much you look at it and just turns away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Identification of the threat, the more you know about a threat the less likely it is going to kill you, something disturbing is almost certainly considered by the brain as a threat even if you are watching it through a TV or computer screen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Look into Terror Management Theory. In short one way we learn what to do, what not to do and get a better idea of what is in the realm of possibility is by observing. One can look at the aftermath of a freak accident, deduct what happened and use it as a cautionary tale to avoid, or at minimum be aware of, its possibility in the future for ourselves and those we care for. A more complex survival instinct than fight or flight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I don’t consider myself timid either, I just feel I know what’s good for me and curiosity doesn’t override that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
