		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Director of the CDC, Robert Redfield, estimated during a media interview that the actual percent infected in the US was between 5% and 8% about 3 weeks ago, up to 10x the reported number of cases. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/06/25/coronavirus-cases-10-times-larger/" target="_blank">https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/06/25/coronavirus-cases-10-times-larger/</a></p>
<p>For many weeks in March and April, low-risk or mildly sick people were asked to stay home and weather the illness without being tested.  We know the actual number of cases is higher than the number of positive test results, but the truth is that we haven't done, or are not doing, enough tests to zero in on a better estimate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Current estimates put the overall percentage of Americans that have been exposed at around 6-7% from the CDC.   </p>
<p>The problem is that we really aren't testing people unless they're showing symptoms, or are on someone's contact trace. Hell, I have someone in my house showing symptoms and currently awaiting test results and I was told that I'd have to wait until they pop positive. As such, my work is telling me to come in and expose my coworkers potentially. It's messy and its dumb. So yeah, we have definitely seen about 6-7% tentatively. The problem is, with that number, a lot of deniers will say we are fine then! But that couldn't be further from the truth. If it took this long to get 6-7% infected, we'd have to repeat the last 90 days about 10x to reach herd immunity for this one strain. And that's assuming it doesn't mutate its S-protein and fool our immune systems and restart the process. It's already done it once when in Italy. The Italian strain is what is dominant now due to it being 10x more infective than the original Wuhan strain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
