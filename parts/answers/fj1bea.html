		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, absolutely. But typically those cases are from someone who was inebriated or under the influence of drugs and unable to respond to the body's internal defense mechanism against this: namely, pain.</p>
<p>When a body part &quot;falls asleep&quot; it's a nerve that is pinched somewhere. Not blood flow &quot;cut off&quot;... usually, anyway.</p>
<p>However, if someone falls asleep with their WHOLE BODY on top of an extremity for an extended period of time (say 12 to 18 hours without moving or adjusting), the blood CAN be stopped to an arm or leg. And they could even get compartment syndrome which could cause death of the muscles, could lead to infection, amputation, etc.</p>
<p>Not to scare you or anything. That almost exclusively happens in people who have OD'd on drugs and passed out.</p>
<p>So don't do that and you shouldn't have anything to worry about.</p>
<p>Most of the time when you feel the &quot;circulation being cut off&quot; that's not technically what's happening. You're just pinching a nerve. If it only happens once in a while it's not an issue. But if it is happening consistently, or very severely one time, it can cause permanent nerve damage. </p>
<p>However, it's usually just temporarily injuring the nerve specifically. Not the whole arm. Usually not permanent. Usually the blood can still get through. That requires a whole lot more pressure to stop, and if it is stopped, is a lot more serious. See above about compartment syndrome, etc. </p>
<p>Smoking (nicotine) lowers your body's ability to heal. So don't do that if you have this and want it to improve.</p>
<p>Edit: if specific fingers fall asleep, that can mean diff things. Ring and small finger (AKA pinky) usually is ulnar nerve at the elbow. Also called &quot;cubital tunnel&quot;. Typically happens because of a flexed elbow. If it happens frequently, try an elbow pad flipped around backward, so the padded part is in front and prevents elbow flexion while you sleep. Not too tight, or else it will cause other issues. But not too loose or it'll fall off. Try to get one with rubberized grip inside. You don't want to let this keep happening. The nerve can accrue permanent damage the more this happens. And surgery for this (Cubital Tunnel Release) is not a guaranteed fix.</p>
<p>If the thumb, index, and/or middle finger are affected, likely carpal tunnel. Due to wrist flexion. Wear a carpal tunnel splint at night while sleeping. Holds wrist straight. Should solve that problem. </p>
<p>If Carpal Tunnel goes on to get worse to the point of considering surgery (Carpal Tunnel Release) it is typically a reliably effective surgery. More so than for Cubital. Several reasons for that.  Cubital involves a larger nerve and has longer distance &quot;to go&quot; when it's healing. The nerve can lose its protective myelin sheath. More motor function is affected. Muscles lose their innervation and atrophy. The healing is less reliable. </p>
<p>If you develop constant numbness from either of those that doesn't go away, definitely should see a hand surgeon. We can help.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's possible depending on how long. Radial nerve compression (one possible scenario of this) is sometimes referred to as &quot;Saturday night palsy&quot; because of passing out with your arm over a chair or something similar. Compression of the nerve over a long enough period of time can lead to effects that may never go away. In this case with radial nerve damage, someone may have a permanent wrist drop and weakness with other forearm and triceps function. This was one of the first nerve differential diagnosis cases we learned about in DPT school- always thought it was crazy.</p>
<p>Edit: Regarding &quot;how long is too long&quot;- it's really an &quot;it depends&quot; situation. People have mentioned getting hand numbness from riding bikes which checks out- often you can press down on the ulnar nerve on a long ride or compress the median nerve through the carpal tunnel. The damage severity will depend on the degree of compression and how long it was compressed. Everybody is wired differently, and situations vary a lot so it's really difficult to give a concrete answer :(</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
