		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Painkillers are a broad term. There are different classifications. </p>
<p>Steroids can act as painkillers by slowing and reversing inflammation, which reduces pressure in the affected area, and thereby pain. </p>
<p>NSAIDs work in a different way to do the same thing</p>
<p>Opioids work in the brain by changing the pathways which process the sensation of pain. </p>
<p>Topical painkillers like novocaine block pain signals in the local nerves from getting to the brain at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pain is an information. Painkillers kill the messengers.</p>
<p>Depending on pain killers, some actually alleviate pains (see u/Xstitchpixels answer) while other just prevent pain from affecting you.</p>
<p>Every feeling of pain ends up as a signal in your brain that is interpreted as pain. You can block or modify the signal before it reaches the brain, or send a signal to the brain to ignore it as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Follow-up question:</p>
<p>Why arenâ€™t we all on painkillers all the time? Bad side effects? Tolerance? </p>
<p>We have the ability to reduce, alleviate, and prevent pain, but yet we only do so under certain circumstances. Usually, after we get pain (headache, cut, injury, etc)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
