		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh dear... how much in detail do you want me to go into that?<br />
First of all; with &quot;armor&quot; you mean plate armour, correct? [1]<br />
If so, then of course we need to establish (how already others pointed out) that one cannot slice through plate armour. [4] As a result, impact weapons and thrusts were used.</p>
<p>In general, the sword was not the primary weapon of a knight. In most cases the lance was. In that case, the lance was actually aimed at the opponent's head, because well...you can armour up as much as you want; if a lance hits your helmet from a charging horse, your head will probably come off. [2]<br />
But; what happens if you don't have a horse and lance? Well, you can use a lance or poleaxe. This can be used to thrust in gaps of the armour (<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Ms.Thott.290.2%C2%BA_132r.jpg" target="_blank">Ms.Thott.290.2º</a>). If that does not work (most times probably) you can also use the poleaxe to whack the shit out of your opponent. If everything goes right, your opponent gets a concussion, gets on the ground and then you can stab your enemy in a weak spot (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZWkDhh9Zsg" target="_blank">YouTube video</a>).<br />
So, but what if even that is not an option? Then you can use your sword. In order to bring down an armoured knight, a blade would have been gripped with one hand at the blade; so-called halfswording (<a href="https://wiktenauer.com/images/9/97/MS_Germ.Quart.16_29r.jpg" target="_blank">MS Germ.Quart.16</a>). That actually meant that the sword had to possess a quite acute taper (Estoc sword for reference). The tip of the sword would then be thrust into the gaps of the armour, e.g. the armpit, wrist, etc. (<a href="https://wiktenauer.com/images/5/5a/Cod.10799_189r_detail.png" target="_blank">Cod.10799a</a>, <a href="https://wiktenauer.com/images/a/a1/Mair%27s_armored_fencing_13.png" target="_blank">Cod.icon. 393</a>). Another way was to grip the blade with both hands and use the pommel as a mace (<a href="https://wiktenauer.com/images/2/29/Cod.10799_157r_detail.png" target="_blank">Cod.10799b</a>). These two ways to grip a sword could of course be &quot;combined&quot;, meaning used against each other (<a href="https://wiktenauer.com/images/a/ae/Cod.icon._394a_38r.jpg" target="_blank">Cod.icon. 394</a>, <a href="https://wiktenauer.com/images/a/a1/Mair%27s_armored_fencing_13.png" target="_blank">Cod.icon. 393</a>). You can see how half-swording may have looked <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hlIUrd7d1Q&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">here</a>. [3]<br />
In the end, it often came down to the fact that the &quot;fencing&quot; developed into grappling, until one knight lay one the ground. Then the superior knight could take out a dagger and stab the other (that one will of course fight back; if you are on the ground in armour, you are not like a bug on its back. But I can tell you, if you got tackled and thrown onto the ground, then your head will probably hurt. A lot) knight (<a href="https://wiktenauer.com/images/c/c1/Cod.I.6.2%C2%BA.1_24r.png" target="_blank">Cod.I.6.2º.1</a>, <a href="http://manuscriptminiatures.com/media/manuscriptminiatures.com/original/1190-32.jpg" target="_blank">BNF Français 356</a>).</p>
<p>So, yeah...I hope that clears some questions.</p>
<p>Edit: A gold and silver award??? You absolute madlads! Thank you from the bottom of my heart!</p>
<p>Edit 2: Even platinum and so many responses? Whoa, guys; calm down! :-DEventually I will try to answer all of your questions and update this post with additional info, but this is gonna take time because where I live its around 11 p.m. now, so...I will do that later, alright?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit 3:<br />
[1]: Because many people asked; yes; in most cases a knight would actually be taken prisoner and ransom would have been demanded. However the question here is how knights were killed, so the whole topic of ransom is off-topic.<br />
[2]: in the late-medieval times certain helmets were developed that offered a good protection against lances, e.g. the frogmouth helmet (can be seen quite frequently in manuscripts in the 1420s). However, at least to my knowledge, those are joust helmets. The problem on the battlefield is that while one can get air with a visor on and see something, visibilty is still reduced, especially with a frogmouth. Therefor, a compromise must be made. Either one utilised full protection, or one utilised enhanced visibility and breathing possiblity. An example for that is Henry V. We know that he was injured in the face by an arrow, however as seen in <a href="http://manuscriptminiatures.com/media/manuscriptminiatures.com/original/121-4.jpg" target="_blank">comtemporary manuscripts</a>, full-face-cover helmets already existed. So, again: it's always a compromise.<br />
[3] Quite a lot of people brought up the topic of maces, bec de corbin, etc. Those weapons were of course used too and could be devastating (See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZUgxWLfCwY" target="_blank">here</a> for (among other stuff) a demonstration of a warhammer from horeback). However, one has to keep in mind that especially longswords served as status symbols and are more versatile than maces. So; were these weapons used? Of course. I just mainly did not cover them before because I though that this would be too much information but generally one can say; if a poleaxe worked, then a mace probably worked too.<br />
[4] On a sidenote: Of course it was not the case that armour was indestructible. Especially something like poleaxes could work as &quot;can-openers&quot; for a lack of a better word. Given that however, swords could probably not slice through armor and in addition to that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBxdTkddHaE" target="_blank">arrows could probably not pierce armour</a>. At least not proper, knightly armour, meaning &quot;the good stuff&quot;. It's a difference of course if you are basically a millionaire and get fitted, custom-made armour crafted by dedicated craftsmen (armourer or &quot;platener&quot; [originated from plate {armour}]) or if you are a poor farmer and have to visit the local village blacksmith.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Going into the early renaissance swords were carried as sidearms the way a pistol would be carried today. The primary weapons were mostly polearms or mauls (warhammer, mace, etc) the polearms of the time had a long thin spike on the top to either pierce plate or work into weak points where the armor was thin like the visor or armpit.  Lower down they usually had an axe blade or hammer on one side and a pick or hook on the other. A group of Franciscan monks treating the wounded after a battle kept record of the wounds inflicted. Something  like 80% were to the head with another 10% to the hands. Knights also used to carry a weapon called a misericorde or mercy knife. It was basically a 14” ice pick they would use to dispatch the wounded. Then add in the crossbow and longbow which could pierce plate, and eventually firearms and you see why plate armor was eventually phased out. That being said mounted and armored knights were the tanks of their time. Huge pain in the ass to bring down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was a documentary, <a href="https://youtu.be/4eDtsnQnFfQ" target="_blank">King Richard III, New Evidence</a>, which may be relevant. It was made after the remains of Richard III were found. They put a man, with a spinal deformity similar to Richard's, into a reproduction suit of plate armour.</p>
<p>The surprise was (for most people) how mobile an armoured man was. The image of a knight being winched onto his horse is a modern myth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actual knights didn't really kill each other all that much.  If another knight was defeated he was usually worth more alive because he could be ransomed.  </p>
<p>The code of chivalry was mainly a way of ensuring that a knight could survive a defeat and return to the fun of warfare with dignity instead of being dead.  </p>
<p>The code of chivalry only extended to knights and had no bearing on the common folk who knights usually slaughtered and raped in mass for fun.  </p>
<p>One of the reasons for starting the crusades was because the Pope wanted all of these barely controlled serial killers to stop killing other Europeans and maybe do something useful.  It was kind of a win win if the church could get them out of Europe and use their fondness for slaughter as a foreign power play.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Late-period plate was indeed very protective against most weapons.  Not just the quality of the steel but its coverage was quite high.  A sword just can't get through the plate itself.</p>
<p>However, the joints, though covered by chain, was still vulnerable to some deep, penetrating, specialized attacks.  A very strong stab can bust through chain.  The visor was also quite vulnerable.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hlIUrd7d1Q&t=1m49s" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hlIUrd7d1Q&t=1m49s</a> shows these takedown techniques.  Note these seem to require the attacker being in armor himself, as the techniques involve catching the opponent's blade on part of your own body.</p>
<p>There is a dagger specifically designed to defeat chain mail joints:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misericorde_(weapon" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misericorde_(weapon</a>)</p>
<p>However, I am unsure if there was any combat style that started with this small weapon.  I think it always came out after a takedown.</p>
<p>Truth be told, if a lone guy in full plate tried to take on 3 unarmored guys in a bar fight with a sword, if someone came at him with a chair first and blocked a single blow, they could still knock him down, get his sword away from him, sit on him, and threaten him with a butter knife in the visor.  So armor does not alone make you into a tank.</p>
<p>In many cases, capturing a knight was a better goal because they can be ransomed.  There was actually a code of honor- once a nobleman surrendered, they would not attempt an escape and in fact often left unshackled on their own honor.  </p>
<p>Once you had a takedown and sit on their chest with a dagger at the neck, you &quot;won&quot; and got a surrender.  </p>
<p>Partial armor was MUCH more common than full plate.  Often not covering the legs at all.  It is easier to put on and move.  It took care of MOST of the risk, esp arrows.  Keep in mind full plate's protection pretty much ends once you get knocked down by an opponent who knows how to defeat it.  </p>
<p>So they focus in acting as units anyways and try to avoid getting overrun, where neither a simple chestpiece OR full plate armor will  save you</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
