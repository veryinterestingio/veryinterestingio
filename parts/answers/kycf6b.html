		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Read the other answers about powers of two. But with flash technology today there’s no need to stay with those standard sizes apart from tradition. The storage has to have spare capacity to deal with defects and failures so a 1GiB drive has slightly more storage than that internally. With SSDs you can get sizes like 200GB, 240GB and 256GB. Spinning disks have had sizes like this for even longer. Even the early floppy disks were multiples of 360 or 400kiB.</p>
<p>So, tradition, and having a common set of sizes for all manufacturers makes it easy for consumers to compare value.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As you probably know digital computers and storage are implemented using binary logic circuitry and this makes it convenient to work with numbers that are powers of two.  In the case of storage, adding 1 bit to the range of your addressable storage also doubles the storage size.  It is probably also convenient for the circuit layout to simply widen or mirror in a symmetric way (two paths instead of one, two blocks instead of one) existing structures rather than create new ad-hoc structures to deal with odd amounts of storage...</p>
<p>EDIT: I completely missed that this is an ELI5.  Ignore.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of great answers, but to go even more for kids, let's say you have 8 light switches. This means you can count from 0 to 8 pretty easy. But computers are super good at adding. What if instead of each being worth one, we make them worth 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128? Now by flipping those 8 light switches on and off I can represent any number between 0 and 255. (Remember the original Zelda game out at 255 rupees? Yes, I'm old...)</p>
<p>So the next step is obviously to add another light switch, but we don't have to start at the beginning. The next switch can be worth 256 so now I can represent any number between 0 and 511, the next switch takes me to 1023, and the one after that will take you to 2047. We'll keep adding more and more switches until we can store all the cat pictures...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because it's based on multiples of two: 2,4,8,16,32... (base 2 mathematics) instead of multiples of 10, which is our standard human number system (base 10 mathematics). Computers use base 2 mathematics essentially because of binary code (where everything is a 1 or a 0). There's a ton more I could get into such as exponents etc, but that should suffice for a 5 year old.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to all the other answers I’d just like to point out that this is not always the case. For example in graphics cards it’s quite common to see 3 or 6GiB or 12GiB of VRAM capacity. In this case it’s because some GPUs have a 192 bit memory bus (it’s a half-way step between 128bit and 256bit) and use (usually) one memory chip for each 32bit slice. So you end up with 6*32bit memory chips. You can then pick e.g. 512MiB or 1GiB sizes for each chip, ending up at 3 or 6GiB respectively.</p>
<p>GPUs in general have quite interesting interface widths: 64, 128, 192, 256, 320, 384 bit are all common. Combine this with the fact that most memory chips have a 32bit interface and you end up with total memory capacities like 12GiB (192bit/32bit*2GiB) or 10GiB (320bit/32bit*1GiB). Interface width is also the main reason why high end models usually have more VRAM and higher bandwidth. They just use more memory chips in parallel. But it is more expensive to do so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
