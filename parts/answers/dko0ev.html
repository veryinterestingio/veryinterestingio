		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All liquids have what's called a vapor pressure. Essentially, if you leave the liquid sitting open to air it evaporates, often very slowly, until there's a certain concentration (partial pressure) of it in the air. The vapor pressure also depends on temperature, which is why hot air can be more humid than cold air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you have less than 100% humidity, water is constantly evaporating. If you leave a glass of water in your house for long enough, it will eventually all evaporate off like you expect. It is just a relatively slow process.  The kinetics of evaporating water in the atmosphere is controlled by 2 things</p>
<ol>
<li>At the boundary layer between the water and air, the air will have a concentration gradient of water vapor. When water evaporates, the air immediately above the water will be saturated with water vapor. Until that water vapor moves away, you will not evaporate more water. You can speed this up by forcing air flow past the surface of the water to pull away the water vapor. This is typically the limiting factor for how quickly water evaporates. </li>
<li>Evaporating water takes a lot of energy so as more of it evaporates, the water becomes colder. Eventually you reach a point where you will not evaporate any faster because you water has cooled down to much. We see this with a wet bulb thermometer, which measures the temperature you would get if you wrapped a thermometer with a wet cloth, then spun it around really fast. It is a really important number for designing water cooling towers.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps simplest way to explain this in one fact would be  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>water isn't same temperature everywhere</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you look close enough, molecules have really random energies<br />
When molecule on the surface suddenly gets &quot;hot&quot; enough, it goes up and away<br />
When molecule in the air collides with surface, it &quot;cools&quot; and comes down again</p>
<p>Both effects are happening all the time, even for solids (although, of course, it can be harder)<br />
There's even a way to cool stuff close to absolute zero based exactly on this randomness of temperature - &quot;hot&quot; ones escape, cold ones are left inside</p>
<hr />
<p>Other thing that might not be intuitive is that it's quite hard for vapour to condense even if there's lots of it - there must be some starting point<br />
In rain clouds, it is dust particles</p>
<p>Similar effect happens to super-cooled water - when water is clean, it is hard for it to start crystallizing</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Temperature is simply the AVERAGE thermal energy of a system. Individual molecules may have higher or lower kinetic energies than this. The higher energy molecules escape and become vapor. The remaining liquid molecules then lose some of their total thermal energy. This explains why sweating cools us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
