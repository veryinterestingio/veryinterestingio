They market the products however they want, and if someone thinks they're lying then they either report them to the authority overseeing advertising (which may or may not pursue the issue), or take them to court.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Consumer product safety has only 1 concern, YOUR HEALTH.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter if the product kills 100 trees if released into the wilderness, as long as it doesn't make you ill, it's &quot;safe&quot;</p>
<p>Flushable wipes arn't &quot;safe&quot; to flush, they are safe to use. meaning using them to wipe your self won't cause illness or harm.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Flushable wipes are safe to use. You just shouldn't flush them because they clog the pipes.</p>
<p>However, I'll agree with you here that they should not be able to put &quot;flushable&quot; in the package.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
