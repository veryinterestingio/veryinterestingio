		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's like grape juice vs wine.<br />
Same main ingredient, but different process, different admixture.   </p>
<p>Tofu<br />
i) Boiled soy bean , blend, filter and let it cool<br />
ii) Add vinegar /  Glucono delta-lactone (<em>GDL</em>)<br />
iii) Pour it into a container and cover with cotton canvas, and press, after several hour, voila..<br />
*the ingredient are only soy and acid, that's why it's almost no flavor.  </p>
<p>Soy sauce<br />
i) Boiled soy bean<br />
ii) Mix soy bean with flour and <a href="https://www.clearspring.co.uk/blogs/news/8024723-koji-the-culture-behind-japanese-food-production" target="_blank">Koji</a> . Koji ia a microorganism, scientific name  <em>Aspergillus orizae.</em> (Just imagine how we use yeast to make bread).<br />
iii) After that, this mixture will be incubated / dried under the sun about a week. During this time, that's microorganism will digest the protein and carbohydrates of the soy bean. There are fungus that fill the soybean. This <a href="https://tvsarawak.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tempe.jpg" target="_blank">picture</a> will give you some idea, how it's look like, fungus with soybean.<br />
iv) After that, this soybean will soak on salt water, then fermentation process begin, and this process can take as long as 7 month (if they still use traditional method). Besides, this fermentation make soy bean which is white in color, turn to black.<br />
v) After this solution &quot;matured&quot;, it will be filtered. Then we have a raw soy sauce.<br />
vi) Other than preservative, other ingredient will be ad to add more flavor, such as caramel  and spices.<br />
vii) Lasty, the soy sauce will be boiled in order to pasteurized it, then voila..</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Traditionally soy sauce is fermented with water, wheat, soy and salt along with the fermenting agents. This process takes a while. </p>
<p>Many soy sauce varieties found in the grocery store use a much faster method that requires artificial colors and flavorings.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
