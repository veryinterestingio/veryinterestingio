		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Are there specific health concerns to be aware of for using essential oils for non-medicative purposes, like pleasant scents or flavors in cooking? In other words, do the health issues of essential oils come from using them instead of &quot;real&quot; medicine, or do they raise concerns in their own right?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some essential oils brands (I'm looking at you, doTerra) provide their marketing teams with &quot;recipes&quot; for various mixtures of oils to alleviate symptoms of various illnesses from gout to leukemia. This misleading marketing scheme could have dire circumstances for patients who discard traditional, evidence based approaches to treatment in favor of a &quot;natural&quot; treatment. How do you respond when patients or even acquaintances mention the use of essential oils for treatment of serious medical problems? And is there any work being done to legislate this misleading marketing out of existence that you are aware of?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some say that essential oils like lavender are effective anti-microbial agents and are recommended for cleaning (i.e. kitchen counters).  (1) are essential oils effective anti-microbial agents and (2) if so what concentration/potency would they need to be used at to be effective in household cleaning?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
