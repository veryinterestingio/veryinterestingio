		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because there is a long pipeline of technologies in the research labs and equipment labs of many many firms involved in semiconductor manufacturing. Modern CPUs etc represent the apex of human mass manufacturing technology. The infrastructure (equipment, factories, test etc) are in the 10's of BILLIONS of dollars located around the world. The supply chain is long and tortuous with many ICs travelling thousands of miles in the manufacturing process (Japan, Europe, Taiwan, US etc etc for die, fab, test, packaging assy ...) </p>
<p>At the end of the day, there is no real economic feasibility making a hugely powerful CPU that yields 1 out of a thousand in a factory. The supply chain commits billions of dollars annually in capital equipment and many hundreds of millions more in research and development in material sciences, computing, physics, robotics, sensors, laser development, chemistry.... involving hundreds if not thousands of PhDs working on various areas. </p>
<p>And this is cutting edge - so there is no such thing as &quot;start here and we'll end here next year&quot;, many areas and approaches are tried and abandoned. Any technology introduced this year probably spent a decade prior in research and development, equipment design, testing with constant set backs and challenges. </p>
<p>My guess is that a lot of people realize this (semiconductor design and mfg) isn't easy but I also believe that most people underestimate how complex this is by an order of magnitude or more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since you already have a technical answer, the other viewpoint is: By spending <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/INTC/intel/research-development-expenses" target="_blank">over 13 billion a year in R&amp;D.</a></p>
<p>Why? Itâ€™s not driven by consumer demand. The goal is to force competitors to also spend huge amounts on R&amp;D (hopefully money they donâ€™t have) or risk falling a generation of chip design behind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cpus are all about the size of the die.  Each wafer is a certain size that they cut up into different dies.  Making the wafer is what costs money so they make more money by getting more dies from a single wafer.  </p>
<p>So basically they could make one super powerful cpu that would take up the entire wafer but itd be super expensive and there could be difficulty cooling it.  </p>
<p>So at the end of the day it's about balancing the heat and the total size of the die.  </p>
<p>Making transistors smaller allows for smaller dies for the same given design.  </p>
<p>Making more efficient designs allows for more compute power for a given die size.  </p>
<p>Adding more cores allows for more processing power at the cost of more die size.  </p>
<p>So basically it's about balancing the die size, making the transistors smaller, and more efficient designs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think a more direct way of answering your question is: It's not an easy feat to fabricate the hardware. </p>
<p>A CPU is a complex mesh of little circuits which do little specific things, then have to talk to other little circuits which do more different little things. How fast or efficiently they do those little things, how many different little things they can do, how closely they can approximate other more different things they can do, and how fast they can talk to other bits of the cpu all matter to overall performance. </p>
<p>The three main ways of boosting total  performance are refining the little parts to do their specific job faster or better, to make things smaller so that the electrical pulses can move around faster, and to move little bits of the processor around so they sit closest to what they are relevant to. </p>
<p>The ELI5 I would use is consider the electrical pulses like trucks moving cargo (data) between different parts of a supply chain. You can move warehouses around the city so theyre closer together (die layout changes), you can make the roads shorter by relocating sites (transistor/die shrinks), and you can upgrade your warehouses so you can get products more assembled so they need to be moved around less (architectural improvements).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This might further confuse the issue but &quot;nanometer size&quot; is pretty much just a marketing exercise these days; it is <em>somewhat</em> useful for comparing products from the same manufacturer but means basically nothing across manufacturer lines as they can basically define what to measure in nanometers and just measure the smallest thing.
An example of this is Intel's new (upcoming?) 10nm process. You'd think given AMD is using a 7nm process they'd have much more efficient and market leading designs...the number implies theyre 30% ahead, right? But in reality Intel made a really aggressive push with regard to transistor density (how closely together the transistors sit), and the result is a similar power/efficiency level in spite of the different marketing terms. </p>
<p>Now, does someone else want to delve into TDP? ðŸ˜‹</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
