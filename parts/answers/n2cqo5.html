		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people with Down Syndrome have a number of other health problems besides the cognitive issues that people mainly notice. For example many have a heart problem, atrioventricular septal defect. If untreated or poorly treated, this can lead to a very early death. There are a number of other health problems they can have. With better health care, they will live a lot longer. They’re getting better health care now than they used to. They’ve stopped the institutionalizing so much and now often mainstream them as kids, which has had great results.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>During WW2 in Germany and I believe Austria, many kids and babies who were institutionalized for disabilities were killed by being out outside without sufficient clothes so they would get pneumonia and die. </p>
<p>Institutions tend to be mental hospitals or called insane asylums. People there get maintenance care at best.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your statement is pretty correct from what I can tell. Since the 1980’s, there have been numerous studies that have led to better insights into Down syndrome cases and medical treatments. Further developments have also led to better schooling and life adaption programs (Where they learn life skills such as having a  place to live, paying rent / bills, and even college educations).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Back in the day, these people were thrown in institutions where the most minimal levels of care were provided. There was also a large aversion to mentally handicapped individuals and society was mainly ok with these people being swept under the rug to keep up appearances. Hence the life expectancy being so low</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The life expectancy of the patient with downs syndrome has increased because the medical system is much better at treating the immediate and chronic problems of these patients. We’re simply much better at keeping them alive day by day.
The issue of institutions is debatable. Without proper care, life expectancy in a poor home will be poor. In a good institution with good care will be good.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
