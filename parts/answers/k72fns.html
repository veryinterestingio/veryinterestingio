		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ooh, so woodpeckers are specialist grub eaters - they're optimised to bore holes in live wood so they can insert their grabby, sticky tongues and slurp out tasty beetle larvae. As such, their tongues are <a href="https://www.earthtouchnews.com/media/1946375/14063876_1122284291198411_420599611955500473_n.jpg?width=710&amp;height=474&amp;mode=crop&amp;upscale=false" target="_blank">incredibly long</a> - so long in fact, the only way for them to fit inside their heads is to wrap them <a href="https://i.imgur.com/qKQGZWj.jpg" target="_blank">up 'round the back of their skulls</a>. Pretty gnarly.</p>
<p>We used to think it was this extended tongue that cushioned the brain case from the extreme forces exerted on a typical woodpecker brain case. You'll still find lots of articles online citing this. We now know this is, mostly, untrue.</p>
<p>It's the combination of strong neck muscles and the micro- and macro-mechanical properties of the beak, brain case and hyoid (tongue) bone that prevents woodpecker brains turning into jelly.</p>
<p>Their beaks are made up of  three layers; an outer horny sheath made of overlapping keratin scales (the 'rhamphotheca', same stuff as your fingernails), a middle foamy layer, and an inner layer of dense bone. In woodpeckers, the scales comprising their rhamphotheca are <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/cms/asset/9522e1e1-9568-4ccb-8436-c4210d5474b7/rsif20140274f10.jpg" target="_blank">unusually elongated</a>, allowing them to slide over each other upon impact, thus dissipating pressure via shearing (it also continuously grows, so is self-sharpening, preventing blunting). Pressure is further dissipated into the foamy layer, whilst the inner bony core channels the pressure wave <a href="https://www.asknature.org/wp-content/uploads/strategy/438bfe12686a92af28a607ac3dc002b7/figure2.jpg" target="_blank">upwards and around the skull</a>, along the path shaped by their somewhat spongy hyoid (tongue) bone, and then back forwards along their lower beak, as a counter to incoming force - all avoiding pressure being directly applied to the brain case itself. Their lower beak is finally designed such that any pressure not absorbed is redirected downwards away from the skull, where their neck muscles can deal with it. </p>
<p>Their brain is also relatively smooth, and sits tightly next to the inner brain case, so there's little room for it to jostle about.</p>
<p>In short, essentially every aspect of their skull is optimised to either absorb or otherwise dissipate n' channel impact force away from where their brain sits. The biomechanical properties of their skull are useful to study, as we can reapply what we learn to all sorts of human devices - from extra-protective crash helmets to all sortsa' industrial machinery.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Much of the internet will tell you it's because of their long tongue. Really, it's all to do with their bones maxing out on micro- and macro-pressure relief, diverting pressure to everything else but the brain. This means woodpeckers can better concentrate on developing zippy one-liners and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3XaPVpm6eo" target="_blank">zany laughs</a>.</p>
<p>... Maybe Woody could do with a concussion, tbh.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly adult woodpeckers actually have one of the halmark physical symptoms of traumatic brain injury. They accumulate the protein tau in their brains as aggregates (this is the same thing that happens in alzheimer's disease but in different regions of the brain). They don't apparently have any cognitive issues that come with it though which may be very interesting or may be just that were not good at assaying the cognition of a woodpecker ;)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There's a &quot;shock collar&quot; currently under commercial development for football players that can be used to protect them against concussion when it detects sudden impact. It quickly inflates against the neck and compresses the jugular veins.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
