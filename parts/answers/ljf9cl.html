		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At the ends of your chromosomes are sequences of DNA called telomeres. Their job is to keep your DNA from fraying. Think of them like the aglets at the ends of your shoelaces. As your DNA replicates over time your telomeres slowly unravel and get shorter. The rate at which telomeres shorten in a given species directly correlates with their average lifespans. Mice telomeres, for instance, were observed in one study as unraveling at a rate nearly 100x that of a human</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lifespan is but an attribute  that evolution gets to play with. Just like some animals are blessed with wings, fake wings, or 4 wings,  or underwater breathing, or scales vs. fur, so are some blessed with a good lifespan.<br />
We might think we're lucky compared to dogs but think about giant tortoises (150 years) and the monarch butterfly (6 months, I think).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
