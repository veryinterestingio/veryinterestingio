		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plagues used to spread to adjacent areas.  Occasionally ships would carry it some distance and it would just pop up.</p>
<p>Now with air travel if disease reaches a &quot;civilized&quot; area it spreads by air transport all around the world. </p>
<p>Ebola pops up in African towns with no transport system.   So it spreads in the town and then to nearby areas.   The airlines canceled flights to the country to prevent it from spreading.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is an entire field of study known as epidemiology. In short, it depends on the particular disease, but visual modeling usually looks something like fireworks that feed into each other as one person or animal introduces it to a new area and it spreads outward.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a biogeographer (who specializes in the distribution of forests not bacteria) my thought is <em>both</em>.</p>
<p>That is, a large-scale pattern of expanding territory of most species would be characterized by a gradual wave-like migration with sporadic long-range jumps that inspire waves from those points of colonization.</p>
<p>With plants and animals and such their populations are limited by the environment, their available habitat. With bacteria transmitted by humans the best habitat would be people, so the flu would find good habitat in larger interconnected populations (eg cities).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
