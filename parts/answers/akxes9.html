		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is exceptionally good evidence that Venus once had many oceans' worth of water.</p>
<p>One of the things we can measure is the enrichment of deuterium (heavy hydrogen) relative to hydrogen. We believe the primordial abundance was 1 deuterium atom for every 50,000 regular hydrogen atoms; this is also the abundance we observe in places like Jupiter.</p>
<p>On Venus, though, this abundance is more like 1 deuterium atom for every 60 hydrogen atoms, very different than primordial values. We believe that Venus likely did start out with that 1-in-50,000 deuterium abundance, but regular hydrogen being much lighter than deuterium had a much easier time escaping the planet, enhancing the abundance of deuterium relative to hydrogen.</p>
<p>When you work the math backwards, the amount of hydrogen the planet once had was enormous, and the only obvious solution to that was that Venus once had massive amounts of water (H<em><em>2</em></em>O) that subsequently evaporated, got split by UV light into its constituent atoms, and the hydrogen subsequently escaped the planet. The oxygen, meanwhile, appears to have bonded with the surface; we see tons of oxidized minerals on the surface.</p>
<p>It's still unclear if the original water was in liquid form (rather than water vapor or hydrated minerals), but it's very possible that Venus was once habitable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the modelling, but yeah-ish.  Accounting for the orbital changes involving Jupiter, 4 billion years ago could be a more proper timeframe.  And like u/Conscious_Mollusc said, a layer of the atmosphere still has environmental conditions that allow liquid water, or to put it another way:  for about 15km, starting from about 50km above the surface, both temperature and pressure are close to Earth's surface values.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Venus IS in the habitable zone of our sun.  Due to its extremely think CO2 atmosphere, the temperatures on the surface are hot enough to melt lead.  However, in the upper atmosphere, there are altitudes of &quot;normal&quot; temperates. Who knows, maybe someday there will be a floating city like Bespin!</p>
<p>Venus is a giant screaming warning to us about the danger of climate change as it suffered a natural run away green house gas event... Something Earth is on the verge of that is man made.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why is Venus' atmosphere seen as such an impossible obstacle in most media, but Mars' gravity and solar distance not? How is thinning the atmosphere of Venus by converting it into water or fuel through floating facilities not even discussed as a viable terraforming project, but greening icy and tiny and barren Mars is?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
