		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1)Tik Tok is owned by a chinese company that doesn't have the same copyright laws as American companies. So there some say they don't need to follow the same rules and regulations 2) I think the real big issue comes with monitization, if you aren't making money there isn't as big of an incentive to sue you because it costs money to sue and if you make zero or even just less money than it costs to sue you it's not worth suing you. Some people have called this being &quot;judgement proof&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This sub used to be good, now it's just everyone guessing. The answer to your question is: they don't really make their business deals public. It is assumed they either get by with fair use or have deals worked out with certain labels and artists.</p>
<p>But as recently as April 4th, some studios threatened to sue them, according to this source:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A body representing thousands of music publishing companies, including Universal, has threatened to sue video-sharing app TikTok for copyright infringement.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>YouTube is actually heaven in terms of copyright for their users. They have contracts with the big music and movie companies that they take copyright infringement on their shoulders with a bot system. That system is not perfect, but without it every tiny little streamer or let's player would have to have a full time lawyer just to get all the permissions for one average video out. Every little sentence and pixel you make money off can be seen as infringement and get you sued, normally, but YouTube is a safe bubble.</p>
<p>Here's a great video explaining it all in-depth:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tik Tom has general agreements in place with the music labels to use their content. The details of this are secret but they exist. </p>
<p>There’s no issues using the songs, Tik Tok and the rights owners have a deal in place for this to be all legit.</p>
<p>Edit; I don’t know why you’d downvote this. It’s public and well known they have deals and do payouts. They pay crap but it’s legit deals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These are actually all generally wrong. Artists can generally chose to release to apps like Tik Tok and instagram (my record label allows me to mark those selections, or choose to unmark them). I’m assuming labels have deals with those apps for previously released songs and everything as well, so they still make royalties. You can still get a copyright strike if you post a song as an actual post, not a story (as that’s run through Spotify). </p>
<p>TLDR- Tik Tok and music on Instagram stories are already monetized by the labels. Places where you create content independently from the app and use music are not monetized by default and result in copyright strikes for that reason.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
