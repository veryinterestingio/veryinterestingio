		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Emergency Physician here: It’s not because we expect <em>COVID</em> to be worse, it’s because of all the other Acute Febrile Respiratory Illnesses (AFRI) that ARE seasonal will also occur. Flu pushes US hospitals to brink of capacity most years without any additional new pandemic.  And because the symptoms of most are overlapping (and NOT mutually exclusive - people get flu and COVID), disguising between them is expected to be awful. This is why rapid testing (like 1 hour) is so important, but also why we are basically going to be locked down until there is a widely available vaccine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not seasonal because the disease is obviously still ravaging us in peak summer like you say. </p>
<p>However fall and winter are still of particular concern because of a few things: </p>
<p>1) even though the virus does survive in the heat and it should be even more stable (and thus more infectious) in the cold </p>
<p>2)human respiratory systems are vulnerable to infection in fall and winter because of the dry air. </p>
<p>3) if it's cold outside people are more likely to be inside spreading those sweet droplets around with inadequate ventilation </p>
<p>So even though the disease isn't seasonal there's still plenty reason to think things will get worse in the winter </p>
<p>Edit: those ain't the the only reasons either! Lots of good other responses like complications flu season will introduce</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also I think experts are worried about Flu season hitting at the same time. It does seem to be true that a majority of people whom get COVID have few or no symptoms. So imagine if they get COVID and Flu at the same time, then the Flu might be making them sneeze, have excess mucus, coughing, etc etc. Then they are more likely to spread both.</p>
<p>On top of that the hospitals will be hit hard with Flu patients (like they are most years) and COVID patients that are still coming in now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Personally, the thing that keeps me up at night when i think about this fall has nothing to do with whether or not the COVID virus becomes more or less transmissible in colder months. It’s actually the fact that in a few months we’ll be into regular old flu season. A bad flu year can already strain some public health systems, but we could be in a situation where some regions see a bad flu year while also contending with COVID spikes... and this year we get to find out what the flu does to lungs that have already been shredded by COVID.</p>
<p>So we could really be in for it. Get your flu shots y’all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No one knowledgeable expected it to be seasonal this year. Media and (especially) politicians talked it up, but that was either wishful thinking or (being generous) misunderstanding what the experts were saying. </p>
<p>Fauci (and others) very early on were saying things like “<a href="https://abc7news.com/coronavirus-warm-weather-seasonal-update-fauci/6089537/" target="_blank">Don't assume coronavirus fades in warm weather</a>”.  But Fauci did say things like the virus might “<a href="https://www.abc27.com/news/health/coronavirus/dr-fauci-covid-19-could-become-seasonal/" target="_blank">assume a seasonal nature”</a>, which is not the same thing - that’s saying that in the future, even when theres widespread immunity, the virus is not going to be eradicated, it will continue as a potential threat forever (like measles, today). In those conditions, with widespread immunity, and much lower transmissibility, the virus is more likely to show seasonal variations than today. </p>
<p>in other words, there might be a marginal influence of season. In a non-immune population like today, that might reduce the transmission (R0) from say 3.5 to 3.1 in summers, which is insignificant. In a future with say 2/3 of the population vaccinated or otherwise immune, the transmission might change from say 0.8 in the summers to 1.2 in the winters, which is huge - the latter can spread, the former will die out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
