		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The entire radio spectrum is &quot;noisy&quot;--there's interference in it from both man-made sources and natural ones (e.g. lightning strikes). If you tune the radio to a dead channel then all it will be picking up is that noise, which it amplifies and turns into the static that you hear. You still get the noise on actual radio channels, but it gets drowned out by the radio station you're tuned in to so you tend not to notice unless it's very bad.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm surprised I didn't hear this answer yet. One of the most dominant noise sources is the thermal noise generated from your system. You can think of heat as random motion or vibration of the matter in your antenna (and well...everything). That means the electrons are randomly moving, and moving electrons in a resistor makes small random voltages occur. This noise is multiplied by the effective receiver bandwidth. So cosmic noise maybe 10 dB above the fundamental noise floor.. Electrical storms and other man made noise can contribute, but MOST of the time, you're just hearing a bunch of warm electrons dancing around inside your radio.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You hear whatever radio electric waves are around that specific frequency. These are generated by each and every electric device, near of far. Tuning at a frequency means your receiver expects a specific signal (a carrier) at that frequency, with some power level, and it also expects data to be coded in a specific way on that carrier. FM radio means frequency modulation, so you get bits by adding a specific set of frequencies on the carrier for a specific length of time (or oscillations).</p>
<p>When there is no emitter, there is no power, but the system will still try to decode the signal like there was a carrier and modulation on it, which produce this noise. Smart receiver systems will try to follow the carrier, as it does move a bit, but when it gets too far from anything it will not &quot;autotune&quot; to the nearest, highest powered carrier detected.</p>
<p>Fun fact, there can be data in that noise. In fact, when you do not need a lot of bandwidth, say under 1000 bauds, you can transmit with a very low level of power, at noise level power or sometimes even less. It makes it &quot;invisible&quot;, since to everyone and anything that scans by trying to detect power levels higher than noise, it is drowned in noise.</p>
<p>I think the military uses that now (they used to use frequency jumps but that can be spied on now)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your radios antenna picking up all the background radio waves/interference from other electromagnetic waves.</p>
<p>When you tune a radio to a station number (or more specifically tune it to that specifically frequency) you pick up what the station is broadcasting with that frequency.</p>
<p>Typically, the this signal is strong enough to drown out any background static/background radiation/interference.</p>
<p>But, when you’re tuned to a station that isn’t broadcasting (that you’re out of range of any station that is broadcasting on that frequency. Your radio antenna is just picking up and playing all that background noise that typically gets drowned out.</p>
<p>Edit: to add a source of these waves/background noise that you’re picking up. They can come from things like radio stations that are too far away to receive clearly, or they could come from all the electronics and appliances like microwaves/handheld radios etc we have around in our modern world. </p>
<p>Or, for really sensitive equipment (or equipment away from lots of other sources of interference, it could even be radiation from space. The sun, stars, and even cosmic background radiation from the Big Bang all exist and can interact with our equipment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Basically, it’s electromagnetic radiation leftover from the big bang. Same as TV static (does that exist anymore? Lol). </p>
<p>Your radio is looking for electromagnetic signals, and it picks that up when it can find anything stronger (like a station’s signal).</p>
