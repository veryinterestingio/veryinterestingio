I’m not aware if there exists a max volume, but there’s definitely a threshold where it begins to cause damage to things.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sound is a pressure wave, and volume is basically the amount of pressure change it causes.</p>
<p>For a sustained sound, the maximum amplitude of this wave is equal to the ambient pressure, with the wave causing alternating regions of double pressure and vacuum. If you try to go higher, you break the wave form and your sound wave becomes a shockwave, since pressure can't dip below vacuum levels.</p>
<p>At sea level averages, this limit works out to around \~194 decibels.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The size of the vibrations - how far the matter moves. There is indeed a maximum possible volume, that's pretty much what a sonic boom is.</p>
<p>ETA: The maximum is less about compression, more about decompression. Specifically, it's the point that the pressure wave leaves a vacuum in its wake.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Look at the speaker on a stereo system.  The cone of the speaker vibrates, not up and down, but towards you and away from you.  Sea waves go up and down, sound waves are usually bursts of compression and decompression.</p>
<p>So yes, the amount of air that's vibrating is volume, but at loud concerts you can feel the sound vibrations in your chest, and if you keep increasing the volume it can start doing damage like an explosion shock-wave would.</p>
<p>So, as far as &quot;max volume&quot;, the atmosphere is certainly capable of transmitting shockwaves that are very damaging, and way beyond what you would call &quot;sound&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>imagine that wave line. the number of times it goes up and down per second is the pitch and the height it goes up and down is volume. </p>
<p>now like ripples in a pond, small ripples will dissapear quicker than big ripples, and small rippled can be seen on a still pond, but not on a wavy pond.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
