Your body doesn’t have much air mixed in with the liquids and your blood vessels have valves and can tighten to prevent blood from draining to other parts of your body when you move around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I mean to a degree you can. If you swallow a lot of air and water you can hear it slosh. That said most often you won’t be taking in enough air to have this effect and having air is very needed to hear sloshing. This is why urine can’t slosh inside you as there won’t ever be air inside the bladder. Same for the brain though the brain does have connective tissue as well. Fun fact when fighter pilots pull high G forced their blood can pool in their legs. This is kinds like you sloshing idea somewhat and is why fighter pilots pass out in maneuvers sometimes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>(ELI5 answer, just to play by the rules: you don't feel it for a few reasons, depending where the fluid is. Some of it is because it's always there so you're used to it, others areas the space the fluid is in is completely full, so it doesnt &quot;slosh&quot;. In other areas, bodies don't have the type of receptors that notice that kind of motion, and in still some others, like your stomach, as others have noted - you actually DO feel it sometimes.  Your bones are always wet though...)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
