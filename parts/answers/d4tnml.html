		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Technically it does, we just have more receptors for pain in our mouths. Because the chemical capsaicin, which is responsible for that, doesn’t actually burn, it just uses receptors in your mouth to fool it into believing it is being burned, and they happen to only affect certain receptors. We also know it does cause that reaction the whole way down due to the fact that too much gives you an upset stomach, which will result in the body trying to eject it either by ridding your body of it the usual route by very quickly passing it through your intestines, or vomiting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It burns your throat, and everything else in your digestive system too, as you know from what happens the next time you go to the bathroom. Its just that it hurts your mouth <em>so much more</em> that it really doesn't even register. Its like if you fall and break a leg, stubbing a toe at the same time won't really get your attention.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it’s not burning anything? You are just tasting an ingredient called capsaicin. </p>
<p>Also why water achieves nothing and could actually make it worse. Water doesn’t neutralize capsaicin, instead it ends up spreading it all around your mouth to even more receptors. </p>
<p>Foods that have some acidic element will neutralize capsaicin (dairy, citric juices, vinegar, etc).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It can, but only certain spots as your throat is covered in a mucous to protect from your acid reflux burning a hole in your throat. If you got acid reflux in your mouth then your mouth would burn.  Same for spicy foods</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
