		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you play around with two magnets you'll see that they have two sides where they are stronger. Depending on how you hold them they either attract each other or repel each other. If you add a third magnet and do some systematic tests you can find out that the magnets have two sides you can distinguish - they are called north (N) and south (S) pole (I'll come to the reason of that). If N of one magnet faces S of the other the two magnets attract each other. If N faces N or S faces S they repel each other.</p>
<p>People played around a bit with magnets. Instead of holding them in your hand you can also put them on a small piece of wood in a bowl of water, for example, then it can rotate easily and it is more sensitive to smaller forces. It turns out that they always align north/south on Earth. The pole facing north was called the N pole, the pole facing south is the S pole. What does that mean? Well, Earth itself is a (weak but huge) magnet. If the N pole of a magnet faces north then it must be attracted by a natural S pole - at the North Pole of Earth. Quite counter-intuitive, but we are now stuck with that definition.</p>
<p>It turns out this is just an approximation, the magnetic poles are not exactly aligned with the poles defined by the rotation of Earth. In addition the magnetic field of Earth changes over time, which means the positions of the poles change, too. We know they can even &quot;flip&quot; - the magnetic poles go from one (rotation) pole to the other. This happened many times in the past. Before such a flip the magnetic field of Earth gets weaker and the magnetic poles wander around quicker (as they are more influenced by smaller disturbances if the field is weaker). The magnetic field protects satellites and (a bit less) the ground from radiation that can be dangerous. Without it many satellites can fail and we might get sightly higher radiation doses at the surface, too.</p>
<p>The quickly wandering magnetic poles plus an observed weakening of the overall field suggest that such a pole reversal might happen in the not so distant future - which means something like 1000 years. It is not guaranteed, however, it is also possible that the field gets stronger again and nothing special happens.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The inner core of our planet is molten metal and as it flows around it creates a magnetic field around the Earth, changes in the direction of the flow changes where the poles are. The magnetic field around the Earth protect the Earth from being bombarded by Solar radiation, without the magnetic field virtually all life on Earth would cease to exist. The North and South poles occasionally swap places but it does take a very long time whether one is currently about to happen is unknown at the moment - <a href="https://youtu.be/QGTPr3CG6GA" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/QGTPr3CG6GA</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's an awesome guy on youtube who buys dangerously large magnets and does interesting things with them. Just moving some of his larger magnets requires an empty room and great amounts of thought and preparation.</p>
<p>One of the things he did was explore the shape of the magnetic field, and he goes so far as to put a dangerously stron gmagnet in a globe to show how it matches what a compass does.</p>

<p>If you watch that video, you'll have a better understanding of the earth's magnetic core and the shape of the magnetic field.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Magnetic poles are the most Northern and Southern points on Earth as determined by a standard (magnetic) compass. The shifting of the poles has several implications, but if this is derived from the post yesterday about redrawing maps, air travel is done by magnetic compass, as is some marine travel (talking about individuals sailing private vessels, not big merchant shipping vessels). If the poles move, a plane flying the same route as it always has will have to adjust it's heading (direction of travel) according to the shift in the pole. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
