		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Microwaves are electromagnetic waves. A microwave oven uses electromagnetic waves with a high energy density to transmit energy to the food to be cooked. <del>The cooking process works in this way: Water molecules oscillate with the EM field inside the oven and rub against each other. This dissipates the energy as heat and the temperature rises.</del> (Edit: Wrong explanation, see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/bdeb4e/why_are_microwave_ovens_made_of_metal_but_we_cant/ekygut6/" target="_blank">here</a> for a better explanation by /u/naman1901).<br />
The metal casing is there to keep the EM wave inside the oven. This serves two purposes:   </p>
<ol>
<li>EM waves are used for other applications: Telecommunication systems like wifi or bluetooth operate in the same frequency range and would be heavily disturbed without it (they are still mildly disturbed due to leaks. You can test that by operation a bluetooth audio connection near a running microwave oven).   </li>
<li>The energy density needs to be high to have the cooking effect. This is done by building the oven in such a way that it serves as a resonating cavity for the microwaves, which produces a standing wave field inside the oven.   </li>
</ol>
<p>Now to answer your question: The metal case is grounded. This means that the electric potential is zero everywhere on the surface of the metal. Due to the grounding, the electric field is zero everywhere on this surface (resulting in point 2 of the list above).
Without a potential difference (voltage), no charge concentration will happen and no current will flow between two points of the case. (Disclaimer: The stuff said above should be correct in theory, but only approximately correct in practice since the metal does not conduct perfectly).
If you put a metal object inside the oven, it will connect two points of different electrical potential, a current will flow, this will:</p>
<ol>
<li>lead to dissipation because the object connects points of differing electric potential</li>
<li>Change the field pattern inside the oven.</li>
<li>Might cause electric sparks at pointy tips of the object
This is bad for the lifetime of the component that produced the EM wave since it needs to output more energy.
Additionally, the sparks might ignite flammable material you put into the oven.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Microwaves are high-frequency radio waves. They heat food by being absorbed (by the water in the food, mostly).  An antenna, and in particular a metal antenna, will absorb this energy much better.</p>
<p>In metal, the shapes that make good antennas are much more common than the shapes that do not make good antennas.  The walls and oven racks for example are carefully designed not to be good antennas.  </p>
<p>But a randomly shaped piece of metal will probably absorb most of the energy in the oven, and do what antennas do:  convert it to electricity.  </p>
<p>There is so much energy in a microwave oven that if it is converted to electricity, it will arc and generate lightning.  Or get melting hot.</p>
<p>Even if the arcing does not catch things on fire, the little bolts of lightning will damage the walls of the oven, which are also metal, and although the walls start out designed to be bad antennas, the arc damage can cause small antenna sites which will suck energy out of the oven over time.  Or worse.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
