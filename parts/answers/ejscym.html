		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Long Answer:</strong>  When you have a cold, the viruses trigger a form of your body's defenses called histamines. These histamines are meant to make it easier for white blood cells to pass through blood vessels and capillaries to combat germs/pathogens (they're pretty much clearing a path for the body's &quot;army&quot; to combat the invaders). This has the side effect of inflaming your nasal passages and producing more, thinner mucus.</p>
<p><strong>Simplified ELI5 Answer:</strong> Basically, your body tries to defend itself from invaders, but in the process causes collateral damage, leading to your once dry nose and countless tissues being filled with mucus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like Zephyr93 said, the histamines opening up the blood vessels so that the white blood cells may pass (diapedesis) does cause collateral damage in the form of inflammation causing thinner mucus, but our bodies always produce snot and other slimes at any time. It just becomes much more noticeable when we're sick.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The mucosal membranes in our respiratory system play an important role in the first line of defense in our immune systems, creating a physical barrier of slime and essentially &quot;flooding&quot; the pathogens out. This is why we produce snot and cough up sputum when sick.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's part of a general strategy of clearing pathogens sometimes called &quot;weep and sweep&quot;: make lots of fluid to trap pathogens, then push it out of your body. If you have a respiratory infection, that's snot and sneezing/coughing. If it's a gut infection, that's mucus and diarrhea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
