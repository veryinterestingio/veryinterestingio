		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fellow microbiologist here and I have so many questions but I'll try to keep it simple!
Have you been able to do any comparative genomics between &quot;newly awakened&quot; bugs and their contemporary counterparts? If so, have you seen any genes lost or gained? What is the risk of reawakening pathogens that haven't been seen in hundreds or thousands of years?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>1) What do we know about the microbes that have already thawed? Are there viruses, bacteria and fungi?</p>
<p>2) There's of course a lot of concern about theoretical dangers... but what are some of the theoretical advantages they could bring? What can we learn from them?</p>
<p>3) Back to that danger issue: have you found anything yet that makes you worried?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
