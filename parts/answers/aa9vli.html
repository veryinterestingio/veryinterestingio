The ending is the left over waste products remaining inside your body from the fight and your body finding methods to move them from essential functioning areas or just expelling them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've always thought of fighting a cold being similar to an army fighting a battle at war.  Your white blood cells are your soldiers, the virus is the enemy.  When you reach the stage where you feel good except for the cough and sniffles, congratulations, your immune system has won!  But, like any bloody battle, there is a lot of cleanup involved.  So, your body flushes out the corpses and shrapnel with mucus.  When you cough and blow your nose, the battle-debris-filled mucus leaves the battlefield of your body to be properly disposed of.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the very beginning, the cold virus has found a home in your throat or nose and your body's defenses against are limited.  Because your body hasn't yet been trained to tag the virus for disposal, it's operating with a degree of camouflage and infects cells and begins to replicate quickly.  You'll get irritation around the site and you'll have a sore, inflamed throat.</p>
<p>Then your body starts to kick into gear and begins the immune response.  You might run a fever as your body overclocks your immune system and tries to make it too warm for invaders.  Types of white blood cells start to analyse the virus and develop antibodies, or basically tags that get stuck to the virus that scream 'kill me'.  More powerful, specialized immune cells join the war.  You're swelling around the infected site in response to damage and to deliver more resources to the fight.  You're generating mucus to slow infection, manage inflammation and help to expel the virus from your body.</p>
<p>The virus is desperately replicating and has hit its peak numbers, and has spread from the initial site to other areas of your respiratory tract.  Your immune system has it tagged though and is annihilating it in massive numbers.  Your white blood cells, of which you make a solid billion a day, are still sprinting to the fight.</p>
<p>Over the next few days, your immune system gets the upper hand and the virus dwindles.  The body turns to cleanup mode, coughing out residual gunk and slowly ticking down inflammation.</p>
<p>Some of those antibody blueprints stick around, protecting you if that particular viral infection tries again.  Unfortunately there are tons of viruses and virus variants hanging around, so chances are it'll all start over again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The common cold is also caused by a virus instead of a bacteria and viral infections tend to travel around. So first you may get a sore throat, then as your body clears that area the virus may travel to your sinuses giving you a feeling of congestion around your eyes and nose, and then finally the virus may travel down into your lungs giving you a cough. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
