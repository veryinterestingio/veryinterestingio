		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what i have read the answer is yes, but it is not neccesarily the brain itself that burns the extra calories, it could be the rest of the body. It could be result of increased heart rate and general awareness/stress levels in the body as a result of the difficult task putting us into some kind of &quot;performance mode&quot;. </p>

<p>A similar question has been asked some time ago, with some good answers:  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/38v6i5/is_the_metabolic_rate_of_a_person_who_is_doing/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/38v6i5/is\_the\_metabolic\_rate\_of\_a\_person\_who\_is\_doing/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/38v6i5/is\_the\_metabolic\_rate\_of\_a\_person\_who\_is\_doing/</a></a> </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Somewhat, but it's not a great way to work out or anything. Our brains already work nearly as hard as they can all the time - heck, they are doing quite a bit of work when we're asleep. Only a fraction of this stuff is what we would normally call &quot;thinking&quot;, but rather all the calculations that go into processing memories, picking up on social cues and just steering the body. Consciously thinking harder won't increase energy bill all that much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

He did a series of experiments that found that thinking hard does use more energy. Interesting read although very heavy going.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Studies show that the brain is very metabolically active and will actuallyburn about 109 calories per pound of its mass per day. So an average adultbrain being about 3 pounds burns 327calories per day! I hope that's helpful</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
