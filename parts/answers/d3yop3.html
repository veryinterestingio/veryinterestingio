Fight or Flight is in a primative area of the brain and is ingrained in our nervous system pretty well through evolution. Beings with strong survival instincts will survive over those that don't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Suicidal ideaton can be a coping mechanism, as weird as that sounds. As someone who has personally struggled with this, there is a weird sense of relief to consider that this moment of pain and angish might have an end point, even a self-inflicted one. For me, having suicidal thoughts was the only way I could <em>survive</em>, they were the hope of being without pain.</p>
<p>And as others have said, the fight or flight (or freeze) response takes place in a different part of the brain. It's an uncontrolled biological response to a threat, totally separate from the areas of the brain responsible for suicidal thoughts.</p>
<p>When I reached out for help and learned some better skills for coping with my emotional and mental pain, the desire to die slowly went away. When I was able to get help and heal, it was easy for me to want to live. I never actually wanted to die, I just didn't want to be in pain anymore. If anyone is struggling and feeling as if death is the only thing that will take the pain away, please believe me when I say that it is possible to have a full and meaningful life that you enjoy living, even if you can't imagine it now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because they reside in different parts of the brain and the brain is not as seamless as one we might think.</p>
<p>The suicidal part is the rational part of the brain (or not so rational in this case). The fight/flight part is the reptillian part of the brain and is autonomous.</p>
<p>Its actually why suicide is so hard and fairly astounding in those that succeed. It requires you to overcome literal millennia of programming (the natural programming to stay alive) and end your own life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine your brain is a smart phone. It comes with the clock and alarm apps. Chronic suicidal tendencies is yet another clock and alarm app, like a 3rd party app that was downloaded/acquired as a response to the outside world, people, situations, unique chemical development etc...</p>
<p>Now you have alarms that you will hear from your most basic preservation inclination and you also will have alarms that are similarly as powerful, that aren't helpful. The two alarms don't interact, it's more a question of how the human responds to them. To answer, you can be told the thing that is good or worst for you, but response is isn't universally knee jerk or sudden.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
