		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Biorhythms and habits. The explanation is a bit long, but there's a tl;dr at the end.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, the largest culprit are biorhythms. Living things do have internal clocks, it's not just a figure of speech. You have a lot of chemicals, mostly hormones, that go up and down regularly, in relation to what happens around and in you. These are all clocks that regulate when things must happen in your body.</p>
<p>The ones you may know best from school are those that regulate the female period. The hormones change during the month and define when the period should start.</p>
<p>You have biological clocks (or biorhythms or circadian rhythms) for other things too, such as eating, and also sleeping.</p>
<p>So now the new questions is &quot;what does regulate the hormones?&quot;</p>
<p>As for sleeping, scientists know sunlight has a big role, by stimulating the production of melatonin (which is the sleep hormone and requires sunlight). Stress, eating habits, exercise, etc also regulate the hormones connected to the sleep cycle.</p>
<p>But this just defines a rough, good sleep pattern (so that you are sleepy at night and wake up somewhere during the morning).</p>
<p>It's the habits that pinpoint the exact moment. </p>
<p>Your body and your brain are wired to create habits. It helps doing things right and not always worry about the details: imagine having to put all your attention to opening a door every single time you do it. Not efficient.</p>
<p>The brain works so that repeated behaviors change your connections brain connections. These connections are easily built if the behavior has a positive result. These new connections make it easier for the behavior to be repeated, even unconsciously. That's how you learn.</p>
<p>With all this stuff in mind, here's the tl;dr</p>
<p>When you go to sleep and wake up at the same time you tune the sleep hormones cycle so that it matches the same time frame every day. With time, this becomes an habit as the brain changes and learns to do that more often. It becomes easier to do that and all your biological mechanisms work fine, in tune and are happy that nothing is disrupting the equilibrium.</p>
<p>On a side note, this last part is also why having an healthy sleep pattern does wonders for health and mood.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have a &quot;master clock&quot; in your brain. It is like a bunch of dominos lined up in a circle but each one is a nerve cell that activates the one after it. They also trigger other hormones that notify your body to do things like wake up, go to sleep, get hungry, etc.
The clock is affected by your activity, exposure to light and sound, chemicals and drugs, and even diseases can change the clock.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Circadian rhythm or &quot;Biological clock&quot;, your body has an internal clock and it's programmable, just like an alarm.</p>
<p>Obviously getting up at the same time everyday programs it, but what I find SUPER interesting is you can program it just with thought, seriously try it! </p>
<p>No alarm needed, just before you fall asleep think &quot;I HAVE to wake up at XXXX time&quot; fill yourself with the thoughts and sensations of waking up at that time, seriously think that's all the amount of sleep you'll allow and BOOM you'll wake up at that time :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pineal glands, endocrine glands located inside your brain (slightly rear of center) are, what is commonly referred to as, your “internal clock”.  These glands produce melatonin to regulate sleep. The more regular you wake and sleep, the easier it is for them to anticipate waking up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
