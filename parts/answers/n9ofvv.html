		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you exercise, your blood pressure is regulated by a combination of your arteries expanding, arterioles in the muscle expanding, and heart rate increasing. For any given increase in intensity, it takes 2-3 minutes for that change to fully occur. </p>
<p>When you’re at rest and under stress, your muscles don’t put out the same dilation (known as functional sympatholysis) yet your heart rate may still increase. In that instance, the heart has to pump more forcefully to overcome the blood pressure shift and maintain the same ejection fraction (amount of blood pumped vs amount of blood left in left ventricle).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your heart is complex and the parameters change constantly. Sleeping, getting up, exercising, being scared, etc. all call for different heart responses. When your systolic pressure goes up and your diastolic pressure does not increase correspondingly, your pulse pressure, which is the difference, goes up and feels like a thump.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
