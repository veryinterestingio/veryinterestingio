		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're not consuming more than they need...if you do that you gain weight. Your body stores any excess calories (absorbed).</p>
<p>They're consuming more calories *than some other person needs*. When someone says &quot;fast metabolism&quot; it only means something relative to someone else that's got &quot;normal metabolism.&quot; The amount of calories it takes just to keep us alive varies from person to person. A person with fast metabolism needs more calories, so they can eat more calories without gaining weight. A person with a slow metabolism needs less, so if they eat the same amount they'll gain weight.</p>
<p>The energy always has to balance out, but you can manipulate both sides: how much you eat, and how much you burn.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was a TV show here in the UK a few years ago investigating why some thin people who didn't  exercise or watch what they ate still didn't  gain weight.</p>
<p>The chose a dozen or so young adults. Had them eat a significant amount more than they usually ate. Some couldn't physically eat that amount. Others unconsciously fidgeted  thereby burning up excess calories. One lucky guy actually gained muscle without working out. That's what his body did with the extra food.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People drastically overestimate how much of a difference a 'fast metabolism' makes if you are the same weight as someone and have the same level of physical activity it's incredibly unlikely that the difference will even be 200 calories.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I read that thin people usually just burn more calories not because of metabolism but more often they can't sit still, are doing things that involve standing, pacing, cleaning, or whatever throughout their day. It all adds up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
