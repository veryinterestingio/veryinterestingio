		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They had to work with native speakers or bilingual teachers. Hell, you can drop someone in a city of people who don't speak their language and given time and effort, they can puzzle out enough of the language to get about (although a teacher <em>really</em> helps there), learning with the speed of a dumb baby.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They interacted with people. You will be surprised how much you can learn, and how quickly, if you have no choice but to learn it.</p>
<p>For example, you travel across the border into Mexico, where they speak Spanish but not English, to sell knock-knacks. Only, no one knows Spanish where you came from, and there are no guidebooks.</p>
<p>You will eventually learn various words related to your wares, their money, and everyday life, just by talking with the locals for long enough. If you don't, you will find yourself lost, losing money from sales and unable to support yourself in a hostile land.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
