An example is a simple harmonic oscillator, where the motion is described by a sinusoidal function.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can define functions where as you repeatedly take the derivative at a certain point, and that value goes up instead of down.</p>
<p>For instance, y = e^(2x) has the derivative y' = 2 * e^(2x). So y' = 2y. </p>
<p>If you take the second derivative, you get y'' = 4 * e^(2x), so y'' = 4 y. That pattern continues, such that each successive derivative is twice that of the one before. So the y_n, the nth derivative of y, = 2^n y.</p>
<p>Polynomials are just the beginning of calculus, and patterns on them don't always play out as you would expect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's say the position of something is given by x(t) = e^t. Then its velocity, its first derivative, is given by x'(t) = e^t and its acceleration, the second derivative, is given by x''(t) = e^t and so on it goes to infinity. In other words, depending on how its moving you can have an infinite number of derivatives.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically never.  Consider a simple harmonic oscillators.  Its motion is described through a sinusoidal function, which can never de differentiated any amount of times to get identically 0 throughout time.</p>
<p>Really the only types of functions that have the property of being differentiated to the zero function are finite polynomials, which don't really occur <em>that</em> often in physics</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
