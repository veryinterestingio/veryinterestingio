<p>Acetone doesn't expand that much, so it is not as efficient or useful. Acetone is also quite dangerous when heated while water is not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>also understand that according to thermodynamics more energy can't be gotten out of a system than is put into it, but shouldn't the turbines spin just as fast no matter what gas is being passed through them/what temperature that gas is?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>this is correct, in fact the boiling point of the liquid used is irrelevant for the engine.</p>
<p>The efficiency of the engine is largely determined by the temperature difference between the hottest and the coldest point in the cycle, so using another liquid is not going to help there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are correct that it doesn't matter what is spinning the turbines, as long as they are spinning.</p>
<p>The reason that we use water instead of something else comes down to two reasons. </p>
<p>First, we've got lots and lots of water, so it's easy to get and super cheap. </p>
<p>Second, water is good at making pressure. The turbine spins because the evaporated stuff takes up more space than the liquid stuff, and that creates pressure. Water takes up more space than a lot of other things when it evaporates (or freezes). There are certainly going to be things that are better at making pressure (e.g. Pepsi), but the cost-to-output isn't going to be as good because of that first reason.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They do precisely this at many geothermal plants. So-called &quot;binary cycle&quot; plants like Casa Diablo near Mammoth Lakes, CA and the now-famous Puna Geothermal Venture in the area of last year's Kilauea eruption, use a working fluid like butane as it has a lower boiling point and therefore works with lower temperature (100-300 degree F) heat sources. A typical binary-cycle plant pumps hot water (usually brine) from a geothermal field, runs it through a heat exchanger (basically a tank with tubes running through it) that boils the low-temperature working fluid, which then, as a gas, runs a turbine generator. The butane is condensed and recirculated through the process just like with a water-based power plant. The brine is then pumped back into the field to be re-heated, and the cycle repeats.</p>
<p>Incidentally, there were a few experimental plants (one in my father's hometown of Hartford, CT if I recall correectly) which used mercury(!) as a working fluid in an attempt to boost efficiency. They didn't take off due to mercury hazards and other issues, and modern combined-cycle (gas turbine generator + steam generator) plants achieve far better efficiency.</p>
<p>One could get into enthalpy, superheat, heat rates, supercritical (once-through) cycles, etc., but after all, this is ELI5.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You actually want the high boiling point.  We want the fluid to have certain properties when it comes out of the boiler. and when we have a high boiling point, we can put in more energy.  Also, water can store a lot of energy before it actually changes temperature, way more than acetone.</p>
<p>The turbine speed and torque is going to be based on super complicated fluid mechanics stuff that I don't know to well. </p>
<p>Edit: I made a mistake in what causes the speed/torque</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
