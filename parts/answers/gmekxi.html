		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Elevation, moisture, topography, and temps all play a role here. As far as I am aware, all of the giant redwoods, including the Sequoias, have only occured on the west coast from mountainous regions in south central California up and into Oregon. Predominately in pockets, with the exception of a much more vast range from Humboldt up into Oregon. </p>
<p>There are only about 5-10% of all giant redwoods left from their historic range. The limiting factor? Man... We have cut nearly all of them down. Here in Oregon, we did cut them all down. Now, they exist exclusively in California.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Giant sequoias prefer relatively equable climates with moderate temperatures and relatively high rainfall.</p>
<p>Back in warmer times, like before the Ice Ages, the climate was wetter and more equable.  There were Giant Sequoias in areas that are now desert/rain shadow in Nevada (<a href="https://i.imgur.com/2bznkqE.png" target="_blank">see this map from Raven and Axelrod 1978</a>), and even further east into <strong>edit</strong> Idaho <del>Montana</del> (should have double checked.  but maybe Montana?).  Their habitat dramatically shrank due to to the sharp cooling and increased seasonality we saw as the Ice Ages approached and arrived, and also because of extensional collapse of the highlands they used to live in in the Great Basin region and points north (which are now lower, and far drier and /or more seasonal).</p>
<p>Before the late Miocene (like 12 mya), the Western Cordillera used to be much higher- high elevations extended from the Sierra crest to just about Colorado.  When the East Pacific Rise subducted under this cordillera, there was massive faulting and stretching of the continental crust, which decreased the elevation of mountains in e.g. Nevada, which created more rain shadows.  Also from this time until the Pleistocene you had a cooling and drying of climate, which made high elevations and more continental habitat less hospitable to Giant Sequoias.</p>
<p>Going even further back, in the Oligocene you had Coast Redwoods thriving in the Mackenzie River in Canada's Northwest Territory (as discussed in Graham 1999).  Climate wasn't really warmer in periods of the Oligocene as compared to the Mid-Miocene, but I'm not sure if there were still redwoods in Northern Canada by as late as the mid-Miocene or whether cold interregnums had pushed them out.</p>
<p>There were also metasequoia (Dawn Redwood) and broadleaf deciduous forests on Ellesmere Island above the Arctic Circle in the Eocene.  They actually have left behind 44-million-year old <em>subfossils</em>, as in not petrified or coalified but rather <a href="https://beatymuseum.ubc.ca/2017/08/30/the-fossilized-forest-of-axel-heiberg-island/" target="_blank">mummified wood</a> that can be burned, perhaps preserved by the sudden arrival of colder climate after the Eocene climate collapse.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Historic range</p>
<p>While the present day distribution of this species is limited to a small area of California, it was once much more widely distributed in prehistoric times, and was a reasonably common species in North American and Eurasian coniferous forests until its range was greatly reduced by the last ice age. Older fossil specimens reliably identified as giant sequoia have been found in Cretaceous era sediments from a number of sites in North America and Europe, and even as far afield as New Zealand[15] and Australia.[16]</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have tried to grow small specimens in western North Carolina and found it not easy. The small trees, at least, are not at all drought tolerant and are easily killed by extended periods of hot, dry weather such as sometimes happen here, even though overall rainfall is sufficient. The mature trees are undoubtedly tougher, but for the species fully to thrive requires a very special set of circumstances</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I asked this question of a ranger 21 years ago but here is his response. My exact question is “what does a young sequoia look like”.  This is what I recall.</p>
<p>Sequoia need bare ground to grow, we kept fires down which burned up brush, encouraged the white pine to survive (no fire).  So young sequoia have a tougher time.  The sequoia are resistant to fires (or more than the pine) with something g to do with their bark so (at least then) they were switching to prescribed burns.  </p>
<p>Sequoia weren’t logged (according to memory) as they shatter when they hit ground so they were left.  They grew in west exclusively with something to do with the water table running down the Sierra and the root structures of the threes.  Ranger pointed out that there is a place in China with similar forest and geology.  </p>
<p>Great question, going to read through rest of responses</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
