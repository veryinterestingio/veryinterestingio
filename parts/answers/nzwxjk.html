		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Texas has its own power grid, the Texas Interconnection ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Interconnection" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas\_Interconnection" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas\_Interconnection</a></a> ) with limited connection to other power grids, so they're unable to provide full power if Texas has an outage.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>That means the connections Texas has to other grids is limited, which in turn limits the amount of power that can be transferred from other grids to Texas and vice versa.<br />

<p>So even if they wanted to buy power from other States' grids, they wouldn't have been able to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
