		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most humor is based on some form of surprise.  A joke (especially one that follows the Rule of Three) creates a pattern that sets up an expectation, then follows the pattern in an unexpected way that briefly confuses our brain while we readjust.  The brain doesn't &quot;know&quot; something is funny, it is reacting to being confused.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>humor boinks the part of our brain that is related to scary stuff, this is because humor works by attempting to subvert expectations. when the brain recognizes that an unexpected outcome was not due to something dangerous, it boinks memory centers that use laughters goofy body chemicals to remind us of positive not-dangerous stuff.</p>
<p>then, humans as social animals leveraged humor's ability to boink positive feelings to form communities and forge better social ties. we associate laughing together as positive so we laugh even when something isnt that funny- that's the extrinsic reason why we &quot;know&quot; something is funny.</p>
<p>it's why someone like jordan peele, a career comedian can make a move like Get Out. comedy and horror follow similar logical maybe neurological paths, it's only the reveal/punchline that determine if something is hilarious or horrifying</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>your brain collects all of your experience, it's like a cloud for today's digital world. all of your interaction with family, friends, teachers, coaches, pastors, books, television, movies, art, pornography etc... are sifted through, and re-organized, and re-shaped, and re-stored in your brain where it begins to make make sense of this perceived world and your place in it. the information you expose yourself to begins to inform yourself, and how you should act or think in certain situations, or moments. the more you expose yourself too, the more your brain has to draw from.</p>
<p>Say, you are sitting with your friend, and they cut their finger while peeling an apple. you ask if they are okay. they say, &quot;'tis merely a flesh wound&quot; you both might laugh because you both have seen &quot;National Lampoons European Vacation&quot; movie, and liked the part where the bicyclist said this same line after a horrible crash. and your friend's accident is hardly as horrible, so, it's funny when the two opposing ideas are next to each other. If your friend saw the movie, and you did not, it may not register as something funny, because you are not drawing from the same background. </p>
<p>our brains also like to organize material by comparing and contrasting them. so, let's say you know a lot about cooking, and you read a story about a hapless chef. this may be funny to you because you understand the &quot;right&quot; or &quot;ordered&quot; way of doing things in the kitchen, and this chef's way of doing things do not meet the standard you know to be true, and its funny because it's &quot;wrong&quot;, but also a story, and not happening to you. Now, say you know a lot about cooking and you are grading the opening of a new restaurant, and it's success means a lot to your bottom line. these same things that you thought funny in a story, may not be funny when more is at stake, but will probably be funny when you re-tell the story to a friend.</p>
<p>same goes for most buddy comedies. one person is a bit of a wreck, and the other is buttoned up, and the problems they cause for each other are funny because we have an idea of how each one likes to behave, and how they like their world to be ordered.</p>
<p>So, in short, humor is developed through experiences and expectations of our perceived world to any situation. the more you have to draw from, the more humor you can find in any situation.</p>
