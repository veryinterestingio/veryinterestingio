		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Machine learning/AI is revolutionizing many industries including mine (I am a medical doctor and PhD researcher, specialized in Gastroenterology).
As someone who has no programing or computer science background, I am trying to better understand it by doing Andrew Ng's machine learning course.
A couple of questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do you think scientists and other science related professionals need to have an understanding of how AI/machine learning works? Or do you think it's adequate to simply adopt the technology without understanding it's workings?</li>
<li>Do you think Andrew Ngs course is a good starting point for a beginner or are there better resources?</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a UK student currently in my second year of a chemistry degree. I'm interested in the more computer focused areas of chemistry but I'm finding that there isn't much of this in my degree beyond excel. I taught myself some python over the Summer but even that hasn't been used in my degree.</p>
<p>Machine learning and quantum computing feels quite inaccessible to me, particularly when I try to find applications to chemistry. Do you have any advice for people in my situation? Is there a particular resource or way of learning some of this stuff outside of a degree that you recommend?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a graduate student in the final year of my PhD - I do experimental, fundamental physical chemistry, by which I mean I experimentally probe specific fundamental interactions between materials at the atomic scale. Fundamental chemistry is often difficult (time-consuming) and expensive, making it hard to justify on a cost/benefit basis, and consequently is often harder to get funding for.</p>
<p>On the other hand, fundamental understanding is often required for the rational design of materials, molecules, etc. Theorists have often told us that data such as ours is useful for the validation and application of computational models. I would really appreciate your thoughts on one or more of the following from your perspective as a theorist: </p>
<p>You mention the need for fundamental research, but you also mentioned the social atmosphere of our time, in which the value of millions spent on research that doesn't have an <em>immediate</em> or <em>guaranteed</em> payoff is less and less recognized. What will be the impact of AI and automation on this tension?</p>
<p>How do you see the importance of fundamental chemistry in relation to theory and AI/machine learning algorithms? Is there a point at which theory needs no further validation? </p>
<p>More generally, what do you think AI and automation might do to fields of chemistry that are difficult/impossible to automate? Is this something you or your colleagues consider?</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and best of luck.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Prof. Guzik! </p>
<p>I am currently finishing my first year as PhD student studying computational catalysis. I deal with classic DFT stuff such as building reaction pathway on oxide surfaces, NEB calculation, and so forth. Currently very interested in the hype over single atom catalyst stability on oxide surfaces (one of my project) and how AI can help it. I am guessing it would be a nice niche to start seeing the power of ML?
I am currently starting the machine learning course by Andrew and was wondering if there is any recommendation on things to try for as a first year grad student interested in data science and ML?
I also saw your kebotix computing website! Are you guys actively looking for interns? </p>
<p>Thank you for this amazing chance! </p>
<p>Best
