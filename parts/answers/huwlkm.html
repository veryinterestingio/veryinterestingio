		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've floated this idea before and got shot down. I think it's because banks in the US all use legacy systems and COBOL for the majority of their data, so things are done in batch jobs (or at least the back-end double-checking of it is) and that is done every 24 hours.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the hidden reason (this is a bit IMHO): so many types of fraud are only possible when there's a delay in transactions. It gives the bank computers some time to detect transaction patterns and make decisions about whether fraud is likely or not.</p>
<p>With very very fast transactions, suddenly that security blanket is gone: an account can be drained of money in an instant, and the money vanished into a maze of accounts, never to be seen again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the US banks are too lazy to make it better. This is a US-specific relic based on how the US banking system was made and lack of desire to update it.</p>
<p>On the topic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The banking community voted it down. [...] the way the ACH governance system works, you need a supermajority of at least 75 percent to vote yes. We do not know the exact tally. It's not public. But we do know that more than half voted yes, but not enough to cross the 75 percent line.</p>

<p>Other countries may delay new accounts or large sums to prevent fraud, but do have near instant free transfers. Living abroad I could share public bank acount #s to people like Venmo to get near instant money payments for meal splitting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>transfers within a bank don't have a delay.   it's only when it goes from one bank to another.   unless....your bank has a reason to delay your transfers for whatever its own internal reasons are.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
