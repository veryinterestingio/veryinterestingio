<p>Fossilization is a pretty rare occurrence all things considered, and some unique things need to all line up. Quick death, lack of decay and mineralization, so you need rapid burial, oxygen poor and mineral rich...Then there is also the bias of fossilization to hard bits, shells, bone, teeth....so for things like, jelly fish etc you’d need a imprint in shale....you also have the fact that just because something actually gets fossilized, we still have to find it (no small task) there is no promise that 1 in a million chance of a fossilized jelly fish isn’t literally beyond our means to extract it, much less randomly find it.... </p>
<p>The only numbers I remember is the fossil record represents something like less than 5% of the species alive today (yes all fossils over a span of a couple billion years) and that the fossils we’ve found probably represents considerably less than 1% of the life that’s existed, ever. </p>
<p>So, needless to say, the fossil record is less than complete</p>
<p>If any Paleontology bros/gals answer, go with whatever they say over me, I studied it years ago and some of the details are fuzzy now</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

(Note: episodes are short. This one is only 8:30) Not only do few of them get fossilized but many of them don't have body parts made of materials that are likely to leave any traces.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe the conventional wisdom stated by other posters that said most species don't get fossilized. But there's something that bugs me: we keep finding skeletons of the same species! If individuals from different species are equally likely to have been fossilized and to be found (and this is a huge if!) then the fact we keep finding the same species of dinosaurs (for example) would indicate, via the statistics of sampling, that there aren't many more to be found.</p>
<p>So why do we keep finding the same species?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Somewhat tangentially, this irritates me slightly whenever I hear that the Blue Whale is the largest animal to ever live.</p>
<p>It seems entirely plausible to me that larger sea creatures have existed in the past, but that they would be comparatively rare, and therefore unlikely to have been fossilised. Or at least fossilised so infrequently that we haven't found one yet.</p>
<p>I know it's a strange thing to be irritated by, but there you go(!)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
