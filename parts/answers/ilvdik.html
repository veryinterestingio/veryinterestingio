		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It was a combination of a number of factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Government backed student loans and the inability to discharge loans through bankruptcy.  Basically, anyone who got into college was able to pay for it via student loans no matter what the price was.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>College degrees had (and still do have) significant impacts on earning potential.  Up until the financial crash in the 00's, having a degree in <em>anything</em> meant you could get a great job with a great salary.  This meant that students were willing to take out loans of any amount to get degrees in anything.</p>
</li>
<li>Universities began competing with each other not on quality of education, but quality of amenities.  Since a degree from just about anywhere was all you needed, and it didn't matter what the degree actually was, you would attract students by improving student life.  New gyms, new dorms, new rec centers, etc. were being built, and that had to be recouped via tuition.  Going back to points 1 &amp; 2, students didn't care about paying this increased tuition because they would be able to service the loans with ease, leading them to pick expensive universities that offered better student amenities. </li>
</ul>
<p>It all kind of came crashing down during the great recession.  Suddenly, people were getting laid off and had to compete for entry level jobs when they had years of experience.  Students with mediocre degrees couldn't compete, leading them to having to take low paying jobs.  However, they still had the student loans to service and since there is no way to discharge them, the banks kept getting paid.   Now, you have an entire generation that is under employed but still paying off expensive loans that they were <em>assured</em> wouldn't be a big deal when they borrowed.</p>
<p>Since the banks are still getting paid, they are still making loans.  Since the universities still have to pay off all of those amenities, tuition is still high.  Since students still need degrees, they are still paying whatever they have to for them.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>:  To clarify, I am not saying that any one of those three factors is to blame or is more important than any other.  Each one of the factors in a vacuum wouldn't be a big issue, but rather the combination that created a perfect storm.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1) The federally guaranteed unsecured loans that the borrowers can’t get out of through bankruptcy with near limitless amounts being lent. </p>
<p>2) University construction projects for bigger, more extravagant facilities to compete for potential students. </p>
<p>3) a need for a college degree to qualify for jobs that never needed a degree. Assistant managers in retail jobs are required to have degrees. </p>
<p>4) an expectation that everyone go to college, but I don’t know if that devalued a high school diploma or if the high school education was degraded through other actions.</p>
<p>5) an explosion in school administration and high end administrator salaries</p>
<p>6) Decreased funding for public universities at the state level, a state may have ‘frozen’ tuition but the schools have been piling on fees.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The current answers are all good, but I'll add in one more factor. Colleges have a certain prestige factor that cannot be replicated. If every vacuum cleaner on the market sold for $1000, you could make a killing selling vacuum cleaners for $200. Virtually every consumer would eagerly switch over to your brand to save money. That doesn't really work for colleges. If I start a new college charging much lower tuition, people are still going to want to go to Harvard, Stanford, etc. No one wants to go to &quot;Bob's Startup University,&quot; so you don't get the good students and professors that let you eventually become a prestigious university. Basically, unlike in most markets, the fact that everything is ridiculously overpriced does not create an opportunity for someone else to come in and undercut. So things stay overpriced.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good intentions with unintended (or perhaps not fully considered) consequences and global economic development.</p>
<p>In the 50s-60s any degree was almost a guaranteed passport to a comfortable middle class life since less than 8% of Americans had degrees. Of course, this meant that degrees were a very valuable asset but the demand was limited by cost. The good idea that a highly educated population is good for the economy as well as the individual led to the provision of government guaranteed student loans. This of course led to a large increase in demand for degrees - the natural outcome being an increase in costs. </p>
<p>Part of the problem is that individual choices (what degree to get or even whether to get a degree) do not naturally lead to optimal outcomes in the short term (what degrees are in demand). But students who still believe that just about any degree is <strong>financially</strong> rewarding and have access to loans continued to borrow allowing universities (especially top ones) to charge more and more. </p>
<p>As other economies around the world developed, there is also a larger cohort of international students who can afford to pay tuition for top universities worldwide.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
