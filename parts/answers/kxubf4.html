		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's no longer contagious when you're not producing enough infectious particles in the airways needed to spread virus to another individual. Ebola virus has been found to replicate within the eye of long haul carriers but no evidence indicates these people are capable of spreading virus. If replication is localized to a protected niche then the chance of it aersolizing or spreading through bodily fluids (ebola) is low. Also, PCR methods only detect RNA so it doesn't tell you if infectious particles are being produced. Long haulers likely have infectious particles but not in areas that increase the chance of spread.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The common PCR tests don't distinguish between complete virus that can infect someone else, and fragments of broken down virus that are getting slowly shed by the body</p>
<p>Given that people still testing positive weeks later don't seem to actually be causing infections, the papers I've seen make the assumption that they are mostly shedding viral fragments rather than 'replication competent' virus</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think about it this way.</p>
<p>Your regular immune system is constantly killing a few viruses here, a few bacteria there.  Small numbers they can handle.  But if someone with full blown Covid sneezes on you, that isn't a small &quot;viral load,&quot; it is too much virus to fight off at your sinuses.</p>
<p>So you get Covid.</p>
<p>If the person who sneezes on you just has allergies, but has a tiny number of Covid germs mixed in, your immune system will kill them before they can get anywhere, and you won't get covid.</p>
<p>Once a person has beaten the virus and their immune system has mostly pruged it, the small numbers of germs still in their body are not enough to get someone else sick.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've wondered this myself. It just seems to be a bizarre concept I can't get my head around although the comment on ebola sort of explains it. </p>
<p>For example, if someone started to get severely ill by day 9 and lands up in hospital on day 11 - are they really not infectious? If that's true, why are so many nurses and doctors infected?</p>
<p>If I'm infected and still symptomatic by day 11, it's okay for me to be out in  public? What if the scientists are wrong and it's actually at 15 days? Could there be a bunch of infectious people about? And how do scientists know this to be true?</p>
<p>That's a lot of questions sorry</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
