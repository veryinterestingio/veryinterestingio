		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because rabies can infect a lot of different animal hosts, many of which can live a long time or indefinitely after being infected. These are known as reservoir hosts because they provide a stable source for infections of more susceptible hosts. Reservoir hosts for rabies generally include Carnivoran mammals (raccoons, skunks, canines) and bats.</p>
<p>Human-to-human transmission of rabies is incredibly rare. Almost all infections come from animals, either directly from a reservoir host or from another animal that was recently infected by a reservoir host.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

You can be infected for months before you become ill. Once symptoms show you have maybe a week to live, a little longer if you're lucky.

<p>There are different variants of rabies virus which are each “acclimated” to a particular host. For example, raccoon-variant rabies cycles within and is maintained within raccoon populations. Raccoon-variant rabies virus can survive for a long time within raccoons; there is no specific set incubation period between infection and showing clinical signs. </p>
<p>In order for the virus to be transmitted, it has to replicate in the brain and then spread into the salivary glands. Therefore, a raccoon may be incubating rabies virus for a long time, but at some point it will develop neurologic signs (and then eventually die), during which time a bite from this animal can transmit the virus to another mammal. There is also a window of time before the neurologic signs are apparent that transmission can still occur. The general guideline is that if an animal bites you and then does not show neurologic signs within 10 days, it could not have been shedding rabies virus at the time it bit you. That doesn’t mean it isn’t still incubating rabies, only that it wasn’t likely infective at the time you were bitten. (That doesn’t mean that if you’re bitten, the correct course of action is just to wait and see; if the bitten animal / person is unvaccinated for rabies, you start treatment just in case, because if the virus reaches the brain then the victim will die. But it’s always nice to know that the animal you’ve been quarantining after a bite exposure hasn’t developed neurologic signs and you’re in the clear)</p>
<p>In the US, canine-variant rabies has been eradicated, meaning there is no dog-specific rabies variant that circulates among dog populations. This is because of vaccination and because we do not have large feral dog populations. Canine-variant rabies is still endemic in India, on the other hand. However, dogs in the US can still contract other-mammal-variant rabies from bats, skunks, raccoons, foxes, and mongooses, as well as any other mammal that contracted rabies from one of those species. Whenever a non-rabies-vector species contracts the virus, the disease course is quicker and the animal will invariably die from the disease, likely without spreading it to too many other individual animals. One raccoon -&gt; one dog -&gt; six other dogs in the neighborhood is more unlikely than one raccoon -&gt; six dogs in the neighborhood. </p>
<p>Small mammals like squirrels can be infected with rabies, but are very unlikely to transmit it, simply by virtue of the fact that the bite that gave them the rabies is very likely to kill them or fatally wound them in the first place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rabies has a very long incubation period in animals so the disease cycle really isn't that short. It also doesn't affect animals quite the same as humans and is very easily spread through bites etc and then has a long period where it could be spread before symptoms appear. It's really not super prevalent in most of the world and is preventable with vaccination of animals (and humans, tho not super cost effective to preemptively vaccinate humans so generally given post exposure)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
