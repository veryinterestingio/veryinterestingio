		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh! This is my time! Bee Biologist (Beeologist?) here, finishing a Masters on what Hymenoptera like bees and wasps do over winter.</p>
<p>So it really depends on which critter you're talking about first of all, the method to survive winter in each family, genus, and even species can vary greatly, often tying in with the life cycle of individual bees. In the wasp and yellow jacket family (Vespidae), we see most of the workers dying off as temperatures cool down and food becomes scarce. New queens and drones are born late midsummer and eat as much as possible to put on fat to live off of once they fly away from the hive, usually seeking out a quiet area with good insulation that is protected from the elements, like a pile of wood. There they hunker down, often clustering together in 'aggregates' with other unrelated wasps and go into a sort of hibernation called 'diapause'. Now, I gotta take a moment to describe diapause because it's not hibernation and mainly differs in that during diapause the actual rate of metabolism slows down at the cellular level. Cell processes slow down, breathing drops to almost nothing, barely any energy is being produced, whereas hibernation is more like an extended sleep, cells are still doing stuff as normal. </p>
<p>Also diapause can occur during summer.</p>
<p>Now, the really cool part about diapause is that it can be done in both adult, pupae as well as egg life stages in insects! So, stuff like the wasps I mentioned earlier, bumblebees, are free-flying adults waiting out the winter someplace safe, and then there are the cute little blue bees I work with called Osmia lignaria, which spend their winters as a fully formed adult, but still living inside the original egg chamber they were laid in the previous spring by their mother. Then you have bees like the leafcutter bee (Megachile rotundata) which is laid as an egg in summer, grows into a fat larva off the pollen stores in its egg chamber, pupates and then spends winter in its cocoon! I'm sure there are members of the bee &amp; wasp family which overwinter as an egg but at the moment they elude me.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can spend winter alive and active, as the European honeybee (Apis melliferra) does. With honeybees, they cluster together in their hives, the current queen stops laying eggs and many of the workers die off. The remaining bees cluster around the queen and the eggs to help keep them warm. As temperatures change, the cluster tightens or loosens up to keep the queen and the brood at the best temperature. Meanwhile, the bees are living off of the honey they made and stored away in the hive. As spring approaches the old queen and half of the remaining workers will swarm and leave the old hive to make a new hive elsewhere, leaving behind a new queen to take over the old hive.</p>
<p>ELI4 version: they either hang out in woody debris piles, or are still sleeping inside the nest they were laid in and wait for warm temps to come in spring to tell them to wake up. Or, if they are honeybees, they simply cluster together in their hive</p>
<p>edit: I just woke up and this comment has exploded! And I've been gilded! And platinumed!!! Oh wow! Thank you kind redditors! All of you! I will make my best effort to reply to each of you who have asked follow-up questions, and if anyone thinks of more questions later please feel free to pm me! I am always happy to help!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In honeybees, all the worker bees (the females) will pick up the drones (the males) and drop them outside the hive to die so they don’t eat all the food during the winter! Then, they all get in a big cluster (like a basketball) around the queen bee, and they vibrate to keep warm. The bees all trade spots in the ball so no one gets to cold, and they travel in formation around the hive really slowly throughout the winter to eat the food they’ve stored. Once it gets warm enough, they break cluster and complete an elimination flight (which means they all fly outside and poop for the first time since fall!) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The bees go back home and sleep but because there’s too many of them, most of them die. Only the Queen, some of her eggs and fellow bees survive the winter in their home. </p>
<p>Before the wasps go night night, they put their babies under the ground and that’s how they survive the winter.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bee keeper here.  <del>I see that the top comment is actually quite wrong.</del> <em>Edit: The new top comment isn't!</em>  </p>
<p>First, you need to understand the function of the bees in a hive.  We all know the importance of the queen, but what many don't know is that <em>all</em> of the worker bees are females.  </p>
<p>The males (or &quot;drones) literally have only one function:  To spread the DNA of the queen to other hives by mating to other queens.  That's it.  They don't guard, they don't work, they don't collect pollen, they don't even have stingers.  In other words, they're like (insert whatever opposing political party suits you to make it relevant here.)  </p>
<p>So we all know that bees collect honey.  But they also collect pollen, and both are kept in the comb in vast quantities.  These stores are specifically to get them through the winter.  </p>
<p>As late autumn hits, it's time to kick out the dudes that don't do any work.  The drones are killed, and booted out, but they only make up about 15% of the population in a healthy colony.  Everyone else gets geared up for winter.</p>
<p>The bees make sure any small air gaps are closed off by sealing them with propolis.  The larger entrances in a &quot;good&quot; hive location are at the bottom of the hive, and the bees build their comb above this.  This is to take advantage of the fact that heat rises.</p>
<p>When winter hits, the entire hive gathers into a ball.  In a healthy hive, this ball of bees can be the size of a basketball.  The queen is at the center of this ball.  The workers then vibrate their wing muscles to produce heat.  All of this work requires a small amount of &quot;fuel&quot; to keep them going, so as the winter goes on, the whole ball moves around the hive, consuming their winter stores slowly as they go.  </p>
<p>The interior of the ball is kept at a balmy 95 degrees Fahrenheit to keep the queen comfortable, and as the bees on the &quot;outside&quot; of the ball get too cold, they'll move to the inside of the ball, allowing the &quot;warmed up&quot; bees to then go to the outside.  And they do this all... winter... long.</p>
<p>If a bee keeper takes too much of the honey from the bees, the entire hive will literally starve to death.  This isn't my blog, but <a href="https://danieljmarsh.wordpress.com/tag/bee-candy/" target="_blank">another bee keeper had some great, though very sad pictures</a> of what a starve-out looks like.  When you open your hive in spring and see that, it's gut wrenching.  </p>
<p>So while I can't talk for wasps, THIS is how bees survive the winter!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some species of bee seal and hibernate the entire hive, but a lot have mass die-offs in the fall and overwinter only the queen or a small number of young/eggs.</p>
<p>Non-social parasitic wasps die in the fall and the larvae overwinter underground.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
