		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don't. Each LED junction can only produce one wavelength, in fact, LEDs are famous for their narrow bandwidth. When we want a multicolour LED, what we do is embed a red, green, blue (and optionally white) LED junction on the same device very close to each other. By mixing the amount of these 3 colours, we can convince our brain that it's actually a single colour.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure you mean things like these.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pololu.com/product/1074" target="_blank">https://www.pololu.com/product/1074</a></p>
<p>Where it appears it's a single unit and it produces many colors.</p>
<p>But if you look at the diagram on the bottom it has 4 wires. It uses that to switch the between three colors and their intensity. This makes up all the colors we see.</p>
<p>It's also called a RGB LED. So what that means is that it has the ability produce Red Green and Blue light. </p>
<p>If you look on the manual specifically here you'll see it has the ability to produce these colors.

<p>So if you look here
<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Rendered_Spectrum.png" target="_blank">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Rendered_Spectrum.png</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Red   ~ 700–635 nm</li>
<li>Orange    ~ 635–590 nm </li>
<li>Yellow    ~ 590–560 nm </li>
<li>Green ~ 560–520 nm</li>
<li>Cyan  ~ 520–490 nm</li>
<li>Blue  ~ 490–450 nm </li>
<li>Violet    ~ 450–400 nm</li>
</ul>
<p>The Led is really good at producing bright Blue, Red and Green colors and less good at producing the in between especially yellow. </p>
<p>As you can see it's kind of really bad from the graph at producing yellow.
But when you look at this picture it's indeed yellow.</p>
<p><a href="https://a.pololu-files.com/picture/0J921.1200.jpg?e20ea36efb61d8a0ded305f8b6a47442" target="_blank">https://a.pololu-files.com/picture/0J921.1200.jpg?e20ea36efb61d8a0ded305f8b6a47442</a></p>
<p>But when you look in more detail using a measuring tool. It's actually producing more of a really light green with some red. Your brain gets fooled by the LED since it's emitting both red and green so it sort of merges into yellow.</p>
<p>Currently more of our technology uses a RGB spectrum mostly because of the physics of LEDs.
And we're honestly used to it because our CRT TVs worked mostly the same.</p>
<p>But say printers again because of physics use a different configuration. They use this.

<p>cyan, magenta, yellow, and key. Key standing for basically &quot;back&quot; to darken things.</p>
<p>So while an OLED RGB display under a microscope looks like this.
