		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The human body is not a perfect conductor for electricity and when electricity encounters resistance it generates heat. If you happen to become a part of an electrical current of a high enough amperage(the measurement of an electrical current), you could be severely burned. </p>
<p>More importantly, electricity causes muscle contractions. Since our body controls its muscles through the nervous system with electrical signals, an overload of these signals might cause serious contractions and even paralysis. What’s worse is that this could even cause your respiratory system to fail and ultimately stop your heart. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body uses electrical signals in its nerves, which is why electricians are told it's better to brush a suspect wire with the back of your hand (so the involuntary cramp pushes your hand away rather than clamps on). The major way people die from electric shocks is if it goes through the heart. Your heart is a finely tuned machine that does not appreciate a sudden external signal saying contract all muscles. If you're lucky, your heart resumes beating with its normal pattern. If not, hope someone around knows CPR.</p>
<p>Incidentally, this is also a bugbear for medical shows - the device with the paddles and the shouting clear doesn't restart the heart, it stops the heart and is used when the rhythm has gone wrong (called fibrillation). The heart can then restart itself with the correct rhythm (hopefully).</p>
<p>Edit: thanks to the 5000 electricians who have correctly pointed out that devices exist for checking if a circuit is live. Use a device if you have one (and if you haven't got one, why are you working on your electrics?). The only time that tip saved by bacon was when I found an unknown wire in my loft. The main house breaker was off, but it turned out some enterprising previous owner had hooked the loft lights up to my neighbours power. 240V is unpleasant (and made my hand &amp; arm contract fast enough to bruise all my knuckles on a joist).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two things really. One of the biggies, is that often electrocution over rides conscious muscle control, and so the person who becomes electrocuted is unable to let go or jump back out of harms way once it starts. They may be thrown clear by their own muscles spasming, or they may instead grip the wire even tighter. </p>
<ol>
<li>Your autonomous nervous system such as heart beat and your internal organs, uses electrical impulses to keep everything working. Electrocution can interrupt or over ride these signals, preventing the heart from beating correctly or sometimes stopping the heart all together. In order for this to happen, the electricity must pass over the critical chest area and vagus nerve. For example touching a livewire with both hands would form a connection from one hand, through the arm, chest, and out the other arm, stopping the heart. Grabbing it one handed might cause it to form a circuit going up the arm, down the side of the body and through the feet. </li>
</ol>
<p>It doesn't take much amperage for this to happen, but it usually requires high voltage. Also alternating current is more disruptive to the body than direct current, and more likely to electrocute somebody even at lower amps and voltage. </p>
<p>And #2 Amperage can cause burns. The same action that causes the filament in a light bulb to glow bright orange, causes your body tissue to get hot and can cause electrical burns as the rapid influx of electricity pushes past the electrical resistance of the body and creating heat in it's wake. These types of electrocutions may not stop the heart, but may literally cook the body. People who get electrocuted and have to have limbs amputated, are usually the ones who were burned by high amperage but not long enough to kill them. </p>
<p>Direct Current with low resistance and high amperage can cause electrical burns to a person just as readily as alternating current can. Amps kill and amps burn. Even a lower voltage direct current could burn you readily if the amperage is high and resistance is low. </p>
<p>This is also responsible for the numb tongue you get when licking a 9v battery. The tongue completes the circuit and begins to be burned, which causes us to yank the battery away before any real damage is done. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of talk here about stopping hearts, burns, etc.</p>
<p>Those are the kinds of effects from lower amounts of power, like household electrical outlets.  </p>
<p>Once you get up to larger amounts of power ( for example a piece of equipment touching an overhead line, or giant cable that power buildings), your heart stopping is the least of your worries.  Your heart will be cooked far beyond well done before it even has a chance to stop.  It would cook you instantly from the inside out.</p>
<p>A downed live power line can kill you even if you are standing ten feet away, and you can be electrocuted by standing with your legs too far apart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two things that make it dangerous.</p>
<p>First, if it takes the right path through your body it overpowers the proper signals from your nervous system causing heart to stop beating or beat too rapidly and weakly to effectively pump any blood.  It can also mess up the signaling in your brain, rendering you brain dead. </p>
<p>Second, if you have a power source able to supply high current and you connect something with some, but not very much, resistance across it a lot of power will go into it and it will heat up really fast and possibly explode.  Short circuits are typically what causes this.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
