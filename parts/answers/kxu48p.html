		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what the other folks have said, I wanted to go over the different &quot;levels&quot; of energy storage. They can be roughly categorized by short term, or long term, or how fast they can be accessed by your body. </p>
<p>For immediate short term energy your body uses ATP as described by another poster. This ATP is replenished by the other energy reserves of your body. </p>
<p>Sugar in your blood, glucose in particular, is usually the energy source that restores ATP on a short term basis. Suger can also be stored in your body as glycogen. Glycogen is most commonly found in your large skeletal muscles and your liver. </p>
<p>Fat and fatty acids, usually in the form of adipose tissue is your longer term storage. </p>
<p>Protein is also used for energy. Usually the protein in your skeletal muscles is broken down after you have started to run low on fat and glycogen. </p>
<p>Remember that there is not any point where one of these processes suddenly stops and another begins. They are all functioning all the time at different rates. It's just the rates of each process will change over time, depending on your needs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ATP is the primary energy molecule in the cell. It can be made incredibly easily and efficiently from glucose, which itself is easy to transport via the bloodstream. When you have an excess of glucose, your body stores glucose as long chains called glycogen, primarily in muscle and liver cells. Muscles, because they will likely need a shitload of energy, so may as well store it at the point of use, and the liver, because your liver can literally make glucose, so it makes sense to store it there before it needs to get released into the bloodstream.</p>
<p>For long-term energy storage, when you have a serious excess of calories (or metabolic weirdness), your body will store energy as fat in adipose tissue, a process also controlled by the liver.  </p>
<p>Source: am biologist. This was off the top of my head though, so more serious physiologists please feel free to correct my errors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Energy is stored in fat, glycogen and muscle fibres.</p>
<p>Caffeine is a stimulant that has been shown to improve both physiological and cognitive performance and reduce tiredness by binding to adenosine receptors it the brain.</p>
<p>Similarly a sugar consumed directly is more readily available as an energy source to your muscles and other nerves such as brain cells and is measured in joules or calories.</p>
<p>In terms or the order they are processed by the body during exercise: sugar from food, glycogen, fat, muscle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It all goes through the Kreb's Cycle. Most of the 'entry points' of our energy production molecules eventually gets turned into Pyruvate-CoA and gets injected into the Kreb's cycle. Even fats go through a pathway that leads to acetyl-CoA. </p>
<p>Proteins (once broken down into amino acids) go to the Kreb's cycle through several points. They usually go through a de-amination step (an amino/nitrogen group is removed first). </p>
<p>Largely however our most readily available source of dietary energy is through glycolysis (breakdown of sugar), then Glycogen break down, which is more or less the 'idle throttle' of our Kreb's engine. </p>
<p>Ultimately though every last bit of what we think of as sources of energy becomes Adenosine Triphosphate through the rest of the processes happening in our mitochondria (Glycolysis, and Oxidative phosphorylation).  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fun Fact: During a marathon, you do not get energy from fat because it takes too long to convert it into energy. So, at the beginning of the race, you get energy from the glucose in your blood stream. When that runs out, you start taking it from your glycogen stores which can be converted quickly. For the average marathoner, this source runs out around the 30 km (20 mile) mark. This is what is referred to as the wall. At this point, your body starts breaking down muscle to make energy. So, the very thing that you need to run, is being dismantled. That is why the last part of the race is so painful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
