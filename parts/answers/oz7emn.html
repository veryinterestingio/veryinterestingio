		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Often there are still some predators, poisons that dissuade birds won’t necessarily also work on tarantulas.</p>
<p>A species with no predators at all can hit the “carrying capacity” of the environment - there’s only so much easy food to go around and a population larger than that will starve.</p>
<p>Tiny prey animals aren’t likely to hit that, but large grazers and apex predators often do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, they do not have a lot of natural predators.</p>
<p>That being said, they go through the tadpole phase in which they are very vulnerable, so that thins out their population quite a bit.</p>
<p>They can also die to diseases, parasites...etc. Some animals might also try and eat them, which many times ends badly for both sides.</p>
<p>Humans are also affecting their population by destrying their habitats in the Amazon and other rainforests.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some of their predators are immune to their venom. A king snake, for example, is called that because it eats other snakes, including rattlesnakes. It is immune to rattlesnake venom.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I mean how does it work with predators?
Food and space are the limiting factors. I mean frogs for example are predators themself? They eat insects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
