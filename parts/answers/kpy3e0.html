		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sound travels in waves (usually through the air). When your vocal chords vibrate, it makes a pattern of waves in the air. If a speaker vibrates in that exact same pattern, it makes the same sound as your voice. The speaker vibrates either in or out.</p>
<p>A microphone is essentially a tiny speaker. When your “voice waves” vibrate it, that in and out pattern is recorded as electronic instructions. Those instructions are sent to the other device over internet, cellular, radio, wire, etc. Once decoded, the device reproduces the in and out pattern on the speaker and you hear the same sound.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A “transducer” turns pressure (sound waves) into voltage. </p>
<p>Once you have a voltage signal there is a bunch of fun stuff you can do with it: turn it into 1’s and 0’s, broadcast it out on an AM tower, shoot it into space... etc</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For a phone call, you have a microphone and speaker.</p>
<p>Basically a microphone involves turning the movement of a vibrating membrane into an electrical signal.  For example [1] by using an electrically charged membrane, any movement will literally push on charges in a nearby wire.</p>
<p>The analog signal from the microphone is amplified by one or more transistors, and (if you have an old-school landline phone) the analog signal is sent directly to the phone company.</p>
<p>Before digital tech started invading the phone industry in the 1980's, the phone company would use literal switches to physically attach wire segments between telco facilities into a single wire.  Including internationally (undersea cables connecting continents are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_communications_cable" target="_blank">surprisingly old tech</a>, the first commercial success being in the 1860's).</p>
<p>And sometimes there'd be an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_switchboard#/media/File:Jersey_Telecom_switchboard_and_operator.jpg" target="_blank">actual human person</a> doing the switching by using their hands to literally plug wires into sockets.</p>
<p>Nowadays the analog signal is converted to a digital signal.  If you're using a cell phone, the digital signal is sent to the nearest cell tower, at most a couple miles away.  If you're using an old-school landline phone, the analog signal is converted to a digital packet-based signal by equipment at the closest telco facility (also at most a couple miles away).</p>
<p>Then the digital signal travels between telephone company facilities, usually over fiber optic cables [2].  The devices that tell the digital signal which way to go are still called &quot;switches,&quot; but they're now specialized computers.  The digital data's divided into packets, each packet has a header that tells where it's going and which conversation it belongs to.  Programmable software and data on the switches tells the switches how they're connected to each other, so the switch &quot;knows&quot; which cables get packets bound for Michigan or Mexico or California.</p>
<p>At the other end, the reverse happens, the signal goes to the user from a cell tower or a landline.  Digital data's converted back to analog at some point, and played by the speaker.</p>
<p>[1] There are lots of different types and subtypes of microphones that work in different ways.  I'm describing one type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electret_microphone" target="_blank">electret microphone</a> which might be found in cell phones and other common devices.</p>
<p>[2] Quick summary of fiber optic cable:  You know how if you look at a straw in a glass of water, it looks broken if you look at it from the side?  That's because light bends when it goes between different materials.  Build the wall of a flexible tube with one clear material, fill the tube's interior with a different clear material, and you can trap light in the tube, by choosing your materials so that striking the wall makes the light bend back inward to the center.  With good engineering the tube can carry light for many miles, and around bends.  We have super high-speed lasers that computers can blink in code really fast, and super high-speed light sensors to detect and decode the blinks at the other end.  Best of all, a bunch of nearby fiber optic cables don't interfere with each other, and you can use a whole bunch of different colors to all carry different data over the same fiber.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
