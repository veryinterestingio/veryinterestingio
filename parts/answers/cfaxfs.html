		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you see a line of bubbles coming from a single point, that point is called a 'nucleation site'.</p>
<p>What is happening is that there is probably a small imperfection in the glass there where a tiny bubble of air can be trapped.  </p>
<p>It is much easier for an existing bubble to get bigger than it is for a new bubble to form out of nothing.  So, what happens its that this tiny trapped bubble grows until it gets too large for the imperfection and it then breaks off and rises to the top of the glass.  When the bubble breaks off it leaves behind another tiny bubble trapped in that imperfection in the glass.  The cycle then repeats.</p>
<p>You can reproduce the experiment by putting a large grain of sand in the bottom of the glass.  This grain of sand is likely a lot rougher than the glass and will contain small trapped bubbles.  After filling the glass with a carbonated drink, the rough grain of sand will likely be one of the locations from which lines of bubbles rise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>because your champagne flute has one imperfection in the glass.  this rough point is the easiest place for the bubbles to form.</p>
<p>now grab one of your glasses you usually use for cola and fill it full of champagne and see what happens.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of glasses such as champagne and the sam adams beer glass put a imperfection (scratch) to make it nucleate from that area. Imperfections cause bubbles to form. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Champagne is fizzy because it has a gas trapped inside it. Gasses want to be free to float around in the air instead of stuck inside liquids.
The people who make the wine glasses use super cool lasers to put tiny little scratches on the bottom of the glass. These scratches make the glass rough enough to break out the gas inside the champagne and it rises to the top in a little bubble. Each time a bubble is made the wine moves a little bit so it's always making new bubbles.</p>
<p>That's about as ELI5 as I can make it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
