		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Edit:</strong> As /u/joekercom points out, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/d0gfhl/family_members_are_posting_on_facebook_that_there/ez9ihup/" target="_blank">the 2005 date is not arbitrary</a>. In 2005 NOAA began collecting climate data from a new network of weather stations due to criticisms about the validity of the existing weather station network. The data since 2005, from both the new and the old networks, does not show a significant warming trend. The misconception here is that this new network is more accurate than the existing network and that a lack of warming in the new network's data refutes the existing observations of warming in the USA. This is not the case.</p>
<p>The whole purpose of the new network (called the US Climate Reference Network) was not to replace the existing network of weather stations, but to measure the validity of the existing network's data and determine whether there are baises in the data due to things such as urban development. We did not know whether the existing weather station network was accurate, but we do know that the USCRN is a &quot;pristine&quot; weather station network that should be free from bias. Here's the important point: <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/BAMS-D-12-00170.1" target="_blank">When researchers compared the results from the USCRN with the existing climate station network, they have found that the data from both networks largely agree with each other.</a> What this means is that as far as we can tell, the existing climate data network that NOAA has been using for decades has not been strongly biased by external factors other than genuine climate change. </p>
<p>Thus, while the 2005 date is not arbitrary, it is neither the beginning of a new era of climate data that rejects all previous observations. It's the opposite, the climate data collected since 2005 only supports the idea that the long-term warming trend we have seen here in the US and elsewhere is a genuine climatological phenomenon, and not due to unseen bias in the data collection methods. </p>
<p><strong>Another Edit:</strong> Just a nice source from /u/kilotesla showing how the new network (USCRN) compares to existing climate data networks used by NOAA:</p>

<h1>End Edit / Original Post:</h1>
<p>They're right, but there are four things to keep in mind here: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The year 2005 is an arbitrary date. <a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-us-and-global-temperature" target="_blank">Over time there is a clear warming trend in the USA.</a> Go back to 1990 and there is a demonstrable warming trend, go back to 1980 and there is a very clear warming trend. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>US temperatures since 2005 have not been significantly rising, but they're already hot. All temperatures since 2005 have been above the historic average. If there was no warming trend, we would expect some years to be above the average and some years below. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changes in local weather patterns can dominate the warming trend in the short term, and the USA is a very temperate country. For example, El Nino vs. La Nina temperature conditions in the Pacific ocean can greatly influence the USA's temperature in any given year, with two of the hottest years in the last 15 being hot El Nino years. </p>
</li>
<li>The years 2015-2018 are the four hottest years on record globally. The global warming trend is clear, and the local variations in weather that have stalled warming in the USA will not continue forever.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone saying &quot;It's called global climate change, not US warming. The US could be getter colder&quot; is totally missing the point. The US is certainly getting warmer, and <em>even that cited NOAA data shows it.</em></p>
<p>The NOAA data that these Facebook posts are talking about comes from <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/temp-and-precip/national-temperature-index/time-series?datasets%5B%5D=uscrn&amp;parameter=anom-tavg&amp;time_scale=p12&amp;begyear=2005&amp;endyear=2019&amp;month=7" target="_blank">here</a>. (For example, <a href="https://www.realclearenergy.org/articles/2019/08/23/climate_alarmists_foiled_no_us_warming_since_2005_110470.html" target="_blank">here's</a> an example of a page using that data to downplay global warming- written by a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/475423b" target="_blank">Heartland Institute</a> lawyer.) <em>Even if you're only using this data</em>, it still shows a warming trend. You can find it in Excel yourself, or look at <a href="https://i.imgur.com/EUqU688.png" target="_blank">this version that I made quickly</a>. See how the black trendline slopes up, indicating a warming trend just in the last fifteen years? The main reason that the Facebook memes use this dataset is because it has monthly values with high variance, which makes that long-term trend harder to see. In contrast, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/mpl8sxH.png" target="_blank">here's</a> the exact same data, but averaged over a 2-yr period, making the warming easier to see. But even though the month-to-month differences are much larger than the total warming, don't be tricked into thinking this warming doesn't matter.</p>
<p>If you extrapolate that trendline, you get &gt;5 degrees F of warming by the end of the century. 5 degrees might not seem like much, but it's about <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/" target="_blank">double the warming</a> that the IPCC sets as a relatively &quot;safe&quot; target, and about <a href="https://xkcd.com/1379/" target="_blank">half</a> the temperature difference between the current climate and the cold of the last ice age. Remember, this is the chart that the Facebook memes and Exxon-funded lawyers are using to show that global warming isn't real. Imagine the charts they're not showing! In IPCC reports that <em>don't</em> cherrypick data from a specific place, time period, and single dataset, the total warming is predicted to be <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/emissions-scenarios/" target="_blank">twice as large</a> without serious interventions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>National Geographic:</p>
<p>&quot;BY ALEJANDRA BORUNDA    PUBLISHED FEBRUARY 6, 2019</p>
<p>According to new reports published Wednesday, the last five years—from 2014 to 2018—are the warmest years ever recorded in the 139 years that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has tracked global heat. And 2018 was the fourth hottest year ever recorded.</p>
<p>Global air temperatures have warmed steadily over past decades, shifting up and down slightly from year to year depending on natural climate oscillations like El Niño, but following a consistent upward path. Land temperatures, they said, were more than two degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the 20th century average.</p>
<p>“It’s a long-term trip up the elevator of warming,” says Deke Arndt, the chief of the global monitoring branch of NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information in North Carolina.</p>
<p>A warming climate doesn’t simply heat up summers and keep winters from getting as cold as they used to: It can also disrupt weather patterns, making storms stronger and rain events more intense. It can change when and where snow falls or lakes freeze. And it may reprogram the very ways that oceans circulate.</p>
<p>&quot;2018 was an exclamation point on a trend toward more big rain,&quot; says Arndt.</p>
<p>But the ever-increasing heat is also a challenge for humans and living creatures around the world. Heat waves from Europe to Australia roiled the planet this past year, breaking temperature records and fueling devastating wildfires. The European heat waves, scientists discovered, were about five times more likely because of human-induced climate change. The wildfires that wracked the western U.S. were also intensified by climate change, scientists have determined, as heat and drought sucked water out of vegetation, leaving it dry and flammable as kindling.</p>
<p>Rising temperatures also contributed to a growing inventory of weather-related disasters. In 2018, NOAA says, there were 14 weather and climate events that cost the country hundreds of lives and $1 billion dollars or more, for a total of at least 247 deaths and $91 billion in damages. Hurricanes Florence and Michael, which devastated the communities through which they ripped, were the most destructive, with western wildfires following closely behind.</p>
<p>The forecast for coming years points to more of the same. The U.K.’s Met Office predicts that 2019 will likely be even warmer than 2018, at least in part driven by a developing El Niño event, which nearly always bump global temperatures up. But scientists stress that greenhouse gas emissions are the primary factor pushing temperatures higher both in past decades and into the future.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
