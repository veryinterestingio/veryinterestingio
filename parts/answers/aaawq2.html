		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the 1950s, the Communist Party in China was faced with a huge population and not enough doctors trained in Western medicine. The solution was a big propaganda push emphasizing the superiority of “ancient” Chinese medicine, which was at that time an eclectic collection of folk remedies. Most of the animals used in traditional Chinese medicine were found in China, but the principles behind it could be extended to other animals - if the recipe calls for parts from a big, strong creature, surely a rhino would be very good medicine. So Now there was a large market with a large demand, and savvy suppliers stepped in to fuel that demand and make profits. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They actually were in Asia, <a href="http://ringmar.net/irhistorynew/index.php/2018/10/12/a-giraffe-in-beijing/" target="_blank">brought in as gifts to the emperor.</a> Southeast Asia and Vietnam, which was historically part of China had the Asian Elephant and Rhino. So these animals used to be the symbol of the rich and powerful. As ancient medicine has all sorts of bad side effects (see bloodletting, trepanning, and mercury for immortality), the methods that do the least harm are the ones that survive, since sometimes the improving health of the patient can be falsely attributed to the medicine, rather than to them naturally healing over time without any effect. This is also why homeopathy still survives to this day.</p>
<p>As the rich and powerful have access to these exotic creatures, they are also seen as status symbols. And as medicines produced from these animals would have little to no effect, and also show a certain amount of divine power (the giraffe is said to resemble the qilin or chinese unicorn), they are written down by the scholars of the time as miracle cures.</p>
<p>As Asia's economy improved and industrialised in modern times, the people had a higher standard of living, and the things that were once only restricted to emperors, nobles and the extremely rich could now be bought by middle class people. This drives up demand, and therefore increases the hunting pressure on these animals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The demand really is only in the super rich Asian and they do it for vanity. Period. It's really no different from those hunting trophies in those very rich country folks or picture of African hunting safari. It's just to show ppl around them that they are rich enough to spend money on this type of stuff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of utter bullshit answers here, including the top answer. Giraffe is not used in any Chinese traditional medicine, nor is any part of the elepahnt. Ivory is used in China how it is used anywhere in the world, as a precious material for trinkets and art. Tiger bone is not an ingredient in any medicine either; some people just think it has health benefits. The only real ingredient is rhino horn, and in modern production of that particular medicine recipe by approved pharmaceutical has been replaced by water buffalo horns. Both elephants and rhinos <em>are</em> traditionally found in China. Like, how hard is it to look up &quot;Asian elephant&quot; and &quot;Asian rhino&quot; and read a little about their habitat and range before the modern era? As for why do people demand endangered animal parts? Why do people want ivory and gemstone and diamond, ever? Because a small but not insignificant portion of the population is both powerful/rich and uneducated/dumb. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's important to distinguish &quot;traditional&quot; medicine in Asia from &quot;folk&quot; medicine.  Traditional medicine has roots tracing back thousands of years and is largely unchanged.  It is generally based on crude pharmacology and various types of anatomy and physiology.  The science may not be 100%, but there is a scientific process of sorts and certified practitioners.  Folk medicine is an uneducated, cobbled together kind of medicine that is customized to area, problems, etc.</p>
<p>Traditional medicine in rural Asia is largely unchanged over the past 100 years.  Globalization has not done much more than change the way it's expressed to a more coherent and organized means.  Their beliefs and science behind it may be questionable, but we have similar issues in our medical practices, just expressed in different ways.</p>
<p>Folk medicine has changed radically with globalization.  The introduction of alien species has opened up a lot of exotic flavors to tired tropes for snake oil salesmen.  Imagine if you wanted to convince an impotent man that you were selling a cure for his ED.  You've been selling ground up oxen horns for hundreds of years.  But now you can sell someone elephant horns.  New!  Bigger!  Stronger!  Exotic!  Striking!  It's everything a salesman would want.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
