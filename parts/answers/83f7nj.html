		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have 3 sets of eye lid muscles, and when all of them are relaxed your eyelids will find a nice balance of being a bit open (think of how it looks when you're tired).</p>
<p>One set is circular and goes around the whole eye, when it contracts your eyelids close (you can flex it by squeezing your eyes shut). It's the orbicularis occuli.</p>
<p>The second set is inside the upper eye lid and it's the one you use to open your eyes wide. It's the levator palpebrae superioris.</p>
<p>The third set is an odd one - it controls the upper eyelids too, but only when you're surprised. You don't have any direct control over this muscle, it'll fire off when you need to open your eyes very quickly. It's the superior tarsal muscle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both. Pretty much every every muscle in your body works in pairs, an agonist and antagonist. What the agonist does, the antagonist does the opposite of. That way neither can pull too far and no muscle ever gets stuck in one plane or position. Every skeletal muscle in the body can only &quot;pull&quot;,even when you think you are &quot;pushing&quot;. So the agonist pulls one direction and the antagonist pulls the other ?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are using levaror palpebrae muscle to open your eyelids. </p>
<p>You can &quot;force shut&quot; your eyes by using orbicularis muscle, but that contracts the entire muscles around the eye. The &quot;periorbital&quot; region. </p>
<p>For the most part, eyelids being closed is all passive, with exceptions. Some peoples anatomy don't cause them to passively shut. </p>
<p>When you're sleeping or dead they're usually shut, however the trauma and electrolyte imbalances of dying sometimes causes your eyelids to contract (open)</p>
