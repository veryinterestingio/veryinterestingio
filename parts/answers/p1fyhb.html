		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s no direct evidence of the brain’s ‘inner wiring’ of any sort. The best we can do at the moment is tell which parts of the brain have increased activity when the person is doing specific tasks/thinking specific things. If someone has ‘foot fetish’, then obviously when they get sensory input associated with feet they’ll also have increased activity in a pattern associated with sexual arousal. This doesn’t suggest any direct ‘wiring’ between the two parts, it may rely heavily on higher order thought, or at least on more abstract representations in the brain. </p>
<p>In fact, if we consider how any kind of feet-associated input (for example, a picture, verbal description, being touched in the feet, touching other people’s feet, or just imagining feet) can stimulate sexual arousal in someone with foot fetish, it’s a pretty strong evidence that the connection is from higher order thought area, and not any of the basic sensory areas. Put another way, it’s the thought, the idea of feet, not the raw sensory signal, that causes the arousal. There would be no appreciable difference in the brain’s connections at that level.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is true that the parts of the brain which directly receive sensory input from the genetalia and the feet are adjacent. There's a distinct strip of brain devoted to sensory input called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortical_homunculus?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">Cortical Homonculus</a>. The genital area is right at the far end, just after the toes area.</p>
<p>Aaaand that's pretty much the only thing that factoid is based on. The brain is generally pretty specific about its wiring, though 'remapping' of inputs can occur - particularly in the case of limb loss. But there's no evidence that I'm aware of for this specific effect, besides the location of the two sensory regions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
