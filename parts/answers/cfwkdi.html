Look at some of the first PS2 games and then look at some just 2-3 years later.  It is hard to believe they are on the same system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The NES cartridge connector connects several NES buses to the cartridge.</p>
<p>One bus connects the PRG ROM. This ROM contains the program and game data. It has 15 address pins so it can address up to 32KiB.</p>
<p>Another bus connects the CHR ROM. This ROM contains tile data: 8x8 squares of 4 colours. There are 4 palettes for backgrounds, and another 4 palettes for sprites (0 is always the transparent colour). One byte is used to select which tile is displayed so there are 256 tiles available for backgrounds, and another 256 tiles for sprites. You need 8KiB to store all this data (2 bits per pixel * 64 pixels * 512 tiles).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>SMB uses the CHR rom at it's maximum capacity. Some sprites like the goombas are in fact the same half twice with one half flipped to save space.</p>
<p>Some NES games uses extra hardware called &quot;mappers&quot; to circumvent it's limitations. It allows mapping a subset of a bigger ROM into the address space. SMB3 uses the MMC3, uses a 128 KiB CHR ROM a 256 KiB PRG ROM and 8KiB of RAM (used for level data).</p>
<p>With all this extra memory available, you can have all the animations, world map and stuff you don't have in SMB1.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, Super Mario Bros was originally on a floppy disk in japan, before capcom discovered how to increase the storage of a cartridge with Makaimura(Ghosts n Goblins)which effectively killed off the Disk System in Japan(The western NES has a serial port on the bottom of the system for the planned western release of the disk system)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>iirc the floppy disks could only hold a max of 144kb whereas the largest licensed NES game kirby's adventure was 512kb for the program rom and 256 kb for the ram</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
