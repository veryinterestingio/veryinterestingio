The research is still out on what exactly causes autism but one study I was reading said that your parents being older (I think it was above 35 or 40?) might have links to higher rates of their child having autism.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are certainly learned behaviors involved with autism. But the phenomenon itself is biological. Study is ongoing. But it's likely not a single thing and &quot;autism&quot; is more a collection of symptoms than a classification of a single thing &quot;going wrong&quot;. Most likely, it's multiple things in any given case.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m a 52 year old higher functioning autistic. I’m a computer savant. I was never vaccinated as a kid, shove that one up your arse anti-VAXor‘s. I didn’t get diagnosed until I was in my middle forties. It started that out as a appointment to see a doctor about G.I. problems. Ended up with a diagnosis for social anxiety, which went deeper and was eventually diagnosed as higher functioning autism. Apart from some repetitive behaviors, and some really bad issues with my surroundings changing unexpectedly, any changes in life unexpectedly actually will send me off the deep end, I didn’t see any of the other signs in myself. Once I got diagnosed it lifted the curtain on so many of my behaviors that were a part of autism. It’s been an extremely difficult journey. If only I had known then what I know now etc. etc...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is currently unknown, though there is certainly a genetic component, there may also be an environmental factor or factors which activates the potential autism. However once autism has developed the brain is then wired differently and it cannot be reversed, though an individual can adopt coping strategies to deal with common situations and others develop masking strategies so as to appear to be more standardised, a masking strategy appears to be far more common in girls with autism than boys.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There appears to be a considerable difference in the prefrontal cortex of autism spectrum individuals which impacts executive functioning. There also appears to be variations in how the various brain networks interact, specifically impacting something called the default mode network or DMN. These two changes seem to account for the behavioral, sensory, and processing differences observed in these people. Since these changes are structural, it's almost definitely primarily a genetic change, although there may also be hormonal interactions in utero. This could explain why it's a spectrum rather than an on/off.</p>
<p>100% it is definitely not caused by any post-partem environmental factor, including vaccines.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
