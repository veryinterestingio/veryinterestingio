		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our legs and knees bear a lot of stress due to our walking upright. The muscles in our upper leg are the biggest and most powerful in the body.</p>
<p>The quadriceps muscle is responsible for extending the leg - when it contracts, it pulls on the tendon that runs over the front of our knee, which extends our lower leg.</p>
<p>This tendon runs more or less right over the kneecap. What the kneecap does is act as a fulcrum - it moves the tendon away from the knee joint's point of rotation, just a little, but enough to provide a significant mechanical advantage. It actually makes the quadriceps muscle about 30% more powerful than it would be without it.</p>
<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XnYO4TnpTCo" target="_blank">Here's a YouTube video showing how it works.</a></p>
<p>As we generally don't walk around on our hands, our elbows need no such mechanical advantage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ulnar bone has a fairly prominent process called the olecranon, wonder if it serves a similar function of moving the triceps pull of force into a more advantageous position about the joint like the patella does for the quadriceps? We talked about the knee in my biomechanics classes in regards to this but never the elbow. Could be as others have said, just don't need it as a bipedal organism.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your femur (thigh bone) and your tibia (shin bone) are sandwiched between a cartilage circle structure (meniscus). These bones are held in place through ligaments to prevent front, back and side movements to keep the bone in place. Your knee joint is actually quite an unstable joint in your lower limb, which has to support the weight of your body, which is why it needs more protection. In your elbow joint, there are two connections to the humerus (upper arm bone); one of these has a hook like end (ulna/forearm bone) which is very stable. Also, the elbow doesn’t often bear a lot of weight compared to the knee. Hope that’s clear!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The knee cap is actually a bone that develops in childhood. Babies don't have them. It's a special kind of bone known as a sesamoid bone that forms inside the tendon to help take the forces exerted on the tendon by the large muscles of the thigh.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
