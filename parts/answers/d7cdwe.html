		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Same reason you can’t tickle yourself. Your brain has a region dedicated to controlling movements, and a region dedicated to analyzing sensations. When you touch yourself, these regions communicate so that your brain knows that you’re the one causing the sensation. This allows your brain to predict the sensations you produce, taking away the surprise factor. When someone else touches you, you’re unable to predict exactly how it will feel because they’re the ones controlling their movements. This is surprising to your brain which allows you to feel more pleasure from the sensation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body releases oxytocin when you have contact with other people. It is known as the “cuddle hormone” or “love hormone” and it makes us feel connected to the other person. That’s why we hug and shake hands and stuff. But our bodies don’t release it when we touch ourselves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
