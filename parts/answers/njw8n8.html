		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doctor here, many people are confidently wrong in this thread. Real reasons are :</p>
<p>1) Blood in stomach or vomiting blood doesn’t necessarily mean you swallowed it. It can be your digestive tract bleeding, which would be absolute top priority to rule out or treat. Clearing it is a necessary step to check it with endoscopy (camera probe) if need be. </p>
<p>2) Full stomach is a vomiting and aspiration (choking) risk in a trauma patient, and an anesthesia risk for the same reason. Emptying stomach protects airways and makes an eventual emergency surgery easier and safer. </p>
<p>All the comments about iron toxicity are completely absurd. </p>
<p>People with any kind of digestive bleeding end up <em>severely iron DEFICIENT</em> since the GI tract can only absorb a small % of the iron we eat, so you’d necessarily end up with less iron in you bloodstream at the end of the day. The amount needed to be toxic would require you to drink more blood than you’ll ever have, obviously killing you from blood loss in the process. </p>
<p>And even self-inflicted iron toxicity was a thing, when a kid is wrecked and bleeding profusely from a car crash, it would be ridiculously insignificant in the list of things you’d have to take care of in emergency.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A) You don't want to add vomiting on top of all the other shit going down. Having a whole heap of blood in your stomach irritates it and makes it more likely.
B) You want to know if bleeding is from the stomach or somewhere else if you do throw up. If there's a whole heap of blood from somewhere else you it's hard to tell if there's GI bleeding and that's something doctors really need to know.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
