It hasn't been much of a problem because competition with native species has kept it in check.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's far more likely that you observed mobbing behavior by the crows, which is a social anti-predator defense (typically of nests) rather than a hunting activity. The goal is to drive the predator (hawk) away, and while the crows may strike at the hawk, and the hawk may go nearer to the ground as a consequence of, or to avoid those attacks, the mobbed predator is rarely injured and extremely unlikely to have been killed.</p>

<p>Crows do not have the physical or behavioral adaptations of accipiters which regularly prey on other in-flight or ground birds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've been reading a book called Crow Planet, where the author asserts that Crows originate from Kazakhstan, and that they have been expanding across the globe alongside our species for millenia.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Corvids--which includes crows, ravens, rooks, jays--are naturally found all over the world. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corvidae#/media/File:Corvidae_range.png" target="_blank">Here is a range map</a>, you'll see that they're not &quot;introduced&quot; anywhere, just &quot;re-introduced&quot; and only then in a small part of the world.</p>
<p>A lot of different birds are called &quot;crows,&quot; like how many different birds are called &quot;sparrows&quot; or &quot;doves.&quot; If you watch anime, you've probably seen crows, but they sound very different from the crows here in America. That's because they're two different species. But for the average person, it's a black bird that's kind of smart and has some association with death, so you might think of it as the same species.</p>
<p>Corvids are some of the smartest animals on the planet. They are highly social (which is important for intelligence), they teach each other things (if a person hurts/kills a crow, they tell all their friends, and they all know to avoid that person), they use tools, and they even hold funerals! The ones in Japan steal nuts and drop them in the crosswalks for cars to crush, then wait for the pedestrian light so they can get it without getting run over. New Caledonian crows have been well documented making tools out of materials that aren't found in nature. </p>
<p>Birds that have been introduced all over the world include the house sparrow, rock dove (regular ol' pigeon), and european starling, the latter because all birds that were mentioned by William Shakespeare should be in North America, because reasons. Pigeons because they're tasty and can be used as messengers. Pigeons are smart (they can read kinda) but if they weren't introduced by humans they wouldn't be in our cities around the world, since prey animals tend to be on the dumber side. But corvids, as scavengers, are incredibly intelligent and are designed to exploit ecological niches as they pop up. This flexibility means they can live in a lot of different environments, so they do really well in suburbs in cities. Put some peanuts and mealworms out if you'd like to see some come to your backyard.</p>
<p>As for the eagle, this is an example of crows knowing who's a bad guy and telling each other. Eagles, hawks, falcons and owls have no qualms with hunting and killing weaker crows, like if they're sick or babies. You can find videos of owls grabbing baby eagles or hawks from nests at night because they fly silently. Crows remember this, and they know that if a bird of prey is around then it might try to kill one of them. They mob it to make it go away, and normally that's what happens; predators want an easy meal, and if a bunch of crows are alerting each other then it's not easy anymore. But a bunch of bunnies or mice aren't going to stand up to an eagle, or a bunch of fawns, or your chihuahua or cat, so the eagle is just going to go eat one of those instead. If eagles <em>only</em> ate crows then, yes, they would have a problem and might go extinct, but since they have a lot of choices (including your defenseless, dumb pets) on a whole they'll be okay.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
