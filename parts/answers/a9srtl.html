		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Exactly! The egg cytoplasm contains maternal RNA polymerases (and other proteins and mRNAs) to get the zygote through the first few cell divisions. There's a later step that occurs around the mid-blastula stage called zygotic genome activation (ZGA) where the zygotic genes themselves start to be transcribed and the maternal mRNA is degraded.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The maternal egg cell is basically primed and ready to go in a lot of ways. One of those ways, like others have said, is that is has all the machinery for cell division and gene replication all prepared for when the cell is fertilized. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Going in a similar direction, the same problem with translation occurs in hibernating species. When staying dormant for long periods, how do you make sure your ribosomes are still intact enough to re-initiate translation once itâ€™s time to get back up and running? Some species actually preserve their ribosomes through crystallization and this phenomenon helped greatly in solving the crystal structure of the ribosome for which a nobel prize in chem was awarded.</p>
<p>Below is a passage from a review written by one of the recipients Ada Yonath:</p>
<p>Given the significance of ribosomes for cell vitality, attempts at the crystallization of ribosomal particles had been made worldwide for over two decades, all of which were found to be unproductive. Consequently, the crystallization of ribosomes was considered a formidable challenge. The difficulties in ribosome crystallization stemmed from their marked tendency to deteriorate, high degree of internal mobility, flexibility, functional heterogeneity, chemical com- plexity, large size, and asymmetric nature. Nevertheless, the
findings that large amounts of ribosomes of hibernating polar bears are orderly packed on the inner side of their cell membranes indicated that ribosomes can produce periodical arrangements in vivo. Similar observations were made on shock-cooled fertilized eggs (e.g. Ref. [20]). These phenom- ena were associated with cold or similar shocks, rationalizing them as a strategy taken by organisms under stress for storing pools of functionally active ribosomes which will be needed when the stressful conditions are removed. Indeed, structural studies performed on samples obtained from shock-cooled fertilized eggs later led to the visualization of ribosomal internal features (see below and Ref. [20]).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So nobody has mentioned yet that ribosomes aren't a protein, they are RNA. This also answers the obvious question about evolution : how do you have a protein that creates all your cell's proteins? You don't, it's a RNA enzyme (same with t RNA)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
