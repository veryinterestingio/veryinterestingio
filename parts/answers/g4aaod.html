		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you start learning to play the guitar, most of the difficulty comes from your off-hand: changing from one chord to another can easily take 5-10 seconds for months.</p>
<p>After some time, though, when you start playing for example guitar solos, the difficulty shifts to your main hand. This is because you don't just do up and down motions: you need to do very small and very precise up-down motions, alternating between multiple strings multiple times a second.</p>
<p>Generally, how fast you can play the guitar is determined by your main hand.</p>
<p>Also this is why there are a lot of off-hand tricks to help your main hand to skip a few tones, most notably hammer-ons and pull-offs. The former is, for example, when you pick a string which you hold down with your off-hand index finger, then with off-hand right finger you slam down the string two frets away. Meanwhile your main hand can prepare for the next tone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I did violin in school and found that my left needed only controlled, minute movements to set up the note, while my right was in control of the technique - volume, style, duration, etc. The right hand had more work to do.</p>
<p>It can also be because history doesn't have a good relationship with left hands, and this hasn't changed or evolved.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming that you don't play guitar at anything above beginner level. Right hand strums, alternate picks, skips strings, applies fingerstyle, mutes and plenty other stuff. In my experience, right hand techniques are just as demanding as left hand techniques.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In my opinion it really doesn't matter. No matter which hand you use for what, they're both going to be developing entirely novel motor skills that you never had before anyway, so they're both going to be equally terrible at whatever you use them for.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>while your skilled hand only does up/down strings?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Never underestimate how much coordination and practice good strumming requires. It's not as simple as it sounds. Again, the strumming motion is also a completely new motor skill for your &quot;skilled&quot; hand, so it won't be doing a great job at first either.</p>
<p>If you're just starting to learn the instrument, start right-handed. As I said, it's gonna be equally hard either way. Well, &quot;why right-handed if it doesn't matter?&quot; you may ask. The answer is finding a left-handed guitar that you like is MUCH harder. Many stores don't stock them, and many models don't even have left-handed variants.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
