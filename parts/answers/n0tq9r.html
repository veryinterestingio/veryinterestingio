		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It feels good right? Sometimes there is too much blood in your arm depending on the position, and when you pick it up the blood pressure goes down a little releasing the tension. That's why you will see in sports when some one gets hurt the pick up the leg. </p>
<p>At least I think that's how it works.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I do this constantly. And sometimes I play video games with the controller kind of over my head and behind me. I find it kind of releases pressure or tension in muscles. And the feeling of just holding your arm up over your head just feels.. kinda good? I dunno, it's likely a blood flow thing also. Or like a superman flying holding your fist up while you're laying down thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
