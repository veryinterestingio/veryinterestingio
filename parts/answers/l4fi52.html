		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Flashbangs contain a mixture known as &quot;flash&quot;. It's often used in professional firecrackers. It's made from often magnesium and potassium perclorate/nitrate(not sure, I believe perchlorate makes the mix more explosive by oxidizing more).</p>
<p>Magnesium that burns produces magnesium oxide, and this reaction generates a lot of heat. Magnesium in itself burns very bright already, and this mix sort of compresses all that energy and releases it really fast.</p>

<p>I hope this helps you :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The critical reaction occurring in a flashbang is centred around magnesium and oxygen: 2Mg (s) + O_2 (g) --&gt; 2MgO (s) + energy .  The energy comes in the form of UV light, which is what's responsible for the blinding effect from this exceptionally exothermic reaction (in fact, if you're not wearing UV blocking eye protection when this guy goes off, you may permanently lose some of your vision).  The oxygen in the air is in excess, so what's most important is simply to get the process going by providing enough energy to make it over the activation barrier and get the reaction going (while magnesium is super reactive with oxygen, it still requires *energy input to get started).  The explosion from the bang component is more than sufficient in this case.  Hope that sheds some light on the chemistry of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
