		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you take a bottle of water, remove the cap, and then tip it upside down the water will flow out in a gurgle. Every so often the flow will stop and air will get sucked up into the bottle, then the water flows again. This happens because of pressure inside the bottle versus outside.</p>
<p>If you poke a hole in the upper part of the water bottle, this stops. That's because one hole lets air in while the other lets water out.</p>
<p>That's what's happening in your car. If you only open one window, air is forced into the car due to the speed, but that builds up pressure until the air forces its way out, and then the outside air is forced in again. That back-and-forth in pressure is what you are hearing/feeling.</p>
<p>If you open a second window at the back of the vehicle, the air flows in one window and out the other, like the hole in the water bottle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What you're hearing is rapid fluctuations in the air pressure in the cabin of the car. The cause of this is typically when you have two windows open on opposite sides of the car, and often if they are at different amounts open but not needfully so. The air flowing in, and out, at speed, is at different paces at each window, affecting each other.   </p>
<p>You know when you open and pour juice how if you don't have it open enough, or don't have an air hole the liquid glugs when you pour it? Think of it a bit like that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s a super low frequency in the several hertz range. Think of when you blow air over a bottle, the sound it makes... now take the cavity of the car and the air going past is like you blowing on the bottle, but instead of hearing a tone, you’re “hearing” or rather sensing a very low frequency.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
