		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Psychology! As far as we can tell, it's an example of what's known as <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning" target="_blank"><em>classical conditioning</em></a>.</p>
<p>You might have heard about Ivan Pavlov and his experiments with dogs. Basically, he found that dogs would salivate when you fed them -- which is a normal physiological reaction that happens reflexively, without any conscious choice -- but that the dogs would start to salivate even before his assistant placed the food in front of them, specifically in response to the sound of the assistant approaching. The sound of footsteps, while theoretically unconnected to the food, triggered the same reaction, even when the food itself never arrived. Further experiments found that you could take natural reactions to certain events, such as salivation (often known as 'unconditioned responses') and have them attach themselves to unrelated triggers ('unconditioned stimuli') through repeated exposure. (Pavlov's actual findings -- and what he thought they meant for human psychology -- were <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/24/drool" target="_blank">a bit more complicated</a>, and not summed up quite so neatly, but that's the idea behind classical conditioning in general.)</p>
<p>What's happening when you pee is that you're effectively creating the sound of running water as your urine splashes against the bowl. Your brain links the two events together -- 'urinating' and 'sound of water' -- into one unit, but it's not <em>great</em> at determining cause and effect. As such, when you hear running water, it can make you think of urination (because the two often go hand in hand), at which point your body steps in to remind you that hey, your bladder is getting a little on the full side, and maybe you want to go and do something about that before you make a mess?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't for me, oddly enough.</p>
<p>But I think the answer is simply an association thing. When people pee they associate the signs of urine hitting the water in the toilet with peeing and the feeling beforehand.</p>
<p>So when you hear a sound very similar to it, then your brain thinks &quot;time to pee!&quot;</p>
<p>The association thing goes back to survival instincts--our brains are formed around pattern recognition so we can spot danger and process information quickly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people are arguing its a conditioned response, but i'd argue that it is an evolutionary trait; In a time when water might not be readily accessible, I would make sense to &quot;Top Up&quot; form a local source at every opportunity. The unration response is probably your body making room for more water by immediately flushing any waste water in your system to the bladder, expecting new water reserves to soon be available.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the time you spend peeing is also spent listening to running water (from your own pee in the bowl/urinal).</p>
<p>So you have hours and hours of (pee - watersound) association.</p>
<p>The resulting effect is like why smelling food makes you hungry. You often experience them both (smelling food + eating) at the same time, so experienceing one &quot;primes&quot; you for the other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
