		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>funnily enough they taught something different to the other comments in med school this year. when you breathe it's a balance of plural cavity pressures plus the effect of the lung called the elastic recoil resisting the expansion of the langs. this recoil is due to the surface tension of water in the alveoli and is greatest at the smaller volumes of the alveoli because the water is closer together. also there's a volume of air in the lungs called the residual volume that cannot be exhaled which really aids in maintaining the elastic recoil not being too high. when you're winded it can pushes out the residual volume so you need to overcome the higher than normal contracting force of the surface tension to inhale and that's why it's harder to breathe. or that's what was taught to me anyways.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Inhalation is the process whereby both the diaphragm and the intercostal muscles engage in order to increase the volume of the thoracic (chest) cavity. More interior volume  lowers the air pressure within the lungs until it is below that of the surrounding atmosphere. At this point the surrounding air moves into the lungs as you &quot;Take a breath&quot; </p>
<p>Basically, the body contracts a series of muscles in order to make the space within the chest larger. This draws air into the lungs in the same way that pulling back on the plunger of a syringe would draw in fluid. </p>
<p>Having &quot;the wind knocked out of you&quot; usually refers to a kinetic trauma, one that places force upon the chest and diaphragm (which is the <em>major</em> muscle used to expand the chest cavity during inhalation). When this outside force hits just right, it can reduce the volume of the chest cavity. As it gets smaller, the air pressure within your lungs begins to increase and, once it is greater than that of the surrounding atmosphere, it will expel the air from your lungs - which results in a forced exhalation.</p>
<p>Basically, if you fall and land on the <em>plunger</em> it depresses and will squirt out any fluid that had been drawn into the syringe.</p>
<p>Attempting to inhale immediately after having the wind knocked out of you is mostly a contraction of the intercostal muscles which, without the assistance of the diaphragm, <em>feels</em> like you are breathing, but no air enters the lungs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your diaphragm goes into spasm as a result of a blow to the upper stomach area. The diaphragm is a sheet of muscle sealing off the lower part of the cavity where the lungs are, for the time it's not working you can't inflate your lungs properly or at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The diaphragm muscle is in your abdomen and helps expand the chest cavity for breathing. Getting the wind knocked out of you is essentially taking a shot to the diaphragm making the muscle spasm and not respond making it very difficult to expand the chest cavity and breathe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
