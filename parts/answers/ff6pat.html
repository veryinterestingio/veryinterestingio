		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some types of binding involve individual stacks of paper called signatures, which are bundles of pages threaded or stapled together (in the middle) and then those signatures are all bound together (stacked up) creating a spine.  </p>
<p>Now say I have a signature that is 1 piece of paper, folded in the middle.  This creates 4 printable pages.</p>
<p>If my book is 6 pages long, Iâ€™d need 2 signatures leaving 2 blank pages at the end.</p>
<p>HTH</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with how books are put together. Pages in a book are put together in groups called <a href="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto,w_728/v1555914665/shape/mentalfloss/64-page-perfect-bound-brochure.png" target="_blank">signatures</a>. A signature is groups of pages folded in half and assembled together. Each signature in a book will always have the same number of pages and it's always even. If you have a book with 10 32-page signatures, your book has 320 pages, but there might not be 320 pages of content in your book. If there are only 316 pages of content, you have 4 blank pages.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is because books are printed on a big sheet of paper, called a signature, which is then folded to make 16-24 pages in the book. So books can only be printed with pages that are multiples of 16 (or something else, depending on how large a signature they started with). This means there will be left over pages at the end of the book if the book isn't an exact multiple of 16 or whatever they used. Most editors would typeset the book so as to reduce the number of blank pages, but sometimes there are one or two that just have to be left blank.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
