		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am going to assume you mean brightest rather than most reflective (but it is both)?</p>
<p>The brightness of a planet is determined by a few factors, and one of them is that is the most reflective (shiniest). Astronomers measure reflectivity with something called albedo, the ratio of reflected to incident light. Venus has an albedo (0.75) that is more than double the next most reflective planet - the outer planets are all around 0.3 and Mars and Mercury are around 0.15. Venus' high albedo is due to the clouds being light coloured as opposed to dark rocky surfaces of Mercury and Mars or the darker clouds of the outer planets.</p>
<p>The distance between Venus and the Sun is also important, the closer a planet is to the Sun the more incident radiation there is so there is obviously also more reflected radiation. Venus is almost as close to the Sun as Mercury. This follows what we call an inverse square law, a planet 3 times further away will have 9 times less incident radiation, the outer planets therefore have very low incident radiation compared to the inner planets.</p>
<p>The next major factor is the distance between the Earth and Venus, while Mercury is on average the closest planet to Earth, when Venus is on our side of the Sun it has the closest approach to the Earth, this will coincide with the times where Venus is exceptionally bright in the sky.  This is also an inverse square law, so if a planet is 3 times further away from us, it will be 9 times less bright.</p>
<p>The last factor is the size of the planet, a planet that has three times the radius will have 9 times the reflective area. The outer planets are much much larger than Venus so despite being much much further from the Sun, much much further from the Earth, and having lower albedos we can still see Saturn and Jupiter brightly throughout much of the year. Venus' relatively small size is more than made up with though by its distance to us (but only for some of its orbit, it is quite faint on the far side really).</p>
<p>So basically a confluence of the distance to the Sun, its size and its reflectivity and, most importantly, its distance to us all make it appear bright to us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Venus is bright because itâ€™s cloudy, as others have said. This is much the same effect as the tops of clouds looking really white from a plane. The droplets and - especially - ice crystals make the thick, cloudy atmosphere highly scattering to light.</p>
<p>More than that though, the effect is juiced up by the fact that Venus is such a volcanic planet. The atmosphere is full of sulphur compounds, and these (especially sulphuric acid) form <em>extremely</em> reflective particles in the atmosphere. So, Venus ends up with a high albedo, AKA reflects a lot of light back, AKA is very white, AKA is shiny.</p>
<p>Fun fact- sulphur aerosols are also super important for understanding past climate on Mars and climate change on Earth. Modelling them remains one of the biggest sources of uncertainty in both. Cloud science is HARD.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thing 1.  It's closest to us, 25m miles away (Mars averages about 140m miles away).  So, of the light it reflects, more is seen here on earth.</p>
<p>Thing 2.  It's closer to the sun than almost all the other planets, so it gets hit with more light than them.  So it reflects more light than them.</p>
<p>Thing 3.  It's pretty large.  Mars is about twice the size of our moon.  In comparison, Venus is about the size of the Earth.  More surface area means it reflects more light.</p>
<p>Thing 4.  The atmosphere.  Almost total cloud cover all the time.  White clouds, reflecting almost all the light that hits them.</p>
<p>Take all 4 things together, and you get the third brightest object from our perspective here on earth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simplest answer is that Venus has a very dense atmosphere, therefore much of the light is reflected back off into space. Mars for example, has a pretty thin atmosphere, so light hits more of the surface and is scattered.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming you mean the brightest planet for an observer on earth.</p>
<p>How bright something is (for you) depends solely on how much visible light coming from it reaches your eyes.</p>
<p>Now, venus does not emit light directly. Instead, it reflects the light from the sun (other bright objects too but none of them are relevant). </p>
<p>How  much it reflects depends on 2 factors: how much light reaches it and how light it is (light in the sense of colour). Venus is close to the sun and big, which means it recieves a lot of light. It is also quite light, being yellowish, so it reflects a lot of it back in space.</p>
<p>Lastly, there's the matter of distance. The light scatters with distance. Because venus is (relatively) close to you on earth, the light coming from it doesn't scatter so much and a lot of it reaches your eyes.</p>
<p>Please take note that this is comment is simplified and lacks actual numbers. But in conclusion, venus is bright because its light enough, big enough and close enough to the sun and the earth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
