		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With the right stimuli, you might be able to remember that first one. Our memories are Squishy Squashy rather than straightforward like a book or a computer. With a book, you would be able to remember your first date, then just flip some pages back to find out how you met. But we don't remember that way. To remember how you met, you would likely need to get some kind of reminder. That can something like entering the room where you first met her, or smelling something that you had smelled at that same time, or listening to a song that was playing when you met her. Just something that could re-link that memory for you.</p>
<p>However, to answer your question more directly. It's because you can remember the times something important is forgotten and you pay zero attention to the times something mundane is forgotten. 2018 April 16, what did you eat? 2017 January 30th, how did you sleep? What was the person who sat behind you on the bus wearing last week?</p>
<p>Those memories are just plain gone. And you would not even wonder about having forgotten them because we don't even try to remember those kinds of things. </p>
<p>The more important the memory, the more connections it has. The more connections a memory has, the easier it is to remember it in the future. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Long term memory does not operate like we think it does, it only stores the most relevant information possible which usually has to do with stuff like danger and pain. Everything else gets compartmentalized in other types of memories and &quot;pointed&quot; to. Around one to two times per year the brain goes through your long time memories and tries to remove further stuff that is no longer necessary. Everything that gets removed is filled in by your imagination. </p>
<p>It means you most likely only remember something specific about that dinner, the rest is just your imagination filling in the blanks.</p>
<p>For example, I remember clearly I watched a music video of an old artist back in around 1985, and the reason I know it must be around that was that I was in a kindergarten at the time. The problem is that I later figured out that that video did not come out until 1994 or so, long after I quit the kindergarten in question. The only explanation I can think of is that my memory has stacked the 1994 videos into the same compartment as the 1985 videos.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

I remember one day in highschool me and my friend were walking to class together and she asked me how my day was. And I said &quot;eh just another day I will forget.&quot; But ironically I've remembered that conversation lol.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Someone will explain it far better than I but essentially your memories are memories of memories.  The more you access a memory the more it becomes embedded.  For example, I broke my leg when I was younger, i was pushed off a slide - I remember who did it.  Except that was a nightmare, that has been accessed time and time again, embedded as an actual memory.</p>
<p>Thus the stories people tell grow arms and legs because the memory is of the last times they told it rather than the actual event itself. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
