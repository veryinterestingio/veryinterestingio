		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As similar as those two things may seem, they are quite different. Activated charcoal is generally pyrolyzed, meaning it is heated to high temperatures around 800 degrees C, under inert atmosphere. This process gives a product which is quite close to pure carbon. Non-carbon elements are almost completely burned out.</p>
<p>In contrast, burnt food stuffs often contain a range of byproducts from incomplete burning, most famously acrylamide. These compounds can be distasteful and carcinogenic, but are also responsible for some of those &quot;smokey&quot; and &quot;grilled&quot; flavors that many people enjoy, when subtly present.</p>
<p>If you would pyrolyze blackened food, it would become charcoal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since the difference between charcoal and burnt food is already well explained, I'll only add this:
Activated charcoal is NOT harmless and definitely not encouraged. It is a medicine used after intoxication, because it is a strong adsorbant, meaning chemical substances like to stick to it. However, the charcoal is not selective. It adsorbs basically any substance. That includes any medication you might need (eg birth control or antibiotics) and also nutrients! So misuse can lead to ineffective meds and malnutrition.
If you don't have to take any meds and are generally a healthy human, nothing bad comes from eating activated charcoal every once in a while. On the other hand, there also are absolutely no benefits to eating activated charcoal without a medical condition requiring it.</p>
<p>To clarify: OP didn't say it was generally encouraged, but I'm seeing the recommendation to eat activated charcoal, sometimes even on a daily basis, all over the internet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I wasn't aware up until this post that people were using activated charcoal for non emergency reasons, but I can say that the reason it has historically been used in EMS for poison control is because it absorbs toxins. We were always told in class that it tasted disgusting and you'd usually not see anyone be able to finish the bottle without throwing up, so I'm pretty surprised to see that people are willingly using it for hangovers, energy and detoxing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Complex carbohydrates create a lot of different compounds when heated, possibly too many to list.</p>
