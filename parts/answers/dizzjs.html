		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>flat screws can apply more torq than phillips.  and cheaper to produce than phillips.  </p>
<p>phillips are intentionally designed to cam out when alot of torq is applied.   the point of using phillips is to help power tools.   with phillips the tool don't slide out from the head.   that happens with flat slot.</p>
<p>robertsons are superior.  but they're even more expensive than phillips.   most applications don't need expensive screws</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Quick note about long term durability. You can easily re-cut a slot to remove a screw, but you can't easily re-cut any other shape. That's one reason marine bolts and screws are often slotted.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With almost everything where someone says &quot;I'll make a new standard and it will be better!&quot; The new thing gains some ground but doesn't eliminate the old one.  Instead we now have multiple standards for lots of things from screws and electrical plugs to audio and video standards.  When someone makes a new one the old one still sticks around for at least a while.  I learned from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cA9bZRHpZE" target="_blank">this great video</a> about the history of a lot of screw types.  I'd recommend checking it out.  Turns out Phillips started out being used by Henry Ford because it's naturally torque limited.  Workers on the factory line could just run a tool as hard as possible and when it kicks out of the screw its tight enough.  Because they ended up on Fords which were everywhere they started getting used more often.  Hex and Torque screws both started out as proprietary security screws in electronics that the manufacturer didn't want you taking apart.  People quickly recognized their superiority in resisting stripping and they gained some popularity as well.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>edit: I might be a little off on Henry Ford's involvement, but watch the video it explains it better than I can.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing that I didn’t see mentioned in other comments is that it seems flat head (or “slotted”) screws are commonly used in places were they might be painted over, but due to their design, paint can be scraped out of the slot, allowing the screw to still be removed. You might encounter this situation when doing home maintenance, specifically with outlet and switch covers or door hinges that someone negligently painted over. If other screw designs—such as Phillips (plus), Robertson (square), Torx (star), and Allen (hex)—are painted over, it can be near impossible to unscrew them without using some sort of extractor tool.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
