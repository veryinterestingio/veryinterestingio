		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Seeing lights, colours and swirls with your eyes closed is called phosphenes and its because the nerve system (ganglion) that reacts to light also reacts to pressure (internal or external) so random pressure creates random nerve interpretations which your brain still receives. And since you ‚Äòsee‚Äô with your brain based on what your eyes ‚Äòtell‚Äô you, you see things.</p>
<p>Additional you see light without pressure because, very basically, your eyes create a minimal amount of light internally, called biophotons which triggers the nerves if there is no other stimuli.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would love to know more on this.
I get it every night when I try to fall asleep. Vivid neon flashing kaleidoscopic patterns that make me dizzy and nauseous. Thr next day, I often have a &quot;blind spot&quot; in the centre of my vision for a few minutes after a bad night of the flashing lights.  Anytime I've mentioned it, people look at me like I'm some form of crazy ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Was just talking with my 8 year old about this. Because he sees the squiggles and I used to when I was a kid, but I don't anymore. So I set a reminder to look it up and this shows up 2 days later.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
