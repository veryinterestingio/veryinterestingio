		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have always had bad sleep — taking hours to fall asleep, waking up and staying up in the middle of the night, being exhausted during the day but unable to nap or sleep later. I don’t take caffeine and am very aware of proper sleep hygiene. </p>
<p>My biggest question is what exactly is happening when I am super tired all day, so excited to go to sleep, then I get in bed and start to feel myself relaxing into sleep only to end up being awake for another 3 hours? Should I be going to bed very early (typically between 8:45-9:15)? Or something else? It is something that happens once I am in bed, not sure that it’s routine related, and it really sucks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
