<p><a href="https://www.thenakedscientists.com/articles/questions/why-do-spiders-have-such-potent-venom" target="_blank">This link</a> explains that insects evolve defences against spider venom, and so itâ€™s an arms race where the venoms get ever more powerful and complex. It sounds reasonable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Venom is not (always) lethal to all creatures.  Different animals have different reactions to venom.</p>
<p>I forget where I read it but in Australia, which had no native primates, the venomous creatures there are not especially lethal to the local fauna (at least not always).  As it happens primates have severe and deadly reactions to the same venom.</p>
<p>Of course, there are a wide variety of different venoms that work in different ways so this is not always the case.  Also consider that some venoms are meant to digest the food for the spider so it serves not only to kill their prey but also pre-digest it for them (they then slurp up the liquefied insides of their prey).</p>
<p>Just how it worked out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People and other primates are exquisitely sensitive to funnel web venom but, intriguingly, other mammals such as mice, rabbits, guineapigs, dogs and cats are relatively immune and often survive 100 times the human lethal dosage. For years scientists wondered whether funnel webs had some special grudge against people. But recently it was discovered the toxin is equally lethal to insects - the spiders' main prey. Dr Graham Nicholson, a funnel web expert from the University of Technology in Sydney, puts our unusual sensitivity to the toxin down to &quot;simple bad luck&quot;. He says there's no question humans and funnel webs evolved independently and our susceptibility probably has something to do with the wiring of our highly-evolved primate brains - one of the down-sides to being smart.  <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/science/slab/shorter/story.htm" target="_blank">SOURCE</a></p>
