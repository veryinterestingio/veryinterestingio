<p>The medical term is  o<strong>rthostatic hypotension (thx for pointing out typo)</strong> or <strong>postural hypotension</strong></p>
<p>I assume blood pressure tend to drop after a big stretch or after taking a blow to head as well which may well explain that phenomenon</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;When we get out of bed or stand up, the blood vessels in our body need to clamp down rapidly to maintain blood pressure going to the brain. If we stand too quickly, blood pressure can drop and cause dizziness, lightheadedness or fuzzy vision. This may just be a symptom of getting up too quickly, so it's important when getting out of bed in the morning to do so slowly.&quot;</p>
<p>Basically, your body gets shocked by you moving so fast and is working hard to get blood to your brain. This causes a dip in blood pressure. Not entirely sure how blood pressure relates to vision though, had a hard time finding anything that explained it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Usually “controlled falls” as I know what’s happening. But still have to go down for a second or two to equalize)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately I have no explanation, but I just want to attest that I know exactly what you mean (by the comments so far, not everyone seems to)! </p>
<p>It's like a bunch of white fireworks stars making quick sprints in multiple directions in your field of vision, then disappearing after a couple seconds, right? Meanwhile your vision is not blurred or dimmed at all, just these bright dots appear in the foreground for a while and then are gone. </p>
<p>Also not the same thing as feeling dizzy from low blood pressure, because that includes feeling weak and fainty, and the visual symptoms are more, umm, stationary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
