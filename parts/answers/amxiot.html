		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question.. Is there any evidence that seeing your life flash before your eyes is a common experience in any culture? </p>
<p>It seems more likely that its a shorthand used in TV, film, radio etc for a near death experience? Something that's become embedded into collective conciousness and so gets reused.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is an article published on this very topic i 2008 in transcultural psychiatry titled &quot;Phenomenology of near-death experiences: a cross-cultural perspective&quot; </p>
<p>The short answer is yes, there is a commonality but the abstract summarizes it rather succinctly so I'll just paste it here:</p>
<p>Near-death experiences (NDEs) include a set of subjective experiences encountered by people who were close to death or were faced with life-threatening situations. Reports have suggested that the phenomenology of NDE might differ across cultures. This article is aimed at providing an updated phenomenological perspective by comparing NDEs in a cross-cultural context. We compared the various descriptions of NDEs from a phenomenological perspective. There were similarities between particular cultures, which differed from typical western European experiences. This article concludes that although there are common themes, there are also reported differences in NDEs. The variability across cultures is most likely to be due to our interpretation and verbalizing of such esoteric events through the filters of language, cultural experiences, religion, education and their influence on our belief systems either shedding influence as an individual variable or more often perhaps by their rich interplay between these factors.</p>
