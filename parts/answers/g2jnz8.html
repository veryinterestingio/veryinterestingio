		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hypersonics are conveniently defined as any speed above Mach 5, because around Mach 5 a lot of engineering problems change their form.</p>
<p>At supersonic speeds, you can quite easily maintain subsonic combustion (a shock cone or ramp intake will do much of this, check Concorde's intakes which are well documented) for a conventional turbine-based engine.</p>
<p>Your airframe will experience drag heating from skin friction, but this again can be solved using titanium, ceramics, carbon, etc.</p>
<p>Flight controls can be conventional control surfaces, so long as you take into account things like aileron reversal.</p>
<p>As we approach hypersonic velocities, all this starts to change. Subsonic combustion becomes impractical, it causes too much drag, so you need to either not intake oxygen (e.g. a rocket) or do your combustion supersonic (e.g. scramjet).</p>
<p>Airframe heating is more intense, but that's manageable (orbital craft re-enter way, way faster than mach 5), what changes is that the leading edge is now exposed to reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxygen plasmas, atomic oxygen, ionised oxygen. Oxygen attacks metal just sat in the open, ROS are types of oxygen turned up to 11: Atomic oxygen can oxidise fluorides. Coming back from orbit, we can use disposable ablative heat shields, and large blunt-bodies to push the shock back. In flight we can't do this if we want to remain flying very long.</p>
<p>Flight controls are different too. If you actuate an elevator, you lose your elevator and empennage, so your turn radius is extremely large. Hypersonic craft get their lift from inertia (ballistics) as much as from the air, and from the air it's less wings as much as lifting bodies.</p>
<p>This is partly the sheer speed of oncoming air, and partly your enormous inertial momentum. You go in a straight line, which becomes a ballistic trajectory at hypersonic speeds, aerodynamic flight is a secondary concern.</p>
<p>So in summary, hypersonics are where the engineering challenges change substantially, and it's conventionally accepted to be around mach 5 where those challenges are the primary ones.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chemically speaking you are no longer flying through the air you are ripping apart the molecules down to ions.</p>
<p>This was the casual description from a leading researcher at a hypersonic materials conference. I used to work on advanced material problems in this field; oxidation and ablation, carbon-carbon composites and ultra high temperature ceramics. The material issues at these speeds are amazing, nothing conventional (titanium, super alloys, polymer composites) survives the environment. Leading edge temperatures over 2,000C eliminate conventional ceramics so you have to use exotic carbides and borides, but they have structural and oxidation problems as well.</p>
<p>It is a very active research field but it is starting to go dark as hypersonic weapons development is ramping up further in the US, China and Russia.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At supersonic speeds, the air molecules vibrate from the heat generated from being compressed against the rocket/missile body, but they do not break, at hypersonic speeds, the air molecules break apart, and turn into electrically charged plasma, this considerably changes the air density and pressure, combine that with the enormous heat leads to significant changes in aerodynamics and material consideration when designing objects that move at those speeds compared to supersonic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What others have said. But there's another effect: while at more &quot;pedestrian&quot; speeds the dominant part of the lift is generated by the upper surface of a wing, it becomes no more true close to supersonic-hypersonic transition. At hypersonic speeds if you want lift, you generate it primarily by compressing air underneath you.</p>
<p>IOW, normal aircraft get most of their lift from generating underpressure above, while hypersonic ones get most of their lift from generating overpressure below. </p>
<p>One of the most extreme cases would be Space Shuttle which flying at Mach 20 60km up (at 200000ft) had underpressure above it's wings and body of about 20 pascacals while the underbelly got around 20000 pascacals. </p>
<p>In such conditions you essentially don't need an aerodynamic lifting profile for your wings. You could use barn door. The problem is everything flies like the said barn door: your lift to drag sucks horribly. 2:1 lift to drag is considered decent.</p>
<p>And, actually, as wood is a quite decent ablative material wooden barn door would better than most traditional aerospace materials, i.e. it would survive longer (but still minutes). The challenge is to find stuff which would fare better than barn door wood.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you're solving fluid flow problems, you can go two routes: solve Navier-Stokes, which is functionally 3d Law of Conservation of Momentum, Mass, and Energy, or use empirically-derived approximation equations. Generalized N-S has only a few specific solutions, so solving it usually involves simplification or approximation. So for example, if you're talking about flow in water with reasonably low pressure, you might be able to assume an incompressible fluid. That term in the equation is removed, and it's now easier to solve. So knowing a lot about the environment you're solving in is important. Anything transonic or beyond means compressibility becomes a huge deal. At hypersonic, your Reynolds number will be so high that you might need to add additional terms to the equation, while others could drop off. And there's not much in the way of guidelines for that sort of thing, either: it often comes down to what level of accuracy you need to achieve and the tools at your disposal.</p>
<p>The other way of solving is empirical equations. Those are typically only valid under very specific circumstances, such as laminar flow over a specific geometry. Empirical equations that have hypersonic effects as an assumption would not be valid at sonic, transonic, or subsonic speeds.</p>
<p>Mach number, Reynolds number, Nuesselt Number, Biot number, there's tons of these in fluid dynamics and they all help guide what assumptions you can and cannot make to solve a problem. Mach number just happens to be the one that people tend to hear about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
