		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The mobile gaming market is sort of a wild west at the moment. Companies will pop up with some cheap garbage game that steals assets from more popular games, run misleading ads to attract as many gullible users as possible, then fold in a year or two only to form again under a different name and repeat the cycle.</p>
<p>Part of the reason why this happens is because of microtransactions and speed. The companies appear and disappear faster than legal action can be taken against them; a straightforward intellectual property suit might take a few years to resolve and by that time they have already gone out of business. Microtransactions mean that their misled customers are likely only out a couple of dollars at most so the authorities don't have much motivation to crack down on them very hard.</p>
<p>Ultimately they are doing it because they can get away with it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You probably don't actually want to play the falsely advertized game. I looked up one of them where you move the pins to solve the puzzle. It's a real game, and you can download and play it. The problem is that all of the levels have to be hand-made, and they're not super difficult, so people just blow through them in a minute or two. As a result, the game devs FLOODED the game with ads. Like, you have to watch an ad multiple times per level. It's like, move a pin, watch an ad. Move another pin. People in the reviews talk about the game as being almost aggressively trying to make you stop playing the game in frustration, and they kind of are, because if you just played the content you'd clear the entire game in like 10 minutes.</p>
<p>EDIT: If you want to sit through the ads, the game is called Hero Rescue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Google is a humongous and profitable company. If they wanted to nip this in the bud, they could. But as long as they get money out of it, it will continue to be a problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
