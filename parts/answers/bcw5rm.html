<p>Those pictures are from big cameras with lots of data in each photo, many gigabytes for all the images collected.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mostly because it was so far away they couldn't use one telescope, so they couldn't use one telescope and set it to make a picture, they had to record the raw data in multiple telescopes and then combine it. And second, black holes are well black, so they were not looking for light from the black hole, but light from things nearby that were affected.</p>
<p>Combining data from multiple telescopes requires extra data than you normally need to make a picture as you need to search for things that match from multiple telescopes and compensate, specifically they need accurate phase information, not just time and amplitude.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very simplified explanation: That  \~5 petabytes is mostly noise.</p>
<p>If you take a picture, there is some &quot;noise&quot; in the picture - you may see this if you look really close at a picture it looks grainy and/or blurry.  If you take a picture of something when it is dark, or when the object is small, or when the object is far away, then there is more noise, because these make the camera's job harder.  Also if there is other stray light  around (e.g. a police car with their flashing lights on) that also interferes with the picture.  If you get too much noise in the picture you won't be able to see anything.</p>
<p>If you take a picture of a black hole that is very very far away and very feint and appears very small, something that is right on the limits of current human technology, then there will be a *lot* of noise.  Also this is radiotelescope picture, so there are a bunch of other radio signals that interfere with the instruments causing more noise.  In order to get enough of a signal that they could separate it from the noise, they had to use several &quot;cameras&quot; spread around the Earth.</p>
<p>After capturing all this, they then did a lot of fancy computer filtering to remove most of the noise, leaving the picture you saw.</p>
<p>Managing to extract a useful signal from the data they had is an impressive accomplishment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The resolution of a normal telescope is WAY too poor to see a black hole in the center of a galaxy.  And the resolution of a telescope is limited by the size of a telescope - bigger telescopes give you better images (obviously, right?).  So, in order to see a black hole, we basically needed to use a telescope the size of the Earth itself.  So we did this by having several telescope all over the Earth looking at the same thing at the same time.  Not only are they looking at the same thing at the same time, but as the Earth spins, they fill in even more data.  They also take data over time, so they can analyze the difference in time between light arriving at one location and another.  </p>
<p>So we don't have one telescope, there are 8 of them.  And they're not looking at still images, they're taking data as time goes on (movies).  Oh, and one last thing - you can't compress these images or these movies like you would with a normal photo, because this compression loses some information (which might be not noticeable to the naked eye, but WILL make a difference when you combine images to analyze them).  </p>
<p>So basically you have multiple high definition images with zero compression and recording over time... not just a single snapshot like you would take with your phone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
