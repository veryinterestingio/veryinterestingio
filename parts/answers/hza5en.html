		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s not that the presence of higher oxygen levels in itself leads to bigger insects. At least not directly, it’s not like insect steroids.</p>
<p>It’s that insects themselves don’t use oxygen like mammals and other (land) animals you generally think about do, they don’t breathe with lungs. </p>
<p>Instead they breathe through little things called trachea, you can read more about that here: <a href="https://askabiologist.asu.edu/how-insects-breathe" target="_blank">https://askabiologist.asu.edu/how-insects-breathe</a></p>
<p>There’s a lot of info about that on the internet, but the important factor is that it’s less effective at exchanging large amounts of oxygen than lungs. That doesn’t matter for tiny insects though, they don’t need lots of oxygen. </p>
<p>For <em>bigger</em> insects, though... that’s important. It means they can’t get enough oxygen to fuel their bodies.</p>
<p>So it’s not that higher oxygen makes bigger insects, it’s that lower oxygen limits their size. </p>
<p>There were still tiny insects filling tiny insects niches in higher oxygen environments. It’s just that bigger insects could survive so they competed with smaller animals in those niches as well (like birds or rats).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>no one wants to do math bit draw a circle, pretend the inside is the bug. the circle outline is the skin.</p>
<p>now make a bigger circle. there is not that much more skin but much more bug </p>
<p>while your bug gets bigger it's skin surface area gets bigger too but not as fast as the bug itself</p>
<p>since bugs breath through their skin, the higher oxygen allowed for bigger bugs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
