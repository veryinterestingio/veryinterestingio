		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li>High heat conductivity (aluminum transfers heat quickly)  </li>
<li>High surface area-to-volume ratio (an object exchanges heat with the environment through that object's surface, and aluminum foil is almost <em>all</em> surface)</li>
<li>Low mass (the actual amount of &quot;stuff&quot; in a sheet of aluminum foil is very small, so it can't retain much heat energy)</li>
</ul>
<p>So as soon as you take it out of the oven, it starts losing the relatively-small amount of heat energy it has very rapidly from the entirety of its surface.  Which means that it cools down <em>super</em> quickly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Temperature and heat are different. The amount of heat energy needed to bring an object up to a specific temperature depends on the material. Tin foil doesnâ€™t need a lot of energy to bring it to the temperature of the oven. When you touch it, the water in your body absorbs a relatively massive amount of that energy and barely raises the temperature of your skin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An object sheds heat based on how wide its surface is and how hot it is compared to its surroundings. An object carries heat based on how big it is and how hot it is.</p>
<p>As such, a twice as thick object will lose heat at the same speed but have twice as much so it takes twice as long to cool.</p>
<p>So let's look at some hot coffee. With a lid, it takes maybe ten minutes to cool down to a drinkable temperature. A sheet of foil is about 0.63 thousandths of an inch, compared to my six inch tall pool of coffee. As such, our very primitive estimate would indicate that foil cools down in 1/9,500th the time, or 0.06 seconds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lot of good explanations on here already, but to make it more ELI5:</p>
<p>If some hail hits your head at 30MPH, you'll feel a light sting. </p>
<p>If a truck hits your head at 30MPH, you're going to the hospital.</p>
<p>They're both going the same speed, but intuitively, the truck is &quot;heavier&quot;. When it moves at 30MPH, there's more stuff your head's gotta stop. Being hit by the truck is like being hit with 100,000 pieces of hail frozen into a single block of ice.</p>
<p>That's sort of what's happening with the heat. The aluminium foil only has a tiny, tiny bit of &quot;heat&quot;, and so it's easy for it to be &quot;stopped&quot;. You feel that &quot;stop&quot; as the foil being slightly hot. </p>
<p>Compare that to a cup of hot chocolate, though. If you leave your hand on the hot mug, you'll burn yourself! There's a lot more &quot;heat&quot; being stored, and the mug just keeps on giving that heat. Your hand burns because of this transfer of heat.</p>
<p>This leads to an important take-away: temperature doesn't tell you how much heat something's got to give. Rather, it's a good rule of thumb for everyday life.*</p>
<p>*For the nerds: Objects with both a low thermal conductivity and can store a relatively large amount of thermal energy are rarely a problem on everyday life so generally it's fine to say &quot;this thing's at 10 degrees F&quot; and just assume that the heat transfer rate is in &quot;gonna suck&quot; territory.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Heat is energy, specifically thermal energy.</p>
<p>So, we can think of this tinfoil piece as a battery of sorts for thermal energy. Now if you crumpled up the tinfoil as tight as you could we'll think of this as how big the battery is.</p>
<p>You'll quickly notice that tinfoil crumple up very, very small, so it's a small battery.</p>
<p>Now how long will that battery last (be hot). Well this is determined by 2 main factors.</p>
<p>1) How many things are plugged in? This would be most similar to how much surface area is there? Tinfoil has a lot of surface area typically so there are a lot of things plugged in to our small battery.</p>
<p>2) how quickly are those things taking that energy. This is determined by a constant (specific heat) which is typically low for metals like tin. As well as the difference in temperature, that is to say a very hot thing passes energy faster to a very cold thing.</p>
<p>Overall these two things combined with our 'small battery' means that the tin foil drops from oven temperature (full battery) down to a safe to touch temperature (let's say 20% battery) pretty quickly.</p>
<p>DO NOT TOUCH STUFF THAT JUST CAME OUT OF THE OVEN! GIVE IT PLENTY OF TIME TO COOL, THEN WAIT AN EXTRA 30 MINUTES JUST TO BE SAFE!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
