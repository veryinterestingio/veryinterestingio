		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of your cells dividing as a printer making paper copies. A copy can only be as good as the original but usually you lose a bit of quality.</p>
<p>Over time, the original document wears out and you're making copies of copies. Each copies need to be a certain quality level or else they're rejected. As you make more and more copies, the reject rate increases over time.</p>
<p>Your dividing cells undergo a check to make sure they're copied properly. If they fail, they undergo planned cell suicide (apoptosis) and are recycled. As you age, a larger percentage of dividing cells fail the check because of DNA wearing out from copying, making it harder to increase the number of good cells to heal a wound.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This may not be a factor but not knowing your health, diabetes can cause major slowing of healing, too, so I wanted to bring it up since it doesn’t seem to have been mentioned. If you know your blood sugar is good, then nevermind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your skin doesn't heal. It is connective tissue that stitch together places that have been damaged. The skin slowly grows back over the connective tissue in a process called remodeling. This is why you have scars and they slowly seem to go away. </p>
<p>Lower legs often have poor blood flow. They are the furthest place away from your heart and require a lot of work to return the blood from against gravity. Think of your veins and arteries as highways. If they aren't well kept the traffic bringing healing supplies and removing damaged materials takes longer. I would see a doctor if the healing time is really noticably longer than it was in the past. There could be underlying events that could be caught and fixed before they become more severe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
