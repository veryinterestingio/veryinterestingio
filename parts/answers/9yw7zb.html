<p>We've just gone from having a very accurate experiment whose results depend on the size of the kilogram to having the kilogram depend on the results of that very accurate experiment.  Since that experiment is more reliable and repeatable than putting the old platinum cylinder kilogram on a scale, it's an improvement for the future, but it doesn't make any practical difference today.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Physicist with a metrology side-hustle here. Great question! For basically any purpose today, the redefinition isn't going to impact anything. As others have said, it will very gradually become important in the future.</p>
<p>The reason we've all made such a fuss about this is because what they did is really elegant and pretty from a conceptual point of view. When we had things which defined units (eg The Kilogram), we had to use them to measure the fundamental constants of the universe (eg the speed of light). But because our units drifted over time, so did the value of the fundamental constants. That's a weird thing to say! We'd much rather have the fundamental constants be the things which stay the same and measure how much a unit is relative to that. It also means that (since the fundamental constants are everywhere, all the time) you can build an experiment to define a unit anywhere in the universe and not have to go all the way back to Paris to calibrate it!</p>
<p>Problem is, that turned out to be really difficult! We've been working on this at least since Maxwell started talking about it over 150yrs ago. It's truly a feat of human effort, on par in my mind with the Higgs measurement itself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On the redefinition of the kg, the new value was chosen to agree as far as possible with the old value. Of course, the problem is that fundamentally, we can't absolutely determine the old value: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#Stability_of_the_international_prototype_kilogram" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#Stability_of_the_international_prototype_kilogram</a> The new definition will allow measurement of the kg independent of a specific object, so the value will be constant over separation in time and space, and different experimental methodology, etc. So, nothing needs to change right now, unless your process is already operating at the level of uncertainty in the old values.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many scientists at CERN prefer to use so-called natural units, which are already universally defined. This is based on E = mc^2 - therefore, m = E/c^2. The unit for energy that is used is eV or electron volts - the energy it takes to accelerate something with a charge of an electron through a potential difference of 1V, a universally defined scale. Next, to make it a bit easier they define c as 1 (and therefore E = m). A consequence of this is that &quot;normal&quot; speeds become extremely slow, as c, the fastest speed (3*10^8 m*s^-1) is defined as 1. The final unit that is used is either GeV/c^2 or MeV/c^2 - this is nice, because the division by c^2 is done in the unit, so it works both with natural units (c = 1) and standard SI units (c = 3*10^8 m*s^-1). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. The LHC is &quot;calibrated&quot; against reality, so that it functions. Reality didn't change - we didn't change the way that the universe works.</p>
<p>What could change is in how LHC *describes* their measurements. Before, they must have</p>
<ol>
<li>periodically revised all of their reporting to reflect the new reference mass - 1g in a paper written 10 years ago != 1g in a modern paper</li>
<li>they standardized on the definition of 1g at a particular reference time</li>
<li>the changes are not significant so they don't worry about it (effectively #2)</li>
</ol>
<p>So, what changes is that they effectively switch from whatever they were doing to #2 (which is probably a no-op), and will never have to revisit it.</p>
<p>Edit/note: I am curious to hear a more authoritative/detailed answer. I expect that most of the fun will be on the administrative side is all. :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
