		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Scratching.</p>
<p>Think of when you have to take your kid/relative to a doctor.</p>
<p>You play games/ make faces / distract them to not have them feel the pain of the injection. Scratching causes mild pain. So that your brain focuses on that instead of the stinging bite. </p>
<p>Some studies have shown that it releases Serotonin fooling your brain.  </p>
<p>But the primary theory is that scratching ( the sensation of scratching and not necessarily the pain) supresses your brains focus to the stinging sensation and hence you feel good. It's just a distraction. </p>
<p>CHRONIC SCRATCHING MAY LEAVE YOU SUSCEPTIBLE TO INFECTIONS.</p>
<p>Edit: Your body releases a feel good chemical (recent studies)  Serotonin which lasts for a short period of time so the itch cycle continues. It's not big pain vs small pain. It's about the sensation. Like with the kid you dont pinch him; you distract him/her. Try keeping a ice pack on your itch the next time and you would understand the concept of sensation. Though the ice pack also relieves some effects of inflammation ; there are many processes that take place at the same time.</p>
<p>Why scratching at other places doesn't work?
One word: Dermatomes</p>
<p>Simple Explanation:
No. See pain is a neuro-chemical sensation. You know how they say dopamine causes happiness. Similarly pain is associated with other chemicals ( Substance P to name one) .</p>
<p>The point where the nerves are stimulated (generally the area of bite - is where the nerves supply so only in that area will scratching be effective and not others as the other areas are not carrying the pain sensation. )</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have different types of nerves. The one that makes you feel an itch is a different type of nerve than the one that makes you feel pain. Your brain gives priority to pain over an itch. Scratching causes mild pain, which your brain then registers instead of the itch coming from the same region.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
