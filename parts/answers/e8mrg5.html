		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All these examples are modern-times City planning. In the old days (when most current cities started) someone built a general store at a cross-roads. Someone else built a stable next to the general store. In this area farmers built houses for themselves and their children. More children = more houses. Postal service gets tired of delivering mail way out there and builds a post office and declares a name for the area.  Residents get sick of mud and set out to tax themselves to build roads and bridges. </p>
<p>Most improvements happen because people are sick to death of current conditions and pull together for the common good.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simple answer here - my dad is a digger driver, and this is based on the UK </p>
<p>They plan <em>everything</em> first. You’ll know how many houses you’re building before you start. </p>
<p>Sewers and drainage comes first. Then basic dirt roads (nothing concrete, as you’ll need to add power). </p>
<p>Then the first few houses are built near the edge, so people can see what they look like and walk round a “show home”. </p>
<p>Then it gets larger from there - it’ll keep being built in the background. As the houses are finished, the roads and sidewalks are finished for that part. Then they all move down to the next bit. Depending on how many houses sell, depends on how quick they move to the next sector of the site. </p>
<p>In the U.K., once you build a certain number of houses in a new area, you’re legally bound to build a pub, a school, and a row of stores. Convenience store, pharmacy, ATM, etc. </p>
<p>The school aspect isn’t implemented often, it’s rarely that big. There’s an area called Chase Meadow in the Midlands, which has been consistently built for the last ten years-ish. That has its own school. It’s weird because, for example, 11th grade is empty until the year below moves up / because hundreds of new families moved in at the same time. </p>
<p>Hope this helps friend. I’ve used American language because I know we Brits have different words for some things</p>
<p>Edit: the discussion below over “legally bound” is very entertaining</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Usually don't just find a place and... build a whole town.</p>
<p>It's much more organic than that... A small number of people settle somewhere, they build houses, get most of their things from some neighboring town... as more people begin to settle, more necessities are required. Things get added and upgraded as people decide they need it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're China you can just build a whole city from scratch and move people into it. Some countries have planned towns/cities built in a short space of time for various reasons (I think Indonesia are moving their Capital to a planned city soon).</p>
<p>Most often, though, a town springs up over course of time and is centred around a population and delivering services to that population. The basic idea behind a town is that it's easier to create one place for everyone in a geographic region to visit to get their services rather than have them travel all across the countryside.</p>
<p>So the most common first things built to form a central town area are things like a post office, a market, a religious/cultural building, a bar/entertainment venue and the like. Usually along an existing trade route/road as towns work on scale (more people passing through/visiting = more efficient and cost effective town).</p>
<p>The most important thing to understand is <em>why</em> a town exists or should be built.</p>
<p>It can serve a rural/farming community and be a place where the population can meet and hang out (community centre/religious building), trade and sell goods and services, or go to find professionals (blacksmiths, carpenters, lawyers, doctors etc. etc.) - It's super useful and efficient for these things to be located roughly in the same area.</p>
<p>A town can also be highly residential (suburban centre type thing) where it serves as a central base for a population working in a region with one or two major industries (mining, manufacture plant, processing centre etc.) in which case it's providing a place for a community to live outside of times when they travel to and from work. The first things built might be entertainment and family services to keep people happy outside of work and to give kids a place to learn.</p>
<p>You can have a tourist industry type town, built up around some kind of tourist attraction (beach/nature park/entertainment or cultural attraction) where the first things built will probably be transportation services, hotels and secondary entertainment venues.</p>
<p>Many towns are incorporated for government or public services for a population or community - so a court house, town hall, welfare agency, tax office might be the first buildings that pop up.</p>
<p>There are a lot of reason for towns to exist when, where, and how they do. There's no real order to the way they are built unless planned specifically - it's usually organic and fulfilling a particular need of the population.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From my experience in Australia having seen several rural towns transition through various stages. First there is a pub. Then people will live closer to the pub. Then people with broken cars will seek help at the pub (prior to the mid 90's there were a lot of lemon cars), and someones shed becomes the local garage. The local garage may become a small petrol station.  People stopping for petrol will want food, so the petrol station spouts a restaurant. Now that you have beer, fuel and food the town is complete until there is reason to grow (eg: a mine opens nearby). At this point the town will get a small grocer and a hardware/ farm supplies shop. If families settle, then things may change when a regional school is funded. At this point someone will come along and open a church. The school often comes with an oval, which then becomes a showground. It often stops there unless  there is a need for some regional facility or institution in the area (eg, hospital).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
