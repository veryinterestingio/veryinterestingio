		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation" target="_blank">time dilation</a> factor is (1 - f^2 )^0.5 , where f is the fraction of light speed.</p>
<p>(This means that the <del>experienced travel time</del> <strong>time that passes inside the ship</strong> approaches 0 as f approaches 1. If you could travel arbitrarily close to light speed, you would experience the journey as effectively instantaneous.)</p>
<p>Here's a calculator for it: <a href="http://www.emc2-explained.info/Dilation-Calc/" target="_blank">http://www.emc2-explained.info/Dilation-Calc/</a></p>
<p>At .999c (99.9% light speed) it calculates that time is slowed down to 4.47% of the outside value. That means four years are experienced as approximately 65 days.</p>
<p>Edit: fixed the wording. This is literally the time that passes for the ship. It affects everything, from atomic clocks to metabolisms to brain activity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nope, time dilation is a cool part of special relativity. At 99.9% the speed of light the trip would be 0.17 ish years to the occupants of the spaceship. The closer you get to 100%, ie. add more 9’s to the end of your percentage, the faster the trip would feel to the occupants. Here’s a cool calculator site you can play with to see these effects. <a href="http://www.emc2-explained.info/Dilation-Calc/#.XESiMRZlCEc" target="_blank">http://www.emc2-explained.info/Dilation-Calc/#.XESiMRZlCEc</a></p>
<p>-edit This seems to be a frequent question and it’s a good one. How would you age? The traveler would age relative to the time they experience. So on this trip while everyone on earth experienced 4 years, you’d only age a few months! Take a long enough trip and you might just outlive your own grandchildren!</p>
<p>-edit2 Time dilation has been proven experimentally using very precise measurements. Here's a link to an article for some further reading. <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/einsteins-time-dilation-prediction-verified/" target="_blank">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/einsteins-time-dilation-prediction-verified/</a></p>
<p>Also, as some have pointed out, it would take a long time to accelerate to these speeds at 1g and would require a HUGE amount of energy to do so. Definitely not practical with current propulsion technologies. I have heard that large solar sails might be able to accelerate small probes to high speeds 20-30% c which would be a cool thing to see. </p>
<p>-edit3 For those curious about the solar sail probe, if you google StarShot you’ll find a lot of info about it. <a href="https://breakthroughinitiatives.org/initiative/3" target="_blank">https://breakthroughinitiatives.org/initiative/3</a></p>
<p>-edit4 As many have pointed out, time dilation is a direct result of the length contraction observed by the traveling body. Also, thanks for for the gifts kind strangers.</p>
<p>-edit5 Another fun link thanks to /u/konstantinua00 talking about relativistic effects on mission duration <a href="http://convertalot.com/relativistic_star_ship_calculator.html" target="_blank">http://convertalot.com/relativistic_star_ship_calculator.html</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another good fictional example of time dilation can be found in the Ender Quintet (the first five books of the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game_(series)" target="_blank">series</a>  that began with Ender's Game). Basically, boy wins war and leaves on a colony ship to meet the descendents of the soldiers he commanded to win the war, with only like two years having passed for him.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, time would pass slower aboard the ship than it would appear to from our perspective.</p>
<p>For a fixed duration 4 year journey at a constant speed (no acceleration or deceleration)</p>
<p>At 99.9% C only 65 days would pass from the perspective of the crew</p>
<p>At 99.9999999999% of C only 3 minutes would pass from the perspective of the crew</p>
<p>A 4ly distance traveling at 100%, 99.9999999999% and 99.9% C from earths perspective would take 4 years, 4 years ~1 day, 4years ~2 days respectively.</p>
<p>Edit: It doesn't <em>just</em> &quot;feel&quot; like 65 days / 3 minutes passes. That's how much time actually passes from that frame of reference. Time (and space) is literally dilated. You would only age by that amount, you would only need to eat that amount of food, because that is the amount of time that has elapsed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
