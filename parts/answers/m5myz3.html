		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you want the drug to make a &quot;change&quot;, then you run the risk of side effects, and you are right that the magnitude of the side effects can be related to the size of the change.</p>
<p>Organisms are highly optimized, if it takes work to make a molecule then using the same molecule for many tasks is more efficient than making a different molecule for every task.  When a drug changes the rate or production for the molecule, all the tasks that use it are impacted.  Maybe you want to drug to change one task so you feel better, but the molecules are all impacted and there will be side effects.  </p>
<p>Much of drug research is trying to make very exotic changes so that the net effect is more like what you want.  Unfortunately, every person is different, and a different balance of tasks leads to a different amount of side effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The body has a limited set of tools to interact with. Some tissues and organs use the same tool in different ways. While one organ may take a screwdriver to tighten screws, another may use it to pry things, while one more may use it to poke holes.</p>
<p>When a doctor diagnoses someone with a few screws loose, the doctor could have the patient take a medicine that gives more screwdrivers. Sure that helps the one organ manage to tighten screws but the other organs, now with more screwdrivers, will start to pry more things and poke more holes. These unintended effects are side effects.</p>
<p>A real life example is the body's response to opoids. Opoids are used as powerful painkillers because they imitate other chemicals in the body that block receptors that transfer the pain response to the brain. The same chemicals also trigger your gut to push your digested food down and out! One side effect of opoids is constipation. The drug brand Imodium, an anti diarrhea medicine, is actually an oral opoid that helps stop your gut from pushing too much. It's dose is not high enough to cause the pain relief for the brain but people have tried abusing it this way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the answer is there's not really such a thing as &quot;side effects.&quot;  There's just &quot;effects.&quot;  A decongestant &quot;may cause drowsiness&quot; as a side effect and the very same drug as a sleep aid &quot;may cause dry mouth&quot; as a side effect.  The drug is the same, it's just whether the effects of the drug are advertised on the front of the box or not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There definitely are some drugs that are highly effective and have minimal side effects. Narcan for instance can block opiods very effectively, but effectively does nothing if options aren't present. I think the receptor specific sympathetic agonists are also extreme effective with minimal side effects. For instance asthma rescue inhalers can bring you back from barely being able to breathe to feeling much better in seconds. There's plenty of other drugs that are similarly effective. </p>
<p>PS: drugs with lots of side effects are usually acting on multiple receptors when you really only want to act on one. Also you have drugs (like cancer drugs) that just aren't targeted at all (aside for killing fast growing cells) and therefore cause all sort of terrible side effects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
