		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, transparent materials are pretty much exclusively fragile or malleable. We could use glass or clear plastic, but glass would be a terrible idea for obvious reasons and plastics expand under pressure. There's research in to pure aluminum oxide as a structural material which is mostly transparent (which is basically <del>jade</del> sapphire [as pointed out] if I recall) but that would also be quite brittle.</p>
<p>For rubber hoses, most of those are made of PVC and get hard and brittle over time, especially when exposed to gasoline or heat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Transparent hoses are not strong enough. They look cool in PC builds because they don't need to be that strong, and cost isn't as much of a factor when you're already building a cooled PC.</p>
<p>Car cooling systems are under high pressure and expected to last 10 to 15 years of cycling, so you need stronger materials. The easiest way to diagnose a coolant leak is to look at the surge tank, which is clear for this reason.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Back in the old days, the A/C system would have a sight glass about a half-inch in diameter to see if bubbles were in the system. Bubbles would mean you were low on freon. You would then add freon until the bubbles went away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
