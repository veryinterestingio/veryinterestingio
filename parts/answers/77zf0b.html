		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Big passenger aircrafts are actually relatively good gliders. Most airliners have glide ratios in the 15:1 to 20:1 range. That means that for every single meter they drop they can travel 15 to 20 meters horizontally. Small private airplanes like a <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/G-BRNE-Cessna152.jpg" target="_blank">Cesna 152</a> are closer to 10:1. Interestingly this glide ratio nearly doesn't change with the weight of the aircraft. More weight means that you will need go faster at the optimal glide ratio. This is often used in competition gliders where they fill tanks with water to optimize their gliding speed.</p>
<p>Typical cruising altitude for passenger jets is about 10 km (6 miles) or above so they can easily glide 150 km (90 miles) even if all their engines failed, which is very unlikely. </p>
<p>There has been a couple of example of total engine failures, most notably the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimli_Glider" target="_blank">Gimli glider</a> which landed safely on a disaffected airport after a 17 minutes glide. The other that comes to mind is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Airways_Flight_1549" target="_blank">&quot;Miracle on the Hudson&quot;</a> which flew for about 3 minutes after engine shutdown at 850 m altitude. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2rxJxwApLc" target="_blank">British Airways Flight 9 in 1982</a> AKA, the reason planes don't fly through ash clouds.</p>
<p>All four engines flamed out due to the ash buildup (volcanic ash is basically pulverized rock, which was liquefying into magma INSIDE the engine!) and the plane had to glide without power.</p>
<p>Two fun facts from this, one of which answers your question. The first is that the aircraft in this instance, a 747, has a glide ratio of 15:1 (so for every mile it drops, it will have traveled 15). The other fact is that it takes about 5 minutes to restart a 747 engine mid-flight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a couple questions here because &quot;catastrophic engine failure&quot; usually means only one, and that doesn't reduce a plane to mere gliding. So, to split the questions up: (1) How far can a big passenger aircraft glide? and (2) How do passenger aircraft handle catastrophic failure of an engine?</p>
<p>The first question is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/77zf0b/how_far_can_a_big_passenger_aircraft_for_instance/dopu85i/" target="_blank">already answered</a>, but it's also not what would happen after the failure you described (unless all engines failed, which is exceedingly rare). The Airbus A340 is also an unusual choice to mention, as it's a four-engine jet (making complete failure even more unlikely), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A340#Further_developments_and_end_of_production" target="_blank">isn't particularly efficient</a>, and has been out of production for about six years.</p>
<p>To answer the implied second question (catastrophic single-engine failure), contemporary commercial airplane capabilities, their routes, and their operational policies are are visible by looking at their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETOPS" target="_blank">ETOPS</a> ratings. The capabilities of aircraft to travel long distances and land safely (with a failed engine) have risen rapidly even in the past 20 years, especially for twin-engine designs like the Boeing 787. The A340, as a four-engine jet, is generally considered exempt from ETOPS, but ETOPS has also expanded (at least in the United States) to rate jets with more than two engines. And, combined with the industry trend toward twin-engine designs worldwide (which means even places that only rate twin-engine jets with ETOPS are rating more designs than ever), the ETOPS ratings are a useful way to estimate achievable distance following engine failure.</p>
<p>From the ETOPS perspective, the answer for single-engine failure is, reassuringly, &quot;enough distance to land safely.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are all certified to stop with brakes alone. Reverse thrust is just to reduce the cost of replacing brakes as often.  Many commercial jets don't even have reverse thrust capability. </p>
<p>But if you're gliding, it's possible/likely you're not landing at your preferred destination. So you might be landing somewhere where the runway isn't long enough whether you have reverse thrusters or not. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most airline pilots and airlines want the pilots to use an idle descent method (to save fuel $) from cruise altitude to just a few thousand feet above the ground.  ATC altitude clearances and surrounding terrain do not  always allow this to happen.  In a standard flight idle descent the plane is also flown at a much faster speed than the speed flown during a total engine failure descent from cruise altitude.  This means that on a normal flight the descent you are experiencing is actually more aggressive and steep than a descent you would experience in an airplane with a total engine failure.  Also if only one engine fails on a twin engine jet (like an A330 or 777) it can actually take around 30 minutes for the airplane to actually lose any altitude (dependent on cruise speed, weight and a few other factors).   Also the pilots probably won't tell you if all the engines stopped working ? (just that there is something wrong and you might see firetrucks near the runway but don't be alarmed) so you probably won't know about it until you're on the ground. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
