		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We stop growing because our bones stop growing. During childhood/adolescence, parts of our bones called <em>growth plates</em> create cartilage which then hardens and <em>calcifies</em> into bone. This adds more material to the bones, making them longer, and is how we grow. Towards the end of adolescence, these growth plates stop creating more cartilage, and they also calcify and become normal bone. At this point we can't grow any bigger (without surgical intervention) because the bones can't get any longer/larger. This also applies to the skull, so past adolescence your skull remains the same size for the rest of your life. </p>
<p>Your ears and nose aren't just bone though, they are also made of cartilage and soft tissues like skin. Cartilage <em>can</em> grow more, but it's debatable whether or not that's responsible for ears and noses getting bigger if we age. What definitely <em>does</em> play a part is skin becoming less elastic and looser as we age, which makes the ears and nose appear larger as they sag.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To expand on the first answer, collagen and elastin are part of what comprise cartilage. As we age, these break down, and it is apparently actually due to <em>gravity</em> that things began to sag and look larger.</p>
<p>The common misconception that cartilage continues to grow is due to sharks, whose cartilage does continue to grow throughout their lifetime.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, us human. Not shark.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
