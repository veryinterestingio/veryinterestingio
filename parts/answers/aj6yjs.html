		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Their breeding range is in the high Arctic of North America, reaching as far as the northern tip of Ellesmere Island. Some populations don’t take the journey to the arctic and stay in the prairie regions.</p>
<p>Typical wintering seasons are December to February, but February is typically where they're populations are furthest South as it takes a few months to migrate. Their wintering locations vary from southern regions in Canada all the way to Mexico. The &quot;early migrators&quot; you saw may have done their summer breeding in the prairies and wintering in Mexico while the &quot;late migrators&quot; may have done their summer breeding in the high arctic (few predators) and wintering in southern Canada/ northern US.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good comment above, but it’s also worth noting another point of interest: geese seen flying South at one time aren’t necessarily flying that way consistently. Geese tend to forage in a wide range of available open spaces during the day, and often return to a safe spot (e.g. a frozen lake) for the night. You may potentially be seeing movements at one time of day that give you the false impression that they’re still making concerted southward movement. Just something to mull over. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Birds actually don't decide when to migrate judging on temperature, but rather judging by the amount of available food. When the food starts to run out, they start gathering for their yearly trip. This is why ducks in the cities who are regularly fed by the townfolk often winter in those same cities, even though ducks are migratory birds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I live in Calgary. I’m sure many (most?) of the Canada geese here fly south for the winter, but we also have a good number that stay year round. Generally the river is still open even when it’s cold, and there are lots of farm fields nearby where they can go to forage for spilled grain.  I think they spend the night on the river, during the day they fly out to eat, and at night they fly back in again.  So yes they appear to be flying south, but really they’re just coming home from Airdrie. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Checking in from Calgary. This is an unusually warm winter. It's cold today but we've been above-freezing for most of the time. The geese don't have much reason to move if there's food and water here. The flocks you are seeing are likely hopping from one field to the next within the city.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
