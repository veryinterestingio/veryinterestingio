		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Children tend to be more sensitive to bitterness, which is apparent in foods like broccoli and brussel sprouts.  This is an evolved defense mechanism, because poisons are often bitter tasting.  As we grow, we learn which foods are poisonous and which aren't, so we don't need the same sensitivity and through evolutionary pressure, we lose the sensitivity over time.  The more foods that are available to eat, the higher the chance of survival, as long as we know to avoid the poisons.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Frankly, it surprises me that you used to think coriander tastes like soap but don't anymore, as the reason it tastes like soap to some but not all people is genetic. Genetic analysis has found a single SNP (single-nucleotide polymorphism, so a single nucleotide that can differ between people) appears to play a role in this. (See: <a href="https://flavourjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2044-7248-1-22" target="_blank"><a href="https://flavourjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2044-7248-1-22" target="_blank">https://flavourjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2044-7248-1-22</a></a>)</p>
<p>I have never heard of anyone where that changed during lifetime, though epigenetics could play a role. But other things can play a role as well: how much coriander was in the recipes, whether it was fresh coriander or the dried seeds. All this is speculation though, as are most other comments on here. Short answer may be that no one really knows.</p>
<p>It's probably not all the answers about bitterness though. It's known that those change during lifetime, but the soapy taste of coriander to some people is caused by different substances than the bitterness as far as I know.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Don't know about the physiologic changes but studies say you should try a food at least 10 times before you can say you actually don't like something, therefore a lot of taste changes could just be that a person hasn't tried something enough times.</p>

<p>Now that is not to say you should try rotten roadkill 10 times, we're talking about safe foods. Things that are bitter and ammoniated might cause natural aversion because they are signs of spoilage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
