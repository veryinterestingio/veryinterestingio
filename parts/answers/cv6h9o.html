		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in flight software on one of these satellites.  I am an engineer, not an earth scientist but I'll do my best.  Molecules react differently to electromagnetic waves, the application of this is called spectroscopy.   Satellites use a series of prisms and lenses to separate the  light into frequency bands and analyze these bands to determine chemical composition.  If you'd like more information, there is tons online about spectroscopy used within astronomy and earth sciences.   <a href="http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/S/Spectroscopy" target="_blank"><a href="http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/S/Spectroscopy" target="_blank">http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/S/Spectroscopy</a></a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Atmospheric remote sensing is very challenging but we got there.</p>
<p>An example would be looking at optical satellite imagery on Google maps when it looks hazy/foggy. In this case you have H20 in the atmosphere that reacts to sunlight (absorb/reflect certain wavelengths) in a way that can be measured..in google earth this is noise. Because we are interested in the land.</p>
<p>Atmospheric scientists on the other hand sees the land as noise and are interested in the atmopshere. In that case you have to detect parts of the light spectrum that absorb the Gass you are interested in, and ideally nothing else, and then you know how much of that light comes from the sun and should be reflected back to you from the ground, but you arnt getting it, so it must be absorbed on the way into the atmopshere or out again to the satallite.</p>
<p>There are very specific light absorption curves for all gasses. The science is in creating the formulas to seperate the signal to noise and your Gass and then to calibrate that light detection to a real measurement (to calibrate the algorithms you have to use measurements). Another challenge in atmospheroc sensing is that you want to know at what altitude the Gass is (pressure). And that is directly related to the temperature of the Gass. Which all gets measured and thrown into pretty epic physics first principle and empirical formula's</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other answers posting about infrared spectroscopy are correct in terms of the “how”, I just wanted to make a clarification on how this relates to emissions.  For the high precision OCO-2 mentioned in your links, it actually measures the total amount of light absorbed and reflected back to space by CO2 (rather than the CO2 itself).  This is done on a really fine grid mesh (~0.8x1.4 miles) multiple times per second, giving us a picture of what the CO2 concentrations are on  earth at all times at really high resolution.</p>
<p>Then, with assistance from computer models, if we track the amount of CO2 over time we can estimate emissions (either positive or negative) in a particular sattelite grid cell based on the change in concentration over time.</p>
<p>See the wiki on the OCO-2 for more info: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbiting_Carbon_Observatory_2" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbiting_Carbon_Observatory_2</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>a nice (wee bit technical) explanation is here.</p>
<p>It addresses both what they measure and how they analyze it:<br />
<a href="https://ocov2.jpl.nasa.gov/science/MeasurementApproach/" target="_blank">https://ocov2.jpl.nasa.gov/science/MeasurementApproach/</a></p>
<p>Basically, we know what direct sunlight looks like, so we measure the sunlight after it goes through the atmosphere and see what is absorbed.   We know specifically what molecules in the atmosphere absorbs what wavelengths.  Sure, they can overlap, but not always. So we can measure how much CO2 is in that path that the sunlight took.</p>
<p>Knowing how much CO2 there is in an area, and watching how it changes, allows us to figure out when CO2 entered and when CO2 exited the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Spoiler: CO2 stays in the atmosphere for a long time, on the order of centuries.  That is why CO2 emissions are so important.  If you put it in the atmosphere,  it stays in the atmosphere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The fast answer is that CO2 has a color and we measure it. That color is outside the range your eyes use.</p>
<p>Having a color is another way of saying it absorbs some kinds of light. Absorbing lights is why CO2 is a problem: it catches that light energy instead of letting it shine back into space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
