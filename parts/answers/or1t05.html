		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Observe your reaction next time you hear a sound whose source is not visible or immediately apparent. You’ll notice that — while you will likely have an initial impression of which side it comes from — you will instinctively react by turning/angling your head to some degree, which is the process that really allows you to pinpoint the location. Quick bangs and other instantaneous sounds don’t allow for this process to play out, and are thus much more difficult to precisely locate without a visual cue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a good question. </p>
<p>When using stereo headphones, you certainly don't get any sense of &quot;front&quot; or &quot;back&quot;, so how does this work in real life? The simple answer is, there is more to &quot;hearing&quot; than just the ears. Sound vibrations are also picked up by the skull itself, and this information transmitted to the brain. Because of this, we are also able to distinguish &quot;front&quot; and &quot;back&quot; point sources of sound.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Excellent question, in reality if our ears were symmetrical (as some microphones) then the source determined by the delay could be in front, behind, up, or down, to be precise the mathematical solution to this problem is a cone, and not a single direction (this is a solved problem in engineering).</p>
<p>So how does it work? For starters there is context, you can easily discard both up and down instinctively, then there is asymmetry, our ears have a flap towards the back, this means the sound travelling from behind won't be registered in the same way as from the front, allowing us to pinpoint the source.</p>
<p>Additionally, the delay is most noticeable for sudden noises, when it isn't sudden then our brain tries to match the waveform to tell how far behind one detected wave is to the other, this isn't easy if the wave doesn't change much with time. For natural sounds this isn't a big deal, but for artificial near perfect sinusoidal waves our brains struggle (there isn't an unique mathematical solution for sine waves and in practice we can only guess a general location such as &quot;somewhere behind&quot;). That's why some people (particularly in the UK iirc) are changing some sounds (truck in reverse, for example) for white noise or readjusting existing sounds, making their locations more clear and, luckily, safer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
