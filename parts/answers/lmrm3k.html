		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gold doesn't tarnish, for one thing. For another, it is much more ductile than silver. That means it's easier to draw into wires. Gold can also be hammered out so thin as to be a single atom thick, without losing its conductive properties! That's one reason it's also used as a coating in the visor of astronaut helmets. </p>
<p>Silver, on the other hand, is much more brittle, and does tarnish. Devices with silver wiring would require much more maintenance to ensure that tarnish didn't interfere with the conductivity.</p>
<p>I hope all that made sense!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gold is used as a plating material over the much cheaper copper in circuit boards because it is extremely inert in normal conditions while maintaining high conductivity. The amount used is typically very small so does not make the cost prohibitive. Silver oxidises in air at STP, so if we used it as a coating it would oxidise over quickly, which is undesirable for contact pads etc. and would fully oxidise over time, exposing the underlying copper to oxidisation as well.</p>
<p>Using silver as a main conductor would be prohibitively expensive, especially since its conductivity is only 5% better, it would be much cheaper just to make your copper wires/layers thicker to reduce resistance.</p>
<p>You can buy silver-plated copper wires supposedly to conduct better at high frequencies due to the skin effect. I'm not sure how useful they actually are though</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mostly because gold is extremely less reactive (oxidizes a lot less than silver, and oxides are generally way less conductive than the relative metallic forms).<br />
If cost is a concern, it's better to go with copper, that offers relatively similar electrical properties to silver, but at a fraction of the cost.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps also because two metals together would make a local element.
Silver readily oxidises on air and has a reduction potential of 0.8V. Copper has a reduction potential of 0.34V. Therefore, in a local element, if the silver soldering oxidizes on air, than this could lead to oxidation of the copper plate as well.
I am not certain if this would be  an issue, but potentially.
In case of tin soldering, this would go in the opposite direction, thus protecting the copper plate.
In case of gold, gold does not oxidize on air and thus would not drive this reaction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
