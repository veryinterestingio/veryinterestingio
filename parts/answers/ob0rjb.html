<p>The damage is caused by a positive feedback loop leading to either immune cells killing infected cells or the cells killing themselves.</p>
<p>Antibody responses actually inhibit this process, greatly reducing the overall inflammatory response. The antibody response is quicker and stronger in vaccinated individuals, so the cytokine storm response should be minimal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the damage caused by the SARS-COV-2 virus is due to an inflammatory reaction by your immune system.  When you develop this condition it is called covid-19.  This is called a cytokine storm, and it is an overreaction by the immune system that causes massive inflammation; usually as a result of the immune system attacking the affected tissue en mass.  If you only have a mild case, It usually means that your immune system has detected and caught the virus early enough to prevent a massive infection and thus your unlikely to have the damaging cytokine storm.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
