		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To travel in space you need to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>accelerate to the desired speed to get where you want when you want</p>
</li>
<li>let off the throttle and open a good (and long) book while you coast</li>
</ol>
<p>Because <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLpgxry542M" target="_blank">Sir Isaac Newton is the deadliest son of a bitch in space</a>, travelling in space doesn't take extra fuel during the trip, only when you need to change direction or speed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wikipedia shows the relationship between the orbits of Earth and the asteroid.</p>
<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/.Animation_of_Hayabusa2_orbit.gif" target="_blank">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/.Animation_of_Hayabusa2_orbit.gif</a></p>
<p>The earth's orbit is about 93 million miles in radius, so when the asteroid is on the opposite side of the sun then it is indeed about 180 million miles away. But the gif shows that the earth keeps &quot;catching up&quot; to the asteroid making that distance considerably less.</p>
<p>As for how long it takes to travel 180 million miles, you do it every four months or so, just by riding the earth along its orbit. Being launched into space doesn't change that...you still carry the momentum of the earth with you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The capsule launched six years ago and traveled 180 million miles. That's an average of about 3,400 miles per hour.</p>
<p>That's not actually very fast, as these things go. Orbital speed is about 17,000 miles per hour. You get these speeds by flying big ass rockets into orbit, and then using gravity to slingshot around the solar system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>if you are on a long elliptical orbit around earth and you make a burn opposite the direction you are moving at the highest point of orbit, it is very easy and extremely &quot;cheap&quot;  to slow down enough to get caught by the atmosphere and slow down into a reentry</p>
<p>You should try playing Kerbal Space Program, it will give you a fairly intuitive understanding of how orbital mechanics function</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
