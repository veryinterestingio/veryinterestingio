		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Organs are made of cells, like pretty much the rest of your body.  </p>
<p>A transplant procedure just hooks up the organ to the new body's blood supply (veins and arteries), so that the cells inside the organ can have oxygen and food, and basically survive and do their jobs.  That's it.</p>
<p>There's no &quot;adapting&quot;, the cells in the organ don't change their DNA or makeup in any way, so basically they'll live and divide and function based on the DNA that they have (which is, the donor's DNA).</p>
<p>So, to answer your question, the organ &quot;ages&quot; according to the donor's DNA and &quot;age&quot;.</p>
<p>But the biggest issue with transplanted organs is that the recipient's immune system (which is in the blood), recognizes that the DNA of the organ is NOT from its own body, and attacks it as if it's actually contamination.  The immune system tries to kill all the cells in the organ, as if they were microbes.</p>
<p>To prevent this, every person receiving a transplant organ must go on medication to disable their own immune system from being so aggressive.  Of course, if you disable a person's immune system, they'll get sick extremely easily, so you can't disable it 100%.  You can just reduce it a bit.</p>
<p>So the organ does eventually get attacked, because the immune system is not disabled, just reduced, so it does still attack the organ over time.  5 years, 10 years.</p>
<p>Basically, age isn't a problem for the organ, as much as being &quot;killed&quot; by the new person's immune system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neither.   They age very quickly due to the recipients body attacking them.  Even though we give anti rejection drugs, the immune system of the recipient will still attack the organ.</p>
<p>It's pretty typical that an organ like a kidney will only last around 10 years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OOh I can answer this! </p>
<p>Source - I (43) received a kidney from my mum (71) last year! </p>
<p>(Trigger warning, this talks about children and babies dying so feel free to click away).</p>
<p>I'm no doctor or scientist but I've been a patient of renal medicine for 20 years and I'm inquisitive, so here we go</p>
<p>The transplanted kidney is the age that it is, so part of me is now 72 years old, even though I'm 43. The kidney will respond to the demands of the body it is in, so this is interesting when donated organs come from Children. Kidneys do generally wear out over time but this isn't especially accelerated in transplant recipients. But they DO change, see below.</p>
<p>I had my transplant at <a href="https://www.leedsth.nhs.uk/a-z-of-services/kidney-transplantation/" target="_blank">Leeds</a> which is one of the best units. They have done a load of work transplanting from children to adults. They did some experimentation with transplanting organs from stillborn babies but found that it doesn't really work very well if the deceased donor is less than six months old, so that is now the limit. </p>
<p>Fun fact! If you as an adult receive a transplant from a small child, you will most likely receive both kidneys so they can provide enough capacity. They are so so tiny!</p>
<p>Fun Fact! if you as an adult receive a child kidney, it will grow very very fast to accommodate it's new workload</p>
<p>Fun Fact! They don't take your old kidneys out unless they are actively harming you - I've got three now!</p>
<p>Fun Fact! Related to the above, some people have four of five kidneys because of this, as transplants do wear out</p>
<p>Fun Fact! Even though your kidneys are half way up your back, under your ribs, the new one goes in your belly. Mine is next to my appendix and sticks out a bit (you can grab hold of it). They do this as the plumbing is much easier, they tap it in to the vein and artery that run down your leg, and put a tube in to your bladder.</p>
<p>Fun Fact! In the 24 hours after my transplant I passed 14 LITRES of urine as the new kidney went all WFT dude and went in to overdrive. I was on two drips (one in each arm) and drinking as much as I physically could to keep up </p>
<p>Fun Fact! one transplanted kidney will often up it's game to do it's job. My one is mostly at 60% and the guy who was in the bed next to me is at 80% with just one! (mine is misbehaving at the moment after I had Covid but that's another story)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Little by little we're approaching a time when we can grow the organ we need from our own body. The closest to viability appears to be kidneys. Most of those working on this believe we'll start growing our own kidneys as soon as 2025. There's no reason to think many other organs won't follow over time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
