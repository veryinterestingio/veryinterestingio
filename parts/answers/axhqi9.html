		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water does get recycled. </p>
<p>The problem is that getting to freshwater takes time, and you can use it faster than it replenishes. </p>
<p>If you live in most of California ::edit:: yes it has rained in California this year, but most of that water will be gone by June and it won’t rain again until November.:: it only rains a few inches a year, so it’s very easy to use the water up before the rains come again to fill your reservoir. </p>
<p>If you live in Brazil ::edit:: yes Brazil is a big place, but it is most famous for its rainforests which are what I was referring to.:: you have quite the opposite problem, because water is so plentiful so also is life in the water. This means that most naturally occurring water sources are contaminated. Consequently you need to dig wells and get to the water that has been filtered as it passed through the earth. But once again it takes time for the water to filter through and become clean and if you use it faster than that you will run out.</p>
<p>The same amount of water is on Earth, but less and less of it is useful, you can’t drink seawater. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The water will come back down, yes, but there's no rule that it has to come back down in the same place or that it has to do so in a reasonable timeframe. Most of the American Midwest, for example, uses a large aquifer that is being emptied faster than the rain fills it. It would take about six thousand years for it to recharge once emptied despite none of the water actually leaving the planet. If the rain falls on the other side of the earth it can't be helpful to your community, and if it falls in the ocean then it isn't being helpful to anyone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>I just have never understood it and why it matter that we don’t take long showers or keep a faucet running or whatever. I’ve just always been under the impression water can’t be wasted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Water treatment <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_water_quality_standards" target="_blank">to the required standards </a>requires many millions of dollars in infrastructure, the more water you use the more capacity you need the more taxes you must pay.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A combination selected from the following processes is used for municipal drinking water treatment worldwide:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-chlorination for algae control and arresting biological growth    </li>
<li>Aeration along with pre-chlorination for removal of dissolved iron when present with small amounts relatively of manganese    </li>
<li>Coagulation for flocculation or slow-sand filtration</li>
<li>Coagulant aids, also known as polyelectrolytes – to improve coagulation and for more robust floc formation</li>
<li>Sedimentation for solids separation that is the removal of suspended solids trapped in the floc</li>
<li>Filtration to remove particles from water either by passage through a sand bed that can be washed and reused or by passage through a purpose designed filter that may be washable.</li>
<li>Disinfection for killing bacteria viruses and other pathogens.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_treatment#Processes" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_treatment#Processes</a></p>
<p>In addition to the capital cost there are all the ongoing maintenance costs and energy costs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_treatment#Energy_consumption" target="_blank">Water treatment plants can be significant consumers of energy. In California, more than 4% of the state's electricity consumption goes towards transporting moderate quality water over long distances</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, water is free but a safe and reliable drinking water supply requires a lot of money - the more you use the more you must pay.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its a simplification. Its not conserving water. Its conserving sufficiently pure water. After you drink water and piss it out, after you take a shower, after water goes down the sink, water isn't exactly &quot;Clean&quot; anymore. As such, it goes through the sewers, to a treatment plant that does a bunch of science stuff to filter out all the bacteria and paint and poo and everything else that ends up in the water. Afterwards, it is sufficiently clean to be re-used. You can't use sea-water, as much of it as there is, because frikkin salt, and lots of microscopic life you probably don't want in your drinking water. Rain is pretty pure, because when water evaporates it doesn't take the crap with it. That said, pollution will contaminate rain, so if pollution gets bad enough things get problematic.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Overall, while the water doesn't run out, the clean water runs out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The basic missunderstanding here is that the water cycle you learned about isn't equivalent with the water we use in our every-day lives. </p>
<p>The water you draw from the tap isn't just re-condensed / rain water, but tap water specifically cleaned, filtered, etc. And that processing work of turning 'dirty rain water' into 'clean tap water' is something that can 'go to waste'.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
