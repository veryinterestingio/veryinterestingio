		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Scientist have looked at brains using fMRIs and found the superior temporal gyrus and the left inferior frontal gyrus light up.<br />
Those are the areas that light up deal mainly with language.<br />
A bunch of other areas light up as well, a lot have to do with predicting what other people would do.  </p>
<p>To put it to an analogy, it's a lot like GPU processing on a high end Computer.<br />
There is some very expensive and very powerful specialized hardware installed.<br />
It was meant to do one thing that was very difficult.<br />
But in the process it turned out we could use that hardware to do some other things that were difficult.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
