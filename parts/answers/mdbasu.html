		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Disclaimer: Reader discretion is advised. Before you click any links, know that you cannot unsee this.</strong></p>
<p>The shadows of Hiroshima are probably the second most <em>haunting</em> thing I can tell you about the nuclear attacks on Japan during WWII. Please know that I am not being hyperbolic with that disclaimer.</p>
<p>The detonations over Hiroshima and Nagasaki created a ball of plasma that plowed out through everything around it, like a mosh pit starting in a concert crowd, which pushed outward until atmospheric pressure could stop it. The nuclear fission chain reaction releases its heat in a fraction of a second, meaning the surface of this plasma ball releases a flash of light as if the sun was suddenly hovering a few hundred meters over the city. This wall of photons is called 'the flash,' and is a wall of heat at a temperature of thousands of degrees. The time from chain reaction to plasma-ball-expansion to wall-of-heat is faster than human reflexes can register. When a nuclear bomb goes off, the world instantly goes from normal to <em>on fire.</em> </p>
<p>The photons of the flash span infrared through <em>literally blinding</em> visible light through ultraviolet and X-rays, and it scorches <em>everything</em>. In the case of wood and carbon based materials, they can be turned black by the heat- burnt. In the case of many other noncombustible surfaces, like stone and some paint, they can be bleached by the intense UV. Have you've left a piece of plastic for a long time in a window, or in your car, and noticed it lost its color after lying in sunlight? This is the same thing, but happening in a seconds instead of months.</p>
<p>And if there was something in the way of this light, it left a shadow. A shadow meant that the scorching or bleaching was interrupted, the flash blocked. For example, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2440067.main_image.jpg" target="_blank">by a ladder.</a> Next to that ladder you can see the silhouette of a person- they would have been covered in third degree burns instantly, unable to comprehend what had happened or why. </p>
<p>The Hiroshima bomb exploded at 8:15 am- we know the exact time because many clocks stopped. <a href="https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/running-Hiroshima-shadows.jpg" target="_blank">Is this the shadow of a man, not too different from you or me, who was waiting for his bank to open? Was he wearing a hat to help stay cool in the hot August sun?</a> We'll never be able to ask him about his choice of hat that morning, but we do know the bombing was only possible because of the clear weather on August 6, 1945.</p>
<p>Many of those shadows were present for <em>years</em> before rain and weathering finally washed them away. In the case of the man at the bank, we will never know who he was, but those stones were removed and are preserved at the <a href="http://hpmmuseum.jp/modules/exhibition/index.php?action=ItemView&amp;item_id=112&amp;lang=eng" target="_blank">Hiroshima Peace Memorial.</a> You can see them in person if you like. </p>
<p>If you haven't lost your appetite, I do encourage you to learn more about the effects of nuclear weapons. Maybe starting with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iPH-br_eJQ" target="_blank">this video.</a> Even though the people killed by the bombs can't speak to us to warn us of the horrors of nuclear weapons, maybe their shadows can.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, the massive pulse of radiation heats the air and all exposed objects, thousands of degrees in less than a second, vaporizing the top layers of everything exposed. Most objects absorb most of the energy just as normal light would, casting shadows behind. The shadows, where the radiation flux is not as high, as only some X and gamma radiation gets through, is now considerably cooler than surroundings, and the super heated ash, dust, and vaporized everything that is now in the air, condenses on the surface of the cooler surfaces, leaving black marks. The nuclear flash is so quick and intense, and from a single focal point, that everyday objects as well as the outlines of unfortunate Japanese citizens are visible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
