<p>There's a sound that every vowel in english can be reduced to. It's named &quot;schwa,&quot; (written as ə) and it sounds like the a in &quot;about&quot; or the u in &quot;under.&quot; This is the &quot;middle&quot; vowel sound in English. It's the one that requires the least effort. And as such, it's the sound people make when they don't know what they want to say.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a linguistics point of view, it's language engrained from day one. English-speaking parents tell kids that when something hurts, we say &quot;ouch&quot; or &quot;ow&quot; when we get hurt instead of crying or whatever else.</p>
<p>In Japan, it is &quot;itai&quot;. This often comes out sounding like a short &quot;ite&quot;, a sort of ow to ouch.</p>
<p>Similarly how, then, we react to a stubbed toe differently, we also indicate a break in our sentences and ideas differently.</p>
<p>In Japan, you're going to hear &quot;ehttoh&quot;, or maybe &quot;nnn&quot; type neutral tones. Also engrained from day one. </p>
<p>As far as neutral tones go, it's one of the simpler noises to make vocally for speech - they can be made without even opening the mouth - and is taught to mean someone is still trying to say something. Also observed and taught from day one. How comfortable people are with the silent breaks and no filler words or vice versa is also something likely to come from what they've experienced.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The why per se I'm not sure, but the umm itself is a learned copied mechanism, each language has it's own &quot;umm&quot;. In spanish for example it can be &quot;ehh...&quot;, &quot;este...&quot;. If you were raised in an environment in which no one used it, you would not use it, you'd just probably stay silent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
