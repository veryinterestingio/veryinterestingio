		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The strength of wind within a super cell thunderstorm shouldn't be taken lightly. It's the same wind that can generate a tornado, which moves objects much bigger than large balls of ice. The answer is, yes, the wind is just that strong.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Updrafts can regularly be 120km/h in a strong sgoem which can lift a 10cm hailstone, and it's not just a ciuple hundred of feet, but several thousand metres until it's too heavy for the updraft.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A hailstone can be the <em>size</em> of a basketball, but be far less dense than an ice cube in your freezer. Hailstones are not solid blocks of ice. They can have air pockets and dissolved gases that reduce their density and weight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
