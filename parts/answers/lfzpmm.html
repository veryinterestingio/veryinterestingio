		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Information is even more general than matter.</p>
<p>It also includes radiation and so on.</p>
<p>Information is important because black holes seem to be the only exception to conservation of information (if they are, we aren't sure)</p>
<p>Information in the physical sense is all the things you can know about something. All it's physical variables, size, shape, temperature, current velocity of each individual atom. Nothing of that can be recovered after something goes into a black hole, and causality as we understand it means we should be able to reconstuct the past from our current information (in theory, for practise we'd need everything completely exact wich is impossible). Black holes maybe contradict this assumptions because after it swallowed something you have no way to find out what it was.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cool, a topic I can actually give some insight on.</p>
<p>Information, when viewed in the perspective of matter and black holes, is more of a concept surrounding the intangible properties of matter, than matter itself.</p>
<p>Think of it like this: Imagine you could create a computer simulation of the universe. In order to do so, you would have to simulate quarks, to simulate protons, neutrons, and electrons. This in turn means you can then simulate atoms etc etc. Everything you simulate, requires data. Quarks have spin, Elementary particles have charges that are based on the spin arrangements of the quarks they are composed of. Atoms have electron and proton arrangements that dictate their properties. With the correct data, you can make accurate simulations of the universe now. </p>
<p>Given enough data and computer processing power, you can simulate the big bang, calculate and simulate every elementary interaction, and build the universe from scratch. You could tell which way what atom traveled, how it bounced off another atom, bonded with another atom, got ripped apart, and kept traveling.</p>
<p>All those things that are happening to the &quot;atom&quot; I described, that is information. All that info, is basically the history of that particle that expresses itself in some form of physical sense. The direction it is traveling, can tell you where it came from. The isotope can tell you if it came from a specific reaction.nNow, in a realistic world, we don't have a super computer to simulate everything down to such degree, but we get a lot of information through other means.</p>
<p>The thing with black holes is, once something goes in, it don't come out. So studying the information by studying the physical surface of the black hole is impossible.</p>
<p>Black holes radiate hawking radiation, which is a by product of it's overall mass collapsing. Basically, black holes shrink over time until they radiate their entire mass away. Radiation doesn't really carry a lot of information from a black hole, besides where it came from. </p>
<p>So that's what they mean with &quot;loss of information&quot;: the loss of conceptual &quot;data&quot; from physical objects in the universe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every bit of matter has data associated with it -- its mass, its position, its momentum, its electric charge, its relationship with other bits of matter, and so on. A molecule of fructose (a simple sugar) has the same mass and charge as a molecule of glucose (a different simple sugar), but we can tell the difference between them.</p>
<p>This data is transformed by physical processes, but isn't fundamentally lost. Momentum is conserved, mass/energy is conserved, lepton numbers are conserved, angular momentum is conserved, etc. I can look at a pair of sugar molecules after a collision, see how they are spinning, how fast they are moving and along what paths, etc and calculate how they had been moving before the collision. I can look at the information inherent in a bunch of water and carbon dioxide molecules and trace back to determine if I got them from burning glucose or fructose. It is exceedingly hard to do so, impossible in practice, but the physical laws governing those interactions would allow it in theory.</p>
<p><em>In theory</em>, I could take a mix of fructose and glucose, put it in the same box that I recently removed Schrodinger's Cat from with a bunch of oxygen and a large brick of ice, but up the sugars completely, let the whole thing come to thermal equilibrium, and then carefully examine the resulting box of lightly carbonated water. I could determine how much glucose and fructose I started with -- not the total of both, but the individual amounts of each. I could tell you the size of the glucose crystals and the orientation of the fructose crystals. </p>
<p>In theory, that is. In practice, there is no way to actually examine the resultant products carefully enough to actually do that, but in theory, I could. Even taking into account quantum mechanics, with the uncertainty principle, wave function collapse, and so on, I could in theory trace back the reactions and recover the information from when I put the stuff in the box.</p>
<p>It changes when I add a black hole to the mix. There's a famous theorem which says that a black hole has limited information available from the outside: its mass, its electric charge, and its angular momentum. Other things, like its position and linear momentum, are observer-dependent and not fundamental to the black hole itself. There is no way to tell if 10 grams of glucose or 10 grams of fructose have fallen into the black hole once it has done so. In both cases, the mass has changed by 10 grams, the charge has remained neutral, and the angular momentum hasn't changed in different ways.</p>
<p>So if I put a black hole in the box with the oxygen, brick of ice, and the mix of glucose and fructose, I can no longer tell, by examining the resulting products at the end, what the mix of sugars I started with was. I have lost information about the system. The matter isn't lost, but the information about the matter is not accessible.</p>
<p>This isn't, itself, a problem. We can't see into a black hole to see the information in it. But there is no reason to assume it isn't still somewhere <em>inside</em> the black hole. I can't measure the position, momentum, etc of particles inside the black hole, but that doesn't mean that somehow that information isn't still around. It's there, but not accessible. Everything goes in, but nothing comes out, so we can't get any info about what's in.</p>
<p>But there's a problem with this.... Black holes, according to the work of Hawking and others, radiate. Stuff <em>does</em> come out. That stuff is random, however, and doesn't contain any information about what is inside -- it's solely determined by the mass, angular momentum, and charge of the black hole. I dump 10 grams of mixed sugars into a black hole, and (eventually) I get back 10 grams of photons and other assorted small particles back. There's no information in the radiated particles about the sugar mix I started with, except its mass, charge, and spin. I lost the information needed to determine how much of each. Worse, since the black hole will eventually evaporate completely, I can't even say &quot;well, the information is still there, but it is even more tightly concentrated in the black hole, with extraneous information radiated away&quot;. The black hole is gone. There's no place to hide that information.</p>
<p>That's the &quot;information paradox&quot;. The laws of physics are time-reversible. If you had perfect knowledge of now, you could predict the future <em>and</em> the past (although with quantum mechanics, those predictions may be probabilistic, not deterministic). With a black hole in the picture, some of that knowledge may be inaccessible, stuck in the black hole, so your predictions would be limited. But black holes radiate stuff which has information, information which is not believed to be correlated with the contents of the black hole. You can't tell much about the contents of the black hole from its radiation. Black holes eventually completely radiate away. With a black hole, you will eventually get to a state where even if you had perfect knowledge, and perfectly time-reversible laws of physics <em>and no black holes around anymore</em>, you will have lost the ability to calculate the past. You will have lost information.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Information is more than just the matter. If I throw a rock into the pond, I might not be able to see the rock anymore, but I can guess the size of the rock by the size of the waves, the position the rock fell in by the center of the ripples, and how long ago the rock fell in based on how far out the ripples have spread.</p>
<p>A black hole erases not just the rock, but the ripples as well.</p>
<p>In real life if something crashes into a planet or something, it will emit heat as well as other signs of what happened. Even after the heat signature can't be detected anymore by our equipment, it's <em>still there</em> just very faint and spread out. The heat signature will always be there, therefore leaving behind information, but a black hole sucks in the heat and everything else, effectively erasing this information.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
