		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're right that it's unlikely - we can only observe a small fraction of exoplanets using the transit method. So we have to survey huge numbers of stars to find the few that are lined up right at the right time. These are ongoing surveys that continually take pictures of large amounts of sky to see when stars get dimmer. The Kepler satellite in particular can see 116 square degrees of sky, which is almost 600 times the apparent area of a full moon.</p>
<p>There is obviously a bias here, but it's a well known bias that's easy to understand. Orbital inclinations seem to be random, so we can reasonably accurately say that some x% of planetary orbits should be inclined correctly for us to see them, and use that to estimate the total number of planets we should expect. We can also take into account the sensitivity limits - i.e. what fraction of correctly aligned orbits might have planets too small to be seen etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Why is it that all of these exoplanets seem to be going directly in between their host star and earth in order for us to be able to view them so consistently?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because those are the only ones we can detect.</p>
<p>Any exosolar planes that aren't perfectly lined up edge-on between us and their star make planets in those planes quite invisible to us, because the way we detect exoplanets is by searching for regular dips in stellar brightness as they pass exactly between their star and earth.</p>
<p>We've <a href="https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1242/" target="_blank">catalogued millions of stars</a>, but spotted only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_exoplanets" target="_blank">a handful of exoplanets</a> (bit over 4000) despite the fact that current thinking is that <em>most</em> stars may have multiple planets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are the orbital planes of different solar systems parallel with each other?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nope, they're (probably) pointing in all sorts of random directions so we can't see their planets from here.</p>
<p>As an example that we do know about, <a href="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*XMTz0MiSWZke-oPiKXCejA.jpeg" target="_blank">our solar plane is some 60Â° offset from the Milky Way's plane</a>, and all the galaxies we can see are pointing in random directions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the only explanation I can think of.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nope, you've got cognitive bias because you haven't compared the number of stars with confirmed exoplanets against the number of stars around which we're theoretically capable of detecting exoplanets if they were orbiting just right.</p>
<p>If you do that comparison, you'll find that we've only detected an infinitesimal fraction of the expected number of exoplanets that could be observed if their orbital plane somehow became irrelevant.</p>
<p>If most solar systems had the same orbital plane, we would expect to observe lots of exoplanets near stars that lie on our orbital plane, and none on stars that aren't near our orbital plane.</p>
<p>As far as I know, the current data disagrees with that hypothesis ;)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The probability to observe a transit, assuming random orientations is</p>
<p>p_tr = (R_star+R_planet)/a,</p>
<p>where R_star and R_planet are the radius of the star and planet and a is the distance between the star and planet (from midpoint to midpoint).</p>
<p>For a Jupiter-sized planet in a 3.7 d orbit that's a 10% chance and for an Earth-sized planet in a Earth-like orbit this drops to 0.5% (both assuming a Sun-like star).</p>
<p>So Hot Jupiters (first case) aren't that unlikely to find if you just look at enough stars. For planets further out you have to observe a lot more stars to find the same number. That's one of the reasons why we have found so many more planets with very short orbits. </p>
<p>You can look at Barnes (2007) for a derivation including the effect of eccentricity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
