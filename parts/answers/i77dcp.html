		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>English is not my main language but i'll try my best to explain.</p>
<p>Skin is made from different layers. The outer layers ( the skin that you shed) is made frome dead cells who lost their nucleus and got filled with a protein called keratin. The inner layers are made of living cells and there is one layer called &quot;basal layer&quot; that is made of replicating cells and while they replicate they push the old cell on the outer side.
An injury that affects the outer layer is gonna disappear with time.
If an injury goes deeper and it's wide enought it will destroy the &quot;basal layer&quot; and two things will happen
1) replicating skin cells die so no new skin is gonna form.
2) the area of the injury is gonna be repaired by fibroblast with the use of collagen forming scar tissue.
Collagen is great for reparing but it doesn't have the same properties of the skin cells, hence the scar will remain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine your skin like grass field. The dirt is the lower layers and the grass is the upper. Periodically the grass will die and be replaced with new grass. </p>
<p>Now imaging someone takes a shovel and digs a trench through the grass and into the dirt removing the grass and its roots. You don't have any sod around so you fill the hole up with gravel. </p>
<p>Overtime the dirt and grass will slowly spread back in, but until that happens you'll have a visibly different part of your field.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Only the top layer of the skin sheds, the deeper layers pretty much stay the same, thats why for example tattoos are possible. Scars on the other hand are a completely other &quot;material&quot; than skin cells, they dont behave like normal skin</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
