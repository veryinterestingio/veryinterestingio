		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in neuro and I don't know the answer to this. Scrolling through the first few top comments I'm seeing wildly different answers. Rather than further misinformation, I'll just interpret the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnic_jerk" target="_blank">wikipedia entry</a>:</p>
<p>Looks like the reaction is not understood, but is probably the activation of the &quot;reflex to stay upright&quot;. When your muscles relax when you fall asleep, it may accidentally be interpreted as weightlessness (falling), which may trigger the response.</p>
<p>So if anyone knows more than this, rather than spread dubious information, please update the wiki with your sources.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From my understanding of some theoretical model of how sleep works, and explained in the way a 5-year-old who understands enough to ask this question:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The different parts of your brains that control what you do talk to each other through waves of electricity when you're awake. When you start to sleep, one big sleep wave goes over your whole brain so the different parts of your brain can't hear each other anymore over this big wave. </p>
<p>When you feel like you're falling asleep little by little, almost rhythmically, that is the sleep wave trying over and over again to stop the parts of your brain from talking to each other. When you suddenly wake yourself, that's one or more parts of your brain sending waves out &quot;louder&quot; because they don't know why they can't talk to the other parts anymore. Then the big sleep wave has to try again, and hopefully it will stop all of the different parts of the brain from talking to each other, so there's just one big, rhythmic wave and you can get some sleep!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a name for this phenomenon: It's called a hypnic jerk or sleep start. ... experts don't know the exact cause of sleep starts, but what seems to be happening is that there's a neurological tussle between the brain systems that keep you awake and the ones that encourage you to fall asleep</p>
<p>Hopefully I understood your question as you wanted :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
