		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because bone isnt really destroyed by high heat. When a body is cremated it doesnt turn into ash, the skeleton remains somewhat intact and is ground up and turned into ash. In some pet crematoriums they even cremate a whole bunch of bodies together, grind the bones, and scoop you a proportion of the ash.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm assuming that you are asking about Pompeii and Herculaneum, during the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in A.D. 79.  Those towns were buried in hot ash, i.e. really fine powdered rock.  Yeah, that ash was hot.  And it was hot enough to make people's skulls explode by causing their brains to boil.  However, the ash wasn't hot enough to make something as moist as a human spontaneously ignite.  In addition, the ash buried the towns so quickly, that even if things had ignited, the fires would have been extinguished by the ash.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But yes, you're correct.  Anything living that has bones would certainly be destroyed by lava.  I may be wrong, as I'm not a paleontologist, but I can't recall fossils every being found in igneous rock..</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
