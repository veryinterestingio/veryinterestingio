		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Crying is a response to extreme emotion- I’ve seen people cry from being scared, angry (kind of the same thing) etc. it’s a natural way to release those pent up emotions. You wouldn’t need to cry over something mild happening, like say, your food order being late, unless you already had a bunch of unexpressed emotions that were piled on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body has evolved to stay at an equilibrium. Any strong emotions cause a chemical upheaval within the body, like adrenaline when you're angry or dopamine when you're excited. However, even if it's a good emotion, your body is constantly working to stay in balance. So the emotion causes a physical response intended to reset the neurochemical balance within the body. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
