		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The blood flow to ligaments and tendons is far, far lower than to the muscles. This means any growth and or repair is much slower, as the blood carries the vital clotting factors etc needed in the healing process.</p>
<p>The problem arises because the muscles are capable of generating much more force than the ligaments and tendons can withstand - that asymmetry can be dangerous when doing too much too soon. Getting strong muscles is relatively fast, strong ligaments and tendons take years to build up strength - and even longer to repair.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The really simple answer is that muscles are effectively made to be torn and damaged to regrow stronger. They're constantly getting minor &quot;damage&quot; as you use them, so major damage doesn't take too long to regenerate.</p>
<p>Ligaments and tendons can't really regenerate. You either have a partial tear - in which case, the ligaments/tendons don't regenerate, just form scar tissue which doesn't have the same functionality as the usual tendon tissue. Or you have a complete tear, and the body can't fix it on it's own, and you have to have surgical fixes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
