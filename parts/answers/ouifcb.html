		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a molecular biologist, I use CRISPR on the daily. What is it you've done that's different, exactly? You haven't really explained. CRISPR combined with homology-directed repair is very well established at this point. I'm literally using it right now to insert a 2000-base pair gene into primary cells. There are many many mutated/modified cas enzymes with greater efficiency/lower off-targets. What's your USP?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Trying to understand, sorry for very basic questions: when you edit 50 vs 1000 bp, what is the mechanism? Is it homologous recombination in both cases, or is there a more direct way? Do you have two guide RNAs targetting the two extreme positions of the stretch of DNA you want to cut out and replace? What limits the distance between these two in classical editing?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
