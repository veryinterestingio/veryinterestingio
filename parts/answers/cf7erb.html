		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The bladder is lined by a type of skin called transitional epithelium. The function of this type of epithelium is to allow it to expand and contract without leaking. This is because that is what the bladder is intended to do. The transitional epithelial cells are connected together by tight junctions, which form an essentially water-proof barrier intended to prevent toxic metabolites within the bladder from getting back into the body. Therefore, once it’s in the bladder, the fluid is essentially inaccessible to the rest of the body without some sort of pathologic process going on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The human body is only so efficient. </p>
<p>Drinking your own urine will only slow the process of dehydration for so long, as your body struggles to extract more water from it. Eventually it will be so concentrated with waste products that you'll experience symptoms of kidney failure. It is also hard on your digestive tract due to the acidic nature of urine.</p>
<p>In order to internally metabolize urine for additional fluids you would need some significant anatomical changes, like a second set of kidneys more capable than the first, and perhaps a second bladder with thicker lining.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body goes through a lot of work and specialized organs (ie the kidneys) to separate water and nitrogenous waste, and what’s left is urine. Once it’s in the bladder there isn’t a mechanism to get more water back out of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
