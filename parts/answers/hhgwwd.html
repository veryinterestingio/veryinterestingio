		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myh94hpFmJY" target="_blank">this video</a> by youtuber Veritasium explains it exceedingly well. Would also in general recommend all of his videos.</p>
<p>Edit: Some explanation</p>
<p>A majority of venomous creatures are &quot;ectotherms&quot;, i.e. cold blooded and utilise their environments to moderate their internal temperatures. It's more difficult for them to be as active as their warm blooded counterparts which means that they are typically more &quot;sit and wait&quot; predators. It's hypothesised that it is beneficial for this type of predator to evolve venom.</p>
<p>Also warmer climates are better in general for all animals to live in - but particularly for these ectotherms. So there are a greater number of venomous species in warm places, simply because there are more species in warm places.</p>
<p>Historical factors are also quite important and explain why some hot places such as Hawaii have no venomous land snakes. By historical factors I mean millions of years ago it was blind luck that some venomous creatures migrated to places such as Australia where they have thrived in the local climates. The recent ice age is also thought to have driven many of the venomous creatures away from the northern parts of the northern hemisphere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because warm regions have a bigger variety of animals in general, and most venomous animals are reptiles and insects that live better in hotter climates.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
