<p>Does the AC power the heater too or should I just leave it off as heat only comes from motor?</p>
<p>I assume it needs to be off because I haven’t been able to find a difference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The car heater works on the heat of the engine - it &quot;has to&quot; heat the entire radiator to a decent temperature first (if you try to suck the air from it too quickly, you will literally cool the engine even more which you don't want on a cold-start).  The engine runs, heats the water, the water heats the air in your car.</p>
<p>You can *get* electric heaters, etc. for the car, they are usually stupidly pathetic (12V, often limited to only 10A on a cigarette lighter socket, is 120W) or aren't something you can have running for more than a few minutes, when the engine has just started, or in cold conditions.</p>
<p>Basically, you sacrifice your heat for the first minute or two of operation to keep the engine running smoothly in cold conditions, then when it has an excess of heat it's designed to give you that.</p>
<p>And anything that sucked the power from the engine in those first few minutes will hinder a cold-start and will, also, take a huge drain and leave you with a flat battery if you use it for more than a couple of minutes.</p>
<p>I used to have a Ford Mondeo (Fusion in the US, I believe).  It used to have a coil-heater in the airvents.  It could blow hot air immediately, but it was a draw on the battery, and even then it wouldn't kick in immediately.</p>
<p>It was also notorious for failing and even starting fires.</p>
<p>I have a newer Ford Mondeo.  It does not have that.</p>
<p>Manufacturers will tell you - the best way to warm up the car in cold conditions is to drive it normally, and not too much strain on it.  Suffer that minute-or-two when you've just got in from the cold outside, and are now in a cold, but not windy, car.  Because anything else will leave you with a flat battery, an engine that can't crank, or a fire hazard.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, the heater in your car pulls free heat away from the engine.  It works like this:</p>
<p>When you first start your car, the engine is cold.  Inside your engine are pathways where engine coolant (water mixed with chemicals that are resistant to freezing) flow to keep your engine from getting too hot (overheating).  The way it keeps your engine's temperature down is by cycling the engine coolant from your engine through the radiator and blowing air (by using a fan as well as forced air as you travel down the road) over the fins of the radiator.</p>
<p>Actually, there is a device in your engine that delays this cycling of coolant in order to speed up the engine warming to normal operating temperature (about 165 - 180 F).  This device is called a thermostat and it remains closed and blocks the flow of coolant into the engine until it reaches a certain temperature (or it would take even longer for the heat in your car to start working).</p>
<p>To heat the air in your car, it has something called a heater core which is mounted somewhere under/behind your car's dash.  This heater core is basically a smaller radiator.  A fan in your car's ventilation system blows air over this heater core and into the passenger cabin.  Until hot coolant flows into this heater core, you will not have any warm air coming from your car's vents.</p>
<p>As a side note, it's easy to tell if your car's thermostat has broken in the open position.  Your engine will take a very long time to reach normal operating temperature and your vehicle's heater will similarly take a very long time to start producing warm air.</p>
<p>Additional side note, the heater core on my 1968 Plymouth Valiant popped one morning on the way to work and instantly dumped hot coolant into the passenger floorboard of my car while simultaneously seriously fogging every window in my car.  I had to stick my head out the window to make it safely to the side of the road.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Car heater uses waste heat from the engine coolant. The engine is large and there's a large volume of coolant in the water jackets of the engine. </p>
<p>The engine has to heat it's self, which heats the coolant, which is moved by the water pump to the heater core, a small radiator in the climate control duct.</p>
<p>Once the engine is at operating temperature the thermostat (physical variable valve, opens up with increasing temp) will open and begin moving the hot coolant to the radiator where the coolant is cooled by airflow, the cooled coolant then flows back into the engine and the circuit continues.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
