		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The wax reacts with the oxygen in the air to form water, carbon dioxide with a smattering of carbon monoxide and soot.</p>
<p>So some of the carbon dioxide you breathe in will likely have come from the burning candle, but I wouldn't say that it is a candle anymore.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The stuff that melts is the stuff that burns.  The wick isn't really the main thing that burns.  It just transports melted wax to the flame.  The wax then evaporates into fumes, which react with oxygen.</p>
<p>As the wax is make of long chains of carbon with a load of hydrogen stuck on, burning it forms carbon dioxide (CO2) and water vapour (H2O), which goes in to the air.</p>
<p>So yep, we'll inhale some of the stuff that was the candle, but in a form we inhale anyway!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is perhaps the best explanation I have ever seen. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrHnLXMTOWM&amp;list=PL0INsTTU1k2UCpOfRuMDR-wlvWkLan1_r" target="_blank">The Engineer Guy replicated <em>The Chemical History of a Candle</em> lectures by Michael Faraday</a></p>
<p>I think it's well suited for younger audiences who might also be interested in learning what science is really about... because the lecture really is more about &quot;How to Science&quot; and Faraday just used a candle to convey that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
