		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nobody really knows, and it's only actually been quantified recently.  Humans, as you noted, do lose strength relatively quickly, losing 54% of their strength in 90 days of bed rest, even with a well balanced diet.  Bears on the other hand only lose 29% of their strength after 110 days of hibernation, so without any food intake whatsoever.  These numbers come from a 2007 study reported in the journal Physiological and Biochemical Zoology.  There is thought that it may be due to lowered body temperatures, slowed and altered metabolism, etc, but nobody really knows the answer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They warm up by removing the bear plug. It takes some effort to remove the bear plug and that effort warms up the muscles, increases cardiovascular activity, and stretches the ligaments.  </p>
<p>Nothing like that first one of the season. Amirite?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I mean what would the default expected behaviour be? You would expect the physiology not to change, just because it isn’t needed. Other parts of the body don’t work like that. You don’t lose fingernails or teeth or bones when you don’t use them. It is actually actively benefitial for humans to maybe reduce some muscles they don’t need to reduce the energy they consume while resting. </p>
<p>So we evolved the ability to metabolize our muscle mass away in dire times. </p>
<p>So all evolution had to do was not have that happen in bears during hibernation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
