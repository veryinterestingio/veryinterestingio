		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most (all?) semi automatic and fully automatic rifles have a mechanism in them that will hold the bolt open when there are no bullets in the magazine.</p>
<p>Pull the trigger, <del>rifle goes <em>click</em></del> <em>trigger doesn’t move</em> instead of rifle going <strong>CRACK</strong>, you look at the bolt and see it’s open instead of a misfire and know the magazine is empty.</p>
<p>There is a button you then press to eject the magazine, you insert a new one, then press a button/lever that will release the bolt and load the first round of the fresh magazine.</p>
<p>Edit: as a few have correctly pointed out the trigger is locked when the bolt is open, it won’t do anything when you pull on it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is one trick that I used is that you put tracer rounds as your last two rounds in the magazine. But most of the time when you’re in combat you will just hear a click and nothing happens. You rehearse reloading a million times in training so it’s basically second nature. </p>
<p>There’s a magazine drop button that you depress and slide another in. Once that’s in you hit the “bolt release” button which loads another round and is ready to fire. </p>
<p>Machine guns take a little longer and the visuals in call of duty and newer video games reflect the actual motions of what it takes to do that. You can do the same trick with putting tracer rounds near the end of your ammo belt. (USMC infantry 2003-2009)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From my personal experience in the military.<br />
We combined tracer (light emitting bullets) with normal bullets.<br />
At the bottom of the magazine I put 2 tracer bullets. and then  few normal</p>
<p>So whenever I saw 2 light traces right after eachother .. I knew i was going to finish in a few bullets and that gave me the option/choice to already reload.</p>
<p>And to be honest ... if you missed the 2 tracers .. it's a question of pressing the trigger and seeing/feeling nothing fire.<br />
Reloading fast and efficient is trained and trained like crazy till it's second nature for this reason.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
