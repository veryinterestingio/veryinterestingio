<p>This is kind of a tough one to answer for a number of reasons. </p>
<p>First, any reaction seen is really going to depend on the type of primate and the social system of that primate.  In more social species you’re probably more likely to see something interesting than in less social species.  Simply, there’s more opportunity for an animal to encounter a dead conspecific.  Moreover, in such species there is often a hole left in the social life of the group (and that of its individual constituents) when an animal dies. This can lead to changes in, or a reshuffling of, group dynamics and/or individual behaviors following the death of an individual - particularly if the dead animal was central to the group.  In solitary species this isn’t going to be as much of a factor.  </p>
<p>Second, when observing primates, it is actually really rare to witness the death of an animal and following group responses.  Primates are long lived, and the odds that you will be there on the day one dies is pretty low if they are an adult - although you are more likely to encounter a dead immature due to high infant/juvenile mortality in many primate species.  In several thousand hours of observational time following primates, I’ve encountered dead study animals on 5 occasions.  Of these, I’ve only seen one actually die. Usually, animals pretty much just disappear, and we’re often we’re not sure if they are dead or have transferred out of their social group.  In the case of predation, it’s likely there will be no body, although you might find parts later.   Basically, recording what goes on after a death is hard since it is so rare to observe.</p>
<p>That said, I can provide a few anecdotes about what I’ve seen with wild primates interacting with dead conspecifics. I’ve seen two mothers with dead infants -one a macaque and the other a ring tailed lemur.  The macaque basically carried her dead infant around for a day or so before finally letting it go.  Primatologists don’t like to infer mental states to animals, but she definitely seemed confused and down about the situation.  With the lemur, I actually saw the infant die.  Mom attempted to carry the infant with her hands while walking bipedally, but dropped the dead infant after 5-10 minutes so that she could keep up with the rest of her group.  Once the group stopped some distance away, she returned to the body of the infant (which I was inspecting and preparing to take back to the lab).  She basically stared at me from a few meters away while I took photos of her dead kid.  Again we don’t like to infer mental states of animals, but she seemed to be in a bad way, or at least hoping that maybe the kid would be alright when she came back for it. I personally felt kind of embarrassed to be doing my job while she sat there.</p>
<p>I’ve also seen macaques checking out the body of a dead young adult male.  These seemed to mainly be members of the “bachelor” group he was hanging out with at the time.  While I noticed they were interested in his body, I didn’t get any good observations as they came after me aggressively when I went to see what was going on.  I basically had to get out of the area to avoid being mobbed.  I don’t know if they thought I had killed him, or if they were protecting the body, or something else.  Interesting behavior though.</p>
<p>Edit:  Wow! Thanks for the gold!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I still don't know what they do with the bodies. Apparently, it's pretty rare for humans to actually witness a natural death in the wild.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Turkish guy here. Magpie's are very common here and i really love them. i know they are not primates but i have a cool fact about them that seems relevant. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.eiu.edu/humanitiescenter/pdf/The%20Dying%20Animal.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.eiu.edu/humanitiescenter/pdf/The%20Dying%20Animal.pdf</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to a report by the
Cornell Lab of Ornithology, yellow-billed magpies
react to a death by descending on the carcass and
hopping around and squawking (Dickinson and Chu
2007). Ethologist Marc Bekoff observed “funeral be-
havior” among a group black-billed magpies: “One
approached the corpse, gently pecked at it, just as an
elephant would nose the carcass of another elephant,
and stepped back. Another magpie did the same thing,”
Bekoff reported. “Next, one of the magpies flew off,
brought back some grass and laid it by the corpse.
Another magpie did the same. Then all four stood vigil
for a few seconds and one by one flew off” (The
Telegraph 2009, ¶5–¶6).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>TL:DR magpies inspect their dead and decide what is the cause of death. i read somewhere that if they do not like the cause of death then they abandon an area but i do not have source rn.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
