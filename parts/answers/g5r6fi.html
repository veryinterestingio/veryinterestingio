		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Light travels quickly but still at finite speed. A light year is the distance that light travels in one year. Sixty-five million light years is the distance light travels in sixty-five million years. As such, if one were actually able to look at that light after it has traveled so far, it would be light reflected off the earth sixty-five million years ago.</p>
<p>One could theoretically look at the state of anything at any point in the past if they could travel quickly enough to a point in space that had a line of sight to the object that was far enough away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Light takes time to travel.  When we are looking at the sun, we actually see what it looked like about 8 minutes ago, because it took 8 minutes for the light from the sun to reach our eyeballs.  When we see a star 65 million light years away, that means we are seeing the light that left that star 65 million years ago, and it's just hitting our eyeballs now.  Fact is, we can't say for sure what that star looks like &quot;now&quot; - we see what it looked like (and the position it was in) 65 million years ago.  Now if there's a civilization on a planet around that star now, and they are looking through their telescopes at where Earth used to be 65 million years ago, they'll see what Earth looked like 65 million years ago.  It's taken that long for light leaving the Earth to reach their telescopes.  And 65 million years ago, dinosaurs roamed the Earth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you &quot;see&quot; something, light is hitting your eyes. That's how seeing works; it requires light.</p>
<p>Light is the fastest thing in the universe, but the universe is so huge that even light takes a long time to get around. A &quot;lightyear&quot; is the distance that light travels in one year.</p>
<p>When you look at the sun (not that you should ever look straight at the sun), you're seeing the sun as it was 8 minutes ago because it takes 8 minutes for light to reach your eyes from that far away.</p>
<p>Think about this: if a planet is so far away that its light takes a long time to reach your eyes, it's impossible to see that planet in real time. The light you see from a planet 65 million lightyears away is the image of that planet 65 million years ago because it took that long for the image to reach you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>65 million years ago, earth was inhabited by dinosaurs (well, 100 million years before that too, but that’s not important). Light reflected off Earth 65 million years ago, theoretically contains the image of the earth and dinosaurs and everything else that was on the surface at that time. That light is travelling across space at the speed of light (1 light year per year). Today it’s hitting part of space that is 65 million light years distant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you look at stuff, you aren’t seeing the world as it is, but rather as it was when the light first reflected off of what you’re looking at. Normally the distances between our eyes and the objects we look at are so small and the speed of light is so fast, that the reflected light hits our eyes almost instantaneously, and we can basically see our immediate surroundings as they are (the difference is insignificant).</p>
<p>However, when you’re talking about space, even though light is crazy fast, it still kinda takes a while, because the distances between things can be so incredibly large. The term light year means the physical distance that it would take light a year to travel. So, if you are 65 million light years away from Earth, and you somehow have a way of observing light emanating from Earth, the light that you would be observing (because we don’t see objects, we just see the light reflected off of them) would have spent the last 65 million years traveling towards you from Earth. You would be seeing the light that left the Earth 65 million years ago, when dinosaurs were still around. </p>
<p>Hope this helps</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
