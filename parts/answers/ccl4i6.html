		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a couple different methods. The one I know best is &quot;wet bulb temperature&quot; which is measured by placing a thermometer covered with a wet cloth outside. The temperature this thermometer reads is a decent indication to how cold it would feel for a sweaty person to stand outside. This isn't a calculation, so much as a measurement, although you could probably calculate it roughly based on wind speed, temperature, and humidity if you really wanted to. ----- If you want the heat index, then there is a table that is used. It can be found in the following wikipedia page under the spoiler &quot;Table of Values&quot;: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_index" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_index</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll be addressing the heat index portion of the question, as I think wind chill is far more intuitive (a breeze always makes you feel more cool, and you can tell when the wind is blowing, and how hard it's blowing.)</p>
<p>The history of this involves a scientist named R. G. Steadman. He worked out some sort of formula involving ~20 factors which could estimate how hot someone would feel in a given situation.</p>
<p>Some other scientists cut out all factors except heat and humidity and estimated what we now call a heat index.</p>
<p>In higher humidity, your sweat evaporates less quickly, causing it to cool your body less efficiently. So to my understanding the heat index calculates the rate at which an average person's sweat would evaporate in a given humidity, then compares the rate at which the ambient temperature heats that person, and after coming up with a net gain of heat over time, compares it to a relative humidity of 20% with a temperature <em>x</em>. The &quot;<em>x</em>&quot; is the heat index.</p>
<p>If it's 90 degrees out, with a relative humidity of 75%, your body is being heated at the rate of 90 degree ambient temperature, but your cooling from sweat is inefficient compared to the standard 20% used for calculation. So it feels like 108 degrees, 20% humidity.</p>
<p>Being from Florida, it's always struck me as odd to say it &quot;feels like 100+&quot; when it's 90 out, because the humidity here is always high. So if it's 90 out, and it feels like 106, but almost every time it's 90 out it feels like 106, it just feels like 90. Because 90 always feels that way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If a hear about a &quot;feels like&quot; temperature, they are most likely talking about the Heat Index from the US National Weather Service.  It is calculated by looking it up on a historical table which calculates the Heat Index based on the actual temperature and the relative humidity.</p>
<p>No, really, that's how they calculate it.  Really, really.</p>
<p>There's advanced study on it, but it's fundamentally just advanced study on how to extend the original table.</p>
<p>The air can hold more water when it's hot. A lot more water.</p>
<p>The &quot;dewpoint&quot; is what temperature the air needs to be to hold the water that it has.  The &quot;relative humidity&quot; is the amount of water in the air divided by the amount that it could hold at that temperature.</p>
<p>So, with these definitions, we can look at the dewpoints at which the temperature and the Heat Index match.  If a Heat Index of 100F means that it feels like 100F, then they must mean that it feels like 100F at the dewpoint for which the heat index is 100F.</p>
<p>Since there's no theoretical basis, we have to do this by reading them off the table.  Since they part where they match isn't generally on the actual table, we have to do it by reading it off a mathematically extended table.  Here they are</p>
<pre><code> Heat Index   Dewpoint where Heat Index = Temperature
 55-80       55
 134         60
 145         65
 155         70
 165         75</code></pre>
<p>So, that's it really.  You're supposed to keep this hidden table in the back of your mind when they mention the Heat Index, and use it convert.  So when they say &quot;It feels like it's 134F today,&quot;, they really mean, &quot;It feels like it's 134F with a dewpoint of 60F,&quot;, except they don't say the second part, they expect you to have memorized that that's what they mean when they say a heat index of 134F.</p>
<p>Except, there's a limit to the amount of heat the air can hold before it rises and spreads the heat around.  In the real world, the maximum possible dewpoint goes down with the temperature at high temperatures, not up.</p>
<p>So, when on the actual Earth, the &quot;feels like temperature&quot; is crazy high, that means that the actual temperature is probably somewhat reasonable, such as 174 °F heat index at 108 °F actual temperature.  When the temperature is actually up near 135F, the dewpoint is probably in the 30s or 40s, and the heat index is usually in the low 120s. And these temperatures over 135F that they're expecting you to use as reference values for heat indicies at high dewpoints don't actually exist on Earth at all.</p>
<p>It may seem like a silly system, but it has the advantage of producing really, really high numbers at high humidities, which appears to be what is most important.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
