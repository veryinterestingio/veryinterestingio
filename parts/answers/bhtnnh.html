		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Particle on skin may cause danger, scratching removes particle (hopefully), relief of the damaging particle releases feel good chemicals into blood. At the same time scratching slightly damages skin, skin damage releases feel good chemical into blood to counteract pain. So kind of a mix of both.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Itching is low level pain and stimulating your nerves temporarily drowns out the tingling pain signal with a stronger stimulus and the relief from that irritating sensation is awesome.  Your muscles relax and your body doesn't feel as tense .</p>
<p>I find scalding a bad itch (like posion ivy) for a second with water on the hottest setting works even better as it deadens the nerve endings for up to a day and that is a lot less temporary than the relief scratching gives you</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you feel pain or any irritating sensations on your skin, pain receptors (called free nerve endings) send signals to your brain that says it’s painful. By rubbing or scratching a painful sensation, you activate a different type of receptor that doesn’t send pain, but rather duller sensations (called beta receptors), which send signals to the brain FASTER than free nerve endings. By being faster, the duller sensations (sent by beta by scratching) over rides the painful sensations (sent by free nerve endings). This is called Pain Gating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
