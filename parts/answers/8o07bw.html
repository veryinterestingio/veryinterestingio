		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The only observed ways that matter is created is when an antimatter-matter pair of particles is created from energetic bosons. This process will never make more of one of the types of matter. Statistics has nothing to do with it in this process.</p>
<p>Since we know that there is more matter than antimatter, there must be some other process by which this apparent asymmetry came to be. Thus we have a baryon asymmetry problem.</p>
<p>An interesting note: <del>if you take the Dirac equation and you calculate the &quot;probability&quot; of finding a particle or an anti-particle, when you approach the non-relativistic limit, the &quot;probability&quot; of finding an anti-particle goes to zero.</del></p>
<p>Edit: My previous statement was a slight misinterpretation. In the non-relativistic limit of the Dirac Equation,one of the two component spinors <del>representing Antimatter</del> solutions is significantly smaller than the other spinor. That's the most technically correct statement. The derivation can be found in the quantum mechanics book by Bjorken and Drell. </p>
<p>Edit 2: upon further review, that problem above doesn't really have anything to do with the prevalence of antimatter. Although it is still an interesting problem none the less.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to add a little bit to the &quot;How do we know there is baryon asymmetry&quot; part of the question for anyone curious, it was explained to me in my intro astronomy class that if distant regions of the universe were actually antimatter dominant we would observe the energy of annihilation reactions as antimatter galaxies combined with matter galaxies and gas clouds.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;When matter and antimatter meet, they annihilate each other and the mass is converted into energy--specifically, into gamma-rays. If a distant galaxy were made of antimatter, it would constantly be producing gamma-rays as it encountered the matter in the intergalactic gas clouds that exist throughout galaxy clusters.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;We do not see any steady stream of gamma-rays coming from any source in the sky. Therefore, astronomers conclude that there are not occasional 'rogue' galaxies made of antimatter.&quot;  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are of the order of 10^80 baryons in the visible universe [1]. For each Baryon, there are approximately 10^8 photons [2]; so, there are approximately 10^88 photons.  The origin of many of these photons is thought to come from baryon anti-baryon annihilation.  So, it is thought that for each 10^8 baryon, there were 10^8 - 1 anti-baryon; they all annihilated pair-wise (producing photons), with one left-over baryon from the original 10^8.  </p>
<p>Conclusion: the original baryon asymmetry was of the order of 1 part in 10^8.  (I have seen estimates varying between 10^8 and 10^10.)</p>
<p>However, if the difference were due to statistical fluctuations, we would think that it would be of the order of the standard error, which, for gaussian distribution and large N that it would be of the order of the square root of N.  If you take the number of baryon as being 10^80, its square root would be 10^40 ... we would thus expect the photon to baryon ratio to be of the order of 10^40 and not 10^8.</p>
<p>Thus, the relatively small 10^8 (compared with 10^40 ... or 10^44) could be a statistical fluke ... however, it would be an extremely unlikely one.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The conservation of quantum numbers isn't a statistical process, nor is it approximate. You MUST conserve baryon number in almost all known processes. So it's not a question of flipping a coin, because probability isn't involved in the conservation (for the most part).</p>
<p>A seesaw would be a better analofy. Let's say one side of a seesaw represents your baryons, the other  side of the seesaw represents your antibaryons. As one side of the seesaw goes down, the other MUST go up, but the centre is always in the same place. It's the same for baryons: if the Baryon number goes up on one side, it has to go down on the other side to balance out, and baryon number going down is achieved by the creation of antibaryons. No matter what you do, the centre of the seesaw, the total baryon number, remains the same.</p>
<p>That's what <em>should</em> happen according to the standard model. But it doesn't: the universe is filled with matter and very little antimatter. In order to explain this asymmetry, you require what is called the 'Sakharov conditions'. One of those conditions is baryon number violation (the other two are interactions outside of thermal equilibrium and CP violation).The sources of these conditions are very active areas of research in modern particle physics and cosmology.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Perfectly timed question! I took cosmology this semester as part of my MSc and we looked at this problem. The baryon asymmetry problem is partly an observation issue and partly a theoretical one. </p>
<p>The observation part emerges from the fact that we observe more matter than anti-matter in the universe. The theoretical part is that our current electromagnetic and strong interaction theories satisfy CP-symmetry while weak interactions do not. But this violation of CP-symmetry is not sufficient to generate the matter/anti-matter asymmetry we see today.</p>
<p>So Andrei Sakharov proposed three conditions under which baryogenesis leads to baryon asymmetry. These are called the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryogenesis#GUT_Baryogenesis_under_Sakharov_conditions" target="_blank">Sakharov Conditions</a> and state that for baryon asymmetry the following three conditions must be satisfied: </p>
<ol>
<li>Baryon Number Violation:
There must exist a process whereby baryons are created and/or destroyed such that baryon number is not preserved.</li>
<li>C-symmetry and CP-symmetry violation:
The rates of processes under Charge conjugation, and under Charge and Parity conjugation must be different so that reactions involving matter proceed at different rates than reactions involving antimatter in favour of matter.</li>
<li>Interactions out of thermal equilibrium:
We require interactions outside of thermal equilibrium sk that the reactions producing baryons favour matter over antimatter. </li>
</ol>
<p>Now, how do we put numbers to this? Well, the way we did it was to estimate the photon-baryon ratio using the number density of photons from the CMB and the current observed number density of baryons. This gives us a ratio of approximately 10^-9, then we say that when the universe was hot enough, the number densities of photons and electrons/positrons were roughly equal as they are in equilibrium. Now if positrons and electrons have identical number densities then they would cancel when the universe cooled and we'd only have photons, but if they were slightly off so that there was one extra electron (and it's associated baryon) for every 10^9 positrons then we'd have a baryon asymmetry.</p>
<p>Hence the current observed asymmetry is not a massive asymmetry, it's actually a tiny one-in-a-billion matter anti-matter asymmetry. </p>
<p>So the conclusion from this is that, it's not just a statistical fluke, we have more matter than anti-matter in the universe and we don't know why. What we do know is that the asymmetry is tiny and we have some ideas as to how we generate that asymmetry. Of course, all of this is predicated upon starting from symmetric initial conditions which then dynamically evolve into an asymmetry due to asymmetric interactions in the physics and the evolutionary dynamics of the universe.</p>
<p>So I hope that answers your question and gives you things to read to better understand baryogenesis in the early universe. 😊</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
