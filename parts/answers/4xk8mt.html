		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A sneeze is an involuntary action but it is a semi-autonomous one, meaning you have some degree of control over it. Most of the time, though, you don't choose to exercise this control and resign yourself to the action. It's similar to a yawn- you feel your own body doing something on its own accord. Additionally, your breath fluctuates wildly during a sneeze and especially during multiple sneezes. This combination-  your conscious brain experiencing an unconscious action plus a change in your regulation of oxygen- creates a &quot;disconnected&quot; feeling that leaves you feeling discombobulated after a sneeze, as if you're &quot;returning to reality&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Before you sneeze there is a tingling sensation because of the nerves connecting to the nasal hairs are sensing irritation.  A similar pins and needles feeling to when you hit that superficial &quot;funny bone&quot; nerve in elbow.  When you expire forcefully against a closed airway(valsalva manuever), chest pressure increases impeding return of blood to heart.  Also, when you get up from sitting for along time you may feel disoriented paired with tingling because the bloods pools in your legs and not enough returns to the heart to supply brain with oxygen.  When/after you sneeze a similar thing is happening.  The baroreceptors which detect blood pressure changes find that the heart is devoid of blood/ not pumping and therefore the brain is not receiving oxygen.  Also, a vasovagal snycope could occur where you get a sudden drop in blood pressure, vertigo etc.  That is why some people lose bladder control when sneezing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Typically, when the hairs in our nose senses that there is something in there  - maybe dust, maybe a loose hair, or maybe even a bug, the nerves in the nose makes the body react to this signal, to try to remove what ever is making the nose tickle. It is generally not something we control - but you can sometimes stop a sneeze by pressing your nose with your thumb and index finger.</p>
<p>A funny thing about sneezing is that it doesn't always have to be something in the nose that makes your body want to sneeze. About 1 out of 10 people sneeze when they get exposed to bright light.. you can test if you are one of them by squinching your eyes together and turn your view to the sun. Be careful not to look straight at the sun for too long, or it may harm your eye-sight.</p>
