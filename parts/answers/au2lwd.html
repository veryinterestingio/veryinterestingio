		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When a laser beam of monochromatic light strikes the surface of something, some portion of the light will be reflected, depending on the object it hits. At the micro/ nanoscale , all things are “rough” and have variations in their structure which are greater than the wavelength of visible light . Polished surfaces with variations in their surface of less than few hundred nanometres would not show a speckle pattern for example . </p>
<p>The reason the speckle arises is that these variations alter the relative phases of the reflected light beams by more than 2pi, and according to diffraction theory, each component of this reflected field acts as its own new point source of light of spherical waves. These all interfere with each other to produce a complex random interference pattern which you observe when you look at the reflected laser beam. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
