		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever played that game where you close your eyes and have someone run their finger down your arm? Or, again with closed eyes, tried to touch the tips of your fingers in front of you (try doing this without moving symetrically)? It's supposed to be difficult, since you're relying only on proprioception.</p>
<p>Proprioception is our body's ability to recognize itself and its orientations. In areas with lots of nerves, it's very strong - you <em>feel</em> where all your fingers are and how large each of them is. Your lips also have a ton of nerves, so you generally have a really good idea of where they are and how big they are. This is important for speech (and kissing). But your arms and legs lack precision unless you've trained them.</p>
<p>Novacaine or other numbing agents prevent nerves from working correctly, and you lose proprioception for that area. Your brain is estimating their size based on sensations <em>around</em> the area you touch, or based on sensations of your fingers. Speech is difficult because you lack control of your lips, so they feel fat and in the way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Usually when you touch yourself, most of the sensation comes from the part being touched.*
e.g. stroke the back of your hand and you'll mainly feel the sensation via the back of the hand, not the fingers.  </p>
<p>if that hand was numbed , like your lip at the dentist, then most of the sensation comes  - unusually - from the fingers doing the stroking (or the rest of your mouth/tongue).  </p>
<p>so you get to really feel your own mouth and, hey, its actually kinda rubbery.  </p>
<p>*Its just occurred to me that this might be why we can successfully masturbate, but thats a topic for when you're older.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: <em>Your body is conditioned over time to ignore normal &quot;background noise&quot; when one part touches another, but the freezing at the dentist changes that by cutting off half the signal, so your body misinterprets it, possibly as swelling.</em></p>
<p>Stop what you're doing and think about your left leg for a second. Odds are parts of it are touching something, and you can feel what it's touching when you think about it... but you can't really feel it when you're actively thinking about it. Now think about your butt, and maybe your right arm. You can now feel that chair you're sitting on (or toilet if Redditing), and how your right arm is resting half against your body.</p>
<p>Not feeling that stuff unless you think about it is a way that the human body removes all the &quot;normal&quot; stuff going on from the stuff it might need to pay attention to, such as when someone touches you or you start to slip on a wet tile floor when walking in bare feet. If all those normal touching points weren't removed, you couldn't really do as well because you'd be paying attention to everything, all of the time. So to avoid sensory overload, you only pay attention to stuff that's DIFFERENT.</p>
<p>When you go to the dentist and they inject you with a nerve deadening agent, your normal body signal gets interrupted at that location and there's a hole in that filtered list of sensory stuff the world is inflicting on you. Your tongue touches that area, and instead of getting the absolutely normal &quot;oh ok&quot; feeling, you get no response from that area... and that's not what your tongue expects. It's DIFFERENT and feels like a fatter lip because your tongue or finger is touching it and not getting a confirming signal back, and your brain translates this unexpected weirdness into thinking the area you're touching might be bigger than it normally is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I feel like this goes for any body part. My arm once fell completely asleep, and I mean COMPLETELY ASLEEP. Like I couldnâ€™t feel shit, so when I woke up in the middle of the night, I attempted to get up, failed miserably, and realized I had this long, foreign-feeling, arm-like entity attached to me. It felt like another persons arm and scared the shit outta me lmao</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The brain makes up reality that matches our sensations.</p>
<p>In case of a numb lip, you can't move the lip easily and the likely explanation is that it has somehow become heavy. Heavy lips would be bigger, so you feel that lips are bigger.</p>
<p>Also you can't feel touch, that would happen if the lips are covered by a thick layer of some substance. So bigger feeling lips.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
