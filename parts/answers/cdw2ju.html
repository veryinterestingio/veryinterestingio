		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two subspecies that don't fully diverge into new species generally won't get a separate name if they then create a hybrid.</p>
<p>Look to man's best friend: all dogs are <em>Canis Lupus Familiaris</em>, and a hybrid with the original <em>Canis Lupus</em> (a wolf) doesn't get a new third designation, it's either mostly wolf or mostly dog and is treated as such.</p>
<p>All modern humans are mostly <em>Sapiens Sapiens</em> by a massive margin, so they retain that name even though some have a low level of Neanderthal hybridization.</p>
<p>More generally, subspecies designation is sloppy work since the line between subspecies is typically very blurry.  Unlike bespoke species that typically can't produce fertile hybrids, subspecies usually can and sometimes this is a significant percentage of the population.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Having a few scraps of DNA from hybridization events is not uncommon and if we went around renaming every species with that names would get too complex and be less useful.</p>
<p>EDIT: just to clarify this, humans have a few percent of DNA from crosses with related species that occurred tens of thousands of years ago.  While the detailed analysis hasn't been done on many other species, you can find evidence for this sort of hybridization, or substantially more hybridization, in many other species including pretty much every domestic animal, polar and grizzly bears, butterflies, chimps and bonobos, and many more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's even more complicated than that. We're also part Denisovan  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denisovan" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denisovan" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denisovan</a></a>   (&quot; <em>Homo denisova</em> &quot;) and likely several other subspecies which we don't know about (likely some in S. Africa, some in Indonesia etc...) really modern humans are all the same species and 'race' is a very nebulous concept and kinda pointless when you look at our ancestry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
