		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about the first question but I can answer the second one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is this why blue LEDs and OLEDs have a shorter lifespan than other colours? Are the semiconductor materials/dyes for blue wavelengths inherently less durable or is their durability tied to the greater amount of light they have to emit?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, in general blue-emitting compounds are less stable over time. This is because blue photons are more energetic than photons with longer wavelengths, so the excited state of blue emitters needs to be relatively high-energy. But this high energy can also cause chemical reactions to take place instead of light emission. These reactions lead to degradation.</p>
<p>As an undergraduate I was part of a research team trying to make compounds for improved blue OLEDs. We had some nice candidates but unfortunately they only lasted 200 hours or so.</p>
<p>For more info, here's a recently published review: <a href="https://www.chinesechemsoc.org/doi/10.31635/ccschem.020.202000271" target="_blank">https://www.chinesechemsoc.org/doi/10.31635/ccschem.020.202000271</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've been in LED lighting for a long time. You're on the right track here. There are two ways to talk about LED efficiency: radiometric and luminous efficacy. Radiometric efficacy is how many Watts of light per input Watt of electrical power. Luminous efficacy is how many lumens per Watt of electrical power. Luminous efficacy is essentially radiometric efficacy adjusted for human eye sensitivity by wavelength. </p>
<p>I can't speak much on OLED's, but in terms of radiometric efficacy, blue LED's are the most efficient, because the most work has been put into making them efficient, since they are the basis of most white LED's, which are actually a blue LED coated in a broad spectrum phosphor. But you are correct that in terms of luminous efficacy, a bare LED will be less efficient than green, though not necessarily red, since it's at the other end of our sensitivity range. A white LED with the right phosphor mix will have a very high luminous efficacy, though it uses a blue LED with a low luminous efficacy. </p>
<p>In terms of reliability, the main differences come from the materials used in the semiconductor. LED's don't suddenly die very frequently, they degrade and lose brightness from defects forming in the crystal and chemicals migrating in the structure. Different colors degrade at different rates depending on the chemistry, but the worst is actually amber LED's. Amber is so bad that many people who want amber LED's in applications that need reliability like car turn signals, will use blue LED's with a special phosphor to convert nearly all the blue to amber. Blue LED's are also dim less when hot, so there's an advantage there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blue LEDs are more efficient than green and red.. but of course, there are many ways to skin the cat. Fluorescent dies are often used to convert blue light to other colors, which of course will create more bluish hue but that is another topic. The blue may contain also UV, which will degrade, well, everything over time.  </p>
<p>But as they are most energetic of the visual spectrum it makes sense we need less sensors to pick them up too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
