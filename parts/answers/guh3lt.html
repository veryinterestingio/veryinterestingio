		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's a link to a <a href="https://www.bio.umass.edu/micro/immunology/poisoniv.htm" target="_blank">University of Massachusetts</a> paper on the subject of poison ivy.</p>
<p>In summary, the body mounts a slow but strong response to the &quot;foreign compounds&quot;, ensuring they get destroyed with the intention of preventing skin infections .</p>
<p>Mosquito bites are a bit different in that you very much do want an active response to something foreign interacting with the blood stream. Sure, the mosquito injects an irritant in the wound site, increasing local blood flow for their own nefarious purposes, but it actually helps prevent infection by concentrating immune cells to the area via inflammation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the urushiol oils of poison ivy, it is a type 4 allergic response. The oil activates the immune cells directly to initiate an allergic response. </p>
<p>It’s not a defect it’s just an unintended effect of a coincidence. </p>
<p>You can stick a tennis ball in the exhaust pipe on a car. No one would argue that it’s a defect in the design of the pipe, just a coincidence that it’s the same size and that someone would actually try it. Same thing with ivy oil. The molecule fits on and activated immune receptors. Quite a coincidence. This sort of thing is why a lot of medicines are discovered by studying plant molecules.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The oils in poison ivy (called urushiols) bind &amp; change receptors on your skin that trick the immune system into thinking those skin cells are foreign. The body then sends its killer immune cells (T cells) to destroy what it thinks are foreign cells. In this way, the oils themselves do not do anything damaging to your skin cells but rather it simply triggers our immune system to do the work.</p>
<p>In that way, you’re right in that the immune response to poison ivy is maladaptive. But it’s not so much a defect in our immune system, more that we just haven’t evolved enough to recognize that urushiol-bound cells are normal self cells. It’s really just an overreaction in our body based on a system that is usually pretty efficient at recognizing infected/damaged cells.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Poison ivy responses aren't really an immune response in the classical sense.  Poison ivy has a chemical, urushiol, that attaches to your own proteins and triggers an immune response to yourself!  Its a pure T cell mediated, Type-4 reaction.<br />
If you wash it off before it gets through the outer layer of the skin you're fine, but if you don't use soap and water pretty quickly that's what happens.  </p>
<p>So the reaction isn't 'necessary' because its just a direct T cell response to the chemical bound to your own cell proteins.  </p>
<p>Mosquito reactions are usually an Arthus  reaction, a Type-3 hypersensitivity caused by immune complexes, usually related to too many antibodies meeting too many antigens.  So its an over-tuned reaction to a foreign protein.  Much more needed than the poison ivy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
