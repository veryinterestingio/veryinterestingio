		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our brains are hardwired for survival, yet we’re living in an environment where survival is almost guaranteed. In the short amount of time that humans have gone from having to struggle for survival to being almost guaranteed survival, our brains/bodies have not had time to adapt to this environment. This is bound to create some unnecessary or problematic behaviors.</p>
<p>Because our brains are hardwired for survival, we tend to want to preserve as much energy as possible and eat foods that will give us a lot of calories to feed our body’s energy stores. </p>
<p>Exercise burns calories, removing energy from our bodies. Our brain doesn’t like that because our brain is adapted for an environment where less energy means less chance of survival. Even though we know that the grocery store not that far away, the primitive survival portions of our brains dont think of it like that</p>
<p>It’s the same reason why so many people overeat and eat sugary, fatty foods even though that makes them feel worse in the long run. Sugary and fatty foods are the easiest sources of calories. And again, even though we know that these sugars and fats are bad for us, the primitive survival parts of our brain are only thinking about trying to consume and preserve energy.</p>
<p>Edit- as someone pointed out, fats are not all bad for you. There are healthy fats and in fact, fats are actually necessary for a well rounded diet. The reason I mentioned fatty foods as bad is that its so easy to overeat on them. Think about foods like pizza, burgers, bacon, etc. They may be low in sugar but they are still not good for us in excess. And it’s very easy to eat them in excess compared to say, chicken breast or brussel sprouts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<a href="https://podcastaddict.com/episode/120729261" target="_blank">https://podcastaddict.com/episode/120729261</a></p>
<p>This podcast covered a lot regarding my problem of procrastination. I remember reading somewhere that it takes us 4 seconds to talk ourselves out of something that we know we should/must do but end up doing. How action within that time frame is important to bang out tasks and finishing. Making that a habit creates new nueral pathways. I'm no expert, just trying to regurgitate what little retained info I've heard/read.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about anyone else's mind, but mine is pretty short sighted: yes exercise makes you feel good, happy bodies and mind, healthier and longer life... But before you reach that state, there is a lot of pain, and sweating and effort.</p>
<p>It's like the kids with the marshmallow test: medium to long term benefits might be great, but short term is no fun.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The activity usually results in negative feelings, and sore muscles, that painfully remind you for two days why you shouldn't do that again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
