		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In an ideal situation, where the Earth was a perfect sphere with uniform density, this is one of those beautiful problems that starts super complicated (undergraduate physics students everywhere will shudder when I mention the <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Mechanics/sphshell2.html" target="_blank">shell theorem</a>) and yet comes out with a fantastically simple answer: As you tunnel towards the center, gravitational acceleration (<em>g</em>) decreases linearly towards the center of the planet (full derivation in <a href="http://astrowww.phys.uvic.ca/~tatum/celmechs/celm5.pdf" target="_blank">this PDF</a>). So if you dug 1% of the way to the center of such a planet, <em>g</em> would decrease 1%; if you dug halfway to the center, <em>g</em> would be half, etc.</p>
<p>Sadly for us purists, our real earth is more complicated. It turns out <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/RadialDensityPREM.jpg" target="_blank">Earth's core is far denser than the mantle and crust</a>. It is not only under tremendous pressure, it has a lot more iron, nickel, and other dense elements than the outer layers of the Earth. Because of this, it turns out that if you had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Core" target="_blank">some kind of super-resilient machine</a> that could tunnel to the center of the Earth, you would measure gravitational acceleration to be <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/EarthGravityPREM.svg/1024px-EarthGravityPREM.svg.png" target="_blank">this complicated, ugly curve</a> (the dark blue one labeled &quot;PREM&quot;). Gravity would stay roughly the same through the crust and upper mantle, then towards the bottom of the lower mantle <em>g</em> would actually <em>increase</em>; reaching a maximum of about 10% higher than it is on the surface (~11 m/s^(2)). Then once you entered the Earth's core, <em>g</em> would decrease rapidly, eventually reaching zero at the center of the Earth.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr: If you could dig all the way to the center of the Earth, <a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/18446/how-does-gravity-work-underground" target="_blank">gravitational acceleration would stay roughly the same, then go up at the bottom of the mantle layer, then go down to zero at the center.</a></strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Historical note: in 1826, 1828 and 1854, George Biddell Airy (who would be named Astronomer Royal of the UK in 1835) and collaborators made repeated attempts to estimate the density of the Earth by timing the period of a pendulum in a mine, both at the top and at a station about 1,200 feet deep.  His earlier attempts were unfruitful but the 1854 reprise was most advantaged by newly developed communication devices that worked on galvanic principles.  (That's what we today would call &quot;electricity.&quot;)</p>
<p>It's fun to read <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/108589?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents" target="_blank">the paper</a> if you're a clock nerd (&quot;Oooh, they used an Earnshaw clock!&quot;), though it gets complicated because he has to consider the differences in temperature and atmospheric pressure at the top and in the depth station.  On p. 330 we get this result:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gravity below is greater than Gravity above by 1/19286 part, with an uncertainty of 1/270 part of the excess.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think about it like this. Gravity doesn't pull from the center of some celestial being (like the Earth). It pulls from every single particle of that celestial being. Literally every single atom in the universe has a gravitational pull -- it's just so utterly microscopic that you don't notice it until a lot of those gravitational pulls add up together.</p>
<p>When you're on the surface of the Earth, or far away from the Earth, it's convenient to identify the center as where gravity is attracting you too. But in the messy reality, it's attracting from every single atom that makes up what we call Earth.</p>
<p>So as you move towards the center of Earth... the center would still be pulling on you, but so would all the other atoms. Which are now pulling you <em>away</em> from the center.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><em>Less</em> ... until there's none at the centre. It's an extremely convenient property of conservative fields that the vector sum of the field <em>inside a spherical shell</em> of the field's 'charge' (in this case <em>mass</em>) is identically zero ... so that the field at some point inside the Earth is exactly that which would be at the surface of a spherically symmetric body consisting of none-other than the matter <em>interior to</em> that point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The gravity would be less.</p>
<p>Actually the only mass 'pulling you in', is the mass enclosed in a sphere centred on the centre of the earth, with your distance to it as its radius. This you can almost intuitively picture as follows:</p>
<p>One way to think about it is to imagine the Earth like an onion, and say you are one shell in. The part of the layer towards the outside of the sphere actually cancels against the further removed part of the layer, that would pull you in. This is because gravity pulls as Force ~ mass/distance^2. </p>
<p>If you imagine a small piece of the layer towards the outside of the sphere, which is essentially &quot;pulling you out&quot; of the sphere. This layer is close to you, but only has a small mass. On the opposite side of the sphere is a counter-weight of an equal 'angular size' as the part towards the outside. This is further away, but has more mass. The mass of each part is equal to the area (or angle squared) it covers. The further away, the bigger the angle, and with it, the mass and force run up by the squared power of the radius. Similarly, the further away, the bigger the radius, reducing the force by squared the squared root of the distance, cancelling the effect.</p>
<p>BONUS: It can be shown that any straight tunnel bored through any rotationally-symmetrical sphere will have a constant free-fall time.
Dig a tunnel from your place to China and jump through it, and you'll be there in ~20 minutes.
Dig a tunnel to Nebraska, ~20 minutes. Two houses next door: ~20 minutes!
Ahhh Physics :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
