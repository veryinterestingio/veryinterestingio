		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Extremely low body fat is not healthy because it causes undue stress on your body and can lead to vitamin deficiencies, hormonal imbalances, and a stressful lifestyle due to constantly being food deprived.  </p>
<p>That being said, having strong muscles and a healthy metabolism is absolutely healthy. Leaner people have better insulin sensitivity (aka lower risk of diabetes), lower blood pressure (aka lower risk of heart problems) and a well moderated hormonal profile (better sleep, better mood, higher energy levels, less risk of low testosterone which has been associated with all sorts of health problems). Being strong and physically capable is incredibly important to your health. You can have visible abs and a good physical appearance as a male even at 12-15% body fat. Will you look like a bodybuilder? No. Will you look good in and out of your clothes? Yes.  Same goes for women who are around the 20% range.</p>
<p>The key is focusing on an active healthy lifestyle which incorporates all modalities of fitness (cardio and strength training) and wellness (proper diet, low stress, good sleep habits, etc). Fitness models are extremes, it is really hard to look like them, which is why their appearances are en vogue. They look different from the average person and it takes a lot of work to maintain an appearance like theirs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

I'm not sure that extreme physical fitness is dangerous in itself, but people certainly do unhealthy things trying to get there. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fitness models are not that lean like on magazines all the time. They schedule photo shoots around (<del>bodybuilding</del> fitness show) competition time when they're at their leanest, which a few weeks at most (plus they are pumped up, oiled up, with good lighting during the shoot). After competitions they'll eat up and gain some fat back. They are definitely leaner than average people at all time though.</p>
<p>Many studies in small mammals show that eating less tend to lead to longer life span. Since eating less leads to being lean, and if you equate longer life span to be the same as being healthier, and if these studies apply to human, than one could assume that being lean is healthier.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the flaw with this question is that it's too broad. The range of what's considered healthy and normal not only varies from person to person, but is usually a wider range than people think. Having relatively little body fat compared to muscle can still be perfectly within the healthy range, or it could not be. Just letting yourself go and having whatever weight your everyday lifestyle gives you can be healthy, or it could also not be. It depends on the person, it depends on the lifestyle, it depends on the expert's opinion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
