		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Quick (Ramen) answer:</p>
<p>Instant ramen is already boiled, and then they deep fry it so it's crunchy like potato chips and you just need to get it soggy again. </p>
<p>Regular pasta needs to get soggy all the way through, and then heat it up enough that the starch soaks the water back up and makes it into a pasta texture. </p>
<hr />
<p>Food science (Pasta) answer:</p>
<p>Think of the starch in pasta like a heat activated sponge, so it's tiny and crunchy when it's cold, and won't expand even if it gets wet, but then when you get it hot it spreads out like a sponge and can soak things up and it's soft. Just heating it up won't expand it though, if you just heated up you just scorch the little pellet rather than expanding it because life likes to make things hard for you. </p>
<p>The sponges in the ramen have already been expanded, they're just dry right right now. The sponges in the pasta still need to get hot with access to water for a while before they can soak stuff up.</p>
<p>As was pointed out by somebody in the comments, you can actually soak uncooked pasta to rehydrate it, it just takes forever, and it still won't really be tasty unless you bring it up to a boiling temperature to activate the starches. This does allow for cooking really quick batches of pasta though, and it plays into why fresh pasta cooks so much faster than dried.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Instant ramen is already fully cooked. You're basicly just hydrating it and warming it up. Many ramen noodles are deep fried and then dried, although some are not dried and are measly cooked in hot water before being dried out. </p>
<p>Spaghetti and such is raw dried pasta. The flour in it is still raw and has never been cooked. You need to cook it longer not only to hydrate it, but to cook it so the starches and such break down and come together like they should for pasta, so it doesn't taste raw and starchy. </p>
<p>You can tell the difference, you can eat a peice of dry ramen and it's almost like a chip; crunchy, but it breaks down easily. A raw spaghetti noodle is harder, and eating it raw it stays hard because it was never cooked.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cooking pasta involves two processes that can be separated:</p>
<ol>
<li>hydration of the noodle</li>
<li>cooking the noodle</li>
</ol>
<p>Instant ramen noodles are cooked in hot water and then de-hydrated by frying, resulting in a porous low density dry noodle that aggressively absorbs water. The frying oil is specifically set at a temperature hot enough to boil off the water but not hot enough to brown the noodles. Basically, the noodles are fried like chips to dry them out. Dried pasta is dried without cooking it, resulting in a dense dry noodle which is slow to hydrate.</p>
<p>When you add hot water to instant ramen, you're only re-hydrating them and warming them up; all the starch and protein in them has already been cooked at the factory.</p>
<p>Fresh ramen (before it is cooked and fried) is more comparable to fresh pasta; since it has a good deal of moisture in it, the cooking process doesn't need to hydrate the noodle as much, so fresh noodles cook in far less time. Most of what is going on is just cooking the starch and proteins in the noodle. However, if you cook a pasta noodle and then fry it until dry, I would expect it to also be porous, because the cooking process causes the starch to expand and change its structure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Instant ramen are fried in oil, so they're partially cooked already. Starch is set for a good part, but what isn't &quot;done&quot; has the oil displaced by water for faster absorption and cooking. Ramen is also a higher protein flour base, which means less starch needs swelling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
