<p>TLDR: Lapse rate, or change in temperature with height, plays a role in whether you get thunderstorms or less dramatic rain.</p>
<p>Full:</p>
<p>This has to do with what kind of storm you’re dealing with that’s causing the rain.</p>
<p>When it’s warm on the ground, and very cold several kilometers or miles up, then the atmosphere is considered “unstable” due to the hot, less dense air rising very easily. It’s kinda like when air from a kettle keeps going up, since it’s hotter and thus less dense than the air around it.</p>
<p>When this happens, air can rise very quickly, and when it rises, it cools, eventually so much that it can’t hold all of the moisture it’s carrying, so some of the water vapor condenses into liquid water droplets, forming rain when they get big enough. When it’s unstable enough (along with a lot of other factors that would take a while to explain to a five year old), this can happen QUICKLY and INTENSELY, forming a strong “updraft,” for air going up and condensing quickly, leading to a sudden, intense, often short-lived thunderstorm.</p>
<p>Eventually, often within minutes, the updraft is overwhelmed by the massive amount of water falling back into it, ending a storm with a massive downpour over a small spot.</p>
<p>On other days, when it’s only a bit warmer at the ground than it is at higher heights, the atmosphere is considered “stable,” and rising motion won’t happen on its own unless something forces air to rise. Fronts and mountains are common ways to get air to rise through a stable layer and still cool down enough to cause condensation and rain. </p>
<p>In s stable layer, air will not rise on its own, so the rain tends to happen much more slowly, hence there being many rainy days where a front moves through a whole country/region and brings moderate rain all day over hundreds of miles/kilometers.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's 2 basic types of precip, stratiform and cumuliform. Stratus rain clouds are like a blanket, a layer of moisture that produces widespread, steady (but usually light) rain. The other type is cumuliform, this type of cloud formation consists of smaller clouds, but many of them. This is essentially due to a more unstable atmosphere causing heavier rain but since there are multiple small clouds, it stops and starts instead of being continuous.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
