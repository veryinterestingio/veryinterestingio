		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, actually; but the reasons are merely historical now.</p>
<p>As you might know, there are several <em>quantum numbers</em> that identify where an electron &quot;is,&quot; or what shell it fits into. One of those numbers is the <em>angular momentum number</em> ℓ, and it's this number we're interested in.</p>
<p>In the early days of spectroscopy, scientists noted that some series of spectral lines of alkali metals -- those corresponding to ℓ-values of zero through three -- appeared to be <strong>s</strong>harp, <strong>p</strong>rincipal in nature, <strong>d</strong>iffuse in nature, and <strong>f</strong>undamentally related to hydrogen lines, in order.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other commenter is right, but the reason it's called a, p, d, and f are short for sharp, principal, diffuse, and fundamental. You can remember the first two by their shapes, s groups electrons follow a spherical orbit, while p group electrons are polar(they go to one side, then the opposite). D orbitals are mostly planar(they occupy a flat area) which is why they are diffuse, and f orbitals are fundamental in that they are found pretty equally in all 8 directions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It was a revelation when I realized that the strange shape of the spd and f orbitals matches the shapes of spherical harmonic functions. It's the same as a Taylor series describing a wave but the orbitals are 3d.</p>
<p>That's when I realized that the shape isn't what the electron looks like, it's the probability of the electron at each point in space around the protons in the center.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<blockquote>
<p>The orbital names s, p, d, and f stand for names given to groups of lines originally noted in the spectra of the alkali metals. These line groups are called sharp, principal, diffuse, and fundamental.</p>
