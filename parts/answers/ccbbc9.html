<p>They decreased the funding for government research &amp; development that helped the US be a tech leader in the 50s and 60s while cutting their own taxes and driving up the national debt.</p>
<p>They focused on making themselves as wealthy as possible at the cost of the environment while pushing the debt and cleanup costs to the next generation. Privatized profits and socialized debt.  </p>
<p>Edit: I want to add that this is not a problem of the past. The Trump tax cuts tripled the deficit, adding trillions to the national debt while almost all of the benefits are going to the already wealthy boomers that are now in their 60s, 70s, and 80s.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;boomers&quot; literally could not fuck up the economy during their careers if they tried.  </p>
<p>Most of the Eurozone was bombed to rubble in the back to back World Wars that killed or maimed just about every man and woman capable of holding a skilled trade.  Any survivors with college training or skills worth having dipped out to America.  </p>
<p>Nearly every factory was obliterated.  Those factories make parts for other factories, so rebuilding gets harder.  Plus, anyone who knows how to build factories is either (effectively) dead, very busy, or has dipped out to America because shit sucks in Europe.  </p>
<p>There's no real financing in Europe either.  Anyone that can cut loans likely did for the war effort and is crippled by interest payments on their loans to US companies, slowing growth because businesses can't get a loan for their new factory.  </p>
<p>That means from around 1945 through 1970 the United States was the only nation with a fully functioning economy with fully operational and well staffed factories stocked with engineers, scientists and skilled tradesmen.  Plus, nearly every country owed us a TON of money.  </p>
<p>When the entire world needs everything, and you're the only country that can make anything, literally any economic policy is guaranteed to succeed.  That means a ton of terrible economic policies that were being invented(?) could be proven as &quot;growth models&quot; because literally any model would grow in that environment. </p>
<p>Around 1980, Europe finally had a full stock of 60-somethings employing 40-somethings training 20-somethings in all new modern factories meaning the US had fair competition for the first time ever.  European economic policies had to be tested in a horrible environment, unlike the US policies which were guaranteed to succeed. </p>
<p>With fair competition, the US economy naturally dipped. Boomers couldn't figure out why their shit wasn't selling as much, because they've never seen real competition.  </p>
<p>Now that the internet has made everything effectively equal for all but shipping costs, they <em>really</em> don't know what to do.  </p>
<p>So, in the greatest of human traditions, they blame the younger generation for being &quot;lazy&quot; and &quot;not working as hard&quot;, while neglecting how easy their parents had made their lives by bombing the competition out of history.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because they all had lead poisoning. </p>
<p>Okay, I was joking, but in all seriousness most of the bad policy decisions were made by boomers. It goes as far back as the oil crisis in the 70s. Although, really, it was the generation before the boomers that started doing stupid things but they brought it to a new level. Trickle down economics somehow made sense to them. After WWII we didn't have deficits until Reagan. They invented the monstrously terrible 401(K), stopped funding universities at a reasonable rate, allowed medical prices to go out of control when everyone else was busy fixing that problem for their citizens, they bashed and broke up unions (pushing wages down for everyone), they never made proper investments in public transportation like every other post WWII major country, they invaded countries over lies (right, Bush was a boomer), and they continually make life easier for the rich than the middle class. Through tax cuts, tax sheltering. Only a boomer would have come up with 'death tax' to describe an 'inheritance tax'. The sad part is everyone was convinced. They were convinced <em>unions</em> were the problem, they were convinced that health care <em>had to be expensive,</em> they were convinced that <em>imports were the problem,</em> they were convinced that <em>immigrants were the problem</em>. If we learn anything it is that the when the American public is given an 'enemy', many of us fall for it without every looking at it critically.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Boomers aren't entirely to blame. They just added more fuel to the fire. There've always been greedy assholes who have no empathy and put their own self-interests ahead of everyone else's.</p>
<p>Boomers are the ones in charge of the government now, and they have seriously unbalanced the US economy by allowing a small handful of people/companies to scoop up massive market share and wealth. They've rose to power by promising to lower taxes and to repeal regulations. This eventually lead to the <strong>Great Recession</strong> and the further ballooning of the US debt. With lower taxes, the government receives less money and its debt continues to grow.</p>
<p>Boomers love to scold the younger generations about not going into debt, yet when they run the country, they allow the debt to go out of control. Meanwhile, a handful of people in the US hold more than 40% of its wealth, and a lot of these people pay very little in taxes. Last time this happened, we got the <strong>Great Depression</strong>.</p>
