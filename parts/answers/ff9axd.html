		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From my understanding, when you make a payment there's two steps that actually occur.  First there's authorization which is when the bank says &quot;right, there's a payment happening, so I'm setting aside the money to be sent&quot; and then there's the transfer,  when that money is sent.  Transfer can happen the same day, sometimes it takes a few days, during which the money hasn't showed up in the store's account yet.   Refunds are the same way, but going from the store's account to yours.  The store's bank authorizes the payment and then the transfer step takes a bit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;They&quot; don't take your funds instantly.  The bank debits the money from your account, but Amazon doesn't get it right away.  They have to wait a day or two for the bank to transfer the money over and then maybe another day until it hits their books.  Then the same thing happens again, Amazon has to approve the refund, then their bank sends the money to your bank so they can credit your account.  And if there is a screw-up or a security hold, it can take longer.</p>
<p>It is entirely possible Amazon was telling the truth, they issued the refund and now it was in the banks' hands.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most people have alluded to this already but I'll chip in as well. When you pay for something on a debit card the money doesn't go anywhere immediately. It gets ringed fenced by your bank as a likely payment. Your balance decreases but the recipient does not have your money. I can't stress this to anyone calling up customer service to complain that they get your money straight away but it takes days to refund. The payment is eventually released to the recipient but depending on where you are and the banking system this can take about 5 days. Refunding can take up to 10 days because the process has to wait for the money to reach the recipient (5 days) and then the process happens in reverse, ring fenced again by the recipients bank before landing back in your account. Often this process is much quicker but can take the full 10 days, especially if your payment was over a weekend or holiday period. One piece of advice (might be UK specific). If you buy something in a shop and say a double payment is accidentally taken (it happens due to signal drop outs etc) then do not ask for the refund at the store as you will be waiting awhile. Instead contact the companies customer service as they can often next day payment you the money (account to account). Likewise sometimes double payments are recognised by the banking systems and most retailers can check whether these were authorised and more often than not the double payment will be ring fenced and just automatically flow back to your account in a day, so again don't call up a customer service yelling that we've stolen your money and won't give it back because it's rarely the case. Also bonus tip. Cash machines often work the same way. You may try and withdraw money only for the machine to be out of cash. However sometimes the balance may deduct on your account temporarily as it ring fenced the money expecting a withdrawal. This will 99% of the time correct itself within a few hours or a day. Again do not go whining to the poor business that houses the cash machine (unless it's actually the bank) as they cannot do anything (maybe UK specific).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How Credit Cards Work. </p>
<p>(This got longer than I intended, so TL:DR: Banks want it that way because they make money off the delay)</p>
<p>When you make a purchase, the merchant talks to the credit card processor, who talks to your bank and asks if you have the money available. If the card doesn't have any wonkiness (No money, stolen, something strange and they want you to call) the bank puts that amount of money on hold and gives an authorization code to the processor who sends it to the merchant's terminal. At that point, the transaction is in the batch. The money is not removed from your account, just on hold. </p>
<p>(Sidenote: Some banks add 20% to transaction authorizations commonly in restaurants based on the SIC (Standard Industrial Classification) code, which tells them 'this is a restaurant', or 'this is a porn store' or whatever) to allow for the tip to be adjusted later. It's not the restaurant overcharging you, it's just the authorization. Similarly, most gas pumps will run a 1$ authorization to check to see if it's a valid card, since it doesn't know how much you're going to pump.) </p>
<p>When the merchant closes for the night, the batch is sent to the processor who deals with the banks to capture the money. The merchant <em>should</em> close the batch every day, but the authorizations are good for 7 days, at which point the money will be released, but the authorization will still in theory be usable for 30. If the merchant doesn't close their batch that night, the authorization and the associated money are on hold until it is closed. If the merchant has a hardware failure (some idiot spills something on their terminal, lightning strike, etc) and the terminal is not able to close the batch, the processor has the authorizations and can do what (my company calls) a rekey, where we run the transactions from our end, using the existing codes if they're valid, or running new transactions if they've expired. That can make the payments run later than you would expect. </p>
<p>Now, to refunds: If a merchant does a refund, it basically runs a transaction for negative however much the refund is. That goes into the batch as usual. When the batch is closed, the processor passes the transaction to the bank. At that point, the merchant's account is debited, they've paid the money back. The processor only moves money from where it is to where it needs to be. </p>
<p>The banks are holding the refunds. </p>
<p>The reason? Any question that begins 'why do they' or 'why don't they' is always answered by 'money'. That refund sits on hold and generates interest for the bank. It may only be a few fractions of a cent, but it adds up when you have a <em>lot</em> of transactions. There's also the possibility it was done in error (I once had to rekey 30 transactions where someone had gotten a new terminal, and on the old one, '1' was 'sale'. On the new one, the programmers had started counting from 0, so 1 was 'refund', and 0 was sale, and it was some hours before anybody there noticed the 'refund' on the receipt. They had to change the programming to add a password for the refund, because it happened several times) and the money would need to be returned. </p>
<p>For online things taking two weeks? I dunno, but I suspect 'the same, but more'. A little processing time, probably some investigation into is it a legit refund, but that's my guess. </p>
<p>Debit cards with credit card logos work kind of the same way, but the money is removed from the account immediately, instead of just being put on hold. The merchant doesn't get it any faster, it's just taken away sooner. </p>
<p>Source: I work for a credit card processing company.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>tl;dr - it takes time because they want to avoid the risk of refunding money they never had, and they can make money by holding yours, even for a few hours.</p>
<p>Long story:
A few things happening here: when you pay with a card - doesn’t matter if it’s in person swipe, chip, etc. or online - the store’s system talks to the bank (or credit card) that issued the card via a Payment Gateway. </p>
<p>The store first asks the bank if you have the amount being charged. This is called an Authorization. If the bank says “yes” then the transaction is approved and move on. The Payment Gateway typically charges the store a fee - usually between $.0001 and $.05 for each Authorization request.</p>
<p>When a request is authorized it will show up on your account as “Pending”.</p>
<p>Then at some point in the future the store starts a process called a Capture. This is when the store actually requests a transfer of the money from the bank. This might be milliseconds later, it might be at the end of the day, or whenever the store decides to do it. Typically they do the requests in what’s called a Batch (a bunch of transactions at once). The store pays a fee for the Capture which is typically a % of the total amount, and sometimes another fee to process the Batch. Some stores wait to process a bunch of transactions at once because it saves them money.</p>
<p>Once the Capture happens the money is moved from the bank to the store and it shows up on your account as a charge. </p>
<p>Refunds work basically the same way, but the other way around. When you request a refund from the store the first thing they have to do is check if they actually have the money. They have to check if/when the transaction was approved, if/when the batch with your transaction in it processed, and if/when the transfer happened. </p>
<p>They don’t want to take the risk of refunding money they don’t have, so they will typically wait until the money makes it into their account to start the refund process.</p>
<p>If your transaction has been Authorized but not Batched, they might be able to remove it from the Batch before it processes, which is why you sometimes see “Pending” charges just disappear. </p>
<p>If your transaction has been Batched then they wait until the money arrives before starting the process to send it back to you. </p>
<p>There is zero incentive for banks to make this process faster. It would cost them money to pay people to build and test and train everyone in the system, and they don’t spend money on things that don’t make money. It’s a zero ROI (return on investment). </p>
<p>Besides, the banks actually make money on “the float” - interest on someone else’s money they hold for any period of time. They can hold your $29 for a day and maybe earn $0.005. That doesn’t sound like much until you add it to everyone else’s $29 and now they’re earning hundreds of thousands overnight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
