		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your corneas do actually freeze when swimming in ice water. Wim Hof the ice man swam like 25 meters under the ice and his story was scary because he couldn't see shit anymore because his corneas froze.</p>
<p>EDIT: <a href="https://youtu.be/DpeM4FNXRsE" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/DpeM4FNXRsE</a></p>
<p>Here he is, this is his Guinness world records attempt and he wears goggles on this video because of well, the Frozen corneas thing that happened to him before.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our eyes are for the most part made of water. Specific heat, which is a measure of how much energy it takes to warm a substance up, is really really high for water compared to a lot of other substances including air. <em>That means a lot of energy needs to be transferred from our eyes to the surrounding air to make our eyes cool down</em>. </p>
<p>Couple that with the fact that air is a poor conductor of heat, especially compared to water (which basically the rest of our body is made from too). <em>That means energy from our body is moving into our eyes much faster than energy is moving from our eyes to the surrounding air</em>. </p>
<p>Those two reasons together are why our eyes don't freeze in cold weather.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Eyes freezing open is a thing, it can happen, but it takes time because of all the blinking and blood vessels. Luckily your entire eyeball won't freeze, because of the blood, just the tear ducts and corneas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure your question was answered, because you basically asked &quot;Why they don't FEEL cold vs. Why don't the FREEZE?&quot;</p>
<p>Several people have responded as to why they don't freeze, but the reason they don't feel cold, as far as I understand it, is our brain expects certain heat loss at various parts of our bodies &amp; becomes used to it. We feel hot or cold when the heat escaping said part of our body doesn't meet the expectation our brain has &amp; signals are triggered.</p>
<p>Our brain expects a certain amount of heat loss through our eyes &amp; when it takes into account the heat loss it is experiencing in other parts of our bodies in comparison it doesn't freak out &amp; signal the feeling of cold.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
