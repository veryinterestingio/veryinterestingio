		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most people working for game studios are really passionate about what they do - you kind of have to be, for the long hours and low pay (compared to what you could earn in other software industries) - and they don't want to harm their product by leaking.  There's also the threat of being fired or sued if the studio figures out who the leaker was.</p>
<p>Many times, especially secret assets and plans are also individually distinguished, so they would be able to tell who leaked it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone in the industry, when working on a project that is in stealth there is really no desire to leak anything. Legally you are under NDA so there is a lawsuit risk, but the real reason is why would you spill confidential information to begin with?   </p>
<p>You would not gain anything by leaking, you'd just be shitting on your colleagues, especially the ones in the marketing department. Most of the time when an NDA is breached it is a journalist who got their dates wrong and published an article early or an employee updating their portfolio (and in both cases they will know they screwed up within minutes of doing so). And there is a difference between &quot;keeping a secret&quot; and &quot;keeping it confidential&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
