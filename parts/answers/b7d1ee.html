		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you define the current species as having emerged 50,000 years ago, then there have been about 100 billion people who have been born.
Since there are 7-8 billion people alive now, that means that there are about 8% of all people who have ever lived are alive now. Which quite frankly is a huge proportion.</p>
<p>This data doesnt count stillbirths. Only live births.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can i ask 2 variants of this question:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How far back do.we.have to go to have had 7-8bn people alive (that are dead now)?</p>
</li>
<li>If we express lives in number of years lived, noting lives 50,000 teras ago were much shorter than our expected lives now, how does the 8% (given in the current top response) compare?</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, there are a range of different estimates, but all the well researched ones come to 'more have died already than are alive right now'. Even ones based on biblical time frames instead of scientifically determined timelines come to similar conclusions. The other poster gives 100 billion, but estimates range +/-50ish billion from there, I believe the religious based ones are around 36 billion iirc from last time i looked this up a month or so ago.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
