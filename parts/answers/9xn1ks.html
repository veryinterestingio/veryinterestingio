		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is not possible to precisely collect X protons under conditions that it could be used for a standard of mass. You could try for example saying that a kilogram is the mass of (0.1 m)^3 of water, but then you'd have to control precisely for temperature, pressure, isotopic composition, etc in a way that is precise to 10 parts per billion. The new Planck's constant definition is sufficiently precise.</p>
<p>There was an attempt to do as you suggest, and make it based on the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/si-redefinition/kilogram-silicon-spheres-and-international-avogadro-project" target="_blank">number of atoms in a very pristine sphere</a>, but it wasn't as practical as the Planck's constant way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That was - kind of - the alternative approach, where the kilogram was going to be defined via the Avogardo costant and the mass of a set number of silicon atoms. In practice it was shown that counting atoms accurately is not that easy, and finally the Kibble balance was chosen. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The mass per proton changes depending on how many of them you have together due to binding energy. As a result 2 protons individually have more slightly mass than if they were bound together. This makes them very bad for using as a metric since the mass of the proton is not a constant but varies depending on it's interactions with other particles. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The new definition, based on Planck's constant, is actually <em>more</em> elegant than the previous definition (which actually was similar to what you are describing, a relationship between subatomic particles and weight) because it is defined with a few of the known constants in the universe.</p>
<p>Many measurements and observations are relative. They depend on factors like where the object is that you are measuring, or from what direction or speed the object is being observed. Gravity is like that, so is speed. Things that <em>aren't</em> like that are the speed of light and the charge of an electron. So this means a kilogram, as newly defined, more precise than ever before and shouldn't change anywhere in the universe. </p>
<p>For lots of everyday observations, nothing will change, but for very precise calculations, like orbits of stellar bodies and weights of tiny doses of medication, it will help us make better predictions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
