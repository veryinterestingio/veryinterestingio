<p>Biologist here. Head tilting allows an animal to gain information about the vertical placement of the sound (how far up/down it is, relative to the axis of the skull). It is assumed that canids do head-tilting to try to localize a sound better. This is backed up by the fact that canids do a lot of head-tilting when hunting small prey that are hidden behind grass or snow.</p>
<p>Generally - as bilaterally symmetrical animals, mammals already get pretty good information on left-right placement of a sound, due to the fact that we have an ear on the left and a different ear on the right - that means we can get left/right info by things like, time of arrival of the sound at each ear, &amp; loudness of the sound in each ear. But up/down information (how high or low the sound source is) for a sound that is coming from directly in front can be difficult to figure out. This is a challenge for a predator that is typically approaching prey that are right in front. The head tilt solves this problem by offsetting the two ears vertically so that sounds from lower down will hit the lower ear first, and will also be ever-so-slightly louder in the lower ear, and vice versa for sounds comign from higher up.</p>
<p>Aerial predators that routinely hunt by sound, like owls, actually have a &quot;head tilt&quot; permanently built in; that is, their skulls are asymmetrical that one ear is a little higher than the other (like this; the feathers surrouding the ears are also asymmetrical); thus they get good information on sound localization immediately, without having to do the head-tilt behavior.</p>
<p>With domestic dogs looking at a human, typically they already know the sound is coming from the human; they seem to just instinctively add the head tilt when hearing a puzzling sound, even if they're pretty sure where it's coming from. It's during hunting that the head tilt really pays off. As I mentioned above, a lot of canids will use this behavior when looking down at a grassy or snowy surface and trying to figure out precisely how far away a prey noise is coming from. (when looking down at a flat surface, &quot;up/down&quot; relative to the axis of the skull = information on how near/far the prey is). See here for this behavior in action by a red fox trying to hunt small prey that is hidden under snow.</p>
<p>BTW primates, which evolved to function in a 3D arboreal environment, have particularly good sound localization, thought to be a feature of the shape of the pinnae (external ear flaps) of the primate ear. Humans, being primates, have quite good sound localization compared to other mammals (one recent review calls our sound localization &quot;remarkable&quot;) - it's one of the few areas where our senses are actually better than average (the other being color vision, another area where primates shine). (Tip for birdwatchers who can't find a bird in your binoculars: if the bird is making any kind of noise, close your eyes and center your head [with binos up] so that the sound seems to be coming from dead center in front of your nose. Now open your eyes. 9 times out of 10 your binoculars will now be pointed directly at the bird.) Humans typically can zero in on a sound location to within 1-2 degrees of accuracy. We use a different method than dogs do, though. In humans almost all of our up/down localization is done using tiny changes in how low vs high frequency sounds are bounced around in the external ear; we do not use the head-tilt method. Therefore anything that messes up the shape of your ear will typically mess up your ability to localize sounds in the vertical plane, but not in the horizontal plane.</p>
