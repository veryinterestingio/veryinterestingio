Altogether only about 1 part in 240 million of the Sun's energy is intercepted. The rest escapes into space, whether out of plane of the planets or between them.</p>
<p>If you're interested in the areas swept by all the planets in their entire orbits, which in my opinion isn't really a physically relevant quantity, that's still tiny, hovering for each planet around 10^(-5),^[<a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%282*planet+radius%2Fplanet+semimajor+axis%29*2pi%2F%284pi%29" target="_blank">calculation</a>] Jupiter being highest at 8.986×10^(-5). Sum them all up^* and it's about 3×10^(-4), 1 part in 3328, or .03%.</p>

<p>^(<em>Note: Viewed from the Sun, the orbits of the planets do intersect, and their swept regions of sky overlap, but likely not enough to change the total significantly. The inclinations vary by a handful of degrees, while the planet with the largest apparent size, Jupiter, is only 0.01 degrees wide.) ^[[calculation](<a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%282" target="_blank">https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%282</a></em>planet+radius%2Fplanet+semimajor+axis%29*180%2Fpi)]</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>100% of the energy. Or to be more  precise around <del>99.99999%</del>  <strong>99.964%</strong> of the energy goes outside of our solar system without having a possible path of our planet in its course.</p>
<p>When we're talking about planetary sizes and distances while all orbits are +-3 degrees from Earth orbit (or +-7 if you include Mercury) there is mostly empty space in between the orbits.</p>
<p>The whole orbit takes only 10\^-5 ... 10\^-6 of the sphere. So even if you assume that orbits don't cross and only take the biggest value and multiply it by the number of planets it still gives less of the 10\^-4 of the area covered. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What portion of the solar energy is projected above and below 7° from the ecliptic? Picture a cone of light projected above 7° and below 7° from the plane, intersecting a sphere. You're looking for the ratio of the volume of these two <em>spherical sectors</em> to the volume of the sphere.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_sector" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_sector</a>, the volume of a spherical sector, Vss, can be written as (2 π R³ / 3) (1 - cos φ), where r is the radius of the sphere and φ is half the cone angle. </p>
<p>Since the volume of a sphere is Vs = 4/3 π R³, the ratio of (2*Vss) to Vs is </p>
<p><strong>2 ((2 π R³ / 3) (1 - cos φ))   /  (4/3 π R³)</strong></p>
<p>which reduces to </p>
<p><strong>(1 - cos φ)</strong>.</p>
<p>If the farthest out-of-plane angle is 7°, φ is (90° - 7°) so (1 - cos φ) = ~0.878. </p>
<p><strong>tldr; About 88% of solar energy is projected above and below the orbits of the eight planets.</strong></p>
<p>If my analysis, geometry or math is wrong, please correct me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because of the conservation of energy, you can imagine that the total energy coming out of the sun is the same as the one around a gigantic sphere of radius equivalent to the distance earth-sun. This means that each unit of surface at the distance earth-sun, will intercept a very small fraction of the sun emited energy,  proportional to its distance with respect to the sun. This will be computed as: Energy by unit of surface received at a distance earth - sun=Total energy emited by sun/size of a sphere at distance esrth-sun= ( E<em>(sunemited)<em>4pi</em>R</em>(radius-sun)^2)/(4<em>Pi</em>R<em>(dist-sun-earth)^2). Now, all you gotta do is imagine the size of the plane blocking the sun energy. One could just approximate jupiter as the principal blocking agent and approximate that the plane is equivalent to one ring that is the size of jupiter (at the distance sub-jupiter) so you just would have to replace earth with jupiter in the precedent equation, and multiply it by the size of said ring perpendicular to the sun (2PiR</em>(sun-jup)<em>R_(Jup)). A
Another way would be to compute the energy capted by each planet and substract it from total energy emited by sun. For example, earth intercepts the energy as a perpendicular circle so you could just multiply first equation by Pi</em>R_(esrth)^2. And do it for all planets. Esrth intercepts 1348W/m^2 or 110000 W. Do it for every planet, sum it up and divide by the total energy of the sun = Sigma<em>5000^4=6.25</em>10^6. .
