		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way I've seen it explained, they don't. At least on the Australian version of Masterchef. They walk between work stations, and taste it while in progress, but a lot of the time they've made up their minds beforehand, and the tasting is just for show.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the show. I know for Chopped, the judges are allowed to taste while the contestants are cooking, and immediately after as well. The dishes are kept warm until the on camera tasting which can be 30 minutes later or more.  On Iron Chef, the contestants finish only one of each dish they make during the one hour contest, for the camera. Then they have additional time off camera to finish four more of each plate to have it ready just in time for judges tasting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can confirm the same for the U.K. version of MasterChef. In fact for the first screen test youâ€™re asked to cook the night before, bring it in cold then plate up while explaining the dish, how you cooked it etc directly to camera.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most TV is fake.  The impression of what the show is presenting happened - did not happen.  It is true for virtually all shows.  They make incidents or situations that did not occur to make it look like something did.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
