		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's all just convention, there's no reason behind any of it. </p>
<p>A publisher has that convention and they gotta stick to it, and they need to have a standard, any standard, or else it will be impossible to properly copy edit. If you publish a journal or edited volume and everyone uses random conventions and standards that will be very ugly and distracting.  And if you don't have a convention then in a single article/book how else would you make it consistent without a set of rules. </p>
<p>And it's too late, they won't change their conventions or have a unified convention.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I wish I could remember where I read this, but it was several year ago. Anyway, I read that it was created when moveable type printing presses came into use. The tiny piece of metal that held the period would slip out of place when they moved the press, so they ended up putting the quotation mark after it.  The quotation mark piece was large enough stay in place when printing, and kept the period from moving while they printed.  From there, it became common.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wow, this is funny because I have felt the same way my entire life.  It bugs the crap out of me when the quotation doesn’t really end the sentence, but I still have to put the punctuation inside the quotation marks.  It makes no sense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That rule is purely for looks, it is actually one of the lesser enforced rules in the writing conventions you listed because of this. </p>
<p>The idea is that:</p>
<p>“Hello world.”</p>
<p>“Hello world”. </p>
<p>“Hello world.”.</p>
<p>The first one just looks cleaner... that really is the sole reason this rule exists at all; no fancy typewriter backstory like some conventions have.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
