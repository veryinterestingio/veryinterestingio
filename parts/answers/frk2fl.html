		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is for your protection.</p>
<p>You can be (legally/forcibly) compelled to give your fingerprint.</p>
<p>You cannot (in most states) be compelled to give a piece of information held only in your head.</p>
<p>If you want to protect your privacy, say at a border crossing, you could restart all your electronics.  Even if you are detained and forced to provide biometrics, your devices remain secure.</p>
<p>This is part of the reason that the USA and other governments want encryption “backdoors” to be built into phones.  With strong encryption, guess limits and lengthy PIN, it can be challenging even for states to break into properly secured consumer electronics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

To disconnect the Secure Enclave when you’ve shut it off because of security/encryption.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fingerprints scanners (or even face recognition) on mobile devices and laptops are pretty basic and aren't as secure pins or passwords, they are used for convenience rather than true security.  </p>
<p>You can only enable fingerprint scanning on these devices after entering the more secure password and you are essentially telling the operating system, &quot;I'm okay with using a less secure method to unlock once I've entered my password&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The stuff inside of your phone or computer is locked up. The key to unlock it is the PIN for your phone or the password for your computer. The key is never stored with the phone/computer otherwise you are putting the key with the lock and hackers would be able to find the key if they had your phone.</p>
<p>On startup it requires the key to unlock so it’s asking for PIN/password. After it has the key it can store it securely in memory and use the fingerprint to get the PIN/password. The main takeaway is the key is the PIN/password not the fingerprint. Fingerprint is not always reliable but a password is 100% reliable (either you know it or you don’t). If your fingerprint doesn’t work you can fall back to the PIN/password. </p>
<p>In reality the key to unlock is not actually your password but rather a randomly generated “master password” and your password is used to lock that. That’s why you can change your password without having to re-encrypt all your files.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
