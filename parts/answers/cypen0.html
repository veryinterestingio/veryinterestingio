		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The gold foil is reflective, so most of the suns radiation, is reflected instead of absorbed, which is important because there’s no atmosphere for heat to be conducted/convected away from the spacecraft like there is on earth. </p>
<p>This basically means that spacecraft won’t over heat, and also means the craft doesn’t develop a large temperature gradient, which can be very dangerous. I think the Chinese jade rabbit rover wasn’t adequately covered in parts which lead to its eventual demise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Former cryogenic vessel design engineer here.</p>
<p>A form of this material is also commonly used in cryogenic storage vessels in the vacuum space between the inner and outer vessels. MLI &quot;multi layer insulation&quot; acts to block radiative heat transfer into the inner vessel. Multiple layers of metal with gaps in between will block radiation of various types. I believe in space use, the MLI will also help to protect from gamma radiation or &quot;cosmic rays&quot; but I may be way off on that point. In industrial cryogenic use, the MLI will typically be constucted of very thin aluminum foil or aluminized mylar with a non woven spacer paper between the layers, which sorta looks and feels like toilet paper.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://youtu.be/9fb7CN8nDlw" target="_blank">One of the episodes</a> of the series <em>From the Earth to the Moon</em> (at 0:53) describes exactly this material and its role in the design of the Lunar Excursion Module. </p>
<p>It was mylar film between layers of kapton with an outer layer of nickel foil. It served as thermal insulation to slow heat flow in and out of the spacecraft. The shiny metal foil reflected heat while the gold-colour plastic films provided tear resistance. Overall, it afforded great thermal shielding while being extremely light weight (only 1/8000th of an inch thick).</p>
<p>This material is still around today in the form of the emergency '<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_blanket" target="_blank">space blanket</a>' in everyone's first-aid kit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
