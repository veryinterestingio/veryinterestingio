		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This has to do with industry standards. The RAM slots on PC's are almost always the same size. A 64GB RAM stick is the same size as early 256MB RAM sticks. The size does not really represent the power/storage anymore. It's just a matter of standardization. </p>
<p>Addition: RAM chips in phones are often integrated and can't be swapped. Cell phone RAM is also a lot slower. It consumes less power, which means it doesn't reach the same temperatures as the far more powerful equivalents in desktop computers. In larger chips, it is easier to distribute heat than in smaller chips, so a larger stick is beneficial for desktop RAM. And well... Desktops simply have the room for it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Space absolutely is a premium on mobile phones, so the DRAM has to be made as small as possible - which is expensive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what others have said about existing standards:</p>
<ul>
<li>The RAM stick standard size is based off RAM sticks from well over a decade ago. Desktop RAM sticks have larger contacts than laptop RAM for more stable contacts (see ref pic halfway down on <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/18995/how-can-i-tell-what-ram-will-fit-my-computer" target="_blank">this StackOverflow article</a>). Part of the reason is the NUMBER of contacts. The DDR4 standard, for example, defines a certain number of pins, the data path 'width' per cycle. Fewer pin contacts would require a different standard but ALSO be much harder to reach the same speeds with.</li>
<li>There is the SO-DIMM standard. However, it's not MUCH smaller (about half the length) and requires far more compact traces, which are more failure-prone. It's used heavily in laptops with upgradable RAM, but even this is too big for a lot of devices. In laptops, that stick is laying down - which takes a LOT of valuable motherboard space - while also still adding a good .5&quot; thickness.  Apple is a good example of this - their laptops haven't had upgradable RAM in years, and part of the reason is that they try to minimize thickness (to an unhealthy degree).</li>
<li>We don't use SO-DIMM in desktops because the motherboard space isn't as much of a premium, and because we tend to want to maximize speed instead. RAM can have a number of different compromises, but it can't be fast, cheap AND space efficient. Pick 2. :)</li>
<li>Many laptops (and even some Small-Form Factor desktops) often have RAM chips directly soldiered-on the motherboard to deal with this very issue. However, this has substantial downsides - more custom engineering, higher manufacturing cost, higher repair/replacement costs.</li>
<li>Many phones use higher density modules (RAM chips) to help save space, and package-on-package is being used to save even more. For example, the Samsung Galaxy S9+ has 6GB, and <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Samsung+Galaxy+S9++Teardown/104308" target="_blank">in this teardown on iFixit</a>, it's embedded on the CPU in a second layer. This makes sense - the CPU and GPU are in the single SOC, and they are really the only things that need direct RAM access, so all of those connections skip the 'motherboard' entirely and are just in the SOC package. Meanwhile, if you <a href="https://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/dram/lpddr4x/" target="_blank">look at the part number for that RAM chip on Samsung's site</a>, it's listed as 48Gb (RAM chips, unlike sticks, are listed in Gigabits, not Gigabytes). That's VERY high density. That high density is also VERY expensive. Compare that with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Patriot-Signature-Module-PC4-19200-PSD44G240081/dp/B016A3B09U/" target="_blank">this cheap stick of 4GB DDR4 desktop RAM</a>; it's not worried about space savings (in fact, only half of one side of the PCB is used!), and is instead using 4x 8Gb chips to reach 4GB. Those low density chips are much less expensive, and PCB traces map them to the full DDR4 standard (with the help of a very tiny chip in the middle of the PCB).</li>
</ul>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So TL;DR: The industry never came up with a smaller RAM board standard than DIMM/SO-DIMM because you need a large number of contacts for RAM to be fast. Very high density RAM is MUCH more expensive, and since space is not at a premium and there is the option to put it directly on the motherboard or in a package-on-package solution, there isn't enough demand to justify the work on one.  </p>
<p>Update: Added SO-DIMM to the explanation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For mobile phones, they use very lower powered memory chips, running at a lower clock speed, lower voltage and often lower bus width as well, that is how much data can be transmitted at the same time. This allows them to put the chips into smaller packages without risk of overheating, possibly even stack multiple chips on top of each other into a single package like they do with memory cards.</p>
<p>But the 4 GB modules aren't anywhere near their maximum capacity. You can buy 16, 32, 64 and in the near future even 128 GB modules, which all fit into the same form factor. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've seen 1MB DIMMs that are recognizable as such, I think desktop parts have more to do with a standard form factor than the limits of technology. Whenever you see RAM soldered down, it's smaller because it's designed with that specific device in mind. So I don't think the desktop &quot;needs&quot; the extra space, it was just never worth building a new shape for a RAM interface. A good analogy would be comparing 2.5 inch SATA SSDs to an M.2 SATA SSD. The technology is similar, just a different shape. In some cases, bigger may be better just because it fits where you want it to fit. Space isn't at as much of a premium in a desktop, if it ain't broke don't fix it</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
