		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lakes are inland and usually fresh water, seas are salt water and connected to the ocean. There is a lot of confusion as there are some lakes named sea and vice versa.</p>
<p>While lakes do tend to be much smaller, that is not their defining characteristic.</p>
<p>Edit: removed an inaccurate &quot;usually&quot; before &quot;salt water&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>from what i've gathered there is no definition by size. what defines a lake is a body of water that's surrounded by land on all sides, and has no connection to other bodies of water other than a river. there are no seas, there is the sea. so what constitutes a sea is if it directly connected to the sea or the ocean. so a lake has no upper limit of size, it only stops being a lake when if it connects to the ocean.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>i think it depends on the people naming it? i’ve been to what’s called the Salton Sea in California, but realistically it’s a huge lake. The colorado river overflowed in the early 1900’s into Imperial Valley, and with no drainage system it stayed there till this day, it’s all abandoned now and a scary as hell wasteland (the sand is all fish bones). But it’s called a sea for some reason, pretty interesting place. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
