		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Welcome to the world of linguistics. We've been trying to answer this question for ages, and a lot of people have great thoughts but nobody really has a definite answer. One of the most popular theories currently is that we don't &quot;learn&quot; language like we do math or biology. We &quot;acquire&quot; it through use. Some people think we are wired to do this with a special device, others think our brains just naturally work that way, but the point is that the more you expose yourself to language, the more you are able to tell what is grammatically &quot;correct.&quot;</p>
<p>Another thing that helps is that the &quot;variety,&quot; or &quot;dialect&quot; of English (I assume you were learning English, but this is true for many languages) that is taught in schools is the same (or very similar) to the one used in writing, so if you read a lot, you'll probably &quot;acquire&quot; the &quot;correct&quot; grammar naturally and intuitively.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Children acquire language, it's a passive thing, no learning required. Your brain is wired for grammar (not the type you learn in books) and 'learns' all the rules of your mother tongue(s).</p>
<p>When linguists talk about the rules of English, they are not talking about the same rules an English teacher would be talking about.</p>
<p>Have you ever heard a small child say 'I goed' instead of 'I went'? That child has never heard 'I goed', but his brain subconsciously took the root form 'go' and added the past forming suffix '-ed' and put them together. That's an amazing little feat of what linguist call generative grammar.</p>
<p>After about age 10-12, your brain stops acquiring language, and it usually has to be conciously learned after that.</p>
<p>An interesting (but sad) side study is feral children who never heard language during this stage, never really learn to competently speak a language.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I haven't read all the answers, but it seems that everyone is forgetting a huge point: Grammar is only a set of rules that describes how a language works. That means that &quot;sounding right&quot; in fact came before &quot;being grammatically correct&quot;.</p>
<p>No one woke up one day, made up a bunch of rules for a &quot;new language&quot; and then started teaching them to people. People were speaking the language for ages, and then someone tried to compile a set of rules that tried to describe how to speak in a way that &quot;sounded right&quot;.</p>
<p>These sets of rules are very useful for a foreigner trying to learn the language. This theoretical foreigner finds these rules useful because they lack the exposure to know what &quot;sounds right&quot;.</p>
<p>BTW, I'm not a native English speaker, but these ideas are valid for all languages ever. Grammar is only a set of rules that try as accurately as possible to describe what &quot;sounds right&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
