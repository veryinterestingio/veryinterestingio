		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Clinical psychologist with a lot of background in depression. Most people’s answers here are on the money, in that IQ holds true but more about symptoms. But let’s move past that part because IQ is a really hard concept to grasp without knowing the background. Don’t worry about IQ, as it’s a relatively a useless thing unless we talk about functioning capabilities. Basically, if you can follow instructions on a lego set and remember a phone number, you’re as “smart” as everybody else and that’s all you need to worry about. </p>
<p>Depression won’t make you less “smart” but how you feel will make it difficult to concentrate, to remember things, to do things efficiently, etc...</p>
<p>Your second question is probably the more important one. Learning, in the shorthand clinical sense, is your ability to take in new information and apply it efficiently (like you if learned to cut an onion today, you know that skill now). The interesting thing is that learning is what helps you overcome depression, like you learn new coping skills, new thought processes, new emotional regulation skills. </p>
<p>There’s even some radical thought out there from 80s psychologists who will argue that depression is evolutionarily a necessary process; our bodies and minds need to take time to regroup, find comfort, and focus on our health needs. You might sleep a lot not because you’re tired, but your brain might want process something to learn that you have a hard time dealing with when you’re awake. It’s important to get “good sleep” versus “a lot of sleep” or to eat foods that satisfy your needs and make you feel good, versus eating unhealthy and it makes you feel worse. </p>
<p>Ok I’ve digressed. What I’m trying to say in a roundabout way is that if you are clinically depressed, of course you’re going to have problems writing reports or doing math, or whatever. However, one part of overcoming depression is “learning” in itself. Dr. Mark Reinecke, a psychologist famous for his work on adolescent depression, once quoted depression as being “when one’s expectations don’t meet the reality.” We have to “learn” how to accept our reality: of who we are, of how difficult things are, but also how amazing you are and what you are capable of, and what you’ve done. It’s just that with depression, it hurts and it’s difficult to do things, which makes it so much harder to do other things for ourselves. </p>
<p>I hope you are finding treatment for this; if not, I highly recommend it and therapy is probably the only medicine with no negative side effects. I promise you that if you can take one step at a time, the next step get easier, and it gets better.</p>
<p>EDIT: I seem to be getting a lot of heat for my oversimplification of IQ testing and psychedelic medication. So I’ll just pin this here.</p>
<p>1) I think a lot of others have responded with awesome responses about IQ, so I was hoping to put things in layman’s terms. We test IQ to understand more about someone’s cognitive functioning, and that informs us of their capabilities and and areas where one might need more help. A lot of tests have tasks related to motor function, executive (decision making) functioning, impulse control, perception, memory, learning, and I was hoping to equate that to something more similar to real life, like being able to follow directions, ability to recall things etc... </p>
<p>The point I wanted to get across is that IQ results don’t make a person. Everyone functions different, as we excel and struggle in different ways. Depression can exacerbate those struggles and inhibit our strengths.</p>
<p>2) I took some time to look at psychedelic research, and found that there is a lot of interest and positive outlook towards that medication in the last few year. Which is great, I’m all for finding out more about how we can help people. However in most my reading, there are two important distinctions in the latest reviews: that we need to do efficacy studies, and that these are targeted towards those who are “resistant” to the current standard of care. </p>
<p>I also was hasty in my readings of some comments. Most of the time, when people talk anecdotal stories of self-medications making them better, it’s usually not described as prescribed medication or participating in a medical trial. I apologize to people who are more educated on the subject, and I hope the people who read those comments below follow up on the research as well. However, I will stand firm on disregarding those who say “I took some LSD/shrooms, went to the into the woods and it cured my depression.” If it truly helped you, great. But it might not work for everyone, and when it comes to mental health, there’s a lot more than just anecdotal evidence at face value. In the same vein, don’t take what I say at face value, as I was obviously behind in my knowledge of current medication research. Talk to your provider about what you need to address in treatment. Ask for the research behind it. </p>
<p>I also stated “don’t use something external for something internal.” That was a bad generalization on my part. I think a better way to phrase what I meant was “use the treatments related to your disorder.” Something that address what’s going on for you. So yes, medications are beneficial and show efficacy, and if prescribed to you, you should follow your doctors suggestions. What you should not do is maladaptive coping behaviors, such as using avoidance. For example, “retail therapy” might make you feel better in the moment, but are you really addressing what’s going on?</p>
<p>I hope this all makes sense. Best to you all. </p>
<p>Back to normal redditing for me.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Wow, I haven’t been gilded before! I appreciate the generosity, but If there are any other kind people out there thinking of awarding something, please consider donating instead to a mental health charity. This helps with further research into how we can best help treat people, and the field moves so quickly thanks to the support of the public.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Yes. So much so that depressive patients sometimes are misdiagnosed with dementia due to a phenomenon called pseudodementia, otherwise known as &quot;depression-related cognitive dysfunction&quot;. The term pseudodementia is applied to a range of functional psychiatric conditions such as depression, schizophrenia and hysteria that may mimic organic dementia, but are essentially reversible on treatment. Pseudodementia typically involves three cognitive components: memory issues, deficits in executive functioning, and deficits in speech and language. Specific cognitive symptoms might include trouble recalling words or remembering things in general, decreased attentional control and concentration, difficulty completing tasks or making decisions, decreased speed and fluency of speech, and impaired processing speed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
