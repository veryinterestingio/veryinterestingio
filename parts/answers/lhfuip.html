		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The truth is that it's complicated.  Your immune system genetics and your immunologic history shapes how you respond to new antigens.  Everyone has various alleles for genes that influence an immune response - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine" target="_blank">cytokines</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_histocompatibility_complex" target="_blank">major histocompatibility complex proteins</a>, etc. Everybody's immune system has seen and responded to different antigens that have lead up to them getting vaccinated.   So while we can predict which cytokines may be high or low (IFN-a, IL-2, IL-12, etc.), we can make educated guesses about which cell types are more actively involved in the response (CD4 vs. CD8; ThC vs. NK cells, etc.), the truth is it's incredibly complex and not entirely consistent from person to person.</p>
<p>I am not an immunologist, but have had a number of immunology courses going through school, so I only see this response from the virus' perspective.  What I'd be most interested in learning, that would be a real challenge to find out, is whether people who have more severe reactions to the vaccination would be more likely to have had a poor outcome through a natural infection.</p>
<p>Personally, my arm felt like my wife punched me after #1.  After #2, it was more like The Rock punched me.  No fever, nausea, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a sub-question to this, if I'm allowed to ask.  </p>
<p>We know that people have a vast range of severity when they get COVID, from basically nothing to extremely serious.  I'm curious if the reaction to the vaccine would follow the same pattern, since it's an immune response specific to each person.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When some people receive a vaccine they experience side effects such as a sore arm, low grade fever, feeling tired or rundown. These effects are usually caused by your own immune system responding to the vaccine. </p>
<p>When you get a side arm, it is because white blood cells are gathering in the arm causing swelling and soreness while they are learning how to fight the virus from the vaccine. </p>
<p>In the vaccine trial I participated in (Jansen) they told us that more side effects after getting the vaccine was tied to increased immunity to the virus. So the more your body and immune system paid attention to the vaccine, the more side effects you get, and the more immunity you get!</p>
<p>I don't know if this is the same for mRNA vaccines, but that is generally how it works for the traditional ones.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
