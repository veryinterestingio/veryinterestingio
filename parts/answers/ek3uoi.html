		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The chemical that makes wasabi spicy doesn't get absorbed by the tongue like the chemical that makes peppers spicy. Wasabi spice is also less hot by eating it with water or watery liquids like soy sauce, whereas hot pepper spice is not. You need alcohol or something fatty like milk to lessen the spiciness of peppers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It gets its spiciness from a different chemical than what gives peppers their spiciness. The chemical in wasabi is smaller and evaporates much quicker up into your sinuses rather than sitting on your tongue/mouth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
