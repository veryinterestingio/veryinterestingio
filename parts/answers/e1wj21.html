		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The white stripes are caused by the active ingredient of the deodorant, Aluminium salt. </p>
<p>The salts dissolve in the sweat or moisture in the underarm. The  dissolved substance forms a gel, which creates a temporary ‘plug’ in the  sweat gland, reducing the amount of sweat that can rise to the skin’s  surface. Aluminium salts are also natural antimicrobial agents, so they  control bacteria on the skin, reducing unpleasant odours.  </p>
<p>(source: <a href="https://www.unilever.com/brands/Our-products-and-ingredients/Your-ingredient-questions-answered/Aluminium-salts.html" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.unilever.com/brands/Our-products-and-ingredients/Your-ingredient-questions-answered/Aluminium-salts.html" target="_blank">https://www.unilever.com/brands/Our-products-and-ingredients/Your-ingredient-questions-answered/Aluminium-salts.html</a></a>) </p>
<p>Without these salts, the glands don't get shut off, so other means of hiding your body odor has to be applied. Some work, some don't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You already have several sections of this answer spread amongst the replies; but I shall collate to the correct response:</p>
<p>So you have 4 different &quot;deodorants&quot;: gel, stick, liquid roll-on, and spray. </p>
<p>Gel almost never has an anti-perspirant, so is usually free of white streaks.</p>
<p>Stick can be further diveded into antiperspirant and just deodorant. The deodarant is a translucent gel-like stick, with antiperspirant being the white one.</p>
<p>The other 2 are often a mixture of light antiperspirant and deodorant.</p>
<p>I have a skin reaction to all gel, and gel-stick types; and a bad reaction to spray antiperspirant. </p>
<p>All antiperspirants will leave some white streaks from the aluminum salts(which can be mitigated by how much you apply). If you see a movie/tv show/ comercial where someone is applying deodorant, you will see them swipe &quot;up, down, up; sometimes back down for a 4th swipe&quot;; this is way too much. You shouldn't need more than a single &quot;swipe&quot; per underarm. With proper amounts applied you really shouldn't get the whote streaks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the ones that leave white marks work better. Some customers are willing to sacrifice effectiveness to avoid white marks, but most people who buy deodorant are more concerned about the product working well than how it looks under your clothes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
