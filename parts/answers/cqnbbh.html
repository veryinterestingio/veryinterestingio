		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey, Canadian tree planter here. Canada actually has similar rules with planting 2 trees for every 1 cut down. Reforestation companies hire large amount of people to work in remote areas to plant trees. An average camp size is about 45 planters not including staff and cooks. An average planter can plant about 2000 trees a day but really good ones can do more. In just one summer/ spring season Canada plants millions of trees. It takes a lot of work to get these camps up and running but once everyone knows how to plant and is serious about making money then trees really start to get planted quickly. Not sure how Sweden does their reforestation but I would imagine similar to Canada. </p>
<p>Now that I think about it I want to plant some trees in Sweden.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Under legislation passed in 1903, the Swedish Forestry Act states that there is an obligation to replant at least two trees if one is to be cut down (aimed at the forestry industry, not regular people). In Sweden, more trees are planted than are cut down since if one is cut down, at least two are grown. The time to simply plant two trees is far shorter than the time required to cut down one tree. People can manually plant one to two trees in a minute or less so it really isn't that difficult. In France, 80% of trees are planted manually because it just isn't hard.</p>
<p>But obviously, this can get expensive and time-consuming so people have figured out how to fully automate or semi-automate this task. There is such thing as automating tree planting and there are many different machines used in the industry. Machines used usually have the same concept: they prepare the ground by clearing it and drops the seeds somewhat deep into the soil (you can't grow trees on the surface of the soil) and if possible - water it.  </p>
<p>Think about it similar to how farmers plant crops using planters pulled by a tractor which tills the soil and then drops seeds in.</p>
