This becomes a problem, it adds a highly resistive layer and adds a worse fit.  If you've ever had actual &quot;silver-ware&quot; it usually needs to be polished on a semi regular basis..  Gold is pretty much the most inert conductor out there and the gold used can be so little that that its cost is very low.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gold doesn't oxidize like silver and so on. So the electrical conduction is optimal from gold contact to gold contact as there is no resistance generated due to corrosion. As soon as the electrical current has passed this gold/gold contact then of course the other metals are a better choice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I worked for a company that used a certain chip in it's design.  The company that made the chip switched from gold to copper for the internal leads. Everything was OK UNLESS the plastic cap on the chip didn't seal perfectly.  Any moisture or contamination that got to the copper would kill that lead.  This usually happened after years of being in use.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work for one of the largest connector companies in the world, specifically in plating/surface finishing and have been involved in electroplating since I graduated (chemical engineering).</p>
<p>People already nailed most of it, corrosion protection is huge. Silver doesn’t readily oxidize but does form silver sulfide in the presence of sulfur - it is soft and conductive but at low normal forces and low voltages this can cause issues. You generally will see silver plating on connectors that have higher forces and voltages (power contacts) that can easily break through this film. This is where the increased conductivity of silver is beneficial, power connectors can only withstand small rises in contact resistance before you can start to cause thermal issues.</p>
<p>One thing I didn’t see (I didn’t read every comment) is that connector plating isn’t pure gold 99% of the time - it’s “hard gold”. Pure gold is a terrible contact finish because it is soft and gals badly during durability cycling. Hard gold has small percentages of cobalt or nickel co-deposited in the layer that, wait for it, increase the hardness. However, the larger impact this has is it greatly reduces the friction coefficient of the deposit that allows the plated layer to have much better wear performance which is critical in separable interfaces.</p>
<p>This just grazes the surface, the required finish (or finishes) depend on the required lifetime of the connector, if it’s separable or not, reliability requirements, the mechanical design, environmental needs, electrical demands, etc.</p>
<p>Automotive industry uses a lot of tin and silver under the hood for example, along with gold. There are lots of variables at play.</p>
<p>PM me with any questions, I’m always happy to talk plating and contact design/physics. :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
