		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sodium and chlorine, which you think of as components of salt, actually entered the ocean separately. The sodium is from dissolved rock, both from the sea floor and from runoff from the continents; sodium is very soluble and many of the most common rocks on the surface of the Earth (like basalt and granite) contain it. The chlorine, on the other hand, is mostly outgassed from volcanic vents. Other ions, particularly calcium, dissolve easily but are also removed from seawater more quickly (e.g. calcium being filtered out by living things to make shells and bones, which ultimately become rock and recycle back into the mantle).</p>
<p>The reason there's so much of it is that it leaves the ocean only very slowly. It can be left on land when the sea recedes after times of high sea level, it can be buried along with the seafloor by subduction under continental plates, or it can slowly react with other rocks on the seafloor. All of these processes are very slow and the rates at which they happen are proportional to how much salt is already in the ocean: if the ocean gets saltier, they speed up; if it gets fresher, they slow down. This acts as a negative feedback that keeps the level of salt in the ocean relatively stable even over geologic time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It comes from rocks on the ocean floor and on land. When rain and rivers flow on land, they dissolve anything soluble (like sodium minerals) and carry it eventually into the ocean. When water evaporates from the ocean, only the H2O evaporates and all dissolved stuff is left behind. That evaporated water then rains over the land and picks up more salt on its way back to the ocean. So the water keeps cycling but the salt has a one-way* path into oceans, so over millions of years it builds up.</p>
<p>*actually it's complicated and chel_of_the_sea's amazing answer goes into that. But the bottom line ELI5 is &quot;salt from the land runs into oceans and accumulates there&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it’s important to note why most lakes are not salty because that’s the next logical 5 year old question.</p>
<p>Lakes are usually fed by a river and also drained by a river. The salt moves into the lake from the river and then also carried out by a river.  The ocean doesn’t have a river to drain it, only evaporation.</p>
<p>It’s also important to note that some lakes are indeed salty if no draining river is present.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fun bonus thought. As the salt levels build up over time, sea life adapts by increasing the amount of salt in its blood to match, to remove osmotic pressure. Sea life that left the ocean long ago has lower blood salt levels that match the ocean salt levels of the time. That's us, we have prehistoric ocean blood.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<blockquote>
<p>Just a little atom of chlorine,   </p>
<p>Valence minus one.   </p>
<p>Swimming through the sea,   </p>
<p>Digging the scene,   </p>
<p>Just having fun.   </p>
<p>She's not worried about the shape or size   </p>
<p>Of her outside shell,   </p>
<p>It's fun to ionize!   </p>
<p>Just a little atom of cl   </p>
<p>With an unfilled shell.   </p>
<p>But somewhere in that sea lurks handsome sodium,   </p>
<p>With enough electrons on his outside shell,   </p>
<p>Plus that extra one.   </p>
<p>Somewhere in this deep blue sea,   </p>
<p>There's a negative   </p>
<p>For my extra energy, yes,   </p>
<p>Somewhere in this foam   </p>
<p>My positive will find a home.   </p>
<p>Then unsuspecting chlorine Felt a magnetic pull,   </p>
<p>She looked down and her outside Shell was full.   </p>
<p>Sodium cried   </p>
<p>&quot;what a gas be my bride,   </p>
<p>and I'll change your name from chlorine to chloride!”   </p>
<p>Now the sea evaporates to make the clouds For the rain and snow,   </p>
<p>Leaving her chemical compounds in the absence Of H2O.   </p>
<p>But the crystals that wash upon the shore,   </p>
<p>Are happy ones, So if you never thought before...   </p>
<p>Think of the love that you eat,   </p>
<p>When you salt your meat.   </p>
<p>Think of the love that you eat,   </p>

<p>I take no credit. I originally heard this as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpTzawl3OmI" target="_blank">song by the McGarrigle sisters</a>. I think it may have been a poem first, but not sure.</p>
