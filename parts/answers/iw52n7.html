		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So there are several things going on.</p>
<p>1) Read the fine print, you're paying for &quot;up to 100mbps.&quot;  It's a subtle distinction but an important one.</p>
<p>2) ISPs market their service in megabits; speed tests and downloads themselves normally measure in megabytes.  100Mb = 12.5MB.</p>
<p>3) Just because you can download at 100mbps, doesn't mean the site you're downloading from -- or the networks between you and them -- can serve the content at 100mbps.</p>
<p>4) That 100mbps is &quot;at the pipe,&quot; and will be shared between all devices on your network.  Roommate downloading the latest 30GB CoD update?  That's going to eat into the available bandwidth.  Sister running her camshow in the next room?  That's going to eat into the bandwidth.  If you've got a house full of people sharing 100mb, it's potentially going to go fast.</p>
<p>5) Wifi.  It's convenient, but a 100mb wired connection will not give you a 100mb wireless connection, especially if there are walls, floors, etc between you and your wireless modem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Applications downloading files measure their throughputs in Bytes per second, but speed tests measure in Bits per second. File sizes are measured in Bytes so that makes most sense for the file downloaders, but your internet speed is advertised and sold in Bits per second so that's what a speed tester reports. If you have 100 megabit internet then I would expect a peak of around 12 megabytes per second when downloading.</p>
<p>That said, all ISPs oversubscribe unless you're paying like a thousand dollars per month for your connection. At certain times (eg: 8-10 pm) internet usage is at its highest and if too much oversubscription happens then you may peak out the connection.</p>
<p>Oversubscription is like when airlines sell more tickets than they have seats on an airplane because they know a few people won't actually show up. ISPs know people don't use their internet connection at full speed all the time, just in random little bursts when they do things, and so can sell more capacity in an area than they could service. Maybe they only have 10,000 megabit to a neighbourhood, but sell internet access to 1000 customers at 100 megabit connections each rather than the mere 100 homes the math says they should be able to service.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another useful speed test is the one Netflix runs on their servers (<a href="https://fast.com" target="_blank"><a href="https://fast.com" target="_blank">https://fast.com</a></a>). Its useful to see the real connection speed to something that's not directly peered to your ISP. </p>
<p>I believe Netflix built that speed test site when certain ISP were suspected of throttling traffic to their servers. I understand this speed test connects to the same servers Netflix uses to send content so it's possibly closer to a &quot;real world&quot; test – of course a real world test to a very well architected infrastructure on the other end. Your mileage will vary with other sites even if you get good speeds at Netflix.</p>
<p>Others have already pointed out that 100 mega bits per second will be about 12.5 Megabytes per second. Since the abbreviates are so similar it's often confusing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Networking speeds are advertised and reported in bits per second, where as download speeds in applications are reported in bytes per second.  8bits = 1byte</p>
<p>And also, just because you can get 100mbits_per_second to your ISP bode that's 10niles from you doesn't mean you get 100mbits_per_second to any location across the country or the world.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
