		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's easy to lose track of someone in a mall, especially if the mall has multiple floors.  Even in an close-in environment, where you're able to move around freely, it's still possible to lose sight of someone.</p>
<p>Now consider that just the Pacific Ocean alone is larger than every piece of land on the planet combined...then there are all the other oceans, too.</p>
<p>Now consider that the oceans go down around 12000 feet on average - roughly the equivalent of an 1,000 floor building, and it gets harder and harder to even send a machine down as you get deeper and deeper.  All of it in complete darkness.</p>
<p>Long story short: you are <em>vastly</em> underestimating how huge the oceans are - it's almost impossible to grasp the scale we're talking about here.  At that scope, it's easy to lose even a whale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The oceans are really big and the funding to study blue whales is really small.  Funding for basic science has not kept up with modern technology, so you just don’t have the researchers to set up a global tracking of blue whales. Honestly, if you can’t spin your research to be relevant to human medicine, you are always starving for grants.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
