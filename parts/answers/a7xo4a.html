		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Omg my time to shine! I wrote a research paper on this.</p>
<p>Bottom line is it comes from sleep cycles. On <em>average</em> sleep cycles are 90 minutes, but it really varies by person and hour.  There are different phases of sleep and they are not all the same.</p>
<p>Ever notice how sometimes you wake up naturally and you feel great? That’s because when you’re in a deep sleep stage of your sleep you don’t wake up from minor irritations like a full bladder or sunlight. Once you enter a light stage of sleep, these things gently coax you awake.</p>
<p>If you’re in a deep sleep or REM sleep you do NOT want to be jostled awake. REM is the worst because in that phase your body is kinda paralyzed. Waking up then is like getting hit by a truck.</p>
<p>The good news is you naturally don’t wake up then. The bad news is we humans love to set alarms that don’t give a fork what stage of sleep we’re in. <strong>Generally speaking, alarms are the reason you are tired.</strong></p>
<p>You can get 1.5 hours of sleep (an avg full cycle) and feel rested. You will get tired sooner in the day, but you’ll be able to jump out of bed ready to roll.  No coffee. If you get 8 hours that’s actually a bad number (you want 6, 7.5 or 9). If you’re jostled awake you’ll feel like crap.</p>
<p>So other than not setting alarms and being late to work, what can you do? Three things, and they all boil down to the same tactic: find a way to set an “alarm” that wakes you up at the right time.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create an environment where natural and gentle irritants will be there when it’s time to wake up. They should be strong enough to wake up during light sleep, but weak enough to stay sleeping during deep sleep. The best option here is a window with daylight or the Phillips Wake Up sunrise alarm clock.</li>
<li>Use an alarm that starts out softly and slowly (over like 15 minutes) raises the volume. If you’re in a deep sleep you won’t hear it. Once you shift to light sleep you will. <strong>The sound should be soft and soothing, like Hawaiian music, not sharp like an alarm. Sharp noises will wake you up from a deep sleep.</strong> Alexa devices can do this.</li>
<li>Get a device that tracks your sleep from motion or brainwaves and wakes you up at a perfect time. <del>Fitbit</del> Jawbone UP can do this. Also there are some attachments for the bed, and some mobile apps. There used to be a great one called Zeo but they went out of business.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>TLDR: you’re tired because of how you woke up, not because of when.</strong></p>
<p>--</p>
<p><strong>EDIT: Guys, I'm so sorry! Two mistakes in this comment/replies below:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>You DO need to change a setting on Alexa to make the low to high volume alarm happen. It's called &quot;Ascending Alarm.&quot;</li>
<li>Fitbit does <em>not</em> do the smart alarm. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171203031618/https://jawbone.com/fitness-tracker/up4" target="_blank">Jawbone UP</a> did it. Unfortunately, I think they are no more.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every person is different but sleep cycles for sure, I have a co-worker who goes to bed around 9-10 and wakes up on their own before 3 every single day without an alarm. And she's the most productive woman I think I've ever met. She seldom drinks coffee, sometimes tea. Manages to do the work of 2 people all by herself because she's also sickeningly organized.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
