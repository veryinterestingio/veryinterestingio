		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In both cases the propeller is actually more efficient when mounted on the rear. This is because the inlet cone on a propeller is much wider then the exaust cone so the hull of the craft is not so much in the way. However the problem that aircraft face is the issue of weight distribution. For stability reasons you need the weight of a craft in the front of the drag. The best example of this is an arrow or a dart which is very stable because it have a heavy point in one end and a tail for stability in the back. Airplanes are designed with the same principle. But in order to do this they need the heavy engines far in the front. Aircraft that use a pusher propeller therefore have to run a long prop shaft through the entire length of the tail of the aircraft. Some boats does have a very similar configuration but because they do not have to fly they usually have much smaller engines and propellers compared to the size of their ship. So they can easily get away with running a small propeller shaft along the keel of the ship to a center mounted engine.</p>
<p>There is also another reason which is why even aircraft with wing mounted engines usually have the propellers in front of the wings. It has to do with low speed control. A big issue with low speed flying is that you do not get enough airflow over the control surfaces to be able to control the aircraft. One solution is to put the control surfaces in the blast of the propellers which gives them more airspeed. And because there are control surfaces on the wings you therefore need to put the propellers in front of the wings. Ships do the same thing but with a slightly different configuration. They put the rudder behind the propeller but the rest of the ship is still in front of it. If you look at some more extreme aircraft designs you do sometimes find this with pusher propellers as well. But cutting out parts of the wing or hull of the aircraft in order to place the propeller in front of the airfoils but behind the rest of the structure is often counter productive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I haven't seen it mentioned yet... To lift the nose up for takeoff, the tail has to be lowered very close to the ground.  That greatly limits the size of the propeller you can mount behind the main landing gear.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is how I would explain to a 5yo.  It's a speed problem.  Things pulled from the front can go faster without falling over and things pushed from behind are more likely to fall over when moving quickly.  Because a plane is a lot faster than a boat it needs the puller in front and a boat is a lot slower so it gets help turning when the pusher is at the back.</p>
<p>I skipped a lot of other factors for the sake of getting to the cookies and milk faster.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Airplanes normally operate in one state of matter - gas (air), though they use wheels to taxi around at airports between flights.</p>
<p>Boats operate in two states of matter - liquid (water) and gas (air) almost 100% of the time (outside of drydock).</p>
<p>While behavior of moving water (hydrodynamics) and moving air air (aerodynamics) share many characteristics, they do have some important differences.  Water, for example, is essentially incompressible compared to air and is far more dense than air is -&gt; this is one reason why airplane propellers and boat propellers are very different.  Hydrodynamic behavior is also a reason why blunt shapes like modern submarines and bulbous bows on ships are common (much greater underwater efficiency) than the relatively sharper design elements on high speed airplanes.</p>
<p>Anyway, putting the main propellers on a boat up forward (along with maybe the rudders) also presents several challenges.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Practicality.  Propellers mounted forward on a ship would require the ship to have huge rudders back aft to provide enough force to change course (like, orders of magnitude bigger than they are now)-&gt; huge rudders require massive machinery back aft to turn them -&gt; massive machinery aft not only then requires compensation forward to maintain stability but it also limits the available weight and volume that can be used for whatever job the ship is being designed to perform.</p>
</li>
<li>Safety.  On the water and especially coming into port, is no such thing as the near-immediate stop on the water like you would taxiing an airplane or driving a car. Ships coming into port (unassisted) will typically make a slow approach and come close to the pier bow-first to put over lines and use their rudders and engines to bring the stern in.  If those propellers and rudders were forward and there was a collision or harder than expected contact, then there's a huge chance the gear would be damaged and suddenly a &quot;hard bump&quot; becomes a &quot;boat drifting uncontrollably around other boats&quot;.  This issue also applies to hitting something uncharted (only 20% of the ocean is mapped) or just stuff floating around (like a log or a half-sunken container) as visiblity underwater is very limited.</li>
