		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0846.2011.00609.x" target="_blank">Tsukahara et al. (2013)</a> yes! (For Japanese people, but OP is Japanese, right?)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In all age groups, men showed increased forehead wrinkles compared with women. In contrast, no gender‐dependent differences were found in upper eyelid wrinkles. Other facial wrinkles were greater in men than in women in all except the oldest group (age, 65–75 years), in which wrinkles in women were greater than or equal to those in men.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reasons aren't explored here but in your question you seem to differentiate genetic factors from facial expression differences across sex while the latter is caused by the former.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several differences in men’s and women’s skin as they age, in part due to sex and part due to genetics. Decreases in cellularity and vascularity, mast cells, and fibroblasts which are responsible for collagen synthesis, collagen crosslinking and bundling also become disrupted at varied rates. Elasticity decreases faster in women than men as well. Aging contributes the most to wrinkle patterns overall in the way that keratinocytes change shape (becoming shorter and fatter) while corneocytes enlarge, All these defections are what lead to wrinkling dimorphism</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It seems that men and women express and perceive emotional expressions in the same way in terms of muscles involved (Ekman 1971: <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1971-07999-001" target="_blank"><a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1971-07999-001" target="_blank">https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1971-07999-001</a></a>), but both babies (i.e. genetic differences) and older children (i.e. societally influenced) show differences in facial expression recognition (McClure 2000: <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2000-15386-006" target="_blank"><a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2000-15386-006" target="_blank">https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2000-15386-006</a></a>) where differences mirror social stereotypes with males being better at recognizing anger, and females being better at recognizing everything else. Males also report experiencing more anger while females report experiencing more happiness, sadness, fear, etc. which are then expressed facially (since these patterns are supported by social display rules), which *<em>could*</em> certainly lead to increased wrinkling in the forehead for men (anger) and around the eyes for women (happiness and to a lesser extent sadness) (Brody &amp; Hall 2008: <a href="https://lafetedubienetre.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/brodyhall2008.pdf" target="_blank"><a href="https://lafetedubienetre.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/brodyhall2008.pdf" target="_blank">https://lafetedubienetre.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/brodyhall2008.pdf</a></a>).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While I'm sure the reasons you mentioned have some variability of effect, I don't enough to comment. However, I do know wrinkle patterns as well as skin 'sag' (that is often attributed to gravity/age) can be heavily impacted by maintaining skin elastin. Overall, men tend to maintain better skin elastin compared to women. Generally, Caucasians and people with less natural oil produced in their skin tend to have less elastin as well. Elastin can especially be affected by things like smoking and skin exposure to sun. I'm sure there's many answers to your question, I've only made a small contribution. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
