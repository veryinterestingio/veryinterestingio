		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a very interesting question! And part of the answer is that physicists use the word &quot;universe&quot; in multiple ways that can be quite confusing. </p>
<p>First off there's the &quot;observable universe&quot;: the area of the universe that we are able to see, because light or other signals have had time to reach us from there. This is a spherical region centred on us, with a radius of about 47 billion light years. [Important note: the fact that we are at the centre is not special, people in a neighboring galaxy would see a slightly different observable universe, centred on them.]</p>
<p>And then there's what we could call the &quot;full universe&quot; (not a technical term): the whole of everything that exists, even the stuff outside of the observable universe that we can't see. At the moment the evidence we have seems to indicate that this is infinite, it keeps going on forever and ever. Certainly, our observable universe is only a tiny fraction of the &quot;full universe&quot;. </p>
<p>Within our current understanding of physics, there is nothing &quot;outside the (full) universe&quot;, in that the concept of &quot;outside&quot; doesn't really apply. If the universe is infinite, then it never ends, it just keeps going. And if it's finite then it loops back around on itself, the same way you'd end up back at your house if you started walking North and kept going in a straight line for long enough. There's no &quot;edge&quot; either way. </p>
<p>Now, within theoretical physics there are models that consider our universe to be embedded within some kind of higher-dimensional space (the way the text on this 2D screen is embedded in your 3D room), and you could consider that a kind of &quot;outside&quot; but there's no evidence at present to support that idea. </p>
<p>To answer &quot;what is the universe expanding into?&quot; is tricky. The answer is straightforward: nothing. But explaining why is hard. When you blow up a balloon, it expands out into space that was occupied by the air, we naturally understand this. But that's an example of a higher-dimensional embedding: the balloon's rubber is a (curved) 2D surface embedded in 3D space. In the case of our universe, it isn't pushing out into some external space, it's just that the distances between very far apart galaxies are getting bigger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is nothing beyond that.  There is just the universe.   When we say the universe is expanding, you can think of it more as the distance between everything is getting bigger, not that the universe is expanding into some unoccupied space.    </p>
<p>Maybe think of it as a balloon with polka dots on it.   Nothing outside of the balloon exists.  Polka dots are the stars/etc.  And as the balloon gets blown up the polka dots will get further and further apart, but the only thing that exists is still the balloon with the polka dots on it.  Hope that helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Scientifically, the word universe is defined to mean everything that exists. It is all time and space. By that definition there cannot be an outside to it. The universe isn't expanding into anything. It is creating space as it expands.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To be honest we can't know that. The universe is everything and there is no such thing as 'outside'.</p>
<p>This seems more of a philosophical question though. Imagine we are living in a simulation. A computer program that generated the universe and is running, simulating every molecule in the universe. If you are in that program, what is outside of that program? Nothing, as far as the program is concerned. Bits in a computer program can't &quot;break out&quot; into the real world and we, likely, can't either.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
