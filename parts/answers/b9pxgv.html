		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An organ is a bunch of tissue that's generally connected, and works together to serve a function. Doesn't all have to be the same type of tissue: eg, the heart is an organ, but there's muscle, fat, nerve, connective tissue, etc etc.</p>
<p>A gland is a type of organ that makes stuff (generally fluids, often hormones). Ovaries and testes both act as glands, since they make and release the 'sex hormones' (oestrogen, testosterone, and all the other related ones). </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>they are both glands and organs. </p>
<p>An organ is just a body structure that serves a function</p>
<p>A gland is an organ that serves its function by excreting a substance that have effects else where outside the organ. </p>
<p>If the substance is directly secreted via a collecting system it is an exocrine gland like the salivary gland which secretes saliva that works in your mouth. </p>
<p>If the substance is something that goes straight to blood stream, usually a hormone, it is an endocrine gland like your thyroid. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
