		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So when the mosquito releases its viral particles they are taken by the Antigen presenting cells (APC) which are the cells of the immune system
This causes the APC to mature and therefore it travels from the site of infection to the lymph node so when it reaches the lymph nodes the APC produces chemical messengers that activates T- cells,  so these T- cells respond by secreting pro-inflammatory molecules then when these pro-inflammatory molecules enter the blood stream they help eliminate the virus and  causes plasma leakage </p>
<p><em>The cause of the plasma leakage</em></p>
<p>So the endothelial surface is maintained by glycocalyx and cell to cell Junctions.
These glycocalyx acts as a barrier against leakage of proteins and fluids across the vascular wall so it's believed that  pro-inflammatory molecules which are relased by the T-cells ,reactive oxygen species as well as enzymes start to breakdown the glycocalyx layer allowing the plasma to leak out of the vessel since the barrier(glycocalyx) is destroyed</p>
<p>More over, this can cause serious complications such as high levels of hematocrit since red blood cells are large and they can't leak out or pass through the tissue. </p>
<p>Sorry if it was too long,  I hope it helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
