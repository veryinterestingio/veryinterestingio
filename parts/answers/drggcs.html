		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I copied this from another user who couldn't remember who originally wrote this comment.</p>
<p>Below is basically a historical approach to why we believe in dark matter. <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1006.2483v2.pdf" target="_blank">I will also cite this paper</a> for the serious student who wants to read more, or who wants to check my claims agains the literature. </p>
<ol>
<li>In the early 1930s, a Dutch scientist named Jan Oort originally found that there are objects in galaxies that are moving faster than the escape velocity of the same galaxies (given the observed mass) and concluded there must be unobservable mass holding these objects in and published his theory in 1932.</li>
</ol>
<p>Evidence 1: Objects in galaxies often move faster than the escape velocities but don't actually escape.</p>
<ol>
<li>Zwicky, also in the 1930s, found that galaxies have much more kinetic energy than could be explained by the observed mass and concluded there must be some unobserved mass he called dark matter. (Zwicky then coined the term &quot;dark matter&quot;)</li>
</ol>
<p>Evidence 2: Galaxies have more kinetic energy than &quot;normal&quot; matter alone would allow for.</p>
<ol>
<li>Vera Rubin then decided to study what are known as the 'rotation curves' of galaxies and <a href="http://imgur.com/UKbNIif" target="_blank">found this plot</a>. As you can see, the velocity away from the center is very different from what is predicted from the observed matter. She concluded that something like Zwickey's proposed dark matter was needed to explain this.</li>
</ol>
<p>Evidence 3: Galaxies rotate differently than &quot;normal&quot; matter alone would allow for.</p>
<ol>
<li>In 1979, D. Walsh et al. were among the first to detect gravitational lensing proposed by relativity. One problem: the amount light that is lensed is much greater than would be expected from the known observable matter. However, if you add the exact amount of dark matter that fixes the rotation curves above, you get the exact amount of expected gravitational lensing.</li>
</ol>
<p>Evidence 4: Galaxies bend light greater than &quot;normal&quot; matter alone would allow. And the &quot;unseen&quot; amount needed is the exact same amount that resolves 1-3 above.</p>
<ol>
<li>By this time people were taking dark matter seriously since there were independent ways of verifying the needed mass.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_compact_halo_object" target="_blank">MACHOs were proposed</a> as solutions (which are basically normal stars that are just to faint to see from earth) but recent surveys have ruled this out because as our sensitivity for these objects increase, we don't see any &quot;missing&quot; stars that could explain the issue.</p>
<p>Evidence 5: Our telescopes are orders of magnitude better than in the 30s. And the better we look then more it's confirmed that unseen &quot;normal&quot; matter is never going to solve the problem</p>
<ol>
<li>The ratio of deuterium to hydrogen in a material is known to be proportional to the density. The observed ratio in the universe was discovered to be inconsistent with only observed matter... but it was exactly what was predicted if you add the same dark mater to galaxies as the groups did above.</li>
</ol>
<p>Evidence 6: The deuterium to hydrogen ratio is completely independent of the evidences above and yet confirms the exact same amount of &quot;missing&quot; mass is needed.</p>
<ol>
<li>The cosmic microwave background's power spectrum is very sensitive to how much matter is in the universe. <a href="http://imgur.com/ssw6TJw" target="_blank">As this plot shows here</a>, only if the observable matter is ~4% of the total energy budget can the data be explained.</li>
</ol>
<p>Evidence 7: Independent of all observations of stars and galaxies, light from the big bang also calls for the exact same amount of &quot;missing&quot; mass.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/millennium/pie_millennium_walls.jpg" target="_blank">This image may be hard to understand</a> but it turns out that we can quantify the &quot;shape&quot; of how galaxies cluster with and without dark matter. The &quot;splotchiness&quot; of the clustering from these SDSS pictures match the dark matter prediction only.</li>
</ol>
<p>Evidence 8: Independent of how galaxies rotate, their kinetic energy, etc... is the question of how they cluster together. And observations of clustering confirm the necessity of vats of intermediate dark matter&quot;</p>
<ol>
<li>One of the recent most convincing things <a href="http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2006/08/21/dark-matter-exists/" target="_blank">was the bullet cluster as described here</a>. We saw two galaxies collide where the &quot;observed&quot; matter actually underwent a collision but the gravitational lensing kept moving un-impeded which matches the belief that the majority of mass in a galaxy is collisionless dark matter that felt no colliding interaction and passed right on through bringing the bulk of the gravitational lensing with it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Evidence 9: When galaxies merge, we can literally watch the collisionless dark matter passing through the other side via gravitational lensing.</p>
<ol>
<li>In 2009, Penny et al. showed that dark matter is required for fast rotating galaxies to not be ripped apart <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_force" target="_blank">by tidal forces</a>. And of course, the required amount is the exact same as what solves every other problem above.</li>
</ol>
<p>Evidence 10: Galaxies experience tidal forces that basic physics says should rip them apart and yet they remain stable. And the amount of unseen matter necessary to keep them stable is exactly what is needed for everything else.</p>
<ol>
<li>There are counter-theories, <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2011/02/26/dark-matter-just-fine-thanks/" target="_blank">but as Sean Carroll does nicely here</a> is to show how badly the counter theories work. They don't fit all the data. They are way more messy and complicated. They continue to be falsified by new experiments. Etc...</li>
</ol>
<p>To the contrary, Zwicky's proposed dark matter model from back in the 1930s continues to both explain and predict everything we observe flawlessly across multiple generations of scientists testing it independently. Hence dark matter is widely believed.</p>
<p>Evidence 11: Dark matter theories have been around for more than 80 years, and not one alternative has ever been able to explain even most of the above. Except the original theory that has predicted it all.</p>
<p>Conclusion: Look, I know people love to express skepticism for dark matter for a whole host of reasons but at the end of the day, the vanilla theories of dark matter have passed literally dozens of tests without fail over many many decades now. Very independent tests across different research groups and generations. So personally I think that we have officially entered a realm where it's important for everyone to be skeptical of the claim that dark matter isn't real. Or the claim that scientists don't know what they are doing.</p>
<p>Also be skeptical when the inevitable media article comes out month after month saying someone has &quot;debunked&quot; dark matter because their theory explains some rotation curve from the 1930s. Skeptical because rotation curves are one of at least a dozen independent tests, not to mention 80 years of solid predictivity.</p>
<p>So there you go. These are some basic reasons to take dark matter seriously.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Finding alternative theories of gravity that would not require dark matter/dark energy to explain galaxy rotation curves or the expansion of the universe is an active research area, see the wiki article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternatives_to_general_relativity" target="_blank">Alternatives to General Relativity</a> for an abridged list of examples. In general, all of these alternative theories have two issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, they are dramatically more complicated than classical general relativity, in order to produce results that reduce down to GR at reasonable conditions, but diverge at other conditions, and secondly,</p>
</li>
<li>They often don't work. Einsteinian GR with Dark Matter and a Cosmological Constant has matched many observations, and many alternative theories have been explicitly ruled out by recent observations. One prime example is the recent LIGO observations of black hole mergers, which fit with GR, but <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07670" target="_blank">do not fit</a> to a otherwise particularly promising alternative.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, we have observational evidence to suggest that dark matter is <em>real</em> in some sense. In particular, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10630" target="_blank">we've seen cases</a> of otherwise similar galaxies having different rotation curves. If dark matter phenomena was simply a result of an alternative form of gravity, then similar galaxies should show similar effects. The fact that this isn't necessarily the case suggests very strongly that there is in fact something we're not seeing that could be unevenly distributed. </p>
<p>So, in short, cosmologists hypothesize dark matter because it works, and don't make alternative theories because by and large they don't work, although plenty of people are still trying.</p>
<p>Incidentally, there is precedent for creating invisible matter to make the numbers work - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino" target="_blank">neutrino</a>, which was predicted in the 1930s when beta decay seemed to violate conservation of energy and momentum. Pauli predicted that, rather than conservation of energy and momentum being violated, there was an invisible particle flying off too. Pauli said</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have done a terrible thing, I have postulated a particle that cannot be detected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, the neutrino was detected, 20 years later.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add on to the excellent answers already posted, I want to emphasize that the fact that you can make GR match observations by adding dark matter is highly non-trivial. One criticism of dark matter models you'll often hear (although it's not a particularly good one, and usually doesn't come from people with expertise in modern physics) is that dark matter is a bad idea because by adding sufficiently elaborate matter content you can make GR fit any data. It's essentially saying that dark matter is the easy way out, where you just postulate the errors of your model away. It's a criticism that is often very appealing to laymen, because from the outside it does seem like physicists are indeed postulating weird, unreasonable kinds of matter so that they don't have to discard their models.</p>
<p>It happens, however, that this is not the case at all. For one thing, as others have already explained, there is active research into possible modifications to GR that would not have to resort to dark matter. But more fundamentally, it's also not at all obvious that just adding some kind of particle content we can't see would work in the first place (let alone fix multiple seemingly-unrelated discrepancies). Modern physics is very rigid mathematically (at least a lot more than the laymen would assume) and it happens to be the case that modifying theories or particle content very quickly leads your theory to either be very obviously inadequate or straight up garbage. The fact that, by postulating dark matter, you can make GR fit the data is itself noteworthy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other answers in this thread have ready addressed your issues with the theories of dark matter, so I'd just like to add a note addressing your example of a liquid in a cylinder.</p>
<p>In every scientfic experiment there is a goal to identify and address every possible source of error in the data. That is often a significant part of the peer review process, where other scientists can propose sources of error that were not accounted for in the initial result.</p>
<p>Back to your &quot;light liquid&quot;, your example would be better if you said that you measured the mass of the liquid, and found a discrepancy from the expected value, despite being absolutely certain that the correct volume of liquid had be added to the container. Perhaps you accounted for it by measuring a different known liquid first, and getting the right result, perhaps you conducted 1000 expents and did some statistical analysis to reduce human error. Perhaps you built a machine to fill your container mechanically with incredible precision. Maybe you did all of these things and more, but you kept getting an unexpected result.</p>
<p>Now, you have a few options. You can reject the current model that correctly explains the masses of all other liquids, or you can postulate a new &quot;light liquid&quot;.</p>
<p>We have a few historical examples of both cases. </p>
<p>John Dalton is credited with the modern discovery of atoms. This new theory replaced a variety of ancient theories that rejected the concept of basic elemental building blocks. </p>
<p>On the flip side we have the example of J. J. Thomson who proved the existence of isotopes. He quite litterally showed that elements have lighter and heavier versions of themselves. When he conducted his experiment he could have rejected classical mechanics and Newtonian theories of gravity, or he could have assumed there was a systemic error in his apperatus ans discounted his work. Instead, he proved that there were in fact different masses for the same element.</p>
<p>As such, if you measured the weight of your liquid carefully enough, and seperated your isotopes well enough, you could in fact have a &quot;light liquid&quot; and a &quot;heavy liquid&quot; made from the same elements.</p>
<p>To tie this all back to astrophysics, scientists are continually measuring new things, refining, confirm, and refuting aspects of our current theories. The best thing about science is that our theories are constantly evolving with new evidence. No one has to simply accept the newest crazy idea, the ideas that survive are simply the ones that haven't been proven wrong yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
