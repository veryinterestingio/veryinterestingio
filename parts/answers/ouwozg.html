		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Draw some dots on a deflated balloon, then put some ants on the balloon. The ants can move at some max speed, which we'll call C, and they walk between the dots because they're made of food.</p>
<p>Now start inflating the balloon. If you do it fast enough, the distance between an ant and the next dot  will increase rather than decreasing, even though they are walking towards the dot. The space between the ant and the dot is expanding faster than C.</p>
<p>Now imagine the surface of the balloon is 3 dimensional, and that it is expanding along a fourth dimension. That's how the universe expands.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The farther away something is, the more space between us that there is to expand. If something is far enough away, the cumulative expansion of all the space between those things will be faster than light.</p>
<p>In the distant future, dark matter will condense our galactic neighborhood into one giant galaxy. And the other giant galaxies will start expanding away due to dark energy until all the galaxies are too far away from each other that the light never reaches to other galaxies and every galaxy will think itâ€™s alone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question though, the diameter of the known universe is based on how far we can observe. If the universe is expanding faster than C, then how come we can observe light from 93 billion light years away?</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be more logical to assume that the universe expands slower than C so light can still reach us albeit at a much longer amount of time? Just like walking up an escalator that is going down. If you walk faster than the escalator going down, you will still reach the top but at a much longer amount of time.</p>
<p>Sorry if this is stupid</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
