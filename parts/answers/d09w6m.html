		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Public backlash over e.g. turtles being harmed by straws in the ocean. </p>
<p>Companies noticed the anger, loudly and publicly started using fewer straws, and (correctly) assumed that customers would fail to consider how small of a fraction of the waste stream is straws specifically. That way, they can sidestep calls for regulation or more drastic options.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I knew of cutlery being targeted first. I was introduced to non-plastic biodegradable disposable tableware in the early 2000’s. This article on compostable cutlery (though not from ~2005 when I was actually introduced to those products) does predate the anti straw fad. <a href="http://www.biomasspackaging.com/how-compostable-utensils-are-made/" target="_blank">http://www.biomasspackaging.com/how-compostable-utensils-are-made/</a></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A couple of videos made rounds on the internet a year or two ago in which straws were stuck in the nostrils of some sea turtles. </p>
<p>The videos were tough to watch and kinda sad. </p>
<p>I think that's probably what made the straws a really easy target.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it has more to do with the fact that the majority of people don’t actually need a straw. It’s very easy to sip from the cup. If we compare it to eating spaghetti or some other food, you kinda need a utensil to eat it. We should definitely consider all plastic a problem, but straws definitely are not necessary in order to drink a beverage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
