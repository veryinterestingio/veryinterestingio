		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don't.  Blue whales and several other types of whales are far larger than anything deep in the ocean.  Same for whale sharks.</p>
<p>Most deep sea creatures are in fact quite small.  The large ones are actually pretty unusual, and because they are both unsual and rarely seen by humans, we notice them more.  </p>
<p>Squids are a good example.  Giant squids are larger than the squids we normally see, but they are still only a fraction of the mass of the largest whales.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Larger animals have a slower metabolism, which means they require less energy to function. Food is not abundant in the abyss, therefore deep sea species evolved to become larger.</p>
<p>Another reason is that the larger a body is, the smaller their surface to volume ratio is. What that means is that the bigger they are, the less surface there is for their body heat to escape, making them again more adapted to survive with reduced access to food.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Coming from the deepest parts of the ocean when viewed from above is completely different from coming from the deepest parts of the ocean when viewed from the side.</p>
<p>Large animals come from the <em>surface</em> parts open ocean, <em>not</em> from the deep parts of the open ocean. This is because large animals require high amounts of food and need to travel far in order to get it, hence they can't be restricted to a single reef or other coastal area.</p>
<p>This isn't exclusive to the very largest animals either, mid sized animals like dolphins and tuna are also found more often in the open ocean, because most of them are constantly travelling.</p>
<p>Animals in the actual deep ocean are mostly very small. The largest are animals like six gill sharks or goblin sharks. And even these rare giants are still dwarfed by a great white shark let alone a whale.</p>
<p>Even giant squids and colossal squids don't live near the very bottom, it's moreso that they are very elusive living near the poles, and live in the sort of border between the open ocean and deep ocean. Even then their size is anomalous, most creatures there are quite small.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bigger animals need less food compared to how much they weigh.
Small animals like a mouse might eat food the size of their body every day.  Where big animals like an elephant might only eat something the size of their head. </p>
<p>Also, big animals can go longer between meals, so the can spend a really long time looking for food.  Sometimes weeks or even months!  Small animals need to eat very often, and don't do well at the bottom of the ocean, there isn't always enough food.</p>
