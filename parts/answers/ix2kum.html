		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The difference is that a bribe is made directly to the person in office, there's theoretically no record of it at all, there's no limit to the amount a person can receive, and there's no oversight.</p>
<p>A political contribution or donation is made to the person's campaign, there <em>are</em> legal limits to how much can be given in some cases, and they <em>are</em> matters of public record, so if you do the research you can see how much money a politician's office received from which lobby group or company and use that to base your vote off of.</p>
<p>There's of course still danger in letting special interest groups give money even through a middleman to a politician's office, which is why it is a commonly talked about issue and one that some politicians have tried to pass laws about in the past (and still do to this day).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In US law, they need two things to punish the politician:  </p>
<ol>
<li>They need to prove that a specific bribe resulted in a specific action. This is called <em>Quid Pro Quo</em>. If it's a nonspecific general favoring, the line has not been crossed.  </li>
<li>There need to be enough politicians who dislike that guy in order to do anything about it. If not, even if he's provably guilty of crossing that line. They can just choose not to do anything about it.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Campaign contributions are limited. So each person is only allowed to donate a few thousand dollars to each candidate. There are however several known loopholes currently in place in the US. The biggest one is the SuperPACs. The concept behind these is that instead of donating to a single election campaign you donate to an independent organization who just happens to run their independent campaign benefiting the candidate you support. Since all of this is outside of the control of the candidate and their campaign it is not subject to any of the restrictions on campaign contributions. This have been a known loophole for some time and requires changes in the laws or even maybe the constitution to fix. However most of the members of Congress have not done anything to attempt to fix this loophole and a lot of them are in fact in favor of this loophole. And these people end up getting reelected each time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In America, anybody should be able to run for public office, regardless of how wealthy they are. Since candidates may not have the personal financial ability to run for office, they can accept money from donors. Running for office is expensive. Candidates usually need to hire staff to help manage their campaign, pay for marketing, and many other expenses.</p>
<p>Candidates are allowed to accept money to allow the to run for office (campaign) as long as the total amount of money from any individual giver does not exceed contribution limits set by Federal and/or state law and the candidate tells the public how much money they have received and who gave the money to them. They have to use the money to pay for their campaign and cannot use the money for their personal benefit.</p>
<p>If a candidate uses campaign money inappropriately or for their own use, they can potentially go to prison. Last year, a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/03/duncan-hunter-pleads-guilty-to-misuse-of-campaign-funds.html" target="_blank">Congressman plead guilty to using campaign funds for personal use by his family.</a> He was sentenced to 11 months in prison.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Contributions go to election campaign budgets, not personal use by the politician... that's the line that is drawn. There are also rules about amounts that can be given directly to individual candidates by individual donors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
