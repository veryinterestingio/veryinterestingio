		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are sugar free chocolates, you can buy them at any walmart and I'm sure most grocery stores. They actually taste quite similar. However because they use sugar alcohols for sweetness instead of real sugar, the inability of humans to absorb/digest the sugar alcohols means they can cause some pretty severe intestinal distress if a lot is eaten. Which means you will have lots of farts and diarrhea to deal with. If you can be disciplined and have just one or two pieces then you may enjoy the experience.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
