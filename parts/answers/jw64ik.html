		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The moon was very important for the creation of land-based life. Tides are caused by the moon rotating around us, and having patches of land that keep changing between submerged and dry helped develop the earliest versions of amphibians. This provided an important stepping stone towards permanently land-based flora and fauna.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The question may not be the one you want to ask.  &quot;Is the moon necessary for earth's survival?&quot;....  no, the earth would change drastically if the moon just went away but it would likely do just fine.  </p>
<p>Would life that is here NOW be affected if the moon just vanished?  Yes, quite a bit.  The moon has a very small effect on earth's rotation and orbit but a much larger effect on it's tides.  Life on earth would be impacted but might survive.</p>
<p>Could life have arisen on an earth with no moon?  Not exactly life like we have now but likely yes.  The solar system still has a number of comet catchers to reduce the chance of impacts.  I don't think tides are strictly necessary to development of life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>YES! (According to a popular theory....)
It is believed that the gravitational forces exerted on the earth by the moon are crucial to keeping the Earth’s mantle molten. The molten core and mantle is what generates the Earth’s powerful magnetic field, which in turn protects us from solar wind. Without this protection, the Earth’s atmosphere would be stripped away, and the surface would be bombarded with high levels of radiation........or something like that. Id love some elaboration or correction from someone who knows more about this.</p>
<p>Edit: not very 5 yo focused. Sorry. I got excited.</p>
<p>Update: sounds like this theory is very speculative, at best. See the replies for   great amplifying info.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
