		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer is yes. Vaginal atrophy and dryness related to low estrogen plays a role in diminished sensitivity and ability to reach orgasm, as does reduced blood supply to the clitoris and lower vagina. Also, the clitoris is likely to be less sensitive than in earlier years, possibly due to reduced estrogen levels and changes in the vascular and nervous systems.</p>
<p>All of this may lead to reduction in the sensations and pleasure during lovemaking. It also can affect orgasm, which may be less intense, take longer to achieve, or rarely happen at all. </p>
<p>More than just issues with the clitoris, a common condition referred to medically as &quot;dyspareunia,” increases with age.  Dyspareunia is a condition where sex because painful. Vaginal thinning and dryness are the most common cause of dyspareunia in women over age 50. </p>
<p>Just like their male counterparts, orgasm problems are more common in women over 45.  Although medicine and research to counteract this seriously lags behind the efforts to treat erectile dysfunction. </p>
<p>In a large nationwide survey about sexual behavior among older US adults, 23% of women ages 57 to 85 said they did not find sex pleasurable.  Of these women, 64%—or 15% of women in the overall survey—said they were troubled by this lack of pleasure. Another large nationwide survey found that about 5% of US women have a problem achieving orgasm that causes them concern.   In that survey, the rate of these problems with orgasm was higher among women ages 45 to 64 and those 65 or older (6% in both groups) than among women younger than 45 (3%).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Erectile dysfunction is mostly a vascular disease. The penile artery is narrower than the coronary artery, so ED is often one of the first warning signs of progressing vascular disease - those fatty, diet-driven deposits on the arteries that cause them to narrow, reducing blood supply and, eventually, rupturing to form a potentially lethal circulating fatberg.</p>
<p>Men who live a well enough life to avoid artherosclerosis will also tend to avoid ED, unless it is the psychological type. Just like high blood pressure - it is <em>not</em> normal for it to worsen with age significantly. It is <em>not</em> simply every man's natural destiny to be gasping for breath while he flagellates his floppy member until his heart gives out. It's &quot;normal&quot; in the western world, but it's not &quot;normal&quot; biological progression.</p>
<p>I imagine the same is true of women.</p>
<p>I know it doesn't really answer your question, I just want you to know what whatever the answer is for a normal western subject, it may not be some inevitable progression for all men/women, but likely an avoidable or symptom of lifestyle related disease.</p>

<p>On this the basis of this information, it is my view that reducing tumescence with age is in many cases the result of avoidable dysfunction, not the normal progression of events healthy people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
