&quot;the eye opposite the sleeping half of the brain is open while the other eye is closed&quot;<br />

<p>I cannot find anything on &quot;personality&quot;, but when dolphins sleep, they do not do much &quot;personable&quot; stuff. They stay still or swim slowly and in a straight line. They do not hunt, they do not play, they do not interact with other dolphins. </p>
<p>We do not know how dolphins feel (since they cannot tell us), but it might be similar to how you feel when watching Netflix at 2am -- you are kinda aware of what is going on around you, but you do not feel like moving or responding to anything that is not life-threatening.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll blow your mind with some related truth:  YOU (and everyone else) sleeps with half their brain awake, every night.  It's called the Subconscious and it dreams but is bad at putting what it does into memory, which is why dreams are so hard to remember.  Nobody's 100% certain what the subsconscious is for, how it works, or exactly how distinct it is from the rest of you.</p>
<p>Dolphins just have a subconscious that is more capable of certain things that they need to do while sleeping - like swimming and watching out for sharks, remembering to surface to breathe every so often, that sort of thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
