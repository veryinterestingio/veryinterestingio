		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Memories are pretty much connections between nerve cells, the more numerous
(edit: and stronger) the connections the better you can remember something. </p>
<p>Since this is a physical connection, theoretically there is a limit to how much we can remember. However we dont know how much of our brain is available to store memories so we really cant determine what that limit is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The truth is that we aren’t fully positive on how and where memories are stored, but there is a strong theory that I support.</p>
<p>Imagine you walk into a library. You want to find a specific book, so you go and look on the computer and you find the location of where that book is. Now instead of having one location for the book, each page is stored in a different place, but you have the locations of every page.
So you go and hunt down each page, and now you have the full book!
To add another layer to this, imagine you just have a pretty solid idea of which pages are in this book and in what order they go in. Each time you find the pages and make the book, you have to later take the book apart and put the pages back.
Do this enough, and things can get a bit messed up, and the book isn’t really the same as it was the first time.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes.</p>
<p>All memory is technically physical evenwith computers. I mean an electron isn't any less physical than the atom it comes from.</p>
<p>It's not as simple as loctating a sector in your harddrive and locating a file. But memories are thought to be sets of physical neurons formed and reformed over time for a specific stimuli.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They’re frequently called memory traces as they’re more patterns of brain activity. Though the simplest form of a ‘memory’ would be the connection between two neurons, as with repeated firing between them, the connection gets stronger. This is the basis for what most people believe constitutes memory and active learning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As you ride your bike down the grass hill in the same way every day, the path will first start to be obvious by the grass all laying down in the same direction after a day or two. After you keep riding down the same path on the hill, the grass will eventually carve further into the ground and make a wider path and begin the carve into the ground. Your familiar feeling with things are attributed to your memory of the things. In the same way that your bike will create a dirt path in the grass over time as you ride it again and again, the memory becomes stronger and more established the more you experience the room or event or experience.</p>
<p>Just as the dirt path your bike makes doesn’t occupy more space, but does hold the information of the path - your memory “paths” in your brain do not occupy more space in your brain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
