		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All liquids generally have a higher heat capacity than their solids. The heat capacity is the amount of heat needed to raise a gram (or mol) of solid by 1 degree. In a molecular solid the heat goes to making the bonds vibrate faster. In a liquid the heat goes towards making the bonds vibrate faster but also to rotating and moving the molecules - you need extra energy to do this</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When water is in its liquid phase, all the molecules hold onto each other through hydrogen bonding. When you heat liquid water, most of the energy is  just going into disrupting and 'breaking' these hydrogen bonds  (disrupting is probably a better term since hydrogen bonds are not molecular bonds like ionic or covalent bonds are).</p>
<p>Eventually, You can add enough heat to overcome the inter molecular attraction that the water molecules have for one another through this hydrogen bonding and that's when water boils. The molecules are moving with enough kinetic energy that they have a hard time lining up their polar ends with one another (which is what hydrogen-bonding is). </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In a gaseous state, the water molecules are much more diffuse and separated from one another, and have more kinetic energy, so there is much less hydrogen bonding occurring. If it does to any significant degree, the water will just condense back into its liquid phase as a result. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Water does have some unique properties, but any solvent will have a higher specific heat capacity in the liquid phase than it will in the gaseous phase because that's when intermoelcular forces are stronger--when the molecules are closer together and have less kinetic energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s due to the amount and duration of hydrogen bonds.</p>
<p>Liquid water has a high heat capacity compared to its gaseous state because when water is a gas, the molecules are traveling faster and are further apart. This means their h-bonds don’t last as long, and their ability to hold together and hold heat decreases.</p>
<p>In liquid water, each hydrogen atom can h-bond to another oxygen, and each oxygen can h-bond to two hydrogens (4 h-bonds total per molecule). In liquid water these bonds aren’t nearly as transient as they are in gaseous water, again due to the lower energy levels, so they last long enough to give stability to liquid water, increasing its ability to store heat energy in those bonds.</p>
<p>Solid water (ice) forms a crystal lattice that prevents new, transient h-bonds from readily forming and prevents molecules from moving around. This lowers the overall ability for ice to retain heat. The crystal lattice is bulky, which is why water expands when it freezes (very unusual for most substances).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Heat capacity is best thought of in terms of boxes.</p>
<p>Each way a molecule can move, vibrate or rotate is a box. When you heat up a substance, you throw a ball into a box. The balls are all jumping up and down between the boxes, so if you add a lot of energy to one box, it'll convert and fill all the boxes evenly.</p>
<p>Temperature is basically how full your boxes are, and heat capacity is then related to the number of boxes.</p>
<p>Every 1 degree temperature rise involves putting 1/2 k energy into every box.</p>
<p>The real question then, is why does liquid water have the most boxes?</p>
<p>Solids can't move or rotate. So they only have the vibrating boxes available.</p>
<p>Liquids are free to rotate, move and vibrate, so they have more boxes than the solids.</p>
<p>Gasses can move and rotate, but the vibrations between molecules don't happen any more, as they are too spread out. They can still vibrate within a molecule, though.</p>
<p>For water, the shape means it has more ways to rotate than other molecules. A linear molecule can only access some rotational modes, as the moment of inertia around the central axis is too small. As water is bent, it can rotate around all three axes. Water also has strong intermolecular forces which mean the intermolecular vibrations contribute. (For a box to be accessible depends on quantum energy levels, the 1st excited state must be accessible at your temperature)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
