		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The major advantage is that vaccine developers can outrace a quickly mutating virus. Developers try to predict which flu strain is going to be the main one to spread a year in advance and recent advances allow them to usually release a slightly more effective vaccine later in the season. </p>
<p>But if they can get mRNA techniques to work to target flu viruses there might not be flu pandemics anymore. Imagine a new vaccine ready for rollout in three months once a new strain looks like it's going to dominate the season, and now the effectiveness of the vaccine is 80-90% instead of 50%. That means less of an increase in the mortality rate every winter.</p>
<p>If mRNA techniques are effective on non-primates it could mean saving agricultural resources. The first response to an outbreak at a farm might be vaccinating animals instead of culling all the vulnerable livestock in the area. That means less interruptions in the food chain and less price spikes at the market.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have to keep in mind that some diseases are harder to treat. For example, HIV can remain latent in immune cells (Reservoirs), which prevents the immune system primed by the vaccine from targeting them. For an mRNA vaccine to work against these latent reservoirs, you need another method of targeting them (Either with some type of drug for activating the latent viruses into being active and producing virus parts for ID by immune system or by reducing the amount of available cells for infection).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No.  To copy/paste what I wrote the last time someone asked a similar question;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An mRNA vaccine is just a clever way  of getting a person to mount an immune response to the proteins encoded  by that piece of mRNA.  </p>
<p>It will not  solve the present problems in developing an HIV vaccine.   We are  perfectly capable of injecting people with HIV proteins and stimulating  an anti-HIV immune response.  </p>
<p>The problem is that the responses we stimulate are not protective.  </p>
<p>With  a virus like measles, someone is infected and the antibodies they  produce protect them from reinfection for the rest of their life.  So we  can mimic that natural response: find a way to stimulate the same  antibody response without making them sick and <em>Voila</em> - you've got an effective vaccine.  </p>
<p>But with HIV, <em>we don't know how to create an effective immune response that can prevent infection!</em>   People don't clear HIV on their own.  Most people with HIV mount good  antibody and cell-mediated responses to the virus - but those responses  don't prevent the virus from eventually killing them.  The virus can  mutate to escape whatever antibody and CTL responses most people create.  </p>
<p>An mRNA vaccine is not going to solve these problems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Same with malaria.  One of the problems with malaria vaccine development is that malaria is not a threat to the developed world.  However, we've still tried <em>dozens</em> of different vaccines (utilizing different strategies) to control malaria - from early vaccines of live attenuated or inactivated sporozoites to subunit vaccines against merezoite and sporozoite proteins.  Often they do well in early studies but fail to show a significant decrease in infection or mortality in larger stage II or III trials.  </p>
<p>The plasmodium species that cause malaria (and there are several) are very well adapted to infecting humans and evading our immune responses.  We have never created a successful vaccine for a pathogen with such a complex life-cycle and such different forms.</p>
<p>There is a similar problem to HIV:  malaria does not confer sterilizing immunity.  Even when people catch malaria and recover, they are not fully protected against future infection (although they often get milder cases as they're periodically re-infected through their lives).  That means that mimicking a natural immune response is not sufficient.   Even when people are exposed to malaria for their entire lives, they don't have sterilizing immune responses.  The partial protection that does exist is also short lived (due to dendritic cell alterations that lead to foreshortened memory B-cell protection) - if someone leaves a malaria zone for <em>just a year</em> and then returns, they are at <em>just as much risk</em> of serious infection and death as an adult encountering malaria for the first time!  As with HIV, we therefore just don't know what, if any, immune response might be protective.  We've tried vaccines that generated very high antibody titers but still offered zero protection.   The problem may be timing: within an hour of infection, the sporozoites have reached the liver and begun producing merezoites.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>HSV-2 is likely an easier pathogen to vaccinate against than HIV and malaria - it's genetically well-conserved and it's a large DNA virus with many potential immune targets.  Though HSV has coevolved with humans for millions of years and has effective ways to evade our immune responses (e.g. downregulating MHC-I to deter CTLs; binding IgG Fc receptors to neutralize antibody responses), the efficacy of vaccines to other herpesviruses (e.g. the chickenpox and shingles vaccines to varicella zoster virus), other viruses transmitted through the genital mucosa (e.g. HPV), and even genitally-transmitted HSV-1 (e.g. a subunit vaccine containing gp D2 antigens was partially effective in preventing HSV-1, but not HSV-2) gives hope for the possibility of an effective HSV-2 vaccine.  While many approaches, including inactivated vaccines and subunit vaccines with various viral glycoproteins, have not succeeded, a vaccine does appear feasible if it focuses on T-cell memory responses rather than humoral immunity.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It's absolutely possible that we will come up with effective vaccines against HIV, HSV, and malaria (despite many decades of trying and failing).  There are current efforts being made (e.g. to generate broadly neutralizing Abs to HIV, to increase the immunogenicity of malaria's circumsporozoite protein and improve on the efficacy of the \~30% protective RTS,S vaccine with prime-boosting strategies) and exciting breakthroughs all of the time. But the mRNA platform will not be the breakthrough that allows such vaccines to succeed.  </p>
<p>The breakthroughs in developing vaccines for infections that have been notoriously difficult to vaccinate against will likely come from careful study of these pathogens, the immune responses to them, the ways in which they evade the immune system, and/or any individuals who are able to mount unique protective responses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dunno about human diseases, but there have been breakthroughs for Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP): <a href="https://www.vet.cornell.edu/departments-centers-and-institutes/cornell-feline-health-center/health-information/feline-health-topics/feline-infectious-peritonitis" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.vet.cornell.edu/departments-centers-and-institutes/cornell-feline-health-center/health-information/feline-health-topics/feline-infectious-peritonitis" target="_blank">https://www.vet.cornell.edu/departments-centers-and-institutes/cornell-feline-health-center/health-information/feline-health-topics/feline-infectious-peritonitis</a></a></p>
<p>This condition is caused by feline enteric coronavirus (FeCV).  90% of cats are able to fight off the virus with few symptoms, but in 10% of cases, the virus mutates into FIP and can turn deadly with a 85% mortality rate.  Until recently, it was considered untreatable.  The advent of anti-viral drugs, like PREP, have made a big difference.  The FDA is still working on approval for the treatment for FIP, but there's treatment now that wasn't there before.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Possibly yes, but also cancer. mRNA vaccines were originally intended as personalized cancer vaccines that train the immune system (T cells) to attack very specific cancer targets. They're easy to make. So in theory, you can biopsy and genotype someone's cancer and make an mRNA vaccine against that very specific cancer and the immune system will fight the cancer. It's quite promising for certain cancers</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
