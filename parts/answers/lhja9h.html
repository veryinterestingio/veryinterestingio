Yet our provincial government has withheld the second dose in preference of giving a first dose to as many people as possible. </p>
<p>Is this the right thing to do? What is the efficacy of each of these vaccines if a person does NOT receive a second dose?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ol>
<li>
<p>It seems the chosen rollout strategy has been to vaccinate more vulnerable populations first, rather than attempt to achieve full coverage in a single localized population and then advance the front of vaccine coverage, progressively shrinking the populations in which the virus is active. From an epidemiological perspective, given that we don’t really know exactly how long vaccine-induced immunity will last, what’s your opinion on the current approach? Do you believe what seems to be a “spread it thin and wide” vaccination strategy will be effective, or do you think there is a significant chance that drop-off of immunity could outpace rollout enough to seriously mess with the current strategy taken?</p>
</li>
<li>Do you think it will be possible to eradicate COVID-19 in humans, either in the US or globally? Or do you think it will remain at some level in the population, potentially by changing/mutating fast enough to necessitate regular vaccination and be more like the influenza viruses in that sense?</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If a vaccine is 95% effective, what causes the 5% of people for whom it's <em>not</em> effective? Is it a failure to mount an immune response? Did they just get a much higher viral load with their exposure? A rare or emerging mutation of the virus itself that the vaccine can't fight?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
