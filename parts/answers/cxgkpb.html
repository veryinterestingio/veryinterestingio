		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is a combination of the fact that the liver does not have an overly complicated internal structure, and the fact that it is an organ which constantly has to regenerate anyway as a consequence of its function.</p>
<p>On a tissue level, the liver is somewhat like a giant blood sponge, and you pump blood through it in order to filter toxins out of it. Because you are filtering toxins out of your blood in your liver all the time, those toxins build up and inevitably kill a lot of your liver cells, forcing you to constantly regrow them.</p>
<p>Since a sponge is not a really complicated structure, as long as you have at least a little bit of functional liver you can grow more of it back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it's an organ that is &quot;designed&quot; to vary in size.</p>
<p>Some animals like snakes will increase liver size for the duration of digestion after a large meal. So their livers can grow and shrink according to current needs.</p>
<p>Liver is also the first buffer for nutrients storage. If you start eating too much your liver will increase in size before you get visibly fat.</p>
<p>So it's easy to grow new liver tissue when necessary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
