		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Before ejaculation, your sex hormones are on a mission.
You're super horny because your hormones are telling you that your priority in life at that moment in time is to sow your wild oats.
Your hormones are making your blood race, your skin sensitive.
Because to your hormones, at that moment in time, sex is 100% all that matters. You are ready for sex and, damn it, you will sex.
Sex is your reason for being, for the survival of your awesome genes.
It's like they're sitting in your brain with a big cattle prod, pushing you in the right direction.
After ejaculation, it's mission accomplished, everybody can go home. Everybody's tired and you can't keep it up forever. If you were to stay in a permanent state of horniness, it would cause problems and at the very least wouldn't be productive.
Without the hormones, your body returns to normal. And so does your brain, without the cattle prod poking you down the path of sexiness.</p>
<p>It's like sprinting. A quick burst of amazing amounts of energy to go a short distance really quickly. But when you're done, you don't need the adrenaline (hormone) anymore. Which also means, adrenaline isn't there blocking the pain for you, giving you energy, increasing blood flow to your muscles. And so, you change very quickly into a breathless, tired, aching mess (jelly legs) because mission is accomplished. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Please everybody look up the hormones men's brains release after a successful ejaculation. One of them gives us a feeling of intense well-being, one cuts our sex drive temporarily, one makes us sleepy, etc etc</p>
<p><a href="https://scienceline.org/2006/09/ask-wenner-sex/" target="_blank">https://scienceline.org/2006/09/ask-wenner-sex/</a></p>
<p>&quot;Research shows that during ejaculation, men release a cocktail of brain  chemicals, including norepinephrine, serotonin, oxytocin, vasopressin,  nitric oxide (NO), and the hormone prolactin.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is an interesting question, and I'll refer to one of David Buss' papers for the answer. Buss is an evolutionary psychologist currently at UT Austin, and I'm personally a really big fan of his work.</p>
<p>He delineated between two major mating strategies for humans-- short term and long term. Short-term mating is what we might call &quot;hooking up.&quot; It involves having sex with lots of people in order to produce as much offspring as possible, and hoping some of them survive to adulthood. A long-term mating strategy involves staying monogamous with 1 individual, and putting &quot;all your eggs in one basket&quot; so to speak, and going all in on a single offspring.</p>
<p>Males almost always benefit from short-term mating more than females will. Sperm is cheap and doesn't take lots of resources to produce, while carrying a kid around in your uterus for 9 months is really costly. Additionally, while a male can potentially fertilize 200+ females in a year, females can only be fertilized by 1 male every 9 months.</p>
<p>This all goes to say that males are more incentivized to do short-term mating strategies. A refractory period after ejaculation facilitates a short-term mating strategy, since it makes the male &quot;move on&quot; to the next female faster. In Buss' words, &quot;In addition, men appear to lower their standards dramatically in the context of short-term mating, and show a marked decrease in attraction to a sex partner immediately following sexual intercourse,perhaps to facilitate a hasty post-copulation departure.&quot;</p>
<p>Edit/Disclaimer: Some people have criticized Buss' ideas as sexist, and truthfully, they kind of are, in that they portray males and females as constantly tricking and lying to one another to get what they want. In his view, males want to trick females into thinking they're committed, and females want to &quot;trap&quot; males into a long-term relationship. I think that if you decide to read Buss, it's crucial to apply his ideas to humans as they existed 10,000 years ago, and apply them to today's humans with a grain of salt. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
