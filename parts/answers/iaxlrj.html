		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called succession. Plants compete for sunlight. Some only grow to a certain height so grasses, vines, and hardy shrubs will start out growing strong and fast but end up getting shaded out once trees or taller plants begin to grow. The crowns of trees (leaves or needles on the branches above) block the sunlight from reaching the forest floor which stunts the growth of the understory.</p>
<p>Trees do this to each other as well. That's why the lower branches get naturally pruned. You can sometimes see where the branches once were. The larger the tree/crown, the more difficult it is for forest floor plants to grow. </p>
<p>If a forest has a dense, mature tree population the ground is typically clear of undergrowth. If the trees are further apart allowing sunlight to reach the forest floor then the sun will help germinate the seeds in the seedbed resulting in other species flourishing until they are shaded out.</p>
<p>Edit: I am completely aware that I did not cover every situation resulting in less dense undergrowth.  Other factors are as follows: logging practices, wildlife foraging, elevation, landscape, natural and artificial disturbances (wind/fires/wildlife routes/trails where compaction of soil occurs)/soil type/ plant zones/forest type/shade tolerance or shade intolerance/etc Thank you all for commenting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several people have mentioned pine forests and soil types but they are missing the mark. A lot of plants exude chemicals from their roots that repel other plants. This action is called allelopathy and is fairly common in the plant world. Pines interestingly have these chemicals in their needles and not the roots. Often when you see big areas of a single tree this is why.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, I'm a field scientist that has worked extensively on projects involving this issue! So this question is right up my alley. </p>
<p>White-tailed deer are the most impactful herbivore on the east coast of the US. Their populations have exploded without predators controlling them. They love eating tasty plants like oak and maple seedlings and ignore plants that don't taste so great like sedges and beech seedlings. This causes a dramatic change in the understory of the forest since plants cannot grow out of reach of the deer's mouth. Tree saplings don't grow into adult trees, shrubs can't grow taller than a few inches from the ground. The forest becomes much simpler, filled with tall, established trees and plants that grow no taller than a few inches off the ground. </p>
<p>When the plants disappear so do the wildlife that rely on them. Insects don't have somewhere to hide or pollinate, small mammals lose their homes and sources of food, and birds don't have somewhere to nest and raise their babies!</p>
<p>Overpopulation of deer is a serious issue. It has recently gained more attention and traction as something that needs to be fixed. There are many way to control the populations and one of the most common is permitting hunting. This is often not taken well by the public, but that's the nature of the beast when you're working with the public on a topic that isn't necessarily well known or understood.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The amount of underbrush is determined by the amount of natural light available at lower levels and by grazing patterns of wild life.  And by forest fire patterns.</p>
<p>In places in the pacific coastal rainforest (west coast of bc), there is a big difference between old growth forests and “reforested” areas post -clearcutting.</p>
<p>In old growth forests, trees are regularly being knocked and branches broken off in the wind.  This creates a lot of patches of light that filter down to ground level.  So there is a lot of underbrush, but the density of underbrush varies quite a bit.  Most of the time, there’s lots of ferns and spindly bushes. But anytime there is a decent patch of light, salal, salmonberry, maple and many other bushes take off- if a plant was well established in a shady environment and a tree toppled over creating a patch of light, all those established plants and trees grow madly as soon as the sun hits them.</p>
<p>In an artificially reforested (tree planted) all of the preexisting Forest is eliminated.  Seedlings are planted the same age and spacing and variety so they grow at approximately the same rate.  There are fewer wind falls and so the area at ground level is really consistently dark.  Once the trees are taller than the normal bushes, the bushes are strangled by lack of light, resulting in almost no undergrowth.</p>
<p>Some organizations that rehabilitate forests intentionally go through and fall trees, kill and leave standing dead wood, and top trees to bring more diversity to the undergrowth.  Essentially more light means more plant diversity means more animal diversity</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
