		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, radiation sickness itself not contagious at all. The apparent transmission depicted stems from the &quot;transmitters&quot; being radioactive themselves by either contamination or by induced radioactivity.</p>
<p>If I recall correctly, the first scene you describe was in the first episode, and the person with radiation sickness was a fireman, right? At this point, he was covered with highly radioactive dust and ashes from the burning plant. That's what caused the radiation burns of the second fireman who touched him.</p>
<p>The first responders at Chernobyl also inhaled (and partly ingested) the radioactive dust, which means they had highly radioactive particles in their body.</p>
<p>In addition, they were exposed to incredibly huge amounts of radiation (I found values of 20,000–30,000 roentgen/hour). That alone is actually able to make pretty much every matter radioactive itself, by so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_radioactivity" target="_blank">induced radioactivity</a>. This also happened in other cases of fatalities by nuclear accidents, for instance the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SL-1" target="_blank">SL-1 incident</a>, where one of the bodies of the killed workers was so highly radioactive that the pathologist performing the autopsy had to cut the body into pieces to be able to safely examine it.</p>
<p>The story of the fireman at Chernobyl and his pregnant wife is by the way based on a <a href="https://www.mamamia.com.au/lyudmilla-ignatenko-chernobyl-pregnancy/" target="_blank">true story</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Vanity Fair did a &quot;fact check&quot; on Chernobyl featuring Alla Shapiro, who was actually at Chernobyl after the accident and is a radiation/medical expert: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1GEPsSVpZY" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1GEPsSVpZY" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1GEPsSVpZY</a></a>. They cover the second scene you asked about.</p>
<p>The tl;dw is that most things related to the radiation was very exaggerated. But it's TV, so they didn't drop the ball, they were just trying to make compelling TV.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's only one way for scene #2 to be anywhere close to plausible, but I haven't seen any numbers on whether it really is. </p>
<p>One of the major radioactive contaminants for someone VERY close to a fresh reactor accident is iodine-131. The firefighters at Chernobyl did have very large doses of this. (Large enough that the Soviets initially lied about it to scientists and doctors who went over there from abroad, and in their official reports; only in the 1990s were their full doses estimated correctly.)</p>
<p>I-131 has a pretty short radioactive half-life (8 days, making it pretty active), but can linger in you for several weeks. It goes into your thyroid gland. However, it is also excreted by the body in sweat, urine, and other bodily fluids (it has a 12 day biological half-life from the thyroid). So people near the fluids of people who are excreting I-131 could also uptake I-131 themselves.</p>
<p>In patients who receive I-131 as part of cancer therapy, there are guidelines for how to avoid contaminating medical staff and (especially for those who are out-patients) your family and caretakers. So it's not just hypothetical that this is a route of potential exposure. Pregnant mothers are indeed particularly vulnerable to this kind of contamination, and there are some modes in which a developing fetus can selectively over-absorb certain environmental substances. </p>
<p>How much of a dose are we talking about for the exposures of the firefighters at Chernobyl? I don't know. There aren't any numbers on this. I've been looking into it a bit, because without the numbers you can't determine between &quot;yes, this is a real hazard that could have been an issue&quot; versus &quot;no, this is a trivial amount of secondary contamination.&quot; The difficulty in calculating this is that you're talking about two different simultaneous processes (biological half-life and radioactive half-life), plus the real-world characteristics of reabsorption. The only numbers that are out there to go off are for much lower dosages of I-131 than some of the firefighters had.</p>
<p>The writers, for what it is worth, took the scenario for #2 from an oral history interview with the woman who says she experienced it. That doesn't mean it happened exactly as she remembers it, or was told. </p>
<p>I don't remember scenario #1 from the show. It sounds less plausible on the face of it — the amount of radiation you'd need to emit to cause radiation burns on someone else would be enough to melt you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
