<p>and &quot;solid&quot; granite (or other natural stone, like marble, quartz, etc) countertops are extremely expensive.  but a lot of the times the &quot;granite&quot; counter top is just a thin layering on top with the bottom part just wood or other material, kind of like how jewelry has the &quot;gold-plated&quot; variety vs the &quot;solid&quot; gold variety.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a contractor, but I am a geologist, and I've been helping my mom redo her kitchen. First of all, granite can be really pretty, and adds a lot from an aesthetic standpoint. It's on the expensive side, but it's also stone, so it can handle having a hot pot set down on it better than most other materials can. After all, what's even a 500°F cast iron skillet when granites form somewhere around 1500°F and up? It's also relatively difficult to chip or scratch once it's installed unless you're really putting some effort into it, so it's durable.</p>
<p>Most of the alternatives are man-made products. Laminate, solid surface, and even wood countertops don't deal nearly as well with heat, though they tend to be cheaper. Engineered stone, marketed under different brand names, is what my mom eventually went for. It's less expensive than granite, and more resilient to heat and scratches than the solid surface ones. They don't quite have the aesthetics, but there are some that dont look too bad.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can take a hot pot off the stove and set it on a granite countertop with no damage.  This is much better than a plastic countertop, which would be instantly destroyed.</p>
<p>Granite comes in pieces big enough that the whole counter could be one piece, or at least only a couple of pieces.  This is much better than tile, the other heat resistant option, which has grout lines which can be very difficult to clean.</p>
<p>Granite can be very pretty, with interesting rock formations in it, which it better than man-made quartz countertops, which share granite's other desirable properties.  Frankly, a lot of people prefer quartz, but htat's a regional trend and highly subject to change.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Granite countertops are not the best available, nor are they the worst.  Granite is, however, currently quite trendy, in the US.  When many home shoppers see &quot;granite countertops,&quot; it makes a home seem more appealing and desirable.  And there are many other such features that are seen as trendy and desirable, such as &quot;barn-door-style sliding doors&quot; and &quot;farmhouse sinks&quot; and &quot;stainless-steel appliances.&quot;  When people see certain features mentioned in a home description, they are more likely to want to see and maybe purchase the house, which leads more people to install and advertise such features, before listing a house for sale.  Ultimately, it's simple salesmanship--giving the people what they want.</p>
<p>If you're still curious, here's a good article from Zillow, explaining certain currently desirable home features.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Granite has a number of advantages...and a few disadvantages.</p>
<p>Advantages are a smooth surface that doesn't give off a ton of heat (so even if you put a hot pan on the countertop you're unlikely to burn yourself) and is resistant to heat and all kinds of abrasion. The disadvantages are that it can crack and it's porous (so it needs to be resealed every now and then to prevent it from staining or becoming a magnet for bacteria). An additional disadvantage is that if the countertop is a complex shape then it will have to be made from multiple blocks of granite.</p>
<p>That generally makes it superior or equivalent to most other countertop materials (certainly superior to laminate, wood or marble). For pure utilitarianism a concrete mix (you can get a really nice finish on concrete if you mix it with the right materials) can usually match all the advantages of a granite countertop. &quot;Concrete countertop&quot; doesn't sound very nice when you're trying to sell the house though.</p>
<p>For commercial kitchens steel is usually the superior choice, since it's easier to keep hygienic. The disadvantage of steel is of course that it will show any stains or deposites. If your tapwater is somewhat alkaline a steel countertop is basically cleaning hell (which is a pro in a commercial kitchen but not that desirable in your home).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
