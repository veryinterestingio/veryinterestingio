		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Besides what the person before me said, our devices don't actually know how much time the battery has left. Yup. They just measure voltage and compare how much time your battery usually lasts. So it's literally a really rough estimative. That's why some devices show 1% battery and end up lasting a tad longer than you would expect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Batteries die slowly and then fall off a cliff. As you get closer to that cliff, the voltage put out by the battery slowly degrades from say 12.5V to 12.3V (Numbers are just for illustration). </p>
<p>Based on your laptop's experience and expectations, it'll guess that a) the cliff is just past 12.2V and b) it takes roughly an hour to go from 12.3V to 12.2V.</p>
<p>So, the laptop might tell you that it expects another hour before it's dead.</p>
<p>BUT as the battery gets older, the cliff might move up. This can result in the device overestimating how much longer it can run before the battery quits. This is usually the cause.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Estimates of how much battery is left make use of historical information, and can’t see the future. If your laptop estimates 2h37m left based on you idling on Facebook, then you start playing intense video games, the estimation is instantly invalidated and it will take time to catch up to how much power it’s being asked to used. </p>
<p>Conversely, if it estimates you have 5 minutes left while you’re gaming, but you close your game and go on Facebook, your battery might last another 30 minutes since you’ve changed your usage pattern. </p>
<p>Unfortunately this process can seem like magic at times because modern computers have so much bloat installed on them running in the background that you don’t usually have an intuitive sense of how much compute power you’re using. Still, the idea isn’t very complicated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Check your Power Plan settings (including the advanced settings) <em>e.g. in Windows 10 :</em></p>
<p><em>Additional Power Settings (Control Panel\Hardware and Sound\Power Options)  &gt; Change Advanced Power Settings</em></p>
<p>It is possible that your power plan is set to put the screen/computer/disk to Sleep when the battery hits 20% or 10% or somesuch (i.e. when there is theoretically a fair bit of battery left).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to other posters, different tasks take different amounts of power. If you are working on a document and the computers says you have two hours left, you might actually have close to that. If you are streaming videos with sound that battery will drain much faster than the estimated time left.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
