		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like others have said, probably not. From what we know of human development going from Africa to Europe skin changes did occur but the time estimates between small landmark changes are spaced by several thousand years, and that wasn't entirely due to changes in UV exposure but also dietary deficiencies. To have a chance of seeing significant adaptations you would likely need a significant population growing in space over many many generations. In all reality the best results I'd expect within the &lt; ~10,000 year timeframe is a shift to darker skin pigmentation. Over a longer timeframe different more novel adaptations might happen but that's anyone's guess.</p>
<p>Edit: Just wanted to add that in the short term there may be changes that occur pretty much immediately as the result of some unknown or poorly understood pathways or increased expression of certain genes to help cope as well as epigenetic changes that carry on to successive generations. This all assumes that the lack of gravity still permits human reproduction and that offspring would then live long enough and be capable of reproduction. I don't know much about the state of research on animal reproduction in space so I can' t give much more than an educated guess on that side of things. </p>
<p>Suffice to say I think it is likely that the UV exposure would be the least of a humans concerns developing in 0g (how do you make a baby develop muscle mass when it takes little effort to lift their head or move?)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>1) Lamarck got it wrong and Darwin got it right. Being born in X doesn't make you better at X. However, if 1M people are born in X then most will die, but after generations the survivors will be better at X. So it's no benefit to you directly.</p>
<p>2) Physicists have a joke that all chemistry is just 13.4eV physics. What they means is that to cause a chemical reaction you have to change electron potentials, so if you put more than 13.4eV into a Hydrogen electron, you give it so much energy that it doesn't change the electron level - it kicks the electron out all together and forms plasma. No molecule containing Hydrogen can withstand a hit of &gt; 13.4eV and survive (actually the real number for organic chemical bonds is <em>much</em> lower, like ~1eV). Space radiation is usually in the millions to billions of eV. Whatever you do, DNA will be damaged in that environment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm interpreting the question pretty literally, and not assuming you mean anything about evolution. Answering the implicit question: The only mechanism humans have for increasing resistance to UV is melanin. Skin colour. You can tan or just be born with dark skin. </p>
<p>IR radiation isn't harmful except when the amount of heat it conveys is a problem. People who grow up in warm environments have more active sweat glands, so...it depends how hot the vessel you were raised in was, relative to where you were actually raised. But that seems like a cheat answer.</p>
<p>Answering the question as asked, assuming the vessel I was raised on was similar to current technology: No. Modern spacecraft don't have a lot of windows to begin with, and the windows they do have block UV more than the atmosphere does. Being that I would never develop any sort of tan in that environment, I'd be worse at resisting UV radiation than I am now. </p>
<p>But even without trying to be snarky and saying &quot;if you were born in space, you'd immediately die because space is incompatible with human life&quot;, the question requires specification if it were to go beyond UV and IR (which are pretty universally protected against by anyone venturing into space). A lot of modern spacecraft are fairly similar in terms of their protections, but they're not the same, and we have the technology to remove some of the health concerns about long-term existence in space already. They're just expensive and unnecessary right now. There isn't really an &quot;In space&quot; <em>standard</em>. It sort of has to be &quot;in the ISS&quot; or some other specific vessel, or set of technologies. By some accounts, we <em>were</em> born in space. Our spaceship is just really big and only goes in a circle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Infrared radiation isn't a problem for humans, beyond the pure heat. That's pretty easy to deal with in most situations. Heat can be a challenge in spacecraft design, but once a spacecraft is built it's a solved problem the astronaut doesn't have to worry about.</p>
<p>UV radiation is ionizing and can cause cancer etc. but is still not very difficult to deal with; it doesn't take <em>that</em> much to block.</p>
<p>Other types of ionizing radiation in space are much more problematic because they're harder to block.</p>
<p>So living in a space station or Moon/Mars colony wouldn't really be any different from Earth in regard to IR or UV radiation. But you might be exposed to higher intensities of other forms of radiation.</p>
<p>It would not really change your resistance to that radiation, however. Ionizing radiation is not something you can build immunity against as an individual. Your cells have a certain capacity to repair DNA, and that isn't boosted by more exposure to ionizing radiation. You could have an evolutionary selection pressure to improve DNA repair, but that would take generations to manifest, and require some portion of current-generation individuals to either die or at least have a reduced ability to reproduce.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
