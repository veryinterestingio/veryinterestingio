		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Go for it. You'll lose money in the long run.</p>
<p>There's 32 teams, so that's a $32 bet. You'd need one of the teams with odds greater than +3200 to win for you to make money. Otherwise, you'd lose.</p>
<p>If I bet $1 on a team with +350 odds, I will win my $1 back plus an additional $3.5 dollars. That doesn't offset the $32 I spent on the other teams.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The odds and mathematics will have you lose money overall. So it makes no financial sense to do that. (At least, that’s the case for European sports but I’m fairly sure the same applies to US sports without having checked the actual numbers)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
