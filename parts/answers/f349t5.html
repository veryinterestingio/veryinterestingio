		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not cost effective to extract yet and is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertile_material" target="_blank">fertile</a>, but not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fissile_material" target="_blank">fissile</a>, but you can derive the U-233 isotope from it. Here's an excerpt from a good article on the subject : </p>
<p><em>All thorium fuel concepts therefore require that Th-232 is first irradiated in a reactor to provide the necessary neutron dosing to produce protactinium-233. The Pa-233 that is produced can either be chemically separated from the parent thorium fuel and the decay product U-233 then recycled into new fuel, or the U-233 may be usable ‘in-situ’ in the same fuel form, especially in molten salt reactors (MSRs).</em></p>
<p><em>Thorium fuels therefore need a fissile material as a ‘driver’ so that a chain reaction (and thus supply of surplus neutrons) can be maintained. The only fissile driver options are U-233, U-235 or Pu-239. (None of these is easy to supply)</em></p>
<p><em>It is possible – but quite difficult – to design thorium fuels that produce more U-233 in thermal reactors than the fissile material they consume (this is referred to as having a fissile conversion ratio of more than 1.0 and is also called breeding). Thermal breeding with thorium requires that the neutron economy in the reactor has to be very good (ie, there must be low neutron loss through escape or parasitic absorption). The possibility to breed fissile material in slow neutron systems is a unique feature for thorium-based fuels and is not possible with uranium fuels.</em></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I didn't see it mentioned but the purposed way of running thorium in reactors is in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molten_salt_reactor" target="_blank">molten salt reactor</a>.  Corrosion is a big problem with these designs as the salts can eat away at stainless steel and after a few thousand hours. This presents a problem with contamination and weakening of the parts the salt comes into contact with. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the breeding process to convert thorium-232 to uranium-233 is very difficult because of the presence of a poisoning intermediatry.  The protactinium that is produced needs to be removed and allowed to become uranium which takes a while. If its left in and catches another neutron it decays along a route that isn't fissile.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In solid fuel reactors like our entire existing fleet, thorium is a shitty fuel. It gets much less burnup (energy per ton of fuel) because of parasitic effects in the breeding process. For thorium to be worthwhile, you need to reprocess the fuel. Pretty much nobody does reprocessing, except France in limited capacity. </p>
<p>LFTR uses a molten liquid reactor core, so you can reprocess the fuel while the reactor is operating, allowing you to take fission products and other “poisons” out, and to firmly control the enrichment level and available reactivity. This is very hard to do though which is why we don’t have any approved or even ready to license LFTR designs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For historical reasons.<br />
The most development was done on light water reactors and thats the tech we have now.<br />
Light water reactors can easily synthesise suitable isotopes for weapons production.<br />
Light water reactors are suitable for lightweight reactors such as on warships.  </p>
<p>Yes there has been much development in breeder reactors but they have not been widely implemented, people just stick with what they know.... and governments all started wanting bomb material</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
