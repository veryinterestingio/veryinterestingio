		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If memory serves yes, I could be wrong on this but I seem to remember elephants are a particularly good example for this.</p>
<p>I saw a video ages ago where a family group of elephants were somewhere muddy, the baby elephant (calf?) got stuck in the mud, the mother was going mental and couldn't get it unstuck. The 'grandma' came over and showed her how to use her trunk to pull it out.</p>
<p>I can't provide evidence of this but I seem to remember 'grandparents' are often help out with child rearing because they're the most experienced in the pack/herd/social group.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
