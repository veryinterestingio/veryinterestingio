		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you learn something or make a memory, your brain actually changes a bit. New synaptic connections are made, or are strengthened by the interactions of neurotransmitters and synapses. You create a new neural &quot;circuit&quot;. These can be of variable strength.</p>
<p>But you are constantly experiencing things that you don't need to retain. They either don't form a new circuit that is strong enough to last long, or never get passed from short-term memory into long-term. The connections are not made or are too weak to persist.  </p>
<p>Memories must be occasionally accessed to persist, or they can decay. There's also evidence that accessing a memory destroys or damages it, and it must be re-written. We don't remember things, we remember memories of memories.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A thought is not a static thing, its a process, a continually changing event.</p>
<p>- In our brains, a signal takes the form of neurons activating other neurons. Compared to an electrical impulse, this is a slow process (but still very fast compared to pretty much anything else). </p>
<p>- So when you are 'mid-thought', you are at a point where many of your neurons are activated, and they are each about to activate other neurons.</p>
<p>- A person with a certain thought in their head will continually change the way they are thinking about it. They will consider it from different angles, and in different contexts.</p>
<p>- Eventually they will get distracted by something else, and the thought will stop circulating in their head.</p>
<p>- Asking 'where did the thought go' doesn't really make sense, because the thought was an <em>event,</em> not a <em>thing</em>. It's like asking 'where did the weekend go'. It didn't go anywhere, it's just over.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That thought is silently discarded if you're not paying attention.  If you're paying attention, it goes into short-term, if the thought is valid, it gets moved to mid-term memory, if it's worth remembering, it goes to long.</p>
<p>Bits and pieces of short-term get re-filed as long-term immediately, thus deja vu.  Sometimes short-term is never touched and you only get long-term but it is disconnected until you find the puzzle piece.</p>
<p>If you're reading, but thinking about something else, sometimes it's really just silent discard.  You might remember a bit of the gist but no details.</p>
<p>Think of it like a firewall doing a silent discard.  There's a record that the packet was discarded, but the content is meaningless.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
