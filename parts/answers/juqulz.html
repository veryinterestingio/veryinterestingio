		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Studies have shown it is likely several reasons: breathing (abdominal fat pushing on the diaphragm), weakened immune system (fat cells in the spleen, bone marrow and thymus leads to impaired function), clotting (obesity increases clotting, and covid triggers clots), inflammation, and delayed care-seeking (people with obesity tend to delay seeking care).</p>
<p>This article in <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/09/why-covid-19-more-deadly-people-obesity-even-if-theyre-young" target="_blank">Science</a> has a very good overview of the existing literature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ICU doctor here. I can tell you that one of the biggest challenges is ventilation. You have to generate far higher pressures in order to ventilate the lungs due to the weight of the abdomen and chest wall. Also in general, obese patients are far more challenging to examine for new medical issues or complications. They are also more likely to develop severe bedsores. In the recovery phase (which really starts simultaneously on day 0), it is far more challenging to get them up and moving and working with physiotherapy.</p>
<p>Just some extra things to mention on top of all the other ones mentioned.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone's touched on the main things about the general unhealthiness of being obese, and how it ties into respiratory issues, hypertension, heart failure, diabetes, etc etc.</p>
<p>There's actually another reason too- in a study by the Mayo Clinic, they found that
&quot;Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expression in adipose tissue is higher than that in lung tissue, which means that adipose tissue may be vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. Obese patients also have worse outcomes with COVID-19 infection, including respiratory failure, need for mechanical ventilation, and higher mortality&quot;</p>
<p>Adipose (fat tissue) by nature of its composition is actually more susceptible to covid infection and propagation. Once sick, then the other stuff kicks in.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People who are overweight or diabetic (or both) are in a constant state of inflammation. Over the years, your immune system becomes accustomed to fighting of that particular problem, in particular ways. However, journal articles have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 requires a different type of immune response that your body does not prefer to mount, as it’s been conditioned to respond in ways that are beneficial to stave off the effects of obesity, but not this virus. Or, one could say your body is used to fighting off wood fires and this is a grease fire, but still tries to throw water on the grease fire because it’s not used to dealing with this threat. </p>
<p>Beyond dysregulated immune response, obesity worsens your risk for SARS-CoV-2 and many other diseases because a lot medication was not designed to be given to overweight people. They were tested on people at lower weights. And it’s not as simple as giving the patient more just because they weigh more. Also, X-rays are more difficult with overweight patients. The fat distorts the image, preventing doctors from getting a clear look at what’s going on in your lungs. Respiratory patients often have to be pronated (flipped to lie on their stomachs), which is complicated because a 110lb nurse can’t flip a 300 pound man on her own, so now you need a team to accomplish something. </p>
<p>TL, DR: Obesity results in a dysregulated immune system that makes susceptible to disease, and complicates treatment by reducing the effectiveness of medication, imaging techniques, and hospital care.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Partly, but they are other reasons.  </p>
<p>When you look at people with increase risk of severe case of COVID-19, those with increase risk came in two form - those that has &quot;weaker&quot; immune system, and those that has trouble breathing in the first place.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Obesity fit both group. As other comments said, obese people tend to have less effective immune system, for complicated reasons. Also, thick fat layer can restrict chest wall expansion, thus having less effective respiratory system in the first place as well, which can make COVID symptom, itself a <em>respiratory</em> disease, worse.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
