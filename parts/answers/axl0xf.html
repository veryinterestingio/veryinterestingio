		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your phone has a three-axis accelerometer in it, which reads the force of acceleration in three orthogonal directions (think up/down, left/right, back/front although these designations vary with regard to the phone's orientation in the world they're always 90 degrees from one another).</p>
<p>When you make a footstep, it creates an impact event - a high frequency sudden shift in acceleration. The phone detects these impact events and marks them as footsteps.</p>
<p>If you're also detecting how far you travel, further signal processing is used to determine the zero-velocity point to pair with the impact events to determine how far you've travelled. Gyroscopes on the phone can then determine which direction you've traveled.</p>
<p>If your application is really sophisticated, it will also 'fuse' this information with GPS location data to allow constantly re-calibration against sensor drift.</p>
<p>In terms of accuracy, it's fairly accurate unless something is specifically interfering with the sensor readings. For example, if you're riding on a train, the rumbling of the train can sometimes create impact events that simulate footsteps. There's no way to perfectly detect footsteps, but decent signal processing can reduce the error rate down substantially.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It isn't tracking actual steps, but sudden changes in direction the phone has moved.  The pattern of those changes is predictable, so phone are able to distinguish steps from other types of movement.  It is not perfect &amp; can be faked, so it's not too terribly accurate, but enough to get the job done.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
