		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We diverged from the same primate line with Neanderthals becoming their own species when they became isolated. We HAVE a complete genome for Neanderthals already due to fossil records. After we had that complete genome then they compared it to samples from (present day) Homosapiens across the globe and found that 2-3% is where overlap occurs between the two sequences. However, not EVERYONE has Neanderthal DNA in them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The cost and complications that would arise (if the entire genome was preserved in our living DNA) would make it incredibly impractical. We already have the genome from naturally perserved specimens, so there isn't really a reason to even try this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
