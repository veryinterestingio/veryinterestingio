		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>England is one of the four countries of the U.K. The other three are Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>England, Scotland, and Wales are to be found on an island called Britain, or Great Britain. Northern Ireland is on a separate island called Ireland.</p>
<p>With me so far?</p>
<p>The confusion arises because people often use the terms UK and Britain interchangeably when referring to the UK. Americans tend to use England as well, again when referring to the UK.</p>
<p>The full country name is: The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. So you see how the U.K. and Great Britain are different. Great Britain (and island comprised of England, Scotland, and Wales) plus Northern Ireland, together make up the U.K.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
