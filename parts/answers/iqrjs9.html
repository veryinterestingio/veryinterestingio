		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't know. people back there knew little about viruses and there was no testing..PCR came in 1984. The time of infection up to the appearance of the clinical symptoms is called incubatory carrier state. It is debatable if people are in fact infectious during this stage. Probably not since the virus is actively replicating but the titer is not high enough to spread. After the resolution of the infection there is a period during which the person is free of symptoms but its still able to shed virions. This is called convalescent carrier state. The person can infect other people if the viral minima infectious dose (MID) is low, it also depends on the viral stability within the environment (closed spaces are better than open environments). Also over time, as the virus jumps from host to host it gets attenuated.</p>
<p>The viral symptoms can vary from none to diffuse alveolar damage (if the virus infects the lung)..thus the answer to the question is ...most likely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes it did, the numbers will never be known though since the government had no testing capabilities like we have today.
Asymptomatic infections happen because of the  slight differences in the immune system from person to person that are caused by genetic variation.
Some people are just bound to have a immune system that has a better handle on the disease than average. The same thing can be seen with most viral or bacterial infections, and has been observed even in people with HIV.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can't know for sure, but 1918 flu was an H1N1 virus, a subtype of Influenza A. Other strains of H1N1 have been responsible for repeated seasonal outbreaks, with studies of asymptomatic cases from those outbreaks.</p>
<p>One example studying asymptomatic peds cases from 2005-2006 seasonal flu in Taiwan:
<a href="https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2334-14-80" target="_blank">https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2334-14-80</a></p>
<p>Here is a meta analysis covering various flu types:
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4586318/#:~:text=In%20outbreak%20investigations%20where%20infections,adjusted%20for%20illness%20from%20other" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4586318/#:~:text=In%20outbreak%20investigations%20where%20infections,adjusted%20for%20illness%20from%20other</a></p>
<p>EDIT--also asymptomatic cases of 2009 Swine Flu (also H1N1) are well documented, e.g., <a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2011/08/study-puts-global-2009-h1n1-infection-rate-11-21" target="_blank">https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2011/08/study-puts-global-2009-h1n1-infection-rate-11-21</a></p>
<p>So we can't say 100% for 1918 outbreak, but it seems reasonable to conclude that there were asymptomatic cases given that asymptomatic infection is generally observed in H1N1 viral infections.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
