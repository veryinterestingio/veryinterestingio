		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's two things to note here:</p>
<p>1.</p>
<p>The human body doesn't feel absolute temperature, what you feel is how much heat is entering (hot) or leaving (cold) your body (That's why metals always feel a lot hotter or colder than their surrounding, high heat conductivity). </p>
<p>So in the case of your breath, the air comes out faster on the &quot;Hoo&quot; sound. A faster flow of air will carry more heat away from your hand via convection. As someone else pointed out, it is the same reason a fan cools you down even though the air doesn't get any colder. </p>

<p>The reason the &quot;Hoo&quot; sound produces a faster airflow than the &quot;Haa&quot; sound for the same effort has to do with the opening size in your throat. If your lungs are pushing the same amount of air in both instances, the air will have to come out faster if the opening is smaller. </p>
<p>Think of a garden hose when partially block the opening with your thumb, the water comes out faster!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you do a &quot;hoo&quot;, the air is coming out from a very small opening which gives it a higher chance to mix with the air around it and cool down.</p>
<p>When you do a &quot;haa&quot;, the air is coming out at a larger volume and needs more time to cool down.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>
Put your finger right in front your mouth when doing a &quot;hoo&quot; and you will sense that it's actually just as hot as a &quot;haa&quot;, but cools much faster a few cms away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
