		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dryer sheets are fabric squares soaked in fabric softener (either quaternary ammonium salts or silicone oil).
As the dryer blows hot air through all the clothes and mixes them around, the fabric softener very lightly coats all of the load. This thin coating of softener gives the laundry the nice scent and the positively charged chemicals (cations) help equalize the electrons building up from all the clothing rubbing against each other. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Heat and tumbling is what de-wrinkles clothing in the dryer. The heat relaxes the fabric threads, and the tumbling motion flexes them repeatedly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wow, all these comments, and not a one mentions paraffin. The wax in the dryer sheet does a lot of the work, such as keeping the softener from spoiling, and the fragrances stay longer. It also helps with making the barrier against static from forming, by lubricating the fabric, and reducing wrinkles, by making ther fabric stiffer.</p>
<p>It's also the main reason why you should never use more than one sheet per load. The excess will coat the inside of your dryer, make your lint burn longer if it ignites, and blocks your moisture sensor from reading the humidity in your clothes, so your automatic cycle stops working. The last thing can be fixed easily by taking some fine grit sand paper, and lightly sanding the sensor bars.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
