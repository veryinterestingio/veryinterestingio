Now a line of soldiers comes marching through in a straight line.  The soldiers are pushing people aside, but each person is still in one piece.  The crowd is split in two, but no one member of the crowd is changed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>But the atoms can't move away either, since it's a rigid solid. (Please correct me if I'm wrong).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They indeed can. All solids are somewhat springy, even if it's a tiny tiny amount. Even the bonds between the atoms of a molecule are springy (this is quite important for some chemical reactions, since these &quot;springs&quot; can store additional energy).</p>
<p>When you cut something, you likely just separate the molecules from each other. If those molecules are very long (e.g. polymers or DNA), you may also rip the molecules themselves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No object is truly rigid. You can say a piece of rebar is rigid compared to a stick because one visibly bends in the wind and another doesnâ€™t. the reality is that all forces are transmitted through the bonds between atoms/molecules stretching or squeezing. Like elastic bands these bonds can only stretch so far before snapping. And like play dough or cookies they can only take so much compression before they slip past each other and/or crack and break. </p>
<p>A knife cutting an object compresses the material beneath it while putting the material on either side of the blade in tension. So first the bonds are locally disrupted by the tip causing them to slip and a crack to form, then the crack is pushed apart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nothing is really rigid, in most solids the atoms are held together with electromagnetic  forces that can extend and contract under external stress. Metals particularly are ductile and layers of atoms can slip over each other, forming new bonds with adjacent atoms as they move away from the original one. In some cases, like plastics, whole chains of atoms can slide, stretching out as the material is pulled.</p>
<p>The closest you can get to rigidity is probably a crystal like diamond. Hit it with a hard knife edge and it cleaves apart along a plane of atoms to give the facet of  jewel. Because the atoms are arranged in a regular pattern there are particular directions that are weaker than others so bonds break along that line.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
