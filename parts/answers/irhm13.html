		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in the world of gastroenteric epidemiology and I can tell you the school/daycare closures, restaurant closures, and visitation restrictions in hospitals and nursing homes have had a huge effect on the circulation of stomach bugs. For example, NoroSTAT is a CDC surveillance system that tracks all Norovirus outbreaks reported to participating state health departments, and it shows that <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/reporting/norostat/data.html" target="_blank">outbreaks dropped to near zero after lockdowns this spring.</a> Other surveillance systems have shown similar patterns. Masks and hand hygiene help with many diseases, but I think the biggest contributor has been the shutdown of key settings. Schools and nursing homes are major settings for outbreaks across the spectrum of infectious diseases, so keeping the germy kiddos away from each other and away from the elderly has had a huge impact across most infectious diseases.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Compared to previous year there has been 74% less norovirus cases. (source: <a href="https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-11401622" target="_blank">https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-11401622</a> ).
