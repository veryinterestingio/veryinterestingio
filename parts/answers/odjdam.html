		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They do exist, for example, your funny bone, technically the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_nerve" target="_blank">Ulnar nerve</a>, is a big chunk of nerve tissue unprotected by significant amounts of muscle or bone, and when struck can produce a electric-shock-like or numbing sensation, which I'm sure you've experienced. If not, don't rush out and try it, it's unpleasant.</p>
<p>That said, the ability of someone to exploit these pressure point in a fight is highly overblown. When you're in a fight, your body is flooded with adrenaline and endorphins, which override pain signals which would otherwise cause you to react differently, so that you can continue to fight (or run, as the case may be).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I haven't seen anyone mention the sympathetic chain and carotid sinus in the neck.  Like most replies, I would agree, it isn't exactly a magic spot. But if you strike the carotid sinus hard it'll mess with blood pressure to the head and make someone pass out or drop.  Sympathetic chain can elicit some weird symptoms as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
