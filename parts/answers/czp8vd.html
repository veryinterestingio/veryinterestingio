<p>There are many, many sources and causes of headaches. The location and type of symptoms are the main things we look for in coming up with a diagnosis. For example, migraines are typically one-sided and throbbing while hemicrania headaches involve one side but are more continuous. Cervicogenic(meaning, from the neck) headaches typically involve the back of the head. Tension headaches typically feel like a band across the head. Cluster headaches involve very intense pain behind an eye. There are many other types, as well.</p>
<p>Going into the actual mechanism behind all of these is a huge topic and not fully understood -- but each of them has very different pathologies, prognosis, and treat treatment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Headaches occur for many reasons, mainly due to overactive blood vessels and nerves. Aside from blunt trauma (concussions), headaches arise mainly in brain areas that work with cognition (front of the brain) and sight (back of the brain).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Hi doc - UK national now resident in the USA. Why is it that the Brits can get paracetamol  &amp; codeine over the counter (with some grown up warnings about dependency), but it needs a prescription in the US? It's the only thing that really kicks in hard on certain painful headaches. (Travelers - highly recommended to pick up a pack of these in Heathrow on the way back home ... unless you live in places that are anti-codeine!)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My migraines are not &quot;in the head&quot;, but they seem to be irritated, or inflamed nerves which are on the forehead/face. It is my understanding that many migraines are actually involving nerves. (Google  supratrochlear nerves or  supraorbital nerves, and you see these two nerves).</p>
<p>There seems to be a link between the frowning/squinching muscles on the forehead (right above the eyes), which is also the location where these nerves are located. This is why some people get botox shots in this area, which act as local anesthesia that &quot;blocks&quot; these nerves and relaxes these muscles so they won't trigger migraines from squinching or reading etc.</p>
<p>Another theory is that these nerves (which seem to be the cause for many types of migraines) are compressed by muscle tissue or being irritated in some other way. This is why some people get surgery which decompresses/frees these nerves and which stops their migraines.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
