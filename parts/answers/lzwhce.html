		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>i actually JUST discovered this cool youtube channel that deals with anatomy and they have a video on this: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHV9E1uz15E" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHV9E1uz15E" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHV9E1uz15E</a></a>. In short, it's just sealed off with connective tissues.</p>
<p>EDIT: fair warning, as /u/filthybaker points out, the video does show a real human cadaver dissection</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have the remnants of structures you used as a fetus i.e. the ductus venosus and the umbical blood vessels. These were used to connect you to the placenta to allow gas exchange and to allow your mother to supply you with nutrients and you to give her waste products. </p>
<p>The structures these become are the ligaments such as the ligamentum teres. A side note is the urachus which is the embryological remnant of a channel on the superior edge of the bladder.</p>
<p>You have many other ligaments in your body which are remnants of fetal structures such as the ductus arteriosus which becomes the ligamentum arteriosum </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There used to be three blood vessels in the umbilical cord, 1 vein that brought the blood from the mother to the embryo, this connects to your liver vein. And 2 arteries that brought the blood from the embryo back to the mother, these come from big arteries in your pelvis. All these vessels are now obliterated (shriveled up), so no blood is flowing through anymore.
One last structure is the urachus, this is another embryonal structure that used to run from the kidneys into the placenta. </p>
<p>If you look inside the stomach, you see your peritoneum (the sack in which most your organs lie) and within this ligament you see 4 ridges that hold these shriveled up structures. It's quite unspectacular actually.
