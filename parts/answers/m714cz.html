		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part of the problem is, &quot;static&quot; is a reference to time. It's a bit like saying, if I'm falling off a cliff next to another person, will he not be moving relative to me? You're just sort of asking a question from within its own frame of reference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's a tough question for ELI5, but when you study the mathematics that physics is built upon, it treats time exactly like a 4th dimension of space. There is no fundamental specialness to &quot;now&quot; vs. &quot;then&quot; vs. &quot;the future&quot;. In other words, the mathematics describing something moving left to the right is the same as something moving right to the left, just backwards. Physics treats time the same way. </p>
<p>As I understand it, the reason why time seems to flow, and to flow in a specific direction, hinges on a concept called &quot;entropy&quot; which comes from a branch of physics called &quot;thermodynamics&quot; and describes the flow of energy. Whenever energy moves, say from nuclear forces in the atoms of the Sun, to light, to solar cells on your roof, to light in your lightbulbs, some of that energy is always <em>lost.</em> Since that energy is lost you can't just reverse time and &quot;send&quot; the energy back into the Sun, it's gone and lost forever. That overall trend of losing energy is what forces us onwards in &quot;the passage of time&quot; and we can't just make a time machine to go back.</p>
<p>Going deeper, &quot;the world just a collection of static 4th dimensional objects&quot; you're getting into advanced physics and existential philosophy. Definitely not the realm of ELI5.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of responses will be talking about spacetime, which is fine. But there's a different reason the answer is &quot;No. At least not right now.&quot;</p>
<p>If there were 100 pennies on a tray, and I shook it up and down, you'd be surprised to see only 3 heads and 97 tails. It's very, very unlikely. </p>
<p>You'd (correctly) assume I set it up such that they were all tails, and I've only shaken it a couple times.</p>
<p>This is essentially what we see in the universe right now. What we currently see is a very, very unlikely configuration. And as we keep checking, we see it inching closer and closer to the most likely configuration. This inching closer is what we perceive as the passage of time. No spacetime or relativity required.</p>
<hr />
<p>Back to the pennies: If, instead, you saw 50 heads and 50 tails and I kept shaking them, they'd stay around 50/50. No evolving towards the most likely configuration. It's already there. In this universe of pennies, there is no passage of time.</p>
<p>Eventually, our actual universe will reach its most likely configuration and time will stop. There will be nothing to evolve. Everything is in equilibrium. Some call it the heat death of the universe.</p>
<p>If we look back to your idea that I had set up the pennies as all tails, we have the same idea about our universe. We're in a very unlikely universe now, and evolving towards the most likely universe. We can connect the dots and find that we must have been in an even less likely configuration before. This idea is called the Past Hypothesis. It likely connects to the Big Bang, but we're not sure how.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've been reading your responses to other explanations. It seems that you are looking into causality, entropy, and information loss, which are not the same as time or randomness. Physics and philosophy rarely speak the same language. Your question is extremely complex in physics, and it touches on multiple theories. I adore PBS Spacetime on YouTube, which attempts to explain physics at an intermediate level. I am a layman, but they are not. There are many episodes devoted to your question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes I think one theory is that from an external point of view. The universe is like a big loaf of bread. Each slices containing the whole universe at one instant. The whole loaf containing the whole universe past and future included. Everything that ever happened and will ever happen. We're just somewhere in the middle perceiving time one slice after the other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
