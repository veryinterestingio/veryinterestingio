		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Surgical cuts are made as to minimize the damage as much as possible. </p>
<p>That means avoiding nerves and tendons, cleaning thoroughly to prevent infection, and removing as little skin as possible, so the body recovers as fast as it can. </p>
<p>Random cuts are, well, random. They may damage the nerves on the area, destroy big amounts of skin, get something inside that the body will have to fight to clean(hot and swelling is a classic symptom of this).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I have been on a backpain management program for the past 3 weeks and I have a little insight. </p>
<p>Pain isn't just pain, it's nerve signals, a &quot;warning&quot; however that is all it really is. </p>
<p>The rest is context, previous experience, social setting etc. </p>
<p>Think of this: You are playing some kind of sport, football/rugby/tennis etc. You stub your toe on a post. Do you hop around making tsk tsk tsk sounds or do you notice you did it, and get on with the game? If you did the same at home on a sunday morning you might be in agony. </p>
<p>Pain is complicated and nerve signals themselves are merely a part of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Surgeon most likely used some bupivicaine that lasts around 16 hrs. (Most commonly used in the states, not sure outside) Might start getting a little sore soon. Exparel is pretty pricey and not routinely used yet although it's becoming more common</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
