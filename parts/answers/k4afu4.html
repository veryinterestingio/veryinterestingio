		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Narcissism is usually pretty apparent to a trained therapist. Not showing any empathy, an excessive need for admiration or praise, inability to see flaws in ones self, grandiosity, superficial charm, manipulative behaviors, steering discussions to ones self, etc are obvious to a professional. The question is whether any/all of those traits rise to the level of clinical diagnosis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People with narcissism (and most other personality disorders) usually think their way of doing things is normal or appropriate, so they often won't actually conceal their traits at all. The characteristics are &quot;ego syntonic&quot;, to use the jargon. </p>
<p>The same goes for many personality traits. You probably don't realise how different your judgements and behaviours are from those of other people in many cases, because your own way of doing things seems obviously correct in the circumstances as you perceive them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>“Shrinks” study templates that explain how patients present themselves during therapy sessions. Narcissist for example tend to make shrinks feel bored (no I’m not joking this is actually something that is often talked about In literature). They rank the shrink based on superficial qualities like looks or gender not on skill. They do not enter therapy to accept themselves but to find the key to being “perfect” and assume the shrink has the answer. Narcissist tend to be dismissive about the therapists curiosity regarding their inner life. They devalue the shrink  whereas depressives over-idealize shrinks by being overly compliant. One common complaint from therapists is that they feel sleepy during sessions with narcissists because the patient by all accounts is quite empty (meaning they lack an “inner life” whereas other personalities disorders tend to be quite colorful and engaging).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mental health doctors can tell when someone is a narcissist because of how the person talks. For example, they will brag a lot, only talk about what their friends and family do for them and not how much they love them, and get very angry fast if they think they're being criticized.</p>
<p>Sometimes people do those things even though they're not narcissists, so doctors have to talk to the person long enough to make sure there isn't another reason for it. </p>
<p>After all that, the doctor might still want to try treating the person for their narcissism and see if it gets better. If it doesn't, the doctor might decide it isn't narcissism and must be something else.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
