		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The harnessing of energy in the form of steam power, electricity, and combustion engines unlocked massive potential for technological development that was simply impossible before, when society largely relied on human and animal muscle-power to power everything.</p>
<p>And not only that, but this harnessing of energy also freed up massive amounts of human <em>labor</em>. In a society where 90% of the population's labor is required to till the land and produce food, there's not much labor available for anything else. But once we can mechanize agriculture and increase the food-production of the land, then the population's labor can instead be directed at other pursuits, building railroads and skyscrapers and great big machines. And these people can be <em>educated</em>, taught to read and write and do math and understand how the world works. Unlocking even more potential for progress and development.</p>
<p>Next is medicine and sanitation. It can't be understated how catastrophic child mortality used to be. In most societies, nearly <em>half</em> of all babies born would die before the age of 5. In many places, the solid majority of people who ever lived would not survive to adulthood. And even people who made it through the gauntlet and survived to adulthood, they were still just <em>decimated</em> constantly by disease. Basically any major wound was likely to be fatal, because it would be infected and eventually kill you. Surgery of any kind was nearly impossible. There were basically no effective medicines beyond a couple of folk remedies that slightly improved symptoms but otherwise didn't do much. No antibiotics whatsoever, all infections had to simply be <em>endured</em>. No sexual protection of any kind besides abstinence. And people lived in absolute filth. Only in part because they didn't understand germs. But even when they did understand cleanliness, they still didn't possess the kind of technology necessary to build sewers to carry their sewage away. And they couldn't banish livestock (constantly shitting in the street) from the city streets, because animals were their only energy source for hauling weights, so epidemics spread through cities constantly, killing huge fractions of the population. Think of how hard it would be for society to function and prosper if top leaders and top scholars were just constantly being randomly wiped out by disease.</p>
<p>EDIT: Really not sure why so many people feel the need to remind me I left out X-important-technology. I never gave the impression this was like a comprehensive and exhaustive explanation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answers you've received are great, but not hitting on what I think is the crux of what you're asking about (that I've read, anyway). </p>
<p>150 odd years ago came the industrial revolution. What's important to realise is that living prior to this demanded a pretty high output of energy to keep warm, fed, and safe. Once you are able to outsource energy requirements to something, even as inefficient as coal, you get a lot more free time. Free time can be used by smart, resourceful people to increase free time by improving the main driver of the industrial revolution: the steam engine. From there, you essentially have a feedback loop of more time means more learning/ingenuity that may have been sidelined before and so on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We are standing on the shoulders of giants. As we create new technologies (or other advances in society), we are able to use those technologies to then create other newer technologies and so on. We built crappy computers that helped us build faster computers that helped us build even faster computers and so on. </p>
<p>Ever heard of The Singularity? It's basically the implied &quot;endpoint&quot; of the rapidly accelerating nature of technology you are asking about. One interpretation is that when we create AI it's going to be able to create a better AI and so on and so forth until the speed at which it evolves at becomes so fast that one day it will basically become advanced way beyond us (and evolving almost near instantly from our PoV) and society/humanity will change almost immediately as a result.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first use of the concept of a &quot;singularity&quot; in the technological context was John von Neumann.[4] Stanislaw Ulam reports a discussion with von Neumann &quot;centered on the accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue&quot;.[5] Subsequent authors have echoed this viewpoint.[3][6]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Edit: RIP inbox. Loving all the discussion! FTR I'm not claiming this is definitely gonna happen, it's just a ton of fun to think about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, in ancient times, if you wanted to, say, invent a car... you needed to invent every single piece of equipment on a car.  Eventually, written language was introduced, so now in order to invent something new, you just had to create the &quot;last&quot; piece that is necessary to make the product... you could start with what everybody has done before you.</p>
<p>Now, written language has been around for millenia, but the number of people who have access to it has exploded exponentially, as well as our ability to share it.  A few hundred years ago, if you wanted to be an inventor, you <em>had</em> to be born to a wealthy family to have time to tinker.  If you wanted to go to college you were elite.  Now, almost any person has access to a tremendous amount of information.</p>
<p>So we have significantly more people, and they're just moving forward on what people before them have done.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Positive feedback loop:</p>
<p>One technology/invention helps with the development of a second, and with each new technology it becomes easier to develop more in different fields that arenâ€™t even directly related to that first or second technology, and things get better at a rate that gets faster and faster.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
