		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as I understand it, the campaigns agree to terms with each other and the stations. If the station or the other campaign demands something they don’t want to do they just won’t do the debate. So the stations adding a mic mute button could essentially lead to both campaigns not participating in the debate at all. After tonight we might have been better off without one, though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because, in my opinion, this Presidential debate is not actually about political discourse.</p>
<p>I would make the assertion that this is more akin to a sporting event: what happens and how the participants behave is less important than how many people are watching.</p>
<p>If the candidates couldn't cut one another off, it would make for a less dramatic experience for the audience.  High drama, particularly this year, is important -- on the whole it raises awareness and gets people who might not ordinarily care roped into a narrative, which, in turn, might get them out to the polls.</p>
<p>Drama is particularly in the interest of Trump, his supporters speak no other language.</p>
<p>So.  While I agree that mic muting would likely be nice, in some form, my belief is that it cannot happen because this presidential debate is not actually about its content.  It is about the drama and the narrative and the presentation.  </p>
<p>It's a performance, not a debate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Muting of a mic means the direct sound is lost BUT with the number of other mics nearby you could still hear something. What it could encourage is more shouting/yelling to get your answer heard and it also encourages partisan voters/fans to claim bias against their candidate for restricting speech - anything not clearly audible could be made up/twisted. It's better to hear everything and use facts to counter conjecture.</p>
<p>I think everyone also hopes that a presidential candidate could act with decorum and the need to have a talking stick isn't necessary... buuuut, here we are.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
