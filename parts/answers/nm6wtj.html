		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How would the number of zoonotic diseases decrease if factory farming would cease to exist?<br />
And how much would it decrease if humans were to not eat any animal products, therefore (I assume) destroying the breeding grounds (farms) and transmission opportunities (contact of humans to other animals) for zoonotic pathogens? </p>
<p>Would it go close to zero or is a big number of these diseases also transmitted in ways other than via farmed animals?<br />
Additionaly: Would the ratio of 'more dangerous' and 'less dangerous' zoonotic diseases change in such a situation?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
