		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These games are designed around having relatively frequent and very noticeable 'rewards' that stimulates chemicals in your brain that make you feel happy or satisfied. Particularly a chemical called dopamine. </p>
<p>Rather than real life where rewards take much longer and are far less in your face.</p>
<p>The brain is sucked into a loop: getting reward 'points' or items or what have you;anticipate getting more rewards, do thing that gives direct and immediate rewards. That's why people can play it for hours. </p>
<p>Accomplishing most irl tasks require much longer periods between reward and anticipation. </p>
<p>//
Tl/Dr : the  in game rewards make your brain release a lot of happy chemicals.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s called variable ratio reinforcement. Most people are familiar with continuous reinforcement through mentioning Paslov’s dog. In variable ratio the reinforcement is more random, but it isn’t actually random. For example when you first sit down at a slot machine you are very likely to be rewarded in the first few pulls, which teaches you reward. This learning schedule is the most effective for creating addiction like behavior because this ‘randomness’ leads our brains to release a larger dose of dopamine when you win. I would say candy crush would fall into this, but Tetris doesn’t really fit next to it. Tetris relies on an intrinsic motivation of skill acquisition for spatial reasoning, but I have tried the Tetris online for Switch (I think it’s called tetris99) and it’s much more random and closer to candy crush.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are specifically crafted to be as addictive as possible. </p>
<p>They figure out how to trigger dopamine release, and then train you to be on a cycle. That is why Candy Crush has limited tries per day. So you don't OD on the dopamine cycle and it loses its appeal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't put Teris and its derivatives into the same category with Candy Crush, though. Tetris has a very good combination of dynamic, tactic and strategic components in a very simple yet very structured game universe. IMO that is what makes it addictive and such a long time survivor. Candy Crush and the likes - just a truckload of dopamine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
