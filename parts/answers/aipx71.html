		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>MA OSHA requires 25cfm/person /occupied space. Companies keep it at the minimum because it's expensive to heat outside air. Office spaces have a limit of 800ppm CO2 before the outside air damper modulated open to 100%.</p>
<p>It would be very expensive to scrub CO2 instead of opening a vent. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would caution against taking a single paper as conclusive evidence of harm from low level CO2 exposure (900-1,400 ppm). To the best of my knowledge, it's still very controverisal how well humans tolerate low-level CO2 (less than 5,000 ppm), and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326040961_On_the_Development_of_Health-Based_Ventilation_Guidelines_Principles_and_Framework#pf12" target="_blank">large evidence-based guidelines have not yet adopted a lower limit</a>.</p>
<p>Regarding the Allen 2016 paper specifically, it has some pretty glaring methodological problems:<br />
1) The experiment ran five different atmospheric conditions, yet all of their cognitive function analyses only included three of the five experimental conditions. This by itself is only mildly problematic, but...</p>
<p>2) The Figure 1 analysis compared &quot;conventional&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, and &quot;green+&quot; while excluding all data from the &quot;Moderate CO2&quot; and &quot;High CO2&quot; conditions.</p>
<p>3) The Figure 2 analysis compared &quot;Green+&quot;, &quot;Moderate CO2&quot;, and &quot;High CO2&quot; while excluding all data from the &quot;Conventional&quot; and &quot;Green&quot; conditions.</p>
<p>4) The &quot;Editor's Note&quot; shows that massive changes were made to the published p-values during the revisions process.</p>
<p>Taken together, this is <em>strong evidence of p-hacking</em>... suggesting that the manuscript authors were unable to reach the conclusion they wanted to by doing their analysis as-planned, so they performed a large # of unplanned subgroup analyses (Many of which were negative, a few of which were positive) and only published the positive ones.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maybe, although it would take a lot of algae (see here to calculate numbers: <a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/w3732e/w3732e06.htm" target="_blank">http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/w3732e/w3732e06.htm</a>). <del>It might be worth borrowing an idea from submarines, which use an amine solution (monoethanolamine, usually) to absorb the carbon dioxide.</del> (since I see your edit says you want to use this in your home, the amine scrubber would be an unwise idea)</p>
