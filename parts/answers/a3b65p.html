		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part of the answer is that often the names basically are the word(s) in the original language.  The idea that names mean something directly sounds weird to you mostly* because names in English were largely taken from other languages (sometimes via a language or two in between) hundreds of years ago. For instance, names like John, Christopher, and Isaac all come from the Bible, which means they are originally from Aramaic, Hebrew or Greek. In their original languages, these names made perfect sense. Christopher, for instance, comes from the Greek words &quot;Cristos&quot; and &quot;phero,&quot; or &quot;bearer of Christ&quot; and comes from a parable about a man who literally carried Christ across a river. Isaac, or Yitschak in Hebrew, comes directly from the Hebrew verb &quot;to laugh&quot; because his mother Sarah didn't expect to get pregnant and laughed when she realized.</p>
<p>Other names are just cool sounding. Zev, Dov, and Arieh are all Hebrew male names that mean wolf, bear, and lion, respectively. A few female examples are Gal, Shir, and Tamar, which mean wave, song, and date (the fruit), respectively.</p>
<p>Do Hebrew speakers find it odd that someone is named &quot;Wave&quot;? No, not at all, just as you aren't confused by someone named Frank or Bob, both of which mean totally other things in English. As with so many things in language, context is key.</p>
<p>*Edit: husband destroyer is just weird on its own</p>
<p>Edit 2: my first gold?! Awesome! So stoked right now. :-)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We do have lots of ancient texts which uses these words and some even explain the words directly. And &quot;husband destroyer&quot; is not any more unusual name then a lot of modern names like Patience, Faith, August, Angel, etc. However most modern names are traditional and even in other languages and the meaning is lost to us. But in the ancient world it was more common to have names that would be a word of phrase in the language as they did not have the big pool of names to draw from.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In ancient greece was this woman literally called husband-destroyer?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This woman wasn't a real person, she was a mythological character. It's not unlikely that her name was deliberately chosen as a way to villainize her (she did kill Hercules after all).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I mean there are lots of people in the modern day that have real world meaning names, such as April or Rose. These girls aren't literally the month of April or the flower, just named after it. Same with people with last names like Smith, doesn't mean they are actual blacksmiths.</p>
<p>A name like Husband Destroyer would be a bit more specific of course but perhaps in the context of the time it made more sense and maybe in the future people will look at our names and think, can't believe they ever had names after jobs, places, months etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
