		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically whenever anything touches another thing, the molecules either try to bond or repel each other. It has to do with the polarity of the molecules. Think magnetism, but on the absolute smallest scale. When you have two things move against each other they also cause friction, which generates heat energy. Lubricants create a barrier between the objects, reducing friction, and reducing heat. Lubes also feel sticky because some of the molecules bond to the surface they are coating, but because they are a liquid, they can flow freely around the object.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Grease is adhesive. It sticks to other things well. Grease is not very cohesive though and does not stick to itself very strongly. So a thick coating of grease will create a barrier between two parts with lots of friction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Grease is two parts - oil and soap. The oil lubricates, the soap binds. The binder is sticky so it keeps the grease where you want it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
