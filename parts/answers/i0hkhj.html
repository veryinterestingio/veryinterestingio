		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all, I assume you're referring to blackjack.</p>
<p>In blackjack, card counting is <em>not</em> cheating. However, a card counter can tilt the odds of blackjack to the point where they're expected to win rather than lose. Casinos do not like to lose money, and so in jurisdictions where it is legal (such as Las Vegas), they will place restrictions on known card counters that keep them from card counting.</p>
<p><strong>What is card counting?</strong></p>
<p>Traditionally, blackjack games are dealt out of a &quot;shoe.&quot; A hand will be dealt, and then the cards will be collected and <em>not</em> recycled. After several hands, the number of cards in the shoe will become low, at which point all the cards are collected and shuffled. That means that, within a shoe, if a player sees lots of low cards dealt to players then the shoe must contain lots of high cards, and vice versa. For complicated reasons, having a shoe with lots of high cards is advantageous to the player. Therefore, a skilled card player can bet small amounts while keeping track of the shoe. When lots of low cards have been dealt, and the shoe therefore has mostly high cards remaining, he will raise his bet substantially. Over the long run, he can win enough on these high value hands to offset the losses from other hands.</p>
<p><strong>How do casinos catch card counters and how do they stop them?</strong></p>
<p>Casinos will watch to see if players exhibit the behavior of a card counter by wagering vastly different amounts in a way characteristic of a card counter. They can also look at video and count with the player to see if the player is indeed betting large amounts when the shoe is player friendly.</p>
<p>If caught, the usual response from the casino will be to &quot;flat bet&quot; the player. The pit boss will tell the player that he may not vary his bet within the shoe, so that he must bet for example $10 on every hand and can only change his bet after the dealer shuffles. This eliminates almost all of the advantage of card counting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it gives the house less of an edge/hold. In blackjack, the house edge/hold is about 20% when playing without tactics.</p>
<p>So for every 1000 usd played they have a 200 usd profit on average. </p>
<p>When using basic blackjack tactics that house edge/hold drops to 2% so they &quot;only&quot; get 20 usd on every 1000 played. Now add card counting in the mix and you can drop the house edge/hold to 0.5% and now the casino only gets 5 usd per 1000 played on a table.</p>
<p>Casino's are businesses, and they make the rules. Card counting cost them money so card counting is cheating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s technically NOT cheating. However, it does give the player an advantage and since casinos are private property, they can kick anyone out that they’d like.</p>
<p>However, they’d still have to pay you if you’ve won while getting caught. They would pay you first and then issue you a trespass.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some casinos have actually turned the idea of card counting into a marketing tool. They now have some tables that are “single deck black jack” which obviously implies that you can easily count the cards.</p>
<p>Of course they have adjusted the odds so that even if you count, you lose.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
