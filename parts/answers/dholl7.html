		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This can actually be a real problem if you set up your bee yard with all of the hives in straight line with all entrances facing the same way. Foragers loaded with nectar and pollen will generally be accepted by the guard bees into a hive. Honeybees tend to prefer the hives on the end which can weaken the center colonies. Generally hives are set up in a horseshoe or some other pattern to reduce this drifting. </p>
<p>However the average lost honey bee is probably not going to find a colony as wild colonies are very rare now due to imported pests and disease. In positive news most bees you see in nature are likely not honey bees and are native solitary bees.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In most instances, bees carry unique chemical identifiers that are associated with the queen from their home colony.  Often, though not always, during a peak, heavy nectar flow, when bees are extreemly busy, the occasional bee from another hive can become adopted into a new hive.  However, under normal condition, the guards that greet the returning bees will reject bees that do not carry the chemical markers of their unique colony.  In the case of persistent foreign bees, the guards may resort to killing the foreign bee. This can be a good thing if the outsider bee is from a deceased colony and could be carrying that infection.  Such bees can spread these deseases.  </p>
<p>Often, man-made behives look very similar to each other, and are in close proximity to each other.  This condition can promote bees becoming confused, which can increase the likelyhood that bees will try to enter a foreign hive.  As an aid for the bees, some beekeepers will mark the front of hives with unique markings that bees learn to recognize, which helps bees return to their own home hive.</p>
<p>Under another cerconstance, if a bee becomes lost while forging, it is likely they will die in the field.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not really.  Honey bees use pheromones to identify members of their own colonies, and will set up guards to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pauV8pnUJJw" target="_blank">prevent other bees from entering</a>.  That said, this mechanism is certainly not perfect, and they do make mistakes.  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4440684/" target="_blank">Couvillon et al. 2009</a> interestingly describe how some bees seemed to be much more stringent than others, since bees that were less likely to allow strangers in were also more likely to erroneously reject their actual nestmates.  But none of the bees were lenient enough to let wasps in at least.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One interesting example of bees getting taken into other colonies is the <a href="https://entnemdept.ifas.ufl.edu/creatures/misc/bees/cape_honey_bee.htm" target="_blank">Cape Bee</a>, which has caused a lot of damage in African countries in areas where they are not indigenous.</p>
<p>There is a mutation that occasionally occurs in Cape Bees that allows workers to lay female eggs. While Cape Bee colonies themselves are evolutionarily equipped to handle the challenges of this mutation when it occurs, other species of bees are not.</p>
<p>What this means is that on the rare occasion that a Cape Bee with this mutation manages to wander off and enter another species of bee colony, AND if the other bee colony doesn't detect the Cape Bee as an intruder, then the Cape Bee will start to lay clones of herself in the other colony. The clones of the worker bees multiply and just eat the hive's honey without contributing their fair share. (they may perform in-hive worker duties, but they don't forage for pollen)</p>
<p>This results in the entire colony collapsing as the Cape Bees essentially move and act as parasites to the new colony, eventually resulting in the collapse of the entire hive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
