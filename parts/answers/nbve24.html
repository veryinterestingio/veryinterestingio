		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The concentration of salt matters. It's recommended you do sea salt soaks on new piercings to soothe them and help them heal faster. The salt concentration is similar to what's in the body so you don't feel any pain from it.</p>
<p>Depending on what body of water you get into the salinity varies.</p>
<p>Edit: I did not say the sea had the same salinity as the body, just that the salinity level is what makes it hurt or not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No for a few reasons. First, saltwater stings wounds for a little while but not forever. If you have a cut and put it in salt water, the pain will subside pretty quickly. Second, it's debatable whether some sea creatures can even experience pain the way we do because their brains are a lot less developed (obviously this does not apply to sea mammals who have similar brains to use)</p>
<p>The reason sea water hurts is because it has a much higher concentration of salt than in our bodies). Some sea creatures have similar salt concentrations to that of sea water. Others have other mechanisms for removing excess salt or otherwise preventing salt water from irritating exposed tissue like secreting mucous (remember, they evolved in that environment).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
