		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Book pages are laid out in what's called a &quot;leaf&quot; which is usually 4 sheets of paper folded and bound together like a zine, so this makes 16 pages. A leaf is then stacked on other leaves and then bound together at the spine. If you look at a book from the side, you'll see the stacks of leaves.</p>
<p>If your book doesn't reach exactly a divisible of 16 in page number, these become extra pages. Also, some &quot;pages&quot; are tools used to bind the stack of leaves to the cover.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part of the reason is that books are made up of signatures, often of 16 pages each.  If you have a book with 161 printed pages, that means you need 11 signatures with 15 blank pages at the end.</p>
<p>A 16-page signature will be a large sheet of paper that has 8 pages printed on the front, 8 pages on the back, and is then folded thrice and cut twice to become part of the book.  It's done this way because it's much faster and simpler to print a few large pages rather than many smaller ones.  Printing presses are big.</p>
<p>16-page signatures are called octavo; oct means 8 because they end up with 8 sheets of paper, each printed on both sides.  <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/Folio-Quarto-Octavo_Compared.svg" target="_blank">See how the paper is folded</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
