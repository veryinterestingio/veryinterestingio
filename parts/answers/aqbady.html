<p>Basically the close nature of the seats create little sub-compartments for the students </p>
<p>&quot;NHTSA decided the best way to provide crash protection to passengers of large school buses is through a concept called “compartmentalization.” This requires that the interior of large buses protect children without them needing to buckle up. Through compartmentalization, children are protected from crashes by strong, closely-spaced seats that have energy-absorbing seat backs.&quot;</p>
<p>Some states mandate seatbelts</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So a lot of reasonable answers here, but incomplete to OP's question. See the article here: www.cbc.ca/news/canada/seatbelts-school-buses-safety-marc-garneau-1.4983517. Note this article is based out of Canada and doesn't necessarily speak for other countries. </p>
<p>The truth is that there is no viable reason not to give seatbelts to passengers on school buses. The study in 1984 claimed seat belts caused more harm than good, which is bogus with the support of the 2010 study by Transport Canada. More buses are being equipped with seatbelts in newer models and the demand is to retrofit seatbelts on existing older models. It is true that school buses are engineered to be safer than other vehicles, but the truth is seatbelts add another layer of security that can save lives and minimize injuries. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
