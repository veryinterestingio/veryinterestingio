		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The amount of debt you can maintain is proportional to your income.</p>
<p>If the people have enough income to pay the payments on their debt, it doesn't matter how much debt they have.</p>
<p>How much stuff they currently have is only relevant if that stuff is collateral for a loan or purchasing it interferes with making their debt payments.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a theoretical millionaire debtor. I have $1 million in cash. I have $5 million in debt. Car loans, house loans, a couple of maxed credit cards. I only am responsible to pay $20,000 per month to my creditors. I can live like this for years before I run out of cash. My monthly income only has to exceed the cost of my payments. It's still a lot of money, but I have $1 million dollars with which to invest, and a 0.2% monthly return isn't hard for someone with any business savvy.</p>
<p>Edit: Yeah, I did my math wrong. You got me. I typed that up in a bit of a hurry and didnt check myself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because debt is an instrument that makes it possible to receive your future money gains right now. You can think of it as just an advance on your income. </p>
<p>Maybe you start earning 100k a month which is huge. But you still can’t buy a decent house right away. With debt you can, because you can borrow 1,2 million and pay it back in a year. And you can have the house right now. Everyone does this. Because if you can revive your future income right now for a bit of a commission why wouldn’t you ?</p>
<p>Many of the biggest companies in the world actually hold a huge amount of debt. Many countries too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It all very much depends on how you define &quot;Rich&quot;.  Are you going by lifestyle? Income? Net Worth? </p>
<p>If you take out a loan at 5% interest, you presumably think you can make at least 6% a year more with whatever you purchase using that money.  You prove that by continuing to make the regular payments throughout the life of the loan. </p>
<p>So, let's say you're the son of a rich man.  You own nothing yourself, and no significant income.  At the age of 46 you still live in your father's house when someone like Forbes calls and asks how rich you are.  Naturally, you say <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/trump-lied-to-me-about-his-wealth-to-get-onto-the-forbes-400-here-are-the-tapes/2018/04/20/ac762b08-4287-11e8-8569-26fda6b404c7_story.html" target="_blank">&quot;I'm very rich, my dad gave me everything!&quot;</a>.  Next thing you know, they put you on the Forbes 400 list. </p>
<p>You could then presumably use that publication to bullshit your way into a loan for $100million.  With that cash you can buy something like a Casino and use the proceeds of that to pay for the loan.  To keep up appearances you throw lavish parties and hang out with rich people.  </p>
<p>That reputation gets you more investors and more debt to buy more businesses.  </p>
<p>If you live within your means, or if your investments don't pan out, you stop being able to live that lifestyle, and don't have the access to high wealth individuals that have the power and wealth to continue investing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It usually depends on cash flow... let's say I'm an NBA star who just signed a big contract, or a doctor who just finished medical school. I may not have much in the way of assets today, and I may take on debt to buy that baller condo in my new team's city or I might have $250k in med school debt and another $500k spent on a house. But my future income is stable and sufficient to pay off those debts in the time frame outlined by the lenders.</p>
<p>It can also be something like a tech startup founder who has wealth tied up in company shares... he can't sell them yet, because the company isn't public or he has a tie-up period before he can begin selling, so he may borrow against those shares as a way to get cash today to be paid back later when he can liquidate some of his company shares.</p>
<p>Another thing is whether it's personal or business debts. A big real estate developer has personal wealth, but still takes on business debt to finance a new real estate project... they borrow $200 million to build that new condo building, then hope to sell the condos for a total of $250 million, pay back the loans, and walk away with a profit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
