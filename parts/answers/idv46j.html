		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What you're describing is accomplished using the magic technique of <strong>educated guessing</strong>. It's not physically possible to know what color something is certainly supposed to be simply from the data in a black and white image or video, but you can use clues related to context of each object to determine what color it should be such as uniforms from a specific period typically being one color. This guessing process can be done by humans or machines, it's ultimately the same fundamental concept of using context.</p>
<p>Our brains are fairly lazy so even if there are numerous errors in this transformation we aren't bothered by them.</p>
<p>If you're asking how technically it's possible to change a gray pixel to a colorized one, the gray tones are just mapped onto some selected shade of a color. So dark gray becomes dark red, light gray becomes light red etc within some boundary. The objects and their components are just separated by a set of boundaries which determine what color they should be.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It's the same concept except the experts who colorize photographs tend to do a little more research to try and get the colors and shades correct.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
