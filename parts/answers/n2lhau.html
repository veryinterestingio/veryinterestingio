For example, what we call the heart is actually two circulation systems that are synchronized. Our liver has two lobes and the pancreas becomes whole by combining two parts during gestation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A long time ago, a flatworm called an acoel was the first organism to evolve with bilateral symmetry of organs. Bilateralism is the tendency of some lifeforms to be symmetrical, and many organisms on Earth today, especially vertebrates, seem to have inherited this kind of symmetry.</p>
<p>In answer to your specific examples: (Not very ELI5) </p>
<p>You only have one heart because your double circulatory systems means one heart can maintain pressure throughout the body. Animals with more hearts, e.g. octopi with three, use them because they cannot provide sufficient pressure to specific organs, in the specific case of octopi the gills. The same problem is faced by mammals and humans, the blood that leaves the lungs is highly oxygenated, but passing across the necessarily large surface area of the lungs means it is at a greatly reduced pressure. However the solution mammals came up with was very effective, and eliminates the need for additional hearts. The blood is pumped back through additional chambers in the heart (which you could say is considered a second heart) . This repressurises the blood allowing it to pass around the rest of the body.</p>
<p>The reason the digestive system is singular is because it is not strictly part of the body, rather it is a space outside of the body through which food passes, and digestive enzymes are secreted. Think of the body as a sort of hugely complicated donut with the mouth, lungs, and digestive tract are all on the outside, and the rest, including the circulatory and lymphatic systems, are on the inside.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The super-short ELI5 answer is because duplicate organs are expensive to build and maintain, and having more than one heart, liver or pancreas doesn't increase our survival enough to pay for them.  Any creature who evolved with these superfluous duplicates would be at an evolutionary disadvantage to similar ones with only one of these organs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We do have two of everything.  It's just that with some organs, the pair of them merged back into a single organ.  The heart has left and right sides.  The  intestines have two lobes if you look at them in cross section.  Yada, Yada, Yada.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
