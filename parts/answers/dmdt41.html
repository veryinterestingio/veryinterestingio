		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you are short sighted, the light is focused slightly away from your retina towards the center of your eye, making things seem blurry. </p>
<p>Your pupil is a hole that focuses light into your retina. When you squint, you make the hole even smaller, focussing light back towards your retina. This balances the focussing error from your shortsightedness and you are temporarily able to see more clearly. </p>
<p>Squinting is very straining for your sensitive eye muscles though so I donâ€™t recommend doing it for long periods of time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Same way a pinhole camera works: the smaller the hole/gap, the sharper the image.</p>
<p>As to how that works, try shining a light through a hole onto another surface, say, a wall; the smaller the hole, the smaller the point of light on the wall. The smaller the point of light, the sharper it is.</p>
<p>An image is essentially a lot of different colored lights going into your eye hole (pupil) and projected onto your eye wall (the retina) (it's also got a lens to focus things properly but in our case we can ignore it). By giving it a smaller hole (by squinting or whatever), a sharper image is projected into your eye.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Light is in focus when all rays from each individual part of the image &quot;match&quot;, so you can tell which ray belongs to which part of the image - giving clear, distinct, boundaries. </p>
<p>There are two ways of doing this. You can either bend all of the light that doesn't &quot;match&quot; correctly, so that it now does (this is typically done with a lens). Or you can block out all of the light that doesn't &quot;match&quot; correctly, leaving you with only the light that does, giving you a better focused, but darker image (typically done with an aperture).</p>
<p>Squinting is a good make shift aperture. </p>
<p>You can also try the same effect by making a small pin size hole between the knuckles on your index finger and thumb, flexing your finger slightly to adjust the size of the hole and you can see how it changes focus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OK, my time to shine! All those images you've ever seen in every single book about how light and lenses work to create an image? All, they are ALL wrong! For the most part. In their attempt to make the concept more digestible they made it so that you are unable to understand how things like aperture work. I spent a very long time working this out on my own and it pisses me off to no end that all the teaching materials are so lacking.</p>
<p>In the diagrams they show a line from the top and bottom of an object converging onto a lens and then diverging to the back of the eye. Wrong wrong wrong! That is not how light works, you need to flip the entire concept around. Don't thing of an entire image entering the lens but think of the light that is given off by a single tiny pinpoint of that thing. The light reflected off of that one point will shoot off in pretty much every possible direction. Now, only a very few of the photons from that point will have the proper trajectory to enter your eye. They will be close to parallel but not quite, slightly diverging from each other. To obtain clear focus a lens must bend those photons so that they end up coming together again to a point like from where they started. Now blow that up to the entire thing you are looking at and all the billions of &quot;points&quot; that make up that object. Every point shotgunning out billions of photons. </p>
<p>Now to the good part. If you are nearsighted then your cornea is not bending those photons properly so the ones that are associated with a particular point do not all end up back at a point at the back of your eye. The ones that are coming in at what would be the centre of that point don't have to bend much so they are still at the &quot;centre&quot; of where they should be, but the ones that are more to the outside of that light cone are not being bent properly and so they end up a bit scattered around where they should all fall and the point is therefore blurry.</p>
<p>When you squint, decrease the aperture, what you are doing is blocking out more of those photons that are on the outside of that divergent light cone. Those are the ones that will fall the farthest from where they are supposed to fall. Fewer scattered photons, less blur, sharper image at the cost of less light and therefore a dimmer image. </p>
<p>If you think about light this way it make complete sense. It explains depth of field, why distant light makes sharper shadows etc. It was such a huge eureka moment for me when I figured this out.</p>
<p>Edit: changed increase to decrease.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your vision is blurry because the shape of the eye is too short or too oblong, so the lightwaves you see don't &quot;line up&quot; correctly on the retina.  When you squint, this little change in pressure changes the shape of the eye ball slightly, correcting the misalignment, thus you see clearer.</p>
