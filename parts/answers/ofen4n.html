<blockquote>
<p>The most severe sequelae after rehabilitation from SARS are femoral head necrosis and pulmonary fibrosis. We performed a 15-year follow-up on the lung and bone conditions of SARS patients. </p>

<p>Measles</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a very rare, but fatal disease of the central nervous system that results from a measles virus infection acquired earlier in life.</p>
<p>Encephalitis. About 1 child out of every 1,000 who get measles will develop encephalitis (swelling of the brain) that can lead to convulsions and can leave the child deaf or with intellectual disability.</p>

<p>Polio</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most common long-term problems seen in polio are brace problems, knee recurvatum, increasing weakness due to overuse and ankle equinus. A definite increased incidence of problems is seen after the patient is more than 30 years post-polio. The basis for most of these problems is chronic mechanical strain of weak musculature and substituting ligaments. Overuse can cause increasing weakness resulting in pain and decreasing function.</p>

<p>Flu</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They include viral or bacterial pneumonia, dehydration, and ear infections and sinus infections, especially in children. The flu can worsen long-term medical conditions, like congestive heart failure, asthma, or diabetes.You might also have muscle inflammation (myositis), problems with your central nervous system, and heart problems such as heart attacks, inflammation of the organ (myocarditis), and inflammation of the sac around it (pericarditis).</p>

<p>Whooping cough or Pertussis</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People born during whooping cough outbreaks are more likely to die prematurely even if they survive into adulthood, new research has found. Women had a 20% higher risk of an early death, and men a staggering 40%. </p>
<p>Women also suffered more complications during and after pregnancy, with an increased risk of miscarriage as well as infant death within the first month of life.</p>

<p>Meningitis</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some of the most common complications associated with meningitis are:</p>
<p>hearing loss, which may be partial or total – people who have had meningitis will usually have a hearing test after a few weeks to check for any problems</p>
<p>recurrent seizures (epilepsy)</p>
<p>problems with memory and concentration</p>
<p>co-ordination, movement and balance problems</p>
<p>learning difficulties and behavioural problems</p>
<p>vision loss, which may be partial or total</p>
<p>loss of limbs – amputation is sometimes necessary to stop the infection spreading through the body and remove damaged tissue</p>
<p>bone and joint problems, such as arthritis</p>
<p>kidney problems</p>

<p>1) Chicken pox causes shingles decades later.</p>
<p>2) Polio can cause post-polio syndrome, which is why my grandfather was 4F-ed in WWII despite being in otherwise good physical health.</p>
<p>3) Rheumatic Fever can cause permanent heart damage which leads to rheumatic heart disease. My uncle's otherwise-healthy best friend had it when he was around 7 and then dropped dead at 35 from a heart attack. </p>
<p>4) SSPE is a 100% fatal long-term complication of Measles that occurs like 5-20 years after infection (usually 6-8 years, but some people in their twenties get it from an infection from when they were like... 5) and causes seizures, coma, and death. There is no cure and no treatment other than getting the preventive MMR shot before measles infection. They used to think it was rare, but now believe it happens in 1 in 600 to 1 in 1400 infections. Measles in general fucks up your immune system, making your cells &quot;forget&quot; prior infections and leaving you susceptible to infections you've already had for years after measles infection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there are a vast number of long-term complications following many virus infections. It does seem that COVID is significantly more likely to lead to chronic problems than many other viruses, but then COVID is also a more severe acute disease than most, so it's probably roughly proportional. </p>
<p>Since influenza is probably the most obvious parallel for COVID in terms of pathogenesis, organs affected, and so on, let's look at some of the <a href="https://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343\(08\)00072-7/pdf" target="_blank">long-term complications that can follow influenza infection</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/01.cir.0000102380.47012.92" target="_blank">Heart attacks</a>. Influenza vaccination is the <a href="https://heart.bmj.com/content/102/24/1953" target="_blank">most effective way of reducing heart attacks</a> we know of, as good as or better than any heart medications or stopping smoking. </li>
<li><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1386653203001197" target="_blank">Encephalitis and other neurological symptoms</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4382767/" target="_blank">Muscle damage</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896841114000389" target="_blank">Narcolepsy</a> </li>
<li>(Possibly) <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5596521/#irv12470-bib-0080" target="_blank">Parkinson's disease</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>The broad category of &quot;long COVID&quot;-like symptoms have also been seen following other infections, though again it does seem more common with COVID:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Historically, the common symptom of altered cognition has been reported during earlier pandemics, which include the influenza pandemics of 1889 and 1892 (Russian flu), the Spanish flu pandemic (1918-1919), encephalitis lethargica, diphtheria, and myalgic encephalomyelitis (chronic fatigue syndrome or post-viral fatigue syndrome). There are similarities between chronic fatigue syndrome and the &quot;brain fog&quot; described in long COVID. </p>
