<p>The rules would say that maybe I should remove this question based on &quot;false premise&quot; - as others have noted, penetrative intercourse is not the only way to have sex.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, we could argue that the intent of your question is &quot;sex&quot; in the penetrative sense. In which case it's not a false premise so much.</p>
<p>I'm going to leave it up, because at the very least there's some useful points on the definitons of &quot;sex&quot;, but I'll lock it since I think the answers have been had.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
