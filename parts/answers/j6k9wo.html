		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a white light in the back of an LCD called the backlight. </p>
<p>LCD is short for Liquid Crystal Display.</p>
<p>Inside the display is something called a TFT - Thin Film Transistor. </p>
<p>The TFT uses electricity to magically change the color of the liquid, this creates pictures. </p>
<p>When you press the screen, the liquid moves around and this interferes with the magic color changing which produces puddles or splashes of different colors. </p>
<p>The TFT is a grid, so possibly the green lines you see are a result of the TFT electrifying the crystal juice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
