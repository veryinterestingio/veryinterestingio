<p>Actually just learned this recently from my sister who's an epidemiologist. The WHO does a lot of work tracking flu seasons around the world, and a lot of the time if they update the vaccine it's based on data from the opposite hemisphere, since they're usually happening during opposite halves of the year. So the flu season in SE Asia during April-Sept gives them information on how to fight it in the northern hemisphere.</p>

<p>Source from the CDC on how it works from their perspective</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oooh! I’m an influenza epidemiologist!</p>
<p>In the US, we recruit healthcare providers to collect specimens and send them to public health laboratories for viral subtyping (i.e. A(H3N2), A(H1N1), B/Yamagata, or B/Victoria). A subset of these samples go to the CDC for further virologic identification (I.e. A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)pdm09-like, etc). This allows us to tell exactly what strains are circulating when.</p>
<p>These results each year are compared with similar results from the southern hemisphere’s temperate climates and from tropical climates (they have different seasonal patterns of flu) in order to gauge how fast the virus is mutating and what the next season’s strains are likely to be. These results are then analyzed for their ability to be grown in eggs, and ultimately, four strains are chosen - an A(H3N2), an A(H1N1), a B/Victoria, and a B/Yamagata. The trivalent option contains the first three, the quadrivent includes all four.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The CDCP actually convenes a flu council after each flu season. The virus genetic markers/sequence are reviewed against previous virus profiles to identify cellular mutations and then applied against a model to pick the strain that will be incubated for the next flu vaccine. That approach will always miss a revolutionary mutation such as the original virus that caused the 1918 Pandemic</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
