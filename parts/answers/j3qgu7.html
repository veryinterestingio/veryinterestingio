		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With great difficulty. There are basically five options, and they all have problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can bring food with you from your own territory overland, but that's very difficult and you can't feed a large army;</li>
<li>You can bring food up on ships, but then you can't go far from the coast;</li>
<li>You can buy food from the locals, but they might be reluctant to sell, because, you know, you're there to conquer them and they're not into that;</li>
<li>You can rob food from the locals, but then you can't stay in one place for long, because the people you're robbing are not going to leave their stuff where it's easy for you to get it;</li>
<li>You can defeat your enemy and take his food— but to do that, you have to win the war in the first place.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the ways Napoleon was so successful was because of how quickly he could move his army around. He would advance so quickly because every City he took he picked clean, and used all the farm land to the disposal of the army. He brought very little food or supplies. He grabbed it on the go. He was able to move so fast that people weren’t able to pack up and go.
It’s actually what lost him the Russian campaign. He pulled up with 600k soldiers, with the anticipation that he would just pillage as he went feeding his huge army. Only problem was as the word spread, the Russians did something never seen before. They burned everything. Entire cities on fire. The army was decimated by this tactic. It wasn’t so much the cold that destroyed them as much as a lack of supplies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The armies main force might be together but pillaging parties would span several cities in length. Usually the peasants and town were mostly unprotected since the defenders had to focus on the main force. That’s why Russia’s strategy Of  burning every was so good because that was the main source of food for the invaders</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
