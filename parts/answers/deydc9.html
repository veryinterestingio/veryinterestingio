		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as I understand with regard to animal intelligence, certain species of gorillas have been taught sign languages, and dogs can understand vocal commands such as &quot;sit&quot;, recognise their own name, or even know that pointing is indicating a direction.</p>
<p>How much communication is possible with an octopus? Can they learn what is meant by certain human body languages/expressions/sounds? Do they have the capacity to learn how to communicate certain things to us, and how would they go about this? For example, in the way a dog can be trained to communicate it wants to go out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know that octopuses live relatively short lives, but are highly intelligent. At what age do they develop an “adult” level of intelligence? Do they go through recognizable cognitive development stages analogous to human cognitive development? Do they keep getting “smarter” or do they plateau?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was read that although an octopus is a master at camouflage, they do not have rods and cones like we do in our eyes to determine color.
