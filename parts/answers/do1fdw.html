<p>Leaves are disposable though, and the outer layers of bark are usually dead plant material that protects the rest. </p>
<p>Most crucially, most plants don't have cells circulating like animals do, so they can't really get anything like metastatic cancer. They also lack vital organs that can become diseased and kill the whole plant.</p>
<p>Plants get tumours of sorts for all kinds of reasons but they can't generally spread and kill the whole organism.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The UV damage repair enzyme, Photolyase, hasn't been covered yet. Mammals do not have functional Photolyase to repair pyrimidine dimers (the most common form of UV-induced damage), while many plants, fungi and bacteria do have Photolyase. Mammals rely on nucleotide excision repair (removing a chunk of DNA and re-writing it), instead. More efficient damage repair leads to less cancer.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plants will actually &quot;tan&quot; in response to intense sunlight (not really the same process) and do get damaged by too much sunlight.  In both the gardening and planted tank hobby, plants will turn red in response to intense light.  Many plants will in fact die if there is too much sunlight, and prefer shade.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spathiphyllum" target="_blank">Peace lilies</a> are one such plant, even with adequate water, too much sunlight will kill your plant, cause it to wilt or turn colors. </p>
<p>In my planted tank experience (where you put live aquatic plants in an aquarium) I've gotten many plants to turn red, especially on leaves grown as the plant grows closer to the light.  When you see plants with red leaves near the top in the hobby like these:</p>

<p>It's because of the light.  Some plants respond more drastically than others.  Stems can also change color (at least with aquatic plants) you'll notice in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwigia_\(plant\)" target="_blank">Ludwigia plants</a> that the stems will often turn red or green depending on if it is its aquatic form, terrestrial form, time of year, but always dependent on how much light it gets. </p>
<p>Plants get damaged in similar ways to how human skin gets damaged, except chloroplasts will often get overloaded with energy and spit out excess high energy particles which start to destroy the surrounding cell walls, or plant cells will convert excess energy to heat, stopping other important cell processes. </p>
<p>Plants are CO2 limited primarily, algae often isn't.  Plants can survive low light conditions, but excel when CO2 is high, as CO2 is where they get most of their structural material from.  In the planted tank hobby, <a href="https://www.liveaquaria.com/article/100/?aid=100" target="_blank">enthusiasts often use CO2 tanks to dissolve extra CO2 into the water.</a>.</p>
<p>EDIT:
I re-read my post, and I forgot to mention that some plants don't have this issue (in general) for similar reasons why certain animals (and even people) don't have as much problem with excess sunlight, they are built to withstand, expel or otherwise use this light.  If you put these high intensity sunlight needing plants in lower light conditions, they might end up dying because of the <em>lack</em> of sunlight.  But just like some plants will turn red in response to increased light, some plants go through transitions in the opposite direction, make leaves more green, increase the density of leaves, broaden the leaves.  This effect happens with certain species of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwigia_hexapetala" target="_blank"> ludwigia</a>, in low light environments, Ludwigia hexapetala will have round thick leaves, in higher light environments, they have thin lanky leaves.</p>
<p>examples:</p>
<p>low light version

<p>high light version

<p>These are the exact same plant species, yet you could be forgiven for thinking they were entirely different.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's what I did my bachelors thesis on! Plants have several strategies to fight excess light energy. Arguably the most inportant is the pathway that dissipates excess absorbed energy as heat. Plants also have several pigments that defend chlorophyll from absorbing excess energy (carotenoids, antocyanins). If excess energy does get absorbed and reactive oxygen species are formed (these are what cause damage to DNA), antioxidants in the leaves neutralise them.</p>
<p>When these strategies fail, plants can and do suffer genetic damage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
