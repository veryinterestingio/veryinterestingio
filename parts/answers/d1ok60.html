		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's part of the involuntary 'body language' that lets other people know how you're feeling. </p>
<p>As social animals, humans have evolved many traits like this. </p>
<p>The 'why' of it is just simply the way it is. There's no underlying logic to only the lip in particular, just that it is a facial feature with a large variety of movements.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the leading theory on emotional crying is that it's a clamp-down on the fight-or-flight response. Your eyes tear up to impede you because from the DNA's point of view, it's safer, for women and children anyway, to stop running and fighting at some point. Hormones found in tears give some credence to this. I don't know how lip quivering factors into it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
