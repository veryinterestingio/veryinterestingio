		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because sperm and eggs are just single cells. Organs and organisms are collections of cells that must operate in unison or the entire organism dies.</p>
<p>If you have 5 million sperm cells and your freezing/thawing process kills half of them, you still have 2.5 million viable sperm cells to rely on, and only need one for success.</p>
<p>If you freeze/thaw a person and kill half their cells, you end up with a mess.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have mentioned, the freezing process is the problem, but I haven't seen ice's role mentioned. When freezing living things, you aim to cool them so quickly and to such a low temperature that ice crystals don't have time to form, because ice crystals act as tiny razor blades to the cells/body. However, if you've ever tried to freeze a really big piece of meat, you'd know that it can take quite some time. Even with liquid nitrogen or helium, it's long enough to kill a human before the process is complete. There's also the problem of bodily functions in a half-frozen/half-thawed state, both during freezing and melting. </p>
<p>This is the main difference between flash-freezing and normal freezing too, btw. When you put meat in a home freezer, the ice crystals rupture cells, resulting in moisture loss during cooking and a drier end product. </p>
<p>Edit: As an addendum, some animals (e.g. some frogs) have anti-freeze which prevents the formation of ice crystals, which allows them to survive the freeze/thaw cycle for winter hibernation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We can - but some large percentage of the thawed cells still die.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>When we do this in lab, somewhere around 80-90% of cells come back to life just fine once they thaw (as do sperm and eggs).  However, 10%+ do not.  A human can't survive with 10% random cell-loss.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And in laboratory conditions, freezing single cells can be done in such a way as to evenly freeze everything at the same time.  This is also much harder for an organism than a soup of individual cells.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, even if you could completely freeze a human and they survive, you would have issues with the dethawing.</p>
<p>Humans have no way of thawing from the inside out. Our limbs and other parts of pur bodies would thaw before our hearts using external heat. So there would be no circulation or blood in those thawed body parts resulting in death. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
