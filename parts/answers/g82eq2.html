		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As per <a href="https://www.vetsci.org/DOIx.php?id=10.4142/jvs.2020.21.e18#B23" target="_blank">this review paper</a>, it remains to be investigated whether adult cats can recognize individuals by their vocalizations, although <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?db=PubMed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;list_uids=26935009" target="_blank">kittens seem to recognize their own mother's call from that of other cat mothers</a>. </p>
<p>Adult cats also seem to be able to distinguish between the [voice of their owner from those of unfamiliar humans] (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10071-013-0620-4" target="_blank">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10071-013-0620-4</a>). </p>
<p>So, cats seem capable of distinguishing between familiar and unfamiliar vocalizations of both other cats (at least the &quot;chirp&quot; of their own mother when kittens) and humans, but I can't speculate as to why your cat is responding differently to the cat videos as there are competing hypotheses beyond familiarity or recognition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Anyway, I'm not sure.</p>
<p>It would appear that cat's don't recognize themselves, at least not in a visual way as they don't pass the &quot;mirror test.&quot; Although some people think that cats can recognize themself through scent, audio or other ways.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
