		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The same reason your skeletal muscles don't continually get bigger and bigger just from walking around and living your everyday life.  </p>
<p>Just using a muscle a regular amount doesn't make it grow.  Doing that just keeps it from getting smaller.  You have to stress and strain it on a regular basis for it to get bigger and more powerful.</p>
<p>If you lifted weights every day with your tongue it would get bigger and stronger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several reasons for this, the first is the fact that tongue is not a single muscle, the second is that the tongue muscles are rather unique among muscles for several reasons not the least of which is that they're not anchored directly to bone like regular muscles.</p>
<p>The third and probably most relevant is that muscles in general don't get bigger just because you exercise them, there are several conditions that must be met.</p>
<p>In order to induce hypertrophy (which is the technical term for increasing he cross sectional size of the muscle) they need to be trained in a certain way, usually to failure (Specific ranges are beyond the scope of this post), as well as having sufficient protein and calories available in the body. This is why for example, marathon runners do not get big and bulky from running marathons, they exercise their muscles quite a bit, but not in a way that promotes hypertrophy. So even if the tongue was like a regular muscle (And I will stress again, it is not, it is a group of several very irregular muscles), it would not get bigger from talking or eating because that is not the sort of stress stimulus that would promote hypertrophy.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone who's posted so far is wrong. Your tongue absolutely does grow bigger with use, though it's a fairly subtle effect. It's possible for the cranial nerves that controls tongue movement to be damaged. It's also possible for that damage to be unilateral, which means that the tongue will only start atrophying <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Unilateral_hypoglossal_nerve_injury.jpeg/800px-Unilateral_hypoglossal_nerve_injury.jpeg" target="_blank">on one side.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
