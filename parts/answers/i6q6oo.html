		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Zapper is basically a simple light detector with a lens at the end of the barrel. Basically, think of it like a really really low megapixel camera. </p>
<p>When you press the trigger on the Zapper, the whole screen except for the position of the ducks is drawn as black for a frame or two. The ducks show as white squares against a black background. </p>
<p>Since old CRT Televisions did not give off any real light in black zones, the Zapper only had to &quot;look&quot; to see if it was aiming right at a bright light or not. If it was dark or black, no duck. If it was bright white, duck. The flash would then revert to normal graphics and continue on. If you slow it waaaaay down, you can actually watch it happen. It's pretty neat.</p>
<p>This is also why you could aim the Zapper at a light bulb and pretty much never miss. It would always detect bright light and thus register a hit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you shoot the zapper, the tv screen goes black for a split second and the duck on the screen turns into a white square. The gun registers a hit if you’re aiming at the white square. It’s looking for light on the dark screen hence the term “Light Gun.”</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
