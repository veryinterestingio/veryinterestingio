		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lenses work both ways. The machine is basically getting a camera trained on your retina and then ‘auto-focusing’ until it sees a clear image of your retina. Software then calculates the properties of your lens based on the amount of focusing it required to get that clear picture of your retina.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Optometrist here. The manual machine where they go 1 or 2, called a phoropter, uses different plus and minus powered lenses. Essentially if you are an ametrope, meaning light does not focus on the retina, which is like a film in the back of the eye that processes the light, you are going to need a lens in front of your eyes to see clearly. Using different plus and minus lenses, we are able to move the location at which light is being focused, giving you clear vision. </p>
<p>The automated machines, called an autorefractor, uses special images on the cornea, the clear part of the eye, to determine the lens that would be needed for the patient to have clear vision. Accuracy can be tough on these automated machines as optometrists do not want to give a patient whatever the machine says, as it can lead to overminus-ing or overplus-ing the patient, which can have negative impact on vision. But generally, we will look at the numbers from the autorefractor and then fine tune it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question. I want to order glasses online, but I'm not sure about my pupillary distance (DP). I tried measuring it myself but I get different numbers each time. Any suggestions...</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks everyone for great suggestions. I completely understand that eyeglasses shops don't want to give this info for free because they want to make money too. I had a bad experience at my last optician where they said, &quot;Oh when you buy your glasses you'll get your real PD&quot; and did a quick estimate. At the time I didn't realize what it was for and that they should have done it right because I was paying for it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
