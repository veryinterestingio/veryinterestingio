		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not a complete answer, but I’ve heard that people who don’t have a strong preference for using either their left or right hand can have this effect. That is, the symmetry of their brain functions mean they don’t have a strong sense of left or right at all, and their world view can flip back and forth too easily.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m curious about this myself, my wife has a big problem with left and right especially if I’m giving her directions when she’s driving. I got her to start playing sea of thieves with me and used port and starboard in the game and it instantly worked for her so now we use it outside of the game lol.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There isn't as distinct a difference between left and right for us as there is between up and down, and forward and back. Our bodies are symmetrical left to right and there are no objective differences between the two directions for us generally. Up is above our head and away from gravity and down is toward the rest of our body and gravity. Forward is the direction our body is facing and back is opposite that. Left and right are essentially the same so we have to do a little more mental processing to distinguish those directions with the words we use for them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyscalculia" target="_blank">Trouble distinguishing right and left can be a symptom of dyscalculia</a> (which is like dyslexia but for number sense instead of written language). I would also guess not having any reason to need to remember right vs. left on a regular basis would make a difference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
