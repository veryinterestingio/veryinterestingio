		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because in much of the world world, you should be using 1, 5, 9 and 13, to get 4 non overlapping options. The 1-6-11 is used because of the U.S. refuses to allow use of channel 13, or, in Japan, to allow channel 14 to be fully non-overlapping.</p>
<p>In addition, there are uses for half-overlapping channels. When a large area needs to be covered, you have 3 non-overlapping channels nearby, and further away you use half-overlapping channels, where the weak overlapping signals won't cause as great a problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All these answers and not a single person has stumbled on the correct one: Hindsight is 20/20.</p>
<p>Remember that when the standard was settled upon, the designers had absolutely no idea how ubiquitous WiFi would become. It would be approximately another ten years before WiFi routers would even start to become household appliances. Zip drives were state-of-the-art, laptop thickness was measured in <em>inches</em>, and the concept of a smartphone was about a decade away from public consciousness. People rented VHS cassettes to watch movies at home on their rear-projection TVs, and HD television was for the idle rich. Netflix had just started mailing people DVDs via The Postal Service.</p>
<p>Okay, I'm getting a little carried away describing the world of the late 90s, but it's important to remember the designers of the 802.11 standards had to make choices in a world where households rich enough to even have internet access connected to the internet via dialup. No one even conceptualized a world where routers would be so cheap that every single tenant in an apartment building would have their own radio transmitter sitting in a closet gathering dust out of sight, out of mind. Many of the choices they made for the standard naturally assumed wireless internet access would only really be deployed by professional network admins who would have control of all the other routers in range. Why not let them choose any channel?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Almost touches on the idea of a prisoner's dilemma -like situation.     </p>
<p>The standard allows the choice of any channel in the range to best suit the user's wishes.     But let's just say everyone sticks to 1/6/11 and those three bands are heavily congested.       Anyone setting up a new radio in a congested area will find a LOT of interference centered around each of those three channels.</p>
<p>Someone else gets tired and decides that to avoid interference he should select something in the middle of the overlapping bands like channel 3.    And suddenly now you have someone who has a relatively clear channel, but now 1 and 6 have some interference from another channel in addition to everyone else already on 1/6.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
