		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a wealth of research on mosquito behaviour but mostly in relation to the ones that spread diseases. </p>
<p>This paper:  <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/blog/post/mosquitos-learn-to-avoid-people-whove-swatted-at-them" target="_blank">https://www.researchgate.net/blog/post/mosquitos-learn-to-avoid-people-whove-swatted-at-them</a> shows that they 'learn' to avoided being swatted. From the article 'the insects’ ability to associate the smell of a specific human with the vibration of a swat may be a factor'.</p>
<p>In terms of resting it all depends on the species of mosquito. There has been a lot of research looking at the resting and feeding behaviour of the mosquitoes, mostly in relation to malaria prevention.</p>
<p>It can divided into two categories. An endophilic mosquito is one that rests indoors, inside a human dwelling, and an exophillic one is one that's rest outside. You also get some that will only bite outside and some that only bite inside.</p>
<p>I am unaware of any research about whether they always rest in the same place but my gut feeling is they don't. However asian tiger mosquitoes tend to hide in dark corners and behind furniture to avoid being seen.</p>
<p>EDIT 1
Update:
I am a mosquito biologist but i didn't have time to find and cite more sources. I love how much interest this question has raised! </p>
<p>Behavioural research into mosquitoes has huge gaps especially when you go beyond the species that don't spread malaria. Much of it is based on host preferences </p>
<p>Most mosquitoes do live short fast lives however some species in colder climate will overwinter. Here is a link the a paper on culex pipiens (common house mosquito) <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21476444/" target="_blank">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21476444/</a>. How they pick their locations as far as I can see is unkown.</p>
<p>Resting behaviour is important in working out out effective mosquito nets and indoor residual spraying is ( this is where you spray an insecticide on walls and when the mosquito land it picks up some of it an dies). This paper  <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23427653/" target="_blank">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23427653/</a> showa Aedes mosquitoes do have a preference to things like the colour of mosquito bed nets and horizontal versus vertical surface when it comes to resting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While we’re on this topic, why mosquitoes have to have such an awful fly-pitch? Like why does the single most annoying insect also produces the most annoying sound? Even flies aren't that bad.  </p>
<p>P.S. One might argue that me thinking that mosquito’s pitch is the most annoying is a result of another bias, where associating this sound with a negative event makes the sound itself negative, but I'd say mosquitos sound awful pretty objectively.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Strangely black and white striped surfaces do hinder their landing pattern. Zebra stripes are a natural mosquito repellent. <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/02/zebra-stripes-confuse-biting-flies-causing-them-abort-their-landings#" target="_blank">science mag article</a></p>
