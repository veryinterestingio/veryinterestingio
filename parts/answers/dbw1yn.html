<p>100 pushups throughout the day gives your body enough time to recover between the sets and thus not ripping up as much (or at all if your body can handle it).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally more reps in a set will develop your muscle endurance more than a series of smaller sets, especially with a bodyweight exercise. I would think that someone capable of 100 straight push-ups with good form would not see much improvement from spacing the same # out through the day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of people on here guessing and citing old research, and I’m afraid I don’t have a definitive answer for you, but I have some places to start looking: </p>
<p>1) “Greasing The Groove:” Pavel Tsatsouline coached the Russian Olympic powerlifting team in the 80’s and is a well-renowned and respected strength coach today. He invented this method (AFAIK), which involves doing a few reps - not to failure - spread out over time all day long. Exactly what you’re talking about with pushups. His powerlifters showed serious results on alt his program and he continues to implement it today. Anecdotally, and similar to another poster here, I was at my strongest for chin-ups when I installed a chin-up bar in my doorway and did a bunch every time I walked through the door. My forearms exploded from that, too. Keep in mind, Pavel is a strength guy rather than a size/mass guy, and this technique is geared as such. To promote strength but not necessarily hypertrophy (muscle size and mass).</p>
<p>2)  The old “broscience” method of lifting for bodybuilding was to focus on each muscle group once per week, and beat the ever living tar out of that muscle. Work it to exhaustion, then do some drop sets and work it a little more. Newer research is starting to show that for natural lifters (ie no steroids), frequency and less intensity is more effective. So, lifting each muscle group 2-3 times a week, never to failure. I also recall reading a study (I’m sorry I can’t find it again, I’ll try to look tomorrow when I’m not on mobile) that suggested that experienced powerlifters who did less volume but trained everything each day ended up doing more volume total over a week, and saw better results than the athletes who used a more traditional training program.</p>
<p>Edit: was typing too long and forgot the original question, removed answer #3 because it was irrelevant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>More repetitions of a movement that exerts your muscles in a shorter span increases size.
Repetition throughout the day will increase the amount of times you can do a specific movement with weight working against it.</p>
<p>100 pushups in a 5 minute span is like a 2-lane highway opening into a 4-lane highway. Might not be as busy but can handle more stress</p>
<p>100 pushups over the course of 24 hours is like putting strategic traffic lights to increase throughput, while traffic congestion happens you will see a dip in performance (i.e heavy weights you cant lift)</p>
<p>Obviously you have a definite weight limit being your body so limits can be reached with strength.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
