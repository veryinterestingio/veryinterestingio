		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bee venom contains many components. It causes a reaction in some ways, but stifles certain other immune responses that would diminish the venoms effects. </p>
<p>This makes it good for <em>some</em> types of inflammation. There are many kinds of receptors and chemical messagers that are in control of inflammation, this protein in bee venom specificly works for receptor/pathways called NF-kB and JAK-2. </p>
<p>These control responses to some specific  inflammatory triggers. The protein (melittin) in bee venom inhibits them, meaning it blocks them from working. By doing so, it stops the body from responding to those inflammation triggers. That stops or reduces the inflammation before it happens. </p>
<p>So basically, melittin blocks the things that cause inflammation to protect the venom so it can do its job better. Otherwise, these reactions could help to stop the venom. We use this to benifit us by using the protein by itself without the other things in venom that cause inflammation in other ways.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is the body that swells in response to the venom, the protein structure itself is actually designed to avoid the inflammation response. Inflammation and heat destroy venom so our reaction is an evolutionary response. Mosquito venom (technically mosquitos are venemous) is being researched as an anti hypertensive because it relaxes blood vessels. ACE inhibitors are derived from smoke venom. Part of the tragedy of the deforestation if the Amazon is that it is home to untold numbers of uncatalogued venemous creatures. There are scientists whose only job is to go to the Amazon and collect venomous things.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If working purely on the venom itself, your body would be less likely to swell, as others have noted, because as you said the venom contains components that inhibit the usual inflammatory response.</p>
<p>Luckily (and painfully) for us, both the venom has other components as well as the trauma of the sting itself are sufficient in producing some form of (venom-weakening) inflammatory response, hence the swelling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
