		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20445032" target="_blank">Studies show</a> that your brain registers the emotional pain of heartbreak in the same way as physical pain, which is why you might feel like your heartbreak is causing actual physical hurt. The language we use to describe heartbreak – “I feel like my heart’s been ripped out”, “it was gut wrenching”, “like a slap in the face” – all hint at the way we associate physical pain with emotional pain. &quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I probably can't explain this accurately..but anyways, when we feel extremely sad and hurt, our brains thinks that the body is injured. But because it can't find any physical injury, it just makes your heart and your gut hurt. I think our brain is most accustomed to dealing with physical injuries than mental ones. It basically makes up a physical reason for you to be crying. Hope you understood what I am trying to say :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
