<p>However, most continental tectonic plates (as opposed to oceanic ones) have very ancient, very stable cores, known as cratons. For example, the Laurentian Craton that makes up a large part of the North American continent has been relatively unchanged for billions of years, while the 'outer' parts of the North American plate are being continuously modified.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Plates breaking apart is known as <em>rifting</em>, and is the process that creates new oceans with their ridges. For example Africa and South America were once on one plate, that then rifted about 100 million years ago, forming the South Atlantic Ocean between.</p>
<p>Plates can join together as a result of continental collisions. The join is known as a <em>suture</em>. An example is the Iapetus Suture which runs through eastern North America, Ireland, and Great Britain, marking where the Iapetus Ocean closed around 400 million years ago; England and Scotland were once on two seperate tectonic plates before they joined along that suture.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I imagine you are asking if the continental plates are, over millions of years, playing a game of geological dodgems where they bump into one another and then pull apart again largely unchanged in shape?  With the implicit assumption that the ocean-floor is a conveyor belt that  is readily consumed as the continents move about?  </p>
<p>To which the general answer is: <strong>Continental plates DO change in size and break apart</strong>.  Although they are certainly longer-lived and more consistent over time than the oceanic plates, continents are heavily transformed over time.  Continents are, compared to ocean floor &amp; the mantle, made out of lightweight material that is hard to subduct.  Therefore continental material stays on the Earth's surface, but </p>
<p>1) <strong>is heavily mangled in collisions</strong> between continents (see India-Asia collision, about 1300km of foreshortening)</p>
<p>2) <strong>is broken apart by rifting events</strong> (see the East-African triple junction centred on the South-Western corner of Arabia.  Two lines of splitting have successfully created the red sea &amp; gulf of Arden, and the third line of the triple junction is busy creating the East African rift valley.  This valley may ultimately break off a chunk of Africa as an island, similar to how Madagascar carved off Africa about 160 Myrs ago)</p>
<p>3) <strong>is stitched together (semipermanently) by collisions</strong>.  Which is to say, when continents collide together, they do not always break apart again along those same lines that they collided on.  (see the Iapetus Suture.  About 400 Myrs ago the Iapetus ocean closed, stitching together two continental masses.  When the Atlantic ocean opened, it split along a different path, most notably leaving Great Britain with a clear suture mark in the middle whereby Scotland and England are completely different kinds of rock)  </p>
<p>If you look at my examples with a skeptical eye, you will notice that they aren't exactly cutting major continents in half... I'm really playing with the edges (to the tune of a thousand km or so).  That's not a coincidence.  Whilst continents do get deformed and altered A LOT, there are some very stable chunks at the centre of continents that are highly resistant to deformation, generally called &quot;cratons&quot;, examples including scandinavia (centred on moscow.), central Africa,  North-Eastern America/Canada, Amazonia,  and Australia.  Best guess is that these chunks of continental have managed to become colder, harder and thicker than other bits of continent and therefore are unlikely to deform or fracture --- there is always something softer nearby that can break instead.  </p>
<p>TL;DR: Continents break, reform, and deform a quite a lot (although not as much as the oceans). However there are some resilient central regions to the continents that don't deform much even as a thousand km of continent is ploughed off the side of them</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another interesting phenomenon is subduction of plates, typically a more dense oceanic plate subducting underneath a less dense continental plate. Sometimes this leads to the suturing of 2 plates, but other times the subducting plate can disappear almost completely.</p>
<p>Back in the time of Pangea, there was a massive plate next to the North American Plate called the Farallon Plate. When Pangea was breaking up, this plate began subducting under the North American Plate (kind of like the end of a conveyor belt on slo-mo). On the other end of the plate was a mid ocean ridge creating new oceanic crust (think beginning end of conveyor belt in slo-mo) but the plate was being subducted faster than it was being created, thus &quot;shortening the conveyor belt&quot;. There are remenants of the Farallon Plate around today, but most of it is gone. Some of these smaller remenants are the Juan de Fuca, Rivera, and Cocos plates in North America, and there are other segments further south.</p>
<p>The Farallon Plate was mostly consumed as the Pacific Plate began subducting under North America, driving a wedge in between some of the remaining Farallon Plate segments. The subducting of the Pacific Plate is not completely  perpendicular to the North American Plate, and so formed the San Andreas Transform Fault where the plates are slipping past each other rather than meeting head on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m a final-year master’s student in Geodynamics, and the answer to your question is yes.</p>
<p>Briefly, the size and configuration of tectonic plates always change due to the heat from the core that is simply caused by the decay of radioactive elements such as potassium, thorium and uranium.</p>
<p>A recent example for the separation of plates would be the East Africa Rift Valley in Africa. Tens of millions of years from now a small part of land will have detached from the landmass of Africa, and a new ocean will be born in its wake.</p>
<p>Another example would be Pacific Plate, which is now moving westward and beneath Eurasian Plate slowly each year, becoming smaller in size in the process.</p>
<p>That being said, plates may grow larger in size, too, which we term “collision and accretion”. According to calculations, 250 million years from now all plates will form one single entity—a supercontinent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
