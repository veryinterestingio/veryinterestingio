		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your heart gets more efficient at pumping blood, you increase the number of red blood cells, you increase the number of mitochondria to metabolize fat faster, you increase the number of blood vessels feeding your muscles, you increase your body's ability to clear lactate, and you build mental toughness. All of those things contribute to stamina.</p>
<p>Edit: I neglected a big one! Neuromuscular adaptation. Your brain gets better at coordinating your muscles to do a certain activity the more you do that activity, increasing speed and efficiency.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body requires oxygen and sugar in order to make chemical energy in the form of a molecule called ATP.  To kick that process off, it needs the spent version of that fuel, called ADP.  So the ATP it has on-hand needs to be used up. Lucky for us, it can do that without oxygen in a process known as glycolysis.  </p>
<p>So after a little glycolysis, the oxidation can start in earnest.  Remember the old mitochondria, the powerhouse of the cell?  Damn right you do.  That's where the oxidation takes place.  Building stamina means a few things, but it chiefly means having more of those mitochondria on hand in your muscles.  </p>
<p>It also means a few other adaptations, like being able to more efficiently exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide, having a bigger supply of some key enzymes, a bigger supply of muscle sugars (called glycogen) and making more efficient use of your movements.</p>
<p>Improving strength is a different beast entirely.  The business end of your muscles are proteins that can slide past each other when your brain tells your muscle to contract. Each of these proteins is very small, and therefore produce a very minute amount of force, but they add up quickly!  You have millions of these little filaments giving it their all in your bigger muscles.</p>
<p>Your body actually employs several varieties of muscle fibers which correspond to the types of loads they typically see.  Postural muscles that are active at a low intensity all the time have a very robust blood supply and lots of mitochondria.  Your big movers like your thigh muscles sacrifice some of those structures in order to pack in more filaments and generate more strength, so they'll compensate by having more glycogen on-hand.  Knowing the function and composition of a muscle informs the ways it will respond best to training.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No one has mentioned this yet so I will: increased sensitivity to insulin is also a well known side effect of excersize. In “normals” this allows your cells to pull in glucose from the blood more rapidly to replenish what you’re using up as well as try to pack in the ATP because it wants to be ready for the next burst of activity. In Type 2 diabetes, a lack of exercise has the opposite effect and your cells lose sensitivity to insulin which then starts building up in your blood. Even a little regular exercise can change this dynamic and lower glucose levels.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
