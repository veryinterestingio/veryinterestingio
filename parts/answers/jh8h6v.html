		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At peak density individual star systems can be as close as .1 parsec (.3 ly) from each other in Galactic clusters/cores</p>
<p>Mind you.. 1/10th of a parsec is still roughly 20626 AU which is 670x the distance between the Sun &amp; Pluto or about 1,917,352,957,951 miles lol.</p>
<p>To put things into context New Horizon (launched in 2006) is moving @12.6 km/s and it would take over 6 <em>millennia</em> (6,325 years) to reach a star .10 parsecs away. Voyager 1 is moving @16.9 km/s and it could do it in a shade under 5 millennia (4,735 years). </p>
<p>Space. Is. Vast.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The very center of Globular Clusters are actually one of the few environments where dynamical timescale arguments tell us collisions (or near passes) of stars actually matter, I.e., one of the few places in the universe where, in a timescale ~age of the universe, you might expect a collision or close pass to have occurred in that time. Only in the center though, where stellar density is highest. </p>
<p>Stars almost never collide or even come close. It’s not so much about the distances between stars that matter, it’s the ratio of the radius of a star to the average separation between stars. This ratio is for stars is exceedingly small. (Try diving 1 solar radius by ~1 parsecs). In contrast, the average radius / distance ratio for galaxies is only like 1/10 or less. So galaxies DO often interact, collide, and merge. </p>
<p>Also to clarify one of the points above — the structure of the GC is maintained by the motions of the stars about the center of the GC. There are two types of motions in stellar systems — random, and ordered. Ordered motion is rotation, like in the Milky Way. Most stars orbit in the same direction and sense, coherently. Dispersion dominated systems like GCs have each star orbiting the center in some ~circular orbit that doesn’t care at all about the orientations of the orbits of any other star in the system. Basically the stars all buzz around the center of mass like bees around a hive. But all these orbital motions support the system against gravitational collapse. And norasguide correctly pointed out, binaries are common in general, but are almost never “made” by stellar systems coming together, rather, they form that way and only ever have the chance of being broken up — which often happens in dense stellar environments, where flybys or gravitational interactions create brief three body situations that can expel a star from its binary system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Binaries are very common! Many stars typically form in binaries, leading to a high primordial binary fraction. However, the effect of a dense stellar environment like a cluster actually decreases the binary fraction.</p>
<p>This is due to frequent interactions between stars which can disrupt a binary, as well as tidal effects from the cluster as a whole.</p>
<p>A typical GC has ~0.4 stars per cubic parsec, so an average distance of 1.4 parsec. However the density is not at all constant! It's much much more dense at the center, even as high as 1000 stars per cubic parsec, so the average distance is only .1 parsec.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The stars are very densely packed towards the center of a globular cluster compared to typical star densities elsewhere in the galaxy. But they are still much less densely packed than you might think from a picture like this. In the picture, each star appears as a little dot a few pixels across - a size that's comparable to the separation between the stars in the center. However, the size of those dots is not the actual size of the stars, it's just the angular resolution of the camera. <strong>The real size of the stars is about 1 millionth of a pixel</strong>. So if you could see that region of the sky without being limited by resolution effects you would see how empty the cluster really is, even at the center.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
