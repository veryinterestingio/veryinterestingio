		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Scavengers have an incredible sense of smell and can sniff out a dead body from a mile away.  They close in immediately and “dispose” of most small corpses pretty quickly.  Vultures and crows are the eyes in the sky watching for death at all times, and other predators and scavengers will follow them to a fresh scene too.</p>
<p>That said, I’ve definitely seen my share of waterlogged possum corpses.  Seems like predators have a tough time retrieving (or don’t want) bodies that end up in stagnant water - and this area is kinda swampy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Between scavengers, insects, and weather…nature is really efficient at breaking down animal remains until all that is left is bones.  And by then, scavengers usually scatter the bones about so there are random bits scattered about which makes it less noticeable to the casual hiker</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've seen a few corpses, but mainly bones. Then those bones find themselves under the soil, or if they are small rodent's bones, then in a nest because birds of prey sometimes eat their bones. Besides this, nature has a way of cleaning things up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The number cause of animal deaths in the wild is predation.  Most animals don't get to die peacefully while asleep, etc.  They are killed by predators.  The predators then eat them.  Any leftovers are eaten by scavengers, maggots, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
