		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a biologist studying impacts of climate change. I will try to keep this brief. </p>
<p>Global warming only encompasses a single symptom of climate change, that is a GLOBAL trend for temperatures to rise. It ignores the many other factors that make up climate, and ignores the fact that some LOCAL areas may have trends other than warming. </p>
<p>Climate change encompasses ALL of the impacts we will see (rising temperatures, changing rainfall patterns, changes in timing of seasons, changes in the number and severity of extreme events (storms, droughts, floods, heat waves, etc.), sea level rise, changes in air/ocean currents, the list goes on. It also realizes that because local climate is extremely complicated, and depends on local geography and its relation to other factors, there could be LOCAL effects that don't follow a warming trend. A good (hypothetical) example would be if air currents that tend to bring warm air from the Gulf of Mexico north into the US were to change, many of those areas in the Midwest might have cooler temperature trends, even if it is just seasonally. </p>
<p>Another important trend, at least in biology/conservation, is to use the term &quot;anthropogenic climate change&quot;, as 98% of scientists agree that it is caused by human activity, and this term prevents greedy industry and politicians from trying to confuse the issue. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another thing to remember is that global warming is just one small part of climate change.  When people discuss the former, they are specifically referring to the increasing average temperature.  When they discuss the latter, they <em>may</em> be referring to global warming, or to things like precipitation, shifting winds/currents, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Conservative strategist Frank Lutz pushed the idea of calling it climate change instead of global warming because climate change sounds less scary and can be conflated with historic changes. &quot;The climate is always changing, so what is happening now is fine&quot;- have you heard that &quot;&quot;&quot;logic&quot;&quot;&quot; before? It turns out that climate change is a helpful term for avoiding the equally logical &quot;it snowed today so the globe isn't warming&quot; argument. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
