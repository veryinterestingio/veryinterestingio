		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few things at work here. Iron (and nickel) are especially abundant in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_of_the_chemical_elements#Solar_system" target="_blank">the solar system</a> compared to many other elements (and significantly more abundant than much heavier elements like gold or copper, though copper is not nearly as rare as gold). Much of this has to do with how different elements are formed, i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleosynthesis" target="_blank">nucleosynthesis</a>, in which iron and nickel represent the heaviest elements produced in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_nucleosynthesis" target="_blank">stellar nucleosynthesis</a> and heavier elements are only made in special environments like neutron stars. There is also some aspect of nuclear stability playing into the relative abundances (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_binding_energy#Nuclear_binding_energy_curve" target="_blank">nuclear binding energy</a>) that tend to make iron and nickel both relatively stable and abundant compared to other elements in similar mass ranges.</p>
<p>After planets and planetoids formed from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accretion_%28astrophysics%29" target="_blank">accretion</a> and during the process of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_differentiation" target="_blank">planetary differentiation</a>, elements within accreted planets and planetoids separate by density (and with some influence of chemical gradients as well) and with iron and nickel being the most abundant of the heavy elements in the solar system, these tended to (1) be reasonably abundant in these planets and planetoids and (2) sink toward the center of these bodies, forming their cores. Iron/nickel rich meteorites, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_meteorite" target="_blank">siderites</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallasite" target="_blank">pallasites</a> represent the core (or near the core mantle boundary) of former planets or planetoids which were destroyed. An extreme example of this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16_Psyche" target="_blank">psyche</a>, an asteroid which is believed to be an exposed core of a former planet / planetoid.</p>
<p>EDIT: For those finding this later, check out good comments from /u/agate_ (<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ij3y08/why_do_there_seem_to_be_so_many_meteors_rich_in/g3bvbzf/" target="_blank">here</a>) and /u/meteoritehunter (<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ij3y08/why_do_there_seem_to_be_so_many_meteors_rich_in/g3c6kww/" target="_blank">here</a>) later in this thread explaining why in addition to everything above, the processes which tend to concentrate copper and gold on Earth are unlikely to have occurred on most asteroids etc (and thus concentrations of those elements in meteorites is unlikely).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
