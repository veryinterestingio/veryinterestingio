		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as I know, Neanderthals proper stop east of Siberia but Denosovians are known from Siberia. </p>
<p>Anyway, Siberia's a big place and I'm not aware of any human remains in <em>northern</em> Siberia until modern humans show up.  Fossils are of course pretty sparse, but if neanderthals and denosovians were limited to lower latitudes because of an inability to survive harsh weather further north, they wouldn't have been able to get far enough north to cross the land bridge.  </p>
<p>Here's an example of the sort of estimated range map you often see for these species...present along the southern part of Siberia, but still not far enough north to be close to Beringia.  Bear in mind this is based off sparse  data, but it's a possible reason.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Bering Land Bridge was different than you imagine, it was less of a bridge, and more of an oasis.</p>
<p>It wasn't a bridge people crossed into America, but a whole continent that rose from the sea during the ice age which was warmer than the surrounding areas. At that time North America was an absolute wasteland of ice and snow, and completely inhospitable, and humans lived in Beringia for thousands of years while it was relatively warm. When the ice age started ending, and Berengia started flooding, most people went back to Siberia, but a few went forward to North America. This was about 15,000 years ago.</p>
<p>Out of all the people who crossed into America, only 70 individuals can be identified through genetic marking. We think of North America as a abundant and habitable land, but a trip to Yellowstone and or the Grand Canyon will tell you it was apocalyptic relatively recently.</p>
<p>Especially after the ice ages, when people would be physically capable of migrating from Beringia into North America, heralded massive floods caused by ice dams breaking.</p>
<p>So why did Neanderthals not move with humans during the deglaciation? It's simple, they were already extinct. North America opened up about 15,000 years ago, Neanderthals died out 40000 years ago.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even though the Bering land bridge did not exist until around 70,000 years ago, we must take into account that human migration through Beringia would have been incredibly unlikely (if not impossible), until the Laurentide/Cordillerian ice sheets retreated to allow a route of migration into the Americas 14,000 years ago. Neanderthals are thought to have gone extinct around 40k years ago, so even if they were able to get to that part of Siberia (which we have no evidence for), they probably would not have been able to realistically get to North America.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Neanderthals never made it that far east  or that far north.  The Neanderthals made it to approximately northern Central Asia — basically the area where Russian and all the “Stans” meet.  Although the Neanderthals were adapted to cold, use of high latitudes (like arctic circle latitudes) did not occur until the spread of modern humans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Speculation here but it could be that Neanderthalers might not have been much with with the seafaring.  They were at Gibraltar in southern europe within sight of Africa (likely off-and-on) for millennia, they could see it most days, but never made it across. </p>
<p>This might be relevant to Beringia because we're not all-together sure how we moved across it into North America proper.  The interior route (through what is now northern Canada) might have been impassable (or really unappealing) as might have been the coast, but a little hopping down the coast on boats might open up the continent.  </p>
<p>We have good reasons to suspect <em>h. s. sapiens</em> were using watercraft way earlier than this, most notably in the settling of Australia ~60k.  That can't be done without at least one open-water crossing of 90 miles or so.  Not impossible that this crossing was an accident but it's pretty unlikely.</p>
<p>Should add that there's basically no evidence that I've ever seen that Neanderthals ever got anywhere near Beringia, but even if they did, they might not have been able to use it as a stepping stone to north america.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
