		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There certainly is a dearth of studies and a lot of claims being made about CBD. This is obviously a rapidly growing industry with a lot of interest. What options do you see to broadly establish trust and quality control? I appreciate that a study was conducted here, but I think people also are generally wary of industry-funded studies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With no approved use for CBD outside of one medication used to treat intractable epilepsy, how is this kind of study beneficial - outside of marketing information for Caliper?</p>
<p>Is that the whole point? You can market your product based on absorption rate because you can't legally market it to treat any diseases or conditions?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
