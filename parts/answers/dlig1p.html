		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every patient have different profiles of their behaviours. Isolation cells in general have very little to no positive effects on sociopathic people (though please bear in mind that sociopath is an informal term to use) because humans are social animals and restricting one's ability to communicate likely only manifests someone's condition.</p>
<p>Anti-social behaviours don't make people go insane unless environmental factors which cause them to develop other disorders like psychosis which further alter their mental state.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most human beings can function without other human beings for long periods of time. Their happiness is likely to be negatively affected, but to my knowledge solitude isn't otherwise harmful.</p>
<p>Harmful effects are separate from merely being isolated. Solitary confinement in prison is very stressful. And when stuck in space/underwater/extreme weather for a long time there is a large risk of cabin fever. These aren't really caused by the absence of people (though human contact might make the situation less stressful). Afaik, this is more related to lack of outside stimulus, monotony, claustrophobia and getting stuck in a destructive mental routine. Whether this is worse or better for sociopaths, I don't know.</p>
<p>Edit: added claustrophobia.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think people with anti social personality disorder enjoy manipulating and using other people too much. They can't live without other people, but for different reasons. As boredom is a problem for them, I imagine isolation with complete lack of interesting stimuli would drive them crazy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
