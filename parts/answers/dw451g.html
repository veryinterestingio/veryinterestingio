		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The vagus nerve, one of 12 cranial nerves, runs from the brain all the way down through the thorax. It's name essentially means &quot;wanderer,&quot; as it has many branches that innervate many parts of the body, which is kind of strange, right? Why is a cranial nerve coming directly down from the brain and traveling into the chest? Idk about the evolutionary relevance, but the observation is that this nerve has a lot of cortical input, meaning it's firing is based heavily on how we are feeling and thinking. So yeah, you feel a sensation in your chest, and you also feel a lump in your throat because the vagus has a branch that straight up just turns around and decides to go back up the body and innervate your larynx (voicebox)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
