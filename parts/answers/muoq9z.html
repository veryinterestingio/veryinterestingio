<li>
<p>Of course no problem in the world has only one cause, but could you speak to what the primary source of antimicrobial resistance is? I understand we overuse antibiotics. Is this more often cases like &quot;Hey doctor, give me antibiotics for my flu!&quot;, or cases where people don't finish their antibiotics, or is it the antibiotics we feed to livestock? Could you give a general overview of how bad each of these practices are and which one, if you had to pick, you'd eliminate?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do you think about the potential to use bacteriophages in the contexts where we have historically used antibiotics?</p>
</li>
<li>Imagine, <em>hypothetically</em>, I did some experiments with Atomic Gardening and some fungal samples, and I had produced something that appeared to act as an antibiotic against E. Coli samples. What would be the proper course of action to have an expert verify whether this is a new antibiotic?</li>
