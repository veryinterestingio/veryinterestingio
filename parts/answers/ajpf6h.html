		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's something other people haven't mentioned here at play and that's the nature of the would too.</p>
<p>Scratches and cuts bleed, that's the bodies second line of defense (skin being #1).  You bleed out, this actually helps push stuff out, it forms a clot and scab blocking new contaminates.  </p>
<p>Puncture wounds often times don't bleed out.  So everything that goes in, stays in, and this is a problem.  Cut's that don't bleed are actually a problem too but this is uncommon, more for deep puncture wounds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever noticed that when you step on a nail it’s usually healed over by the end of the day? That’s exactly what clostridium tetani likes. It needs a warm, anaerobic environment and what is better to provide that than a deep hole that heals over quickly?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tetanus is a bacteria that can be found on ANY dirty surfaces. It’s a common misconception that it could only be found on rust. It’s another misconception that the rust itself causes tetanus. It doesn’t. The bacteria can only survive in places with no oxygen. If you have a deep wound, there is little to no oxygen deep inside your body. If it’s a surface cut, that cut is much more exposed to oxygen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
