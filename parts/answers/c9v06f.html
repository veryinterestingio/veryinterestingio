		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Strategically, it completely removed one of the main geopolitical thorns in the US' side in the Middle East. Iraq is no longer at odds with the US' most important ally in the theatre, Saudi Arabia, and isn't flinging missiles at their other important ally, Israel.</p>
<p>The US also gained air bases in Iraq which could be invaluable in a potential war against the new geopolitical Middle Eastern thorn in the US' side, Iran. Most likely a US invasion of Iran would be staged primarily in Saudi, Oman and Bahrain and would be primarily aerial for most if not all of the conflict, so bases right next door would obviously be useful, provided Iraq allows the US to use them to mount an aerial campaign. They would probably only see significant use towards the end of the war, however, as most of them I believe are within range of Iranian cruise missiles.</p>
<p>If the US <em>did</em> decide to mount a ground campaign (which they probably wouldn't) it would likely go through Iraq (whether they liked it or not), south of Basrah across the Shatt-al-Arab river on the Iranian border. It's unlikely Iraq would give them permission to do that, but it's even more unlikely they'd actually do anything about it besides formally complain and summon the US ambassador.</p>
<p>Edit: as u/Patranus mentioned which I meant to include: the US gained valuable experience of what a modern war would look like, and in the theatre it's most likely to happen in again. <em>So</em> many lessons were learnt from the Iraq war, it honestly completely changed a lot of things about the US and other NATO militaries. Russia, China et al do not have that same experience and that gives the US an extremely significant edge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine how much money, cash money, went to the US never to be seen again. Several billion I'd guess. So that's in the pockets of the US, somewhere.</p>
<p>Also, Iraq had a lot of gold bullion, a lot of it never turned up. So that's in those pockets too.</p>
<p>Oil, OMG the oil, one of the biggest fields of oil in the world. That's producing a lot of revenue every moment of every day for several Americans.</p>
<p>But for America, it's people, and citizens. Not a fucking thing, they arguably paid for the war, but go none of the spoils.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The fact that, with our involvement in Afghanistan as well, we now have our forces on both sides of Iran.</p>
<p>Iran is backed by Russia.</p>
<p>We kicked the Russians out of the Middle East in the 80's by arming the Taliban, led by Osama Bin Laden, who at the time was a CIA asset.</p>
<p>Russia invaded the middle east because they had a plan to build a pipeline from the abundant oil fields in the Middle East all the way up to Iran (Or Syria) where they would reap the benefits.</p>
<p>We invaded the Middle East so that we could create the same pipeline to our own allied countries (Israel, Turkey) so that WE could reap the benefits.</p>
<p>What you hear about us fighting terrorism and fighting the good fight is just pure bogus. We invaded Libya for the fact that Gaddafi had been an enemy and aggravator of the U.S. and our operations in the area and the fact the Gold Dinar would have thrown the economy in the area out of our favor. It was nothing about saving a bunch of people surrounded by his army. If we cared about that... If we were really the big good guys of the world who wanted to save everyone, we would have ended the War in Darfur by now. We would have ended a lot of the wars in Africa and the Middle East instead of propagating them.</p>
<p>The money in Big Oil is obvious, but there's huge money in weapons and arms deals as well. We've been arming factions against each other in these regions to cause instability - instability that helps us move into the region to look like the good guys, but it's not about that. It's about the money and it always has been. This is what we do. It's called &quot;Regime Change&quot;. We destabilize areas that are backed by Russia and then we replace the government with one that is in our favor instead. It's basically monopoly played by criminals on a global scale.</p>
<p>As General Dwight D. Eisenhower said as he left office (probably the only time it was safe for him to say it):</p>
<p>&quot;Beware the Military Industrial Complex.&quot;</p>
<p>And as George Orwell said in 1984: &quot;We've always been at war with Eastasia.&quot;</p>
<p>Add in a quote about Big Oil and you have your three reasons why we're involved in the Middle East and why the U.S. meddles with places like this in general. We do the same in South America. ExxonMobil and the like have made people abandon their villages down there just so they could drill for oil.</p>
<p>It's the stuff you don't hear in the news, but that's why were there and it's one of the few &quot;assets&quot; or &quot;tactical advantages&quot; of being in any of these places.</p>
<p>The goal: To keep the area in the West's hands for profit (Oil and Arms) and to keep the East (Russia, China) out!</p>
<p>If you want to believe otherwise, that's up to you, and it may help you sleep well at night, but this is why we're there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
