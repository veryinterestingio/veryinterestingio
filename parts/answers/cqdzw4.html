		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Recession expectations can be self-fulfilling via the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_thrift" target="_blank">paradox of thrift</a>, but not in the way you have worded it. First, we need to define the basic concepts you mentioned:</p>
<p>A <strong>recession</strong> is when total national income, measured by GDP, along with other measures such as employment and retail sales, falls for several months across the country. Think of this as a real, sustained reduction in economic activity.</p>
<p>A <strong>market crash</strong> is a severe drop in the value of stocks and other financial assets. It can be driven by some short-term shock, including psychological factors, or it can be driven by new information and expectations about what's going to happen to corporate profits--including due to falling expectations for economic growth.</p>
<p><strong>Predictions</strong>--generally referred to as &quot;expectations&quot; by economists--might be those of 1) stock market traders and financial institutions, 2) the Federal Reserve (the central bank of the US), or 3) the average consumer.</p>
<p>How do these things fit together?</p>
<ol>
<li>If these traders and financial institutions freak out and the market crashes, it is unlikely to cause a recession. Some of the worst recessions in the past have been caused by financial crises, but most financial crises do not cause recessions. The stock market crash at the end of the 90's internet bubble is a very good example of this. Investors realized they'd overvalued a bunch of tech stocks, causing a massive sell-off. But most economic activity went along the way it was, since it didn't directly affect them.</li>
<li>If the Federal Reserve thinks a recession is coming, they will cut interest rates further to prevent it. So Fed expectations of a recession are more likely to <em>stop</em> a recession than cause it.</li>
<li>If the average consumer anticipates a recession, <em>this is where things get dangerous.</em> When consumers expect hard times ahead, they cut back on spending and start saving for a rainy day. But, by doing that, they cause a reduction in overall spending (aggregate demand) and thus cause businesses to cut back on investment and employment, leading to a recession. This is the classic &quot;paradox of thrift&quot; scenario.</li>
</ol>
<p>TLDR; Predictions of a recession might cause a recession, but not because of the market crash. The predictions might cause a recession by freaking the average person out and causing them to cut back on spending.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The prediction is a sort of self fulfilling prophecy. However a prediction of a recession will not do much unless all the analysts in the market also make the same prediction. In addition people will be looking for some sort of trigger in addition to having predicted the recession. So if there is some sort of trigger and nobody predicts a recession then there will not be one yet. However if at some later point you get the same trigger but the majority of the market does predict that the recession is close it will trigger it and cause a recession.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a theory that when it comes to large scale human behavior as soon as you start to measure something, the measurement loses some of its value.  You want to measure how well your business is doing?  Measure quarterly profit and instantly the company will start to do weird shit to boost quarterly figures in the short term.  </p>
<p>However just because measurements corrupt things doesn't mean that they are useless.  Everyone has been eyeing the market thinking that it is behaving oddly.  Valuations on assets are sky high, unemployment is low, yet inflation is low and wages are not rising.  People have been watching these bond yield numbers for a year now seeing them flashing danger signs and this is just the straw that broke the camel's back in terms of convincing people there is a real challenge here.  </p>
<p>The fundamentals of the market are fucked up right now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If it were that shallow, yes. But there is a ton of real data, visible to all investors, that goes into that prediction. So in reality it is the actual data about economic performance that leads to the recession.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The technical definition of recession is 2 consecutive negative gdp quarters.</p>
<p>The market is basically how much people will be paying for expected earnings of companies and dividends.</p>
<p>The first affects the second, but only really becomes causal if people and businesses and governments actually stop spending money. </p>
<p>So if market actually scares people it can contribute to a recession; but there’s a lot of stuff that goes into the gdp calculation (consumer spending, business spending, investment, govt spending) so it probably wouldn’t ever be the primary factor if an economist would make a write up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
