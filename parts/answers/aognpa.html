<p>Can astronauts use their cell phones to make calls or text?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The International Space Station does have internet access. They can make calls or text over the internet/Wi-Fi (like Wi-Fi calling, Facetime, or Skype does), but they can't make a &quot;normal&quot; phone call because there are no cell towers. I don't know if they can just use it whenever they want since bandwidth would be limited and probably must be kept free most of the time for official business.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Isnâ€™t all that information going from a cell tower, to a satellite?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, your phone connects to a cell tower, and then there are cables and wires connected to the cell tower that your data moves through. Neither you nor the cell towers connect to a satellite.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
