		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The flu kills about 1 in every 10,000 people that get it.</p>
<p>COVID-19 kills 200 in every 10,000 it infects.</p>
<p>People compare the general death tolls without putting it into context of how many got it. Also we are not done with this virus yet, it will spread and kill a lot more. </p>
<p>There are strains of the flu that do kill at the rate that COVID-19 does and on rare occasions outbreaks of those do happen, but they are taken just as seriously as this years outbreak is, the last time this happened was in 2009 with the H1N1 influenza virus.</p>
<p>Additionally since this is a highly contagious strain of a virus family that does not commonly infect humans, there is a fear that may potentially become a recurring event in human history like the flu. If it spreads enough, there is a possibility that it will become a disease that stays around in the centuries to come with enough infections to mutate a strain resistant to past vaccines like the flu is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Infection rate is similar to flu, death rate is much higher,  there is no vaccine yet. </p>
<p>Iâ€™m talking about rates and not actual numbers, because while the flu is a pandemic and affects basically everyone, COVID-19 not yet. If you project the death rate over the global population, you would end up with a much higher number than flu.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know how every year we have a flu vaccine? We dont have one for this. We are able to anticipate seasonal flu based on testing and create a vaccine before it hits. Its some of the best and underrated science we humans do. Still, seasonal flu kills a lot of people even with a vaccine. Like Covid-19 it's mostly young or old or those with compromised health. Even with a 2% mortality if 100m are infected that's still 2m deaths. In a modern society, that's unacceptable. The 2 week latency period is especially difficult.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
