		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The definition I've always learned is &quot;Drill is used to move a group of people from point A to point B in a smart and orderly fashion.&quot; Teaches cohesion, obedience and discipline. Though marching isn't necessarily used in combat anymore, drill is used to build up into other movements and more complex and relevant strategies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Discipline. The military instills discipline, unity, and following orders from day one.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a teaching tool for many reasons.  How to move as a unit, how to take orders, and builds self discipline.  Not moving on parade when you aren't supposed to, making precise movements in unison, and making it look good are all individual contributions to the unit's overall image and perceived capability.</p>
<p>It also teaches recruits to act when they're told to.  Much easier to embed this with drill than say on an active rifle range. </p>
<p>A lot of it is practical in that it makes roll calls, giving orders, and moving people easier than gaggling.  There's also the ceremonial aspect of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the other answers, marching is also a hold over from when it <em>was</em> practical in combat. </p>
<p>The the olden days, unit formation on the battlefield was very important. Marching allowed for your army to move together and maintain cohesion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
