		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello. My question is that many people say that deforestation can be solved by aforestation. But aforestation is just planting trees where they werenâ€™t before. This is not good enough as it doesn't restore the ecosystem that was destroyed by deforestation. So is there any way to completely restore the destroyed ecosystem? If not, can such an ecosystem be made artificially?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
