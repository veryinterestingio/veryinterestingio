		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, tldr: because it is safe, in the form of Teflon (which is a solid polymer), but as a monomer, it is dangerous to humans.</p>
<p>By itself, it is dangerous, but that hasn't stopped the use of dangerous chemicals, just increased safety standards during the manufacture.</p>
<p>Once you change the chemical bonds inside the molecule, the properties are changed. Chemistry works in a weird ways, for example, the same molecule can be either deadly or an effective drug to combat severe desease (enantiomers).</p>
<p>Now, to explain why it is still used and how it is safe (kinda) think about table salt and gold production.</p>
<p>Table salt (NaCl) is made of sodium (explosive when exposed to oxygen) and chlorine (deadly as pure gas). Together they make a lattice (cage-like structure) through bonds (almost polymer like), and salt is produced, which is safe to consume. </p>
<p>Polyethylene is made of ethylene, which is toxic. And the same story goes for plastic bottles made from PFTE that carry water, milk, soft drinks, etc.</p>
<p>Gold uses cyanide heap leaching. Cyanide is a very potent poison. Release of gaseous cyanide in a factory guarantees almost no survivors. BUT the safety precautions associated with this process are very high. Therefore it is still used today. And many produces use dangerous chemicals as a starting material.</p>
<p>So at the end of the day, Teflon is safe to use, and it's production is controlled to ensure noone gets harmed (obviously depends on the country safety standards).</p>
<p>Edit: before people say that Teflon is still carcinogenic, yes it might be, if you eat it in large amounts over years. Smoking (and even bacon, according to some sources) are carcinogens, but that doesn't stop people from consuming such. And if we get down the line of conspiracy theories, then well, I don't know what else to say.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh they were DEFINITELY carcinogenic and caused birth defects.  Watch <em>The Devil We Know</em> documentary for the full history and how that all went down.</p>
<p>Basically, after years and years of lawsuits and back and forth they finally got a specific chemical marked as carcinogenic and Dupont voluntarily stopped using it.... and replaced it with this chemical.   This means that everyone has to start from scratch to prove that THIS chemical does basically the same thing.  It'll take another twenty years.  The fact that it's chemically similar doesn't mean it starts in a different spot, legally, really.</p>
<p>And I haven't used a nonstick pan since I watched that documentary.  Powerful stuff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
