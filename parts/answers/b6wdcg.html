		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I haven't seen a good response that actually talks about the properties of vinyl, so I'll give it a shot...</p>
<p>The reason vinyl is still used is because it is really perfectly suited to this task. It's cheap, readily available, very consistent, easy to mold, and most importantly - it's very quiet as a medium. We have stronger plastics, sure. But getting that clean impression from the stamper is important and vital for getting a record that sounds good. Old shellac records were noisy - lots of hiss, the surface was as good as it could have been for the time - but it's still not great. Not to mention, heavy, brittle... shellac was a lousy material for records.</p>
<p>Enter vinyl - it's soft, flexible, and durable. Vinyl, as a material, is incredibly stable. It does not break down, and it's immune to most chemicals. I remember a forum post years ago where a guy tested various cleaning products on a Milli Vanilli album, in an attempt to see what could dissolve it. He eventually did find something - but he did find just how hard it is to chemically damage vinyl. This is also why records pressed in the 60's still sound perfect (assuming well cared for) - the plastic is long term stable.</p>
<p>Vinyl is very durable. Despite the fact that it can be easily scratched, it stands up to the weight of the stylus well, and an album can be played thousands of times on properly set up equipment without degrading. It's also very flexible - you can hold a vinyl record and &quot;wobble&quot; it back and forth and it won't damage it. Sure, you can break a vinyl record, but it's kind of hard to do this accidentally. It survives shipping well.</p>
<p>The surface of a vinyl record is very quiet, because the material is so smooth and soft. Making a record out of something like polycarbonate - the stuff they make CD's out of - would function, but the hard, brittle plastic would likely be very noisy, and it would probably be susceptible to the grooves chipping and breaking. Despite the fact that the stylus tracks at only about 2 grams, it's very tiny, and a diamond. The pressure at the tip is actually pretty high.</p>
<p>Shellac and vinyl are NOT the only materials that were used for records. Polystyrene was also widely used. This is what they made most 45 RPM records out of, back in the 60's and 70's. Hold one up to the light - if you can see reddish through it, it's polystyrene, not vinyl. This is a hard, brittle plastic somewhat like polycarbonate. These records perform poorly, and wear out quickly. The surface is noisier than vinyl, and the grooves don't hold up to the stylus like vinyl does. This material was used for 45's not because it was cheaper - but because polystyrene can be liquefied and injection molded. This meant that the stampers didn't wear out as fast, so they could crank out more records with less overall costs. They wore out quickly, but - 45 RPM singles were viewed as disposable, and sold cheaply. The wear problem was known at the time, and sometimes they would make vinyl runs of the same single for jukebox and DJ use.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Audio for records is recorded to a surface that is scratched, then a mold is made, then a metal cast is made, called a master, then that metal mold is used to press vinyl into the shape of the recording.<br />
Vinyl is used because it is easier to get a good copy of the mold without sticking to the metal.<br />
It's just cheaper and easier, and lasts long enough that most people don't notice the quality degrading.<br />
Edit: a couple of people have objected to me leaving out an electroplating step. I will say, my explanation is basically correct. I am not an  expert, this is ELI5, one part of the casting step used is electroplating, the terms used vary widely. The part I called a master, is also called a couple of other things at the same step. Enjoy the ELI5 it is technically correct, the best kind of correct, and terms differ in use.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Due to the biggest advantage of Vinyl being that it is an analogue recording of the sound, the biggest issue is any record material needs to be light enough so that the recording needle can actually scratch down all the fine nuances and details of an audio recording yet also be durable for multiple playback. I'm no expert but I would imagine that there are few materials that can fulfill both criteria, too heavy of a material (like an ultra durable composite polymer) would not be able to adequately be abraded to capture the fine details while something light like Shellac has obvious disadvantages. </p>
<p>If RnD persevered, I would imagine they would've refined the medium to some kind of composite polymer in the end but with the advent of CDs, it was not financially viable to keep refining analogue records so Vinyl kinda stuck.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also, you want a material that doesn't damage the needle, so something soft but stiff. Vinyl does that well. Shellac is actually brittle, and flakes off easily. The very first records were was, which has obvious problems. If you made aluminum records, the needle would flake and chip, and wear out quickly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
