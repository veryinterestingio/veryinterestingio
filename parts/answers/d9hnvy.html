It was later discovered that Sgr A is itself comprised of multiple components. The bright and compact central component was named Sagittarius A*, there's also Sgr A East which appears to be an unusually large supernova remnant and Sgr A West which may be associated with material moving towards the black hole.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The <strong>asterisks</strong> arose because in atomic physics, excited states of atoms are denoted by <strong>asterisks</strong> â€” and <strong>Sgr</strong> A* is an incredibly exciting discovery. &quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of different stories here, which is surprising. What I thought I had learned is that the asterisk (actually pronounced &quot;star&quot;) means &quot;hypothetical&quot;, because we can't actually see the object, we can only infer that it is there due to the gravitational effects on the stars around it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
