		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi! I'm an audiologist, someone who specializes in hearing and balance. </p>
<p>This phenomenon is known as transient ear noise. It's completely normal and can happen to anyone. It may last several seconds, possibly up to a minute. </p>
<p>There's lots of theories about why this happens, but it could be due to caffeine use, head position, tension, etc. It can also happen for no reason at all. </p>
<p>They're typically harmless occurrences and don't mean damage is occuring to the hearing system. There's no evidence to connect the events with hearing loss or more serious tinnitus (ringing in the ear).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This may get buried. It has to do with the phenomenon of attenuation and the tensor tympani muscle. You have a muscle in the middle ear who's purpose is to limit the vibration of the ear drum. Normally to protect you from loud sounds. When it contracts or spasms, there is a decrease in the amplitude and range of vibration that is transmitted to the inner ear. </p>
<p>Now your brain also has this mechanism where it tunes out stimuli that are present continuously for too long. That way you can focus on more important changes. When the tensor tympani spasms, and those static signals decrease, your brain interprets this as a change and you hear the   difference. Similar to staring too long at a high contrast image and then looking at a white piece of paper.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This can very commonly also be caused by myoclonus (spontaneous rhythmic contractions) or spasm of the stapedius muscle in your middle ear or tensor tympani muscle, which makes your eardrum taut.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
