		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have pointed out, Earth and Mars formed from the same planetary disk, so the overall ratios of elements are probably pretty similar.</p>
<p>However, we aren't blending Mars into a smoothie- we only care about elements that are close enought to the surface to reach.</p>
<p>During planetary formation, most metals and heavier elements end up in the core, but some still get left near the surface. Meteoroid impacts also deposit more ores near the surface over time.</p>
<p>Edit: have been informed that the following last few sentances are incorrect, or at least nowhere close to the full story. Read on with healthy skepticism:</p>
<p>Earth is regularly resurfaced by plate techtonics (at least on long timescales) while Mars is pretty much frozen, accumulating more and more meteorite impacts. So Mars may very well have more abundant metal sources near the surface, conveniently marked by craters.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Metal deposits on Earth are typically formed by flow of heated water through deep cracks in the crust. Water of that high temperature hold dissolved metals. When the water cools or reaches a place where the pressure is low the metals will precipitate and we call that deposit a vein. <a href="http://www.geologyin.com/2014/11/veins-and-hydrothermal-deposits.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.geologyin.com/2014/11/veins-and-hydrothermal-deposits.html" target="_blank">http://www.geologyin.com/2014/11/veins-and-hydrothermal-deposits.html</a></a></p>
<p>Since there is a history of volcanoes on Mars it is safe to assume that there will likely be some metal ore or vein deposits.  Volcanism on Mars was active perhaps up to 500 millions ago and there may be some activity today. As an aside the most recent lander on Mars was sent to study marsquakes and will help determine how active it is today. To find metal deposits on Mars we would look near plate boundaries. Moons of Jupiter are mostly iceballs and unlikely to have metal deposits anywhere other the core.</p>
<p>We have studied the geochemistry of Mars and the elements on Mars are the same as on Earth. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>By the time we have the technology to go to Mars, mine, and bring back to Earth metals in such quantity as to be economically useful, we'll be mining asteroids.  Asteroids such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16_Psyche" target="_blank">16 Psyche</a> are likely to contain incredible quantities of metal, enough to render all Earth mining obsolete, and returning the metals from an asteroid is almost certainly going to be cheaper than escaping Mars gravity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing most responses didn't touch on or if they did kinda glossed over is your last question.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Would we potentially find a new metal or element?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>New metal (alloy,) probably not.  The same type of chemical processes likely occurred on Mars as on Earth.  Some asteroids have mineral compounds that are found rarely or not at all on Earth, but I'm not aware of any that are of economical or scientific significance.</p>
<p>New element, absolutely not.  We've discovered or synthesized in anything from a nuclear reactor to a particle accelerator all the way up to element 118. The last 15 or so have half-lives of milliseconds to hours.  There's a hypothesized &quot;island of stability&quot; further on in the table, but wouldn't result in anything stable, just with a slightly longer half-life, (seconds to minutes, probably).  Uranium is the heaviest naturally-occurring element, with a halflife of up to millions of years, depending on the isotope.</p>
<p>The odds of us ever discovering a new* naturally occurring element anywhere, assuming the laws of physics are the same across the universe, are astronomically low.  They would possibly be synthesized in a supernova, but any detection equipment we had near a supernova would be annihilated before it could transmit data of anything it detected.</p>
<p>A few minor edits for clarity. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, I'm pretty sure I'm not supposed to answer this since I'm not any relevant kind of scientist</p>
<p>My understanding is &quot;yes, dramatically more often, because Mars did not undergo an iron crisis&quot;</p>
<p>One of the fundamental events in the formation of our planet was that a big planetoid hit us, liquefying both.  The resulting lava lamp became Earth and The Moon.</p>
<p>This is relevant because Earth's heavy stuff, which includes almost all the metals you're asking about, are way more in-the-center than most planets, as a result of being liquefied after being aggregated, which isn't common.  </p>
<p>This is why we have a metal core that provides us such a great magnetic field.</p>
<p>Also, however, the more important question is &quot;why bother?  There's way more metal that's easier to get in the asteroid belt.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
