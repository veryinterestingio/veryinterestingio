Some trees, such as aspens, can live in large clonal populations where there is minimal genetic variation. Of course, if a person has an identical twin you can’t tell them apart with genetic testing either.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others above have said, so long at the tree is a unique genetic individual (not a member of a clonal colony or a propagated clone), it is theoretically possible. However, the reason we are able to do this type of analysis in humans is because we have so much information about the human genome. Many scientists work with human DNA, and a lot of work has been put into being able to identify the source of human DNA specifically for forensic reasons. The human genome has also been fully sequenced many upon many times which has allowed us to create very high quality human reference genomes. This in turn makes us intricately aware of many sites in the genome that are variable between humans. We can therefore look at specific variable sites in the DNA left (for example) at a crime scene and compare it to the DNA from suspects to see if all the sites of the DNA are variable in the same way. We probably wouldn't be able to do this with trees just because of a lack of information. Not many scientists work on tree genetics, and many species have never been studied genetically ever. We don't know many (or any) variable sites in pretty much any tree species, and tree genomes are very difficult to work with in general (weird chromosome numbers, hard to extract the DNA, etc). Most species, most genera, heck even most FAMILIES of trees don't have a reference genome to work from, and if they do it's very low quality. This would make comparative DNA analysis very difficult.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Question: I heard that with, for instance, all apple trees of a specific type of apples are grown from a cutting of another tree, never from seeds. And that this means that all apple trees are essentially clones. (Similar with bananas, resulting in banana tree diseases a few decades ago).</p>
<p>So I guess that means all these trees have the same DNA as well?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>actually i’m in Forensics and a strand of hair isn’t able to be traced back to someone specific unless it has DNA from the follicular tag i believe. of course if it does have dna on it, as long as the person it traces back to has a twin it still remains as class evidence and not individual evidence which actually is someone specific.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Forensic botany is a real field.</p>
<p>There was a murder case in the 1990s where a suspect claimed he never visited the murder site, but a search of his truck turned up seed pods of trees from the crime scene. They sampled the DNA from every tree on the property and were able to make a match to the DNA from the seed pod. There was enough minute differences in DNA between the trees to individually identify them.</p>
<p>I can’t remember any more details. I saw this on a murder mystery TV show years ago.</p>
<p>I know seed pods aren’t like leaves, but leaves aren’t like hair, either. You need the fleshy bit at the end of the hair to do DNA sampling. The hair is otherwise colored keratin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
