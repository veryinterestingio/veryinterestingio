		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The salts and sugar help the water be absorbed faster by the body, as there is a sodium-glucose cotransporter  in the intestines. You can look up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_rehydration_therapy" target="_blank">oral rehydration solution</a> for a medical product that does basically the same, just better. But it does not hydrate the body more. You only get the water a few minutes quicker in the bloodstream.</p>
<p>But Gatorade contains less than 1 liter water per liter (edit: \~5%), to due all the solved molecules. So if you are only limited on water, gatorade might be a worse choice. If you are sweating a lot and not eating (gives many electrolytes), gatorade might me a better choice.</p>
<p>Outside of extreme conditions, in everyday life, water is the better choice. (Edit: because normally you want to avoid sugar and overloading on salts)</p>
<p>Edit: in severe dehydration, especially due to diarrhea, Oral rehydration solution is best.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Couldn't find the actual study in a quick search. If you want to blow a 5-year-old's mind. Chocolate milk was used as a control to access sports drinks and did just as well for recovery.</p>

<p>Looking at this article about it, most of the advantages measured were how your muscles recover from the workout, nothing specific about hydration.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are such things as electrolyte kidney stones. You shouldn't over consume electrolyte drinks if you're not burning the energy to absorb them.</p>
<p>In the desert (and in most cases of high calorie burn/dehydration), you'd probably be better off in the short run drinking Gatorade, and in the long run drinking water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
