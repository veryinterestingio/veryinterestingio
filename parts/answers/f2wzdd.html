		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of speculation in the comments, and a lot of the information in the comments is outright wrong/dangerous. Please don't take medical advice from any of these comments...</p>
<p>In short, pathogens cause the release of cytokines, which are inflammatory modulators that in a broad sense do various things to help fight infection. Some of these cytokines are pyrogenic (IL-1, IL-6, TNF, IFN). These act in many ways, but one of them is acting at the level of the hypothalamus to raise the body's 'set point' temperature via PGE2, similar to how a normal thermostat works. This causes a number of physiologic changes eg. you vasoconstrict in the periphery (so your limbs feel cold), and we're behaviourally programmed to decrease exposed surfaces - wearing more clothes, getting inside, reducing activity. You might also shiver.</p>
<p>Fever generally makes us feel terrible because of the above. It also increases baseline O2 consumption, can induce mental changes, and it can also exacerbate cardiac or pulmonary disease. </p>
<p>There is evidence that an elevated (febrile) temperature in animal cells IN TEST TUBES is beneficial, via a heightened immune response and increased bacteriacidal killing (PMID 12015457). HOWEVER there are no studies showing that fever itself facilitates any faster recovery from illness or adjuvants the immune system. There is isolated evidence in the context of influenza vaccination that treatment with antipyretics can actually boost anti-influenza antibody levels (PMID 7746030). We're pretty sure that treating fever symptoms with antipyretics does no harm and also doesn't slow recovery. </p>
<p>Exogenous heat exposure/production in an uncontrolled fashion can override the body's ability to lose heat and cause dangerously high (read: you could die) internal temperatures (ie. heat stroke). The thing we worry most about in the context of the acute illnesses that we're talking about from a temperature perspective is high fever, because we know that this results in bad things happening (some mentioned above) - and potentially seizure, coma, death. </p>
<p>Our bodies are well-oiled machines, and for the most part, your body knows what it's doing. Don't go messing around with trying to increase your body temperature on your own, because that is perhaps the most dangerous thing you can do. </p>
<p>tl;dr - We don't really have evidence that tells us whether temperature alone changes how the body manages infections. We know for a fact that artificially altering your body's temperature, particularly attempts to raise temperature, is dangerous.</p>
<p>This is not medical advice, and if you want medical advice then you should go see a doctor.</p>
<p>Edit: spelling and more pointed summary
Edit 2: Thanks for the gilds!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll piggy back on this question and ask, does fever actually help the body fight off infection?  I know that we take Advil/Tylenol/etc. which brings down the fever, and the body still is fighting off the infection, so I would think that it isn't the fever per se that is fighting off the infection, rather a by product of this fight...  But I really have no idea, so will be curious to hear what others say.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
