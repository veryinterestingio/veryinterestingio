		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The primary reason you experience these slowdowns is resource contention.</p>
<p>Your processor is rarely the bottleneck in your system. If all you want to do is a simple mathematical operation on a small amount of data, your processor can churn away at billions of tasks per second.</p>
<p>But that's rarely what you want to do. Most of what's going on in your computer is moving data from one location to another - one resource to another. When you have a large number of different processes all trying to move resources over the same limited channels, you often run into problems where multiple processes want to use the same limited resource and have to wait their turn.</p>
<p>Think of it like traffic on roads. Normally, it might take you 15 minutes to get to the grocer. But as you increase the total traffic, that time starts to spike upwards because there are other people using the roads you need to use.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A &quot;task,&quot; for the purposes of your sentence above, is simply adding two numbers together.  There is a massive amount of &quot;tasks&quot; involved with even simply drawing a square on your screen.  Opening a program involves loading it into memory, performing trillions of tasks to set it up, performing trillions more to start interpreting a web page, performing trillions more to display that page to your screen, etc etc...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of these answers aren't <em>wrong</em> per se - but when it comes to loading programs (like your browser) the main thing that's really bottlenecking the whole process is the speed of your disk. </p>
<p>Your CPU and other components can't process jack until the program is pulled off your main drive and loaded in to RAM. Main disks (especially traditional spinning hard drives) are some of the slowest components in your computer, so the rest of the machine is stuck waiting for it to finish. </p>
<p>That's why many modern systems ship with an SSD as their main disk instead of a traditional hard drive; since SSDs don't have any mechanical parts they're WAY faster and and significantly cut down on loading times. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now, if your program is still acting slow after it's already been loaded THAT'S when you need to start considering other factors like there being too little RAM, thermal throttling, unoptimized code, etc...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the things others have already explained, there's also the issue that while our computers have gotten really fast the people who tell the computers how to do things for you (programmers) have, on average and with some noteable exceptions, stopped caring about telling the computer how to things <em>efficiently</em>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Usually memory resource issues (is the chunk of RAM you need written out to swap, and needs to be brought from disk back to RAM?) and/or storage speed (spinny disk? well, they're slow as hell. BIG spinny disk? even slower!).</p>
<p>CPU speeds are almost never the issue, though if you don't have a GPU and your CPU is instead doing some co-processing, or a bunch of math needs to be done, or if your computer is working on encryption or something else, the CPU can slow up a bit.</p>
<p>Computer &quot;speed&quot; to a user is really about how the whole computer works together.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
