		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think its your neurons forming new connections and sometimes they bump into other older less traveled neurons which fires them off and takes you down memory lane.</p>
<p>I know that the more you use a neuron connection the stronger they get and they have built in feedback prevention in our brains so its possible that you lost most of the connections to them after not using them but the pathways were still there and your brain brought it to the surface to see how you react and decide if its worth keeping. </p>
<p>Your brain might keep more stuff you feel nostalgia for while discarding things that you were scared of or bad memories. </p>
<p>So eli5:tldr; its probably your brain growing and making connections with or rediscovering older pathways. According to a wild steve anyway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I bought a retro style table fan a few days ago. As soon as I turned it on, I was back at my grandparent’s house, 38 years ago, listening to the oscillating fan in their living room. Memory is a crazy thing. Something as simple as the sound of fan blades triggered a place and time I hadn’t really thought about in years. I didn’t even realize that particular sound had that association till it happened. Now - it brings me unexpected joy every time I use it and the associated memories flood back - canning vegetables, picking up pecans from under the tree, putting pennies on the railroad tracks (it was a simpler time), reading under the shade tree. I love the sound of that stupid fan now, and all I bought it for was some extra air flow in my office.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>(M70) I am a world traveller and a trigger for me is it the sense of smell.  Tabac cologne, I am in Heidelburg. Another smell - Buenos Ares.  I enter a horse barn, I am 15 remembering how much fun it was to live in a menagerie where all of the animals had a name and were friends. Over the course of several years, we had: 5 horses 10 dogs, 1 lamb, 2 racoons, 5 chickens and one very fast cat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
