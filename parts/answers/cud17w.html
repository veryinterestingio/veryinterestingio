		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The primary driver for saving water in the UK is during the summer when reservoirs can run low. The rest of the year, it's more of a general desire to save resources e.g. clean water requires energy to produce. so using less water saves energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You save water for 2 things, to save the water that is already in reserve like dams and underground water, and you save electricity in pumps and waste management. </p>
<p>The costs of transporting vasts amounts of water outweigh the benefits, places like cape verde where there is a constant lack of fresh water has resolved its issues with desalination plants, which costs less in terms of energy than to transport fresh water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of comments here reference saving for the dry season, conserving power, or the lack of global benefit. This is all valid. There is another item that I don't see mentioned yet, and that is the value of innovation combined with economy of scale. By employing conservation methods and technologies even in a place where that conservation is not critical, methods are tested and verified. New ideas and approaches can be tried out, adapted, and shared, and useful products can be produced at a larger scale, making them potentially more accessible (affordable) in areas where the need is greater. So, there can be some global benefit. It's just not as direct as saving water here to make it more available somewhere else.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Saving water in the UK saves resources, it does not directly help other dry countries because you are an island.</p>
<p>In other locations where a river may start in one country (or state in the USA) and travel through another country the damming or use of the water closer to its origin can have a major impact on downstream areas.  </p>
<p>For example the Colorado river flows from Colorado to Nevada and then along the California -Arizona border to Mexico.  Currently so much of that water is used up in the upper stretches (Vegas LA area) that the river is a fraction of its former size by the time it reaches San Diego / Mexico.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
