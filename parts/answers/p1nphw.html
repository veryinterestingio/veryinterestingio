		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just my personal experience. When I was losing weight I found Coke Zero to be a life saver. I was able to satisfy my craving for sweetness and not ingest any sugar. It work very well for me. I drink it any time I want Coke now. There's probably some other awful side effect of aspartame, who knows, but my concern at the moment is weight loss and for that, it is effective (for me).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Welcome to the wonderfulworld of nutrition, where we can't test people in labs, so we don't know very much for sure.</p>
<p>Some people think that drinking a zero-calorie drinks makes you feel like you did something &quot;good&quot;, so you let your guard down and end up eating more food later as a reward. Some people also think that too much artificial sweetener makes the good germs in our tummies sick, which isn't good for us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Zero calarie sodas have zero calories in the., meaning they won't &quot;make you fat&quot; however some people believe that the sweetness of diet sodas causes you to crave other sweet things. But strictly speaking if you were on a deserted island and there was no food and you found a shipping crate of diet 7-up washed up on shore, you would still starve to death no matter how much of it you drank</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming you don't slyly adjust your consumption (&quot;I had a Coke Zero, I deserve a donut!&quot;) they do not contain any calories your body can use. Without that, they do not contribute to weight gain.</p>
<p>They may have some minimal effect on your blood glucose, but I haven't found that to be the case. I've done a 1 week and a 2 week fast, both with zero food. Water + electrolytes only. I measured my weight, blood glucose, and ketone levels 2-3 times per day. I drink Coke Zero during fasts sometimes just cause I like it, and it has no appreciable effect on my blood glucose or weight. When I'm not fasting I never drink soda.</p>
<p>So the simple answer is no, not directly. Indirectly? Time will tell. But they will be minor effects. Things like variations in metabolic rates and making your body &quot;hold on to fat&quot; and the like tend to be VASTLY overblown in the diet/fitness world. A diet coke won't make you put on 2 donuts worth of weight when you only ate one. Your body is already very efficient at getting nutrients out of food. If it wasn't you'd know because you'd either be sick and malnourished, or having diarrhea 24/7.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sugar substitutes work on the premise that they're SO MUCH sweeter than sugar that an incredibly small amount is needed to make the drink as sweet. Because of this the calories of the sweetener are essentially immeasurable for the purpose of our nutrition standards. The artificial sweetners themselves literally do not have the amount calories to make you fat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
