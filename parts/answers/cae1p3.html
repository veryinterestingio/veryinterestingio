		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lobsters and crabs, etc. have a compound called astaxanthin in their shells. This compound is bright red, but it is usually stuck to another compound called crustacyanin that prevents its red color from showing. When the lobster is boiled, the astaxanthin gets separated from the crustacyanin, and it appears bright red since it is no longer stuck to the other chemical.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5 (as I understand it) - They are coloured with &quot;paint&quot; and this &quot;paint&quot; is made out of several colours mixed together that makes them look grey. The colours other than the red/orange get destroyed by the heat, so when they are cooked, only that colour remains.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
