<p>The water in your toilet bowl and in the U pipe under your sink prevent the sewage smell gases from getting into your rooms.  However, these gases must be released or pressure will build up, so there's a pipe vent going to the roof.  So when the wind blows strongly outside, there's a bit of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_effect" target="_blank">chimney effect</a> and some of that atmospheric wind &quot;pressure&quot; pushes on the water in your toilet bowl a little bit, enough to create waves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I've never noticed this! Now I'll be staring at my bowl when there is a wind storm. If I had to hazard a guess it may have to do with the air pressure difference between outside and inside sort of like a barometer. Or it could be your building is slightly shifting in the wind depending on how tall it is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
