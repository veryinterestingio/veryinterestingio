		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The true value of TREE(3) isn't known, although we do have lower bounds, which far exceed grahams number. They are hard to describe in a Reddit post but they are written in terms of the fast growing hierarchy.</p>
<p>The fast growing hierarchy is a set of functions where the first one f_0(n) equals n+1. Ever successive function iterates the lower function n times. So f_1(n) adds 1 n times, which is the equivalent to doubling the number.</p>
<p>This process makes huge numbers really fast, but we can allow it to grow at a rate that exceeds any finite growth rate using infinite ordinals (basically think infinity, but treated as an actual number). Describing how that works in simple terms is hard, but it basically involves repeatedly creating new functions that diagonalize (that is, take on the fastest possible growth rate) over previous functions.</p>
<p>Now, the lower bound for TREE(3) is basically f_gamma-nought(3), so it's at least that number, but likely far bigger. Gamma-nought basically diagonalizes over several sets of ordinals, which in turn diagonalize over the fast growing heirarchy.</p>
<p>So while this can't easily be explained, you might want to read up on the things I have talked about if you want to get a good idea for the sheer magnitude of TREE(3) and how the fgh can generate way bigger numbers that make TREE(3) look meaningless.</p>
<p>edit: i real quick want to mention this since this post is getting a decent amount of attention, but TREE(3) doesnt have a good upper bound, while the bound i gave far exceeds grahams number by a literally incomprehensible amount, it is still likely a very weak bound on the size if TREE(3), it could very well be vastly greater than the known lower bound.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, the way that large numbers are categorized is through something called &quot;<a href="https://googology.wikia.org/wiki/Fast-growing_hierarchy" target="_blank">Fast growing hierarchies</a>&quot;. The short summary of what a fast growing hierarchy is, is that it's a system where very large numbers can be generated by repeated recursion. However, to generate truly gigantic numbers, fast-growing hierarchies are mapped to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfinite_induction" target="_blank">transfinite ordinal numbers</a>, where each new ordinal contains all previous ordinals in its fundamental sequence. </p>
<p>With this system, any function that works on recursion can easily be categorized according to the FGH. It can be shown that the Graham's number function (where Graham's number is G(64)) grows as fast as fω+1(n) in the FGH, where ω is omega, the smallest transfinite ordinal. </p>
<p>The tree function (and it's faster growing cousin, the TREE function) are not so simple. The tree function is defined as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose we have a sequence of k-labeled trees T1, T2 ... with the following properties:</p>
<p>Each tree Ti has at most i vertices.
No tree is homeomorphically embeddable into any tree following it in the sequence.
Kruskal's tree theorem states that such a sequence cannot be infinite. Harvey Friedman expanded on this by asking the question: given k, what is the maximum length of such a sequence?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem here is that the tree function is not defined recursively. It's the solution to a different sort of problem. Therefore, in order to determine the exact number of tree(3), you might have to brute force it by running a program. Of course, that program's runtime would completely dwarf the lifespan of all possible universes, so that's not going to happen.  We know that tree(n) for any finite number n is finite. However, we don't really know how fast the function grows, and we don't really know how large tree(3) is. </p>
<p>From <a href="https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/u.osu.edu/dist/1/1952/files/2014/01/EnormousInt.12pt.6_1_00-23kmig3.pdf" target="_blank">Friedman's paper</a> where he explains his estimate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><del>THEOREM 8.3. n(3) &gt; A(7198, 158386).</del></p>
<p><del>A good upper bound for n(3) is work in progress. Crude result: A(n,n) where n = A(5,5). Note that this crude upper bound is a short composite of the Ackerman function with small constants.</del></p>
</blockquote>
<p>edit: My bad. This theorem was for a different combinatorial problem that is significantly less massive than TREE, he doesn't actually give an upper bound in this paper. </p>
<p>So you can see, his LOWER bound is A(7198, 158386). This is already mind blowingly large, but again it's only a lower bound. His &quot;crude upper bound&quot; is A(A(5,5),(A(5,5))), where A(5,5) is already mind blowingly large. But I was unable to find a proof for these bounds. </p>
<p>Basically, as far as I can tell (and I hope someone can correct me). There are accepted estimates for the growth rate of tree(n), but no formal proofs. All we really know is that its finiteness cannot be proven with ordinary transfinite induction (second order arithmetic), and requires stronger axioms than normal to prove. Therefore it will dominate all functions that can be proven within this system. </p>
<p>Tl;dr- We know that the tree(3) is finite, but don't really know its value. All we know is that the tree function grows much faster than even anything that can be proven in strong versions of second order arithmetic. It requires <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_collapsing_function" target="_blank">ordinal collapsing functions</a> to prove, something I can't quite hope to understand. The Graham's sequence can be proven with only the weakest form of second order arithmetic.</p>
<p>Edit: I was applying this to the weak tree function. The strong TREE function has similar rules but grows much faster. For our purposes, both functions grow roughly equally mind blowingly fast.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
