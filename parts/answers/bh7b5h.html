		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Although the other answers are correct, I don't think they speak to the phenomenon you're asking about exactly.  What you seem to be describing - that sometimes when you leave water sitting in a glass for a long time it forms bubbles on the inside of the glass and sometimes it doesn't - it has to do with the barometric pressure!  Water has gasses like carbon dioxide and oxygen dissolved in it.  When you pour water there's a certain amount in solution.  When the air pressure falls those gasses come out of solution and appear as bubbles on the glass!</p>
<p>As to the change in taste, tap water is usually chlorinated and chlorine evaporates out of water pretty quickly, so that's responsible for some of the change in taste.  Also if you leave it out it tends to absorb CO2 from the air which gives it a bitter-ish taste.  There's probably other chemical changes that I'm not aware of.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So when you open up your tap and water comes pouring out you can see it's a kind of frothy and foamy-looking as it pours down into the glass, there's a little aerator filter head on the top of most spouts And that also introduces more air to the water. So now we have a bunch of tiny air bubbles but you can't see them all swirling around inside the water. Overtime those air bubbles work their way out of solution And either let out of the water back into the air, or they stick to the side of the glass and form visible bubbles. </p>
<p>After time of sitting out, the water tastes &quot;stale&quot; that just means that It tastes different than what we are accustomed to, it is not actually bad water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Power Plant Water Chemist here.  The source of water in the large part determines the final product of the water.  Most municipal water districts are charged with making water safe to drink according to governing body regulations.  Two typical types are surface water and well water.  Surface water is lakes, rivers and streams.  Well water is typically an underground aquifer.  </p>
<p>Surface water: the turbidity, alkalinity and metals naturally found in the source water can have significant impact on the final product.  For example, the end of the Mississippi River is very turbid(dirty) and contains many naturally occurring metals including iron, lead and manganese.  The water must go through a clarification process ( to remove the dirt) typically by way of an up flow clarifier and sanitation by way of chlorine, bromine, ozone or uv treatment.  In some water treatment plant a the water is so contaminated with human and animal waste extra steps are taken by adding ammonia with bleach/chlorine to make chloramine.  It gets the biologicals associated with poo poo out if you will.  Surface water can be a great source however.  Some lakes are so clear and have a high alkalinity that add to the quality and taste.  These sources typically do not need much processing such as clarification and only slight sanitation to stay within governing body standards and to ensure it gets to the tap safe to drink.  </p>
<p>Well water: this is usually the best source to gather water for human consumption.  The water  trickles through layers of sand and rock making its way to aquifers.  Some of these sources are safe to drink with no processing, however large quantities of hardness in the form of calcium carbonate (think limestone, the white stuff that forms on the tap or basin/tub ring) as well as magnesium based species.  Some well water systems have some amount of biological activity even without the presence of oxygen and must be treated accordingly.  Most cases, these anaerobic bacteria are harmless to humans.</p>
<p>All sources of water can have some amount of entrained gasses.  This can be from the source, from processing or from distribution of potable water.  In some areas where building a water tower is out of the question and large high pressure distribution pumps are not economical, tanks with a cover gas may be used.  This ensures the service area will have a steady pressure and will act as a surge volume during times of heavy demand.  These tanks with a cover gas will absorb some amount of air and will off gas when exposed to the atmosphere.  In some cases methane or natural gas can enter the water and off gas at the tap as well.  This is usually caused by man-made activities.  </p>
<p>As others have said, The bubbles you see could just be due to the aerator on the faucet.  The taste of the water directly after filling a glass has all these items to take into account.  In some cases leaving a glass of water out will slowly become more acidic by way of absorbing carbon dioxide gas.  </p>
<p>The source of your water directly impacts the quality of your water regardless of treatment.  Garbage in equals garbage out.  I no longer drink surface water in South East Louisiana even if it's been through an reverse osmosis process.  The Mississippi River is the nation's sewer and the more I learned about water the more I began to fear what I was consuming.  </p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The top post has this explained pretty well, but I also know I learned a very interesting topic in a beer tasting class. If you ever get a drink at a restaurant or at home and the bubbles cling to the side, it means the glass is dirty. It most likely is just quick washed or just rinsed out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
