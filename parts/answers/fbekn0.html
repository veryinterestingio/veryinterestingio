		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Itching is commonly caused by changes blood flow to the skin which causes nerve stimulation. This can be due to an irritant (bug bite or medication reaction), change in blood pressure (exercise in some people or medications or many other causes), or for some people vibrations which can cause direct stimulation of the nerves.</p>
<p>In some cases people who do not regularly exercise will have tiny blood clots in their capillaries. This isn't a problem, but when they're dislodged by vibrations or a change in blood pressure (such as exercise) they can cause itching. These tiny blood clots are largely harmless and will dissolve when they get into larger blood vessels. This will go away with repeated exposure.</p>
<p>Edit: added a bit about the capillary clots.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure this is related but if I don’t see someone coming up behind me and they touch my back I get an itch before they touch me in the exact spot. Now I’m probably not clairvoyant so I’m thinking it may be like deja vu where you remember something before you perceive it and it seems like it’s happened before.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several types of nerves in your skin that detect “touch”. Different types of nerves are specialized for things like sharp objects, texture, motion, vibration, and pain/itch/temperature. </p>
<p>Pacinian corpuscles are the ones that are specialized to sense vibration. Each of these nerve endings have a rather large zone of sensation, so that’s why it’s difficult to localize precisely where on the skin is vibrating. You just generally feel an area of vibration. These pacinian corpuscles are deeper in the skin compared to “free nerve endings”, which detect itch. Thus, activation of the pacinian corpuscles almost always involves activation of free nerve endings as well. </p>
<p>Your brain is able to process the incoming inputs (via the thalamus, cortex, and other midbrain areas) and determine that it is not painful. Therefore, the input from the free nerve endings is interpreted as itch or slight discomfort.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
