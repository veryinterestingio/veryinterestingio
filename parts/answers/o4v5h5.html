		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The part of the brain that analyzes sounds we hear and turns it into useful information is right next to a part that handles emotions. Sometimes activity in the one area can stirs up activity in the other area.</p>
<p>People with a condition called Misophonia actually feel anger, sometimes extreme, when triggered by particular sounds, most often chewing or clattering sounds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It produces dissonant, erratic tones, which we evolved to find unappealing. The reason they are unappealing is because the frequencies are random, jittery, and hard to discern </p>
<p>We have developed very musical brains. If your brain is evolving to find certain frequencies pleasing(what westerners would call notes), then the flip side is that it will find the frequencies that are in the middle of the notes(dissonance) to be “wrong”. Your reaction is how your brain tells you.</p>
<p>But keep in mind that many things play a role in this. It could be that irregular, loud sounds are more likely to be made by something sudden, uncontrollable, and potentially dangerous: thunder, a rockslide, a tree snapping and falling, a baby or a friend screeching in pain. </p>
<p>A brain that can hear the notes, will want to prove it with the way it talks, the music it makes, and how it sings. Continue this for millions of years and our species has incorporated this skill into our cultures - thus making even greater selective pressure to be able to hear when frequencies make “notes” and also when they’re “off”</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
