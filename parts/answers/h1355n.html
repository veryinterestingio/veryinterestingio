		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Veins are directly under the skin, arteries are not. Also it would be harder to deal with the bleeding. On ICU’s there are arterial catheters which measure the blood pressure and allow you to take blood from patients. The blood from an artery enables you to monitor the blood gases. Arms are easy to reach and it’s not as painful. I also have taken blood from someone’s feet for example. With baby’s you take it from the head.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The arteries have higher blood pressure so there would be a lot more bleeding.<br />
They are alose deeper down in the tissue. So just for this reason, you use veins.</p>
<p>The arms are primarily used because people care less if you touch them, easy to get access, and move and there are shallow and large veins in the elbow area.  You can in a simple way put a tourniquet around the arm so the veins increase in size.</p>
<p>The tourniquet usage make the arms and legs the best spot to find veins. </p>
<p>If there is one location with easy access, you can just sit down and stretch out your you arm, none or very little clothing need to be moved a people do not care if you touch that part, Why would you not primary use it?</p>
<p>If that fails for some reason like lots of scar tissue on the veins you usually do it on the feet with shallow veins and part of the body to access and another location people do not care if you touch.<br />
Thre is likely shallow veins in the knees but to get there the patient would need to lay down on this stomach so it is a very unpractical location.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You do not use the hand to take blood in large part because it is a more sensitive area and if there is some bleeding below the skint it is a lot more visible.<br />
But you use it for intravenous therapy because you can use tape to attach the catheter and the lines to the skin a simple way. the backside of the hand is a stable area that in most situations is not in contact with other parts of the body, a chair, bed etc so it is a location where is the leas in the way for the patient.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question:</p>
<p>Does anyone know why there's sometimes a lot of pain after having an IV in for a while? And what it means for a vein to get &quot;tired&quot;? </p>
<p>I had an IV that was fine, then all of a sudden, it felt like they were pumping viscous mercury into my veins. </p>
<p>The nurse quickly realized what it was, and said something like veins get &quot;tired&quot; and switched it to my other arm. </p>
<p>What does that mean?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to add a bit, peripheral IVs are mainly done on the arm for convenience. It's easier for patients to manage and convenient for people to start them there. You can do them on the hand, as well, but the veins are smaller and it's not an appropriate site for when you want higher flow IV fluids or etc. (CT contrast, for example, won't be administered through an IV in your hand but can go through one in your arm). </p>
<p>But we can and do start them pretty much anywhere that has a large enough vein/can be accessed/is appropriate for the situation. In an emergency we can even drill a hole into one of your bones to put the IV in there instead of in a vein.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
