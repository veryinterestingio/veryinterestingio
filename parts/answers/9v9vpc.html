		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As an adoptee, Ive been told told to do genetic testing (23andMe or AncestryDNA) to learn about my roots. But how much information can I actually get from taking a genetic test? Is there any important health related information I could learn, such as if there is a history of disease (depression/ high bp/ cancerous tendencies) or do I need health records from family to know that? Also, can people find relatives they didnâ€™t know about through this kind of testing? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A local murderer was recently found because a close family member did one of those genetic screenings (like 23 and me) and somehow law enforcement was able to access those results to narrow the search to just a handful of people.  While I am thrilled they caught the guy, this seems like an insane overreach of law enforcement into private medical information to me.  The guy himself didn't even do the test.</p>
<p>Are there any measures in place or being debated that would protect our privacy?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi there!  I'm a psychiatrist for children in a  major hospital.  We have a robust medical genetics program.  I've always wondered though: given the strong genetic transmission of mental health diseases, why aren't there more psychiatric genetic syndromes?  Physical features and defects are often grouped together in syndromes (and often &quot;psychiatric difficulties&quot; is on the long list of other symptoms), but rarely do you see a primarily psychiatric or majority psychiatric syndrome, and yet surely it must be a thing!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello and thank you so much for being here to speak with us today. Genetic counseling is a fascinating field.</p>
<p>Many general practitioners may not be up to speed on genetic counseling as an option and even sometimes asking about family history. How do you pull in doctors to make sure everyone can properly utilize the services you're here to discuss? Without hearing about these options from GPs many people will not know they are available at all.</p>
<p>Thank you again for your time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So eugenics rightly has a bad name given its association with some very inexcusable and unethical policies.</p>
<p>What do we do with the desire to engage with knowledge of genomics, and what bearing they may have on our future society?</p>
<p>One situation I've heard people express concern about is services like 23 and me potentially being used in insurance coverage.  Is this a real concern in your mind?  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
