		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oof that's a hard one without getting to much into detail.</p>
<p>Basically there are certain genes inside your body that regulate proteins during the development of the embryo. Those proteins are signal proteins and they can make cells transform or migrate. They are called <em>Hox Genes</em> Also those proteins influence their own genes to generate a whole lot of them. This way the body knows where exactly to make a leg or an arm.</p>
<p>In areas where you shouldn't grow an arm these proteins are not as much expressed or are heavily regulated by other proteins to not express them at all.</p>
<p>In terms of 'How do those genes know where to express': We don't fully understand that yet. Most likely organogenesis is regulated by proteins of our early brain or our early nervous system.</p>
<p>Yes genes for those proteins are basically the same if they serve a similar function like expressing arms and legs. But to understand that you first have to understand how many basepairs a protein actually is. Sometimes there are over a 10,000 basepairs coding for a single proteine that can be altered again after the transscription. Only a few base pairs that change can alter the entire protein and the outcome.</p>
<p>I hope you can understand this explanation. Like I said, it's a very complex subject that we don't fully understand yet.</p>
<p>Edit: For anyone interested: The subjects that are studying this part of biology are Developmental biology, Molecular Genetics, Evolutionary biology and EvoDevo. There is a nice song about EvoDevo on YouTube and I highly recommend watching it a few times. It explains basic stuff and teaches a few things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ydqReeTV_vk" target="_blank">This</a> is the song.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It starts with basic differentiation, front vs back, top vs bottom, inside vs outside. </p>
<p>Individual cells &quot;know&quot; where they are based on substances in that region of the body. But they also produce substances that increase the detail level of differentiation between different regions.</p>
<p>For example, there is a protein that signals that an eye should be formed where it is expressed. It is expressed in the head of the animal, near the front and top. The protein doesn't know what an eye looks like -- it  is nearly the same in a human and a fly. But the other eye related protein know more about what an eye looks like in the organism.</p>
<p>So the whole process it &quot;top down&quot; -- first simple geometry like top vs bottom get expressed, then segments along the body like backbone/rib segments in humans, or millipede segments, then features of segments like eyes on the head. Regions get identified, the subregions of those regions and so on. </p>
<p>For example, insect legs start off as concentric circles of cells on the skin of larvae. These concentric circles form by an algorithm of the cells sending chemical signals to each other to figure out where they are. After the circles form, the center protrudes in a separate process, and develops into the toe, then the second circle protrudes to become the ankle, etc, and the outside circle is the hip. </p>
<p>Butterfly wings often have concentric circle patterns as well. These are borrowed from insect limb formation to make colored patterns. So the same pattern forming mechanism can have different uses.</p>
<p>The same system is used in all animals, with slight variations. A gene to express mouse eyes works when inserted into the fly genome to produce fly eyes.</p>
<p>Interesting fact: If you cut a frog's arm off at the elbow, it will grow back. But if you rub vitamin A on the wound (of at least one frog species) it will grow a whole arm including the shoulder in the place instead of just the arm from the elbow down. The gradient of the concentration of vitamin A seems to indication position in the body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our body has a system like GPS, but it's chemicals instead of satellites. Just like GPS systems figure out where you are based on how close you are to certain satellites, cells can tell roughly where they are depending on the strength of certain chemicals. Then the cells eventually start growing towards / turning into whatever they should be, like pinky fingers or noses.</p>
<p>This system is called or consists of the hox genes, and we don't totally know how it works.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For OP since I don't know if you read the Edit to my comment and anyone else interested in the subject.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/ydqReeTV_vk" target="_blank">There is this Dude on YouTube</a> who made a whole song about the basic stuff from the subject OPs question is centered about. Watching it a few times will help you understand at least some of it. </p>
<p>Yet there are still big parts missing in this puzzle and even scientists can't explain everything about it. I'd day we're about 5% there on our way of understanding it fully.</p>
<p>This is because the EvoDevo theory is still very young and methods to verify this theory that are actually affordable only came around in the last 10-15 years. If anyone is interested in a career in this subject, go on and study biology. It's very complex and you'll have a hard time learning but this subject is probably your big chance if getting your name in a history or biology book. There is so much to learn about this fascinating subject and I really hope some of you will consider this as a possible career choice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
