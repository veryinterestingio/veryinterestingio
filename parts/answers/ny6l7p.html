<blockquote>
<p>How far does the Sun's gravity reach? And how it affects the objects past Neptune? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gravity has an infinite range. If you exist in the observable universe, the matter that makes up the sun will exert a gravitational force on you. Just so we have it written out, the force of gravity between two objects with masses <em>M</em> and <em>m</em>, separated by a distance <em>r</em> is equal to </p>
<pre><code>F = G M m / r^2</code></pre>
<p>where <em>G</em> is the gravitational constant. So obviously, more massive objects exert greater forces, but that force does get weaker as our planet <em>m</em> gets farther away. Your question is about how these two terms 'compete' in a sense. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>for instance: how is Pluto kept in the system, by Sun's gravity or by the sum of gravity of all the objects of the system? </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/justintaylor/files/2011/08/Sun.jpg" target="_blank">The mass of the sun is humongous, it's 99.8% of all the mass in the solar system</a>, so the force of gravity of the sun on Pluto is far greater than the force of gravity of any of the planets. Of course, the equation above isn't unique to the sun- it tells us something far more important which is that <em>every piece of matter in the universe is attracted to every other piece of matter in the universe.</em> This means that the planets exert a gravitational force on each other, but that's not a huge factor since they are so much less massive than the sun. </p>
<p>Amusingly, since <a href="https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/review/years-on-other-planets/orbits_speed.en.gif" target="_blank">the distance between planets vary immensely over their orbit from being 'much closer than the sun' when orbits are passing to 'much farther than the sun' when on opposite sides of the solar system</a>, the forces between planets oscillate a lot, and so the subtle gravitational tugs tweak the shapes of the planet's orbits over millions of years. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>What affects the size of the radius of the solar system?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The thing we usually call the 'radius of the solar system' has more to do with magnetism than gravity, as the solar wind carries the solar magnetic field to about 3x the radius of Pluto's orbit, <a href="https://cdn.sci.esa.int/sci-images/c5/heliosphere%20screen.jpg" target="_blank">after which the 'bubble' of solar wind crashes into the interstellar medium and the galaxy's magnetic field</a> (similar to <a href="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e2a24898550ed02a07bd994e974108a6.webp" target="_blank">the earth's magnetic field smashing into the solar wind and the sun's magnetic field</a>, but bigger). That's not really your question, but it's just a neat piece of info I thought I'd share. </p>
<p>There are almost certainly large numbers of objects that orbit beyond this point, <a href="https://space-facts.com/wp-content/uploads/oort-cloud.png" target="_blank">mostly icy comets which fall into the inner solar system from time to time</a>, and in an ideal sense if there weren't other stars in the galaxy an object could be arbitrarily far from the sun and orbiting it. But in practice, farther than a lightyear or so, the chances of finding anything gravitationally bound to the sun (another way to say 'orbiting') become pretty slim because the gravity of other stars would tend to disrupt that orbit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Once you get about 4 parsecs (about 13 light-years) away, the pull from the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy is going to be stronger than the pull from the sun. This doesn't mean that the sun's gravity is gone, but it's no longer dominant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>VeryLittle's answer is fairly complete, but I'll add a little bit. (tl;dr at bottom)</p>
<p>They are correct to say that, in principle, gravity stretches infinitely (limited by the speed of light). The Sun's gravity affects everywhere its light can reach, which is most of the observable universe.</p>
<p>Now, of course, in practice I don't think that's <em>quite</em> what you meant. What you probably meant, and what most people mean asking something like this, is &quot;how far away do we have to get before the Sun's gravity becomes negligible compared to other sources?&quot;, or perhaps &quot;how far away until something else overwhelms the Sun?&quot;</p>
<p>We can roughly say the answer is &quot;well the Sun's Hill sphere is where its gravity dominates all else&quot;, and I definitely recommend the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_sphere" target="_blank">Wikipedia article by that name</a>. Loosely, the Hill sphere is where it's possible to orbit a smaller body as opposed to a larger body.</p>
<p>For example, the Earth's Hill sphere within the Sun is about 5 lightseconds (0.01 AU) in radius; compare that to the Moon being around 1.2 lightseconds from Earth (i.e. the Moon is inside the Earth's Hill sphere, <del>so it orbits the Earth primarily and the Sun only secondarily</del>).</p>
<p>(On every day scales, a meter is about 3 lightnanoseconds; New York to LA is about 4,000km which is around 12 lightmilliseconds, as any gamer knows [tho in practice ping is usually around 2-5x worse than lightspeed for various reasons], and a full lap around the Earth is 40,000km or 120 lightmilliseconds.)</p>
<p>So the Earth's Hill sphere being about 5 lightseconds (0.01 AU) compares to the Sun being about 8.5 lightminutes (1 AU) away (a bit over 500 lightseconds); Jupiter is about 40-45 lightminutes (5 AU) from the Sun, and Neptune is around 250-270 lightminutes (30-31 AU) from the Sun, or around 4.5 lighthours.</p>
<p>Finally, comparing the Sun to the rest of the galaxy, <a href="http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/pdf/1965SvA.....8..787C" target="_blank">this paper</a> linked from the Hill sphere article gives the following (tho it is admittedly rather old and possibly out of date): </p>
<blockquote>
<p>....the region of space in which the attraction of the sun is greater than the attraction of the galactic center [... has a radius about] 4500 AU [26.5 lightdays]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It says that the region where it's convenient to consider the Sun the center, and the galaxy as a perturber, is around 60000 AU [354 lightdays] in radius, whereas outside that space it's more convenient to consider the galaxy the center and the Sun the perturber; and finally it says that, relative to the galaxy, the Sun's Hill sphere extends about 230000 AU [3.7 lightyears]. It's worth noting that the next nearest start is only around 4.2-4.5 lightyears away, so at that distance the Sun's gravity only just barely is most important. Getting further than that quickly decreases the Sun from the top of the list of which bodies you care about.</p>
<p>So altho in principle gravity is infinite, you only need to go about 100x as far as Neptune for galactic gravity to start to matter, and you only need to go as far as the next star over to be able to almost-entirely ignore the Sun's contribution.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the universe is expanding, there's a distance where light and gravity emitted now can never influence an object in the future. This is the cosmological event hlrizon. It extends about 16 billion light-years. Anything further than that won't be able to measure out gravity anymore.</p>
<p>Because the sun is 4.6 billion years old, anything further than about 20.6 billion light-years (it's not exact due to continuously <em>accelerating</em> expansion) has never experienced the gravitational force of the sun and never will.</p>
<p>Edit: If anyone who's better with math wants to compute the scale factor since the sun was formed, you'd get a lot more accurate answer. </p>
<p>You would use that to calculate the cosmological event horizon 4.6 billion years ago.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Technically, infinity. Force due to gravity between two objects decreases by the square of the distance from the two centers of mass - in this case, the sun’s center of mass and the other object’s center of mass - meaning that force due to gravity can be very, very small, even negligible, but technically never zero. </p>
<p>The solar system can be considered to be much, much larger than how we normally think of it; the Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud extend far past the orbit of Pluto, but contain much less massive objects. The Oort Cloud, for example, is probably mostly dust. At some point past the Oort Cloud, billions and billions of miles out from the sun, even those tiny dust particles lose their tenuous hold on the sun’s gravity. That vague distance is the effective limit of our solar system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
