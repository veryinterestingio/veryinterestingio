<p>ELI5 If the chord progression number system is i - II - iii - iv - V - VI - VII and your first chord is C minor, how do you determine what chord II and so forth will be? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The numbers indicate the scale degree. i is the first note of the scale, ii is the second, etc. Which means you have to know the notes of the scale. Maybe you understand that now from other responses. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also, how do you determine which order to play them?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You play them in the order the song requires. Or if you're writing a song yourself, you order them how you want to get a particular sound. There are many possible chord progressions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The tough thing about this is a 5 year old would have a hard time understanding this.</p>
<p>I have taught college music theory for 5 years now and when students come in that are there to satisfy a fine arts requirement as a core class, they struggle with this as well.</p>
<p>My best recommendation is to think of a scale as what notes are “allowed.”</p>
<p>What notes are involved in a C Minor scale?</p>
<p>What notes are involved in a C Major scale?</p>
<p>Once you have those notes, you can build chords using the 1,3, &amp; 5 starting from each scale degree.</p>
<p>Don’t forget the Roman Numerals may or may not be capitalized depending on their chord quality. </p>
<p>In C Minor the 1 = i
In C Major the 1 - I</p>
<p>So each of the corresponding chords up the scale will reflect a capital or lower case depending on whether or not it’s major or minor.  And in the case of a diminished chord, there will be a degree symbol.  Like it’s 70° &lt;</p>
<p>Best of luck, first step is to be able to spell out your scales whether major or minor.  Start there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Roman numeral notation is fairly straight-forward. The numbers determine the scale degree the chord is built on, and capital/lowercase letters determine the quality of the chord. So for an example, a V chord is a <em>major</em> chord build on the fifth degree of the scale, while a v chord is a <em>minor</em> chord based on the fifth degree of the scale.</p>
<p>For your example you state the i chord is C minor. So we'll take the notes of the C minor scale (C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C) and use those notes as the root of every chord. Which gives us:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Roman numeral</th>
<th>Chord</th>
<th>Notes</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>i</td>
<td>C minor</td>
<td>C Eb G</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>II</td>
<td>D major</td>
<td>D F# A</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>iii</td>
<td>Eb minor</td>
<td>Eb Gb Bb</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>iv</td>
<td>F minor</td>
<td>F Ab C</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>V</td>
<td>G major</td>
<td>G B D</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>VI</td>
<td>Ab major</td>
<td>Ab C Eb</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>VII</td>
<td>Bb major</td>
<td>Bb D F</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This example ends up being a little wonky with the mix of sharps and flats, but that's what each roman numeral in your title would mean. If it helps, the proper chords for the key of C minor would look like this:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Roman numeral</th>
<th>Chord</th>
<th>Notes</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>i</td>
<td>C minor</td>
<td>C Eb G</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>iidim</td>
<td>D diminished</td>
<td>D F Ab</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>III</td>
<td>Eb major</td>
<td>Eb G Bb</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>iv</td>
<td>F minor</td>
<td>F Ab C</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>v</td>
<td>G minor</td>
<td>G Bb D</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>VI</td>
<td>Ab major</td>
<td>Ab C Eb</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>VII</td>
<td>Bb major</td>
<td>Bb D F</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As for the order you play them in, you would simply play them however it's written. If a song you're trying to play says to play the chords iidim - V - i, then you would play (assuming we're still in C minor) Ddim, G major, and C minor in that order. If you're writing a song on your own, then you can put them in whatever order you'd like based on what sounds good to you or what sound you're trying to go for.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chord progression systems are based on standard scales. A Major scale is I, ii, iii, IV, V, vi, viidim. A minor scale is vi, iidim, III, iv, v, VI, VII. </p>
<p>So going up the Scale C Major. I Chord: C E G, ii Chord: D F A, iii Chord: E G B, IV Chord: F A C, V Chord: G B D, vii Chord: A C E, viidim B D F. </p>
<p>C Minor Scale. I Chord: C Eb G, iidim Chord: D F Ab, III Chord: Eb G Bb, iv Chord: F Ab C, v Chord: G Bb D, VI Chord: Ab C Eb, VII Chord: Bb D F. </p>
<p>Your suggested scale is abnormal but this is what it would be: i Chord: C Eb G, II Chord: D F# A, iii Chord: E G B, iv Chord: F Ab C, V Chord: G B D, Vi Chord: Ab C Eb, VII Chord: Bb D F. It is constantly flipping between sharps, flats and naturals and would not be coherent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First we have to know what scale we're playing. Since we're starting on a C minor we will assume that we're playing in C natural minor (also known as C aeolian, C minor or Cm scale). The C natural minor scale consists of the notes</p>
<p>C - D - Eb - F - G - Ab - Bb - C - D - Eb - F - G - Ab - Bb - C (etc.)</p>
<p>There are reasons for this but to keep this post from getting thrice as long let's settle for &quot;because that's just what a C natural minor scale is by definition&quot;.</p>
<p>The roman numerals represent the chords that belong to these notes.</p>
<p>So I is the chord beloning to C, II is the chord beloning to D, III is the chord belonging to Eb.</p>
<p>If we want to build this particular chord then what we do is we take the root note, the note that is two positions to its right (The &quot;mediant&quot;), and the note that is four positions to its right (The &quot;dominant&quot;. so two more positions from the last one). Example: Our III chord in C minor consists of the notes Eb, G and Bb. This chord is known as &quot;E flat major&quot; also known as &quot;Eb chord&quot;, &quot;Eb triad&quot; or just &quot;Ebmaj&quot;.</p>
<p>Why is this chord &quot;major&quot;? In an eli5 sense the best thing I can tell you is &quot;A major chord has 4 semitones between the root (in this case Eb) and mediant (in this case G) and 7 semitones between the root (in this case Eb) and the dominant (in this case Bb)&quot;. If it were a minor chord then these distances would by 3 and 7 instead of 4 and 7.</p>
<p>For clarity: A semitone is the distance between two tones on the twelve tone &quot;chromatic&quot; scale. So it's the distance between two adjacent keys on the piano or between two adjacent frets on the guitar.</p>
<p>A little trick that might help you cheat this logic: If the roman numerals are in upper case (III) then the chord is Major. If they are in lower case (iii) then the chord is minor.</p>
<p>As for your last question of how do you determine which order to play them... That is a point of study that'll require a good 1000 pages of reading. If you want the quickest and easiest rule of thumb: Chords like to either move up or down by a fifth (That is four chords to the right or four chords to the left. So from C to G or from C to F) and they like to move up or down by a third (That is two chords to the right or two chords to the left. So from C to Eb or from C to Ab). They like moving down more than moving up.</p>
<p>But that isn't to say that these are the only &quot;legal&quot; moves&quot;. Any note may follow any note and any chord may follow any chord, it's just that moving by thirds or by fifths (and especially downward) is something that chords just enjoy doing. The reason that they like doing this is if they move by third or fifth then the new chord will contain notes from the old chord. Eg. If you move from your i chord (C, Eb, G) to your VI chord (Ab, C, Eb) then both of these chords will contain the notes C and Eb. This gives a nice familiar feeling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
