		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A contributing factor is that we probably haven't synthesised the most stable isotopes of many superheavy elements. The higher the atomic number, the greater the neutron/proton ratio required for stability, and since superheavy elements are synthesised by fusing two lighter ones together it's hard to get enough neutrons.</p>
<p>For example the first isotope of Copernicium (element 112) synthesised, in 1996, was Cn-277 with a half-life of under a millisecond. A few years later Cn-285 was synthesised and that has a half-life of about 30 seconds. Still very short in human terms, but many thousands of times more stable than the first isotope discovered.</p>
<p>It's likely the same will apply for the newest elements discovered, and indeed unconfirmed results indicate this. Even in the predicted &quot;island of stability&quot; half-lifes are still likely to be minutes at best though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The superheavy nuclides that have been discovered so far all have very short lifetimes to alpha decay and/or spontaneous fission.</p>
<p>At very high atomic numbers, the repulsive Coulomb interaction starts to become large.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
