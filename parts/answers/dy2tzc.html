		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The posts talking about the mass of Br are wrong. At the atomic scale, the gravitational forces due to mass are vastly outweighed by the electrical forces.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the trend in boiling point:</p>
<p>Cl2, -100C</p>
<p>Br2, 59C</p>
<p>I2, 184C</p>
<p>HCl, -85C</p>
<p>HBr, -66C</p>
<p>HI, -35C</p>
<p>HCl, HBr, and HI all follow a pretty clear trend. Cl2, Br2, and I2 also follow a pretty clear trend. Both trends are driven by dispersion forces, where the higher amount of dispersion forces (due to more electrons) results in a higher boiling point.</p>
<p>In this trend HCl/Cl2 is actually the odd one out, as it’s the only pair where the acid has a higher boiling point than the diatomic molecule. If we look at the position of Cl, Br, and I on the periodic table, the reason becomes clear: Br and I have electrons in their d-orbitals, which vastly increases the number of electrons around atom, which increases the strength of the dispersion forces due to an increased chance at a spontaneous dipole. It is at Br where the dispersion forces of the diatomic molecule are stronger than the dipole forces of the acid.</p>
<p>If you consider the size difference between Br and H, the question is kind of like asking why Br2 has a higher boiling point than Br. Br2 has twice the chance of a spontaneous dipole than Br does.</p>
<p>So the idea that dispersion forces are generally weaker than a dipole-dipole interaction is true, the case of Br2 and HBr actually breaks away from this trend.</p>
<p>Note: I’ve intentionally left out F2, HF as HF can hydrogen bond.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>because your teachers are lying when they say dipole-dipole forces are always stronger than london dispersion forces.</p>
<p>Think about it. I2 is solid at room temperature yet is non-polar, whilst water is liquid. London dispersion forces get stronger when the molecule is (a) larger or (b) more polarisable. Both size and polarisability increase down the periodic table - basically what happens is the electron cloud is bigger, looser and floppier and is more susceptible to forming the temporary or induced dipoles that explain dispersion forces and their strength.</p>
<p>the hydrogen atom is absolutely tiny. What's more, if you're bonding it to a bromine, the hydrogen has less electron density anyway due to the electronegativity difference and the more ionic character of the bond due to poor orbital overlap.</p>
<p>The overall effect of this is that Br2's dispersion forces are stronger than the forces going on between HBr molecules.</p>
<p>EDIT: commented this below, but will copy it here.</p>
<p>The idea that dipole-dipole interactions are generally stronger than dispersion forces is actually false.</p>
<p>What people forget is that *every* molecule can do dispersion forces. The polar ones can just do dipole-dipole PLUS dispersion forces, where a non-polar one only has dispersion. It isn't that dipole-dipole is stronger, it's that it's an *extra* force of attraction on top of what's already there.  </p>
