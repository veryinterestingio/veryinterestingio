		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think you're really underestimating how big Earth and the space around it are, and how small those things are in comparison. Also for image satellites it might be more desirable to pick a lower orbit, where there's less of this stuff in the way. On the off chance that something <em>is</em> in the way, they might discard the photo and get another one on the next pass.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why do photos taken from your phone don’t contain every spec of dust in between the camera and the subject?</p>
<p>As explained by others, they’re either too small to even be caught by the camera, or when they do photobomb a picture they’re just discarded</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Space is big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist's, but that's just peanuts to space.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Answer this: &quot;Why do images of Earth from space not contain trucks?&quot;</p>
<p>Because they're too small and spread out, right? </p>
<p>Except there are way more trucks than satellites, AND each truck is bigger too!  So you've answered your own question. They're smaller than a pixel in a pic that fits the whole earth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
