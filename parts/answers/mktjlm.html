		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As some others have already stated, to really understand what goes on inside an atom, you need to turn to quantum mechanics, and even then, describing a H- ion isn't easy.</p>
<p>Fortunately, some smart people have already done this, and the answer can be described with a fairly simple analogy: the electrons are roughly on opposite sides of the nucleus. This means each electron is further from each other than they are from the nucleus. As the electrostatic force depends inversely on the (square of the) distance between the charges, each electron &quot;sees&quot; more positive charge from the nucleus than negative charge from the other electron.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, this situation is pretty delicate. This means that H- ions are tricky to make, and easy to destroy, but it is possible to make them in a controlled way. [Source: am plasma physicist working with negative ion beams]</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Classical analogue: magnets attract each other. How come a magnet is attracted to a piece of iron, that in rest doesn't have a net magnetisation? The magnetic field induces a magnetic polarisation in the iron, whereafter it can be attracted.</p>
<p>For an H atom, the charge distribution of the electron cloud is symmetric, but not in an external electric field. The free electron repels the bound electron, while it attracts the proton, creating an induced dipole moment. Then, the attraction to the proton is larger than the repulsion from the bound eletron.</p>
<p>In general in multi-electronic atoms, the electrons are further apart than one would naively expect, this is both the result of Fermi-Dirac statistics and interelectronic repulsion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My job is to run an H- ion source for a particle accelerator. In fact I have four separate experimental areas, plus another one well on the way.</p>
<p>There are two main ways to make H- ions. One is to impact neutral hydrogen onto a low work function material (i.e. something willing to give up an electron) and after bouncing around inside a few times, it can emerge having collected a second electron. This is called &quot;surface production&quot; and usually involves depositing caesium onto a molybdenum surface. If you can arrange for 0.6 monolayers of caesium, then the overall work function is actually lower than either molybdenum or caesium by itself. </p>
<p>The other way is a bit more subtle and neat, which we call &quot;volume production&quot;. In the plasma volume itself, far from surfaces, we divide it into two regions by a magnetic 'filter' field. Upstream of the filter, relatively fast (around 15eV) electrons impact neutral molecular hydrogen. They have enough energy to excite the molecules, but no enough to dissociate them. The fast electrons are turned back by the filter field, but the excited H2 and slow electron population can diffuse across the filter. There, the slow (few eV) electrons may impact the excited molecules, dissociating them and becoming bound to one of the now free atoms to form a negative ion. You don't want any fast electrons downstream of the filter because they will destroy both the excited molecules and the newly formed H- ions. This process is obviously quite delicate and requires some finesse, but we've gotten quite good at it over the years. </p>
<p>You then want to extract the H- quickly before they are destroyed or lost to the walls. You want as good a vacuum as possible soon after the plasma so the accelerated ions are less likely to be 'stripped' by residual gas molecules, so we have a huge pumping speed right after the source.</p>
<p>Any questions do ask. This is literally my job and this question is my Reddit dream come true!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even neutral hydrogen can't be explained classically, so the existence of H- is a quantum mechanical phenomenon. Nothing a priori prevents two electrons binding to the same proton to form H-, so the question is whether there is a stable bound state with such a configuration. That there is was <a href="https://sci-hub.se/10.1007%2FBF01340659" target="_blank">proven by Bethe in 1929.</a></p>
<p>More interestingly, unlike neutral H, there is only one bound state for H-, which <a href="https://sci-hub.se/10.1103%2FPhysRevLett.38.643" target="_blank">was not proven until 1977.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
