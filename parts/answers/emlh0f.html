		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water sticks to surface.</p>
<p>Water glides over water.</p>
<p>When there is a lot of water, water acts as a gliding film between two surfaces.</p>
<p>When there is little water, water sticks to a surface on one side, sticks to another on the other side, but there's not enough water to form the gliding film, thus 'increasing friction' not unlike a double sided tape.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Though I am also looking for an explanation, I think people explaining here are misunderstanding the question. Imagine 3 states:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Completely dry hand and dry surface: pretty low friction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Completely wet: slippery</p>
</li>
<li>On a dry surface you add a tiny drop of water and keep rubbing it until it almost dries: as it is drying, the friction increases until it dries, where it becomes case 1 again.</li>
</ol>
<p>So what is the explanation for this</p>
<p>I would also like to add that the wrinkling of fingers does not improve grip, it probably used to but it is just an evolutionary artifact by now. Or so I have read.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What they think is happening is your skin on your fingers reacts to water by making your the skin wrinkly so you can grasp stuff easier. Same with the bottom of your feet. It's so if you happen to get wet you won't be slipping everywhere and dropping everything. The longer you spend in the water the easier it is to grab stuff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
