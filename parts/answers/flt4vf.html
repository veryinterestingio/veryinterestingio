If a domesticated pig turns feral, does it develop tusks or not? If so, does it do so immediately or does it take a few generations before it comes back?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Have you uncovered any universal/general/convergent rules about animal weaponry or fighting behavior? They are so diverse it seems unlikely there are any fundamental concepts to be revealed, but it would be neat if there was!</p>
<p>For instance, what can a thagomizer tell you about nematocysts and vice versa? I'm guessing not much.</p>
<p>Mate selection seems like a complicated confounder for combat evolution, although I suppose intra-species conflict is driven almost entirely by sex, so perhaps they are one-in-the-same.</p>
<p>In the absence of predator/prey interactions, do weapons still evolve, solely for mate selection?</p>
<p>What do you think is the evolutionary pressure that drives some species towards violence in mate selection, and thus requiring specialized weapons, while others seem to do so peacefully?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
