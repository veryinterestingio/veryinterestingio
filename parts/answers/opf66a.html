		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know how radio waves induce an electric current in wires which then makes the speaker emit sound? If you emit really powerful radio waves then the induced current becomes so high that the radio receiver gets fried. It works the same for all electronic devices because they have a lot of small wires and other conductors inside them. Humans and animals donâ€™t, so strong radio waves and EM pulses do not affect us the same way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electromagnetic radiation (radio waves, xrays, etc) pass (mostly) harmlessly through flesh. We don't have highly conductive parts inside us. Electronics on the other hand are made up of massive very small electrical connections made of different types of metal and semiconductors which radio waves do not pass through. Instead they are absorbed as electrical energy. That is why an antenna can &quot;pick up' radio signals. </p>
<p>Solar flares emit electromagnetic energy as a byproduct in the form of radio frequency (RF) waves which travel at the speed of light until they encounter something that absorbs them. </p>
<p>When they enter flesh, they just pass right through, but when they enter electronics, the circuits absorb the energy. Since microchips circuits are not designed to handle sudden surges of power, this can cause them to overheat which in turn causes microscopic circuits to melt and short out.</p>
<p>EDIT: Actually, I don't think solar flares have enough electromagnetic energy to destroy electronics, just possibly disrupt their circuits by introducing noise. It takes a large electromagnetic pulse (EMP) such as the detonation of an atomic bomb or being hit by a purpose-built EMP weapon to do real damage. Critical systems (airplanes, military equipment, etc.) take this danger into account and shield sensitive electronics from EMP by enclosing them in a metal case which will absorb the energy before it can get to the electronics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it can't &quot;destroy all electronics.&quot;</p>
<p>People on Reddit (and elsewhere) often confuse solar flares (coronal mass ejections, CMEs) with electromagnetic pulse (EMP) which are associated with the discharge of a nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>EMP will indeed destroy all electronics within a certain radius and just generally ruin your day.</p>
<p>CMEs, on the other hand, can only induce a current in VERY long, continuous wires, like power lines and telephone lines. There have been power outages attributed to solar flares, and the Carrington Event disrupted telegraph operations, but they don't damage electronics per se.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Almost all of these answers here are fundamentally incorrect.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, solar flares cannot actually destroy all electronics, at least not directly.  <a href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/solar-flare-electronics.htm" target="_blank">They disrupt large power grids, instead.</a> </p>
<p>Induced current is the effect that is caused by magnets moving near wires, or v.v.  When a magnetic field moves near a wire, it causes electricity to flow within that wire by moving the negatively charged electrons through the metal within it.  The strength of that current is determined by the length and thickness of the wire, and the strength of the magnetic field inducing the current.  This makes sense, because long, thick wires have more electrons in them, and stronger magnetic fields pull them harder and faster.  Short, thin wires as found in small electronics are not capable of being affected by even the strongest magnetic disturbances in the atmosphere.  Only the longest, thickest cables we use to actually transmit electricity from power stations to cities are affected.  </p>
<p>What <em>can</em> happen is that the power grids go haywire, and the power company's safeguards become overwhelmed, causing a power surge.  If that power surge is not controlled in some way (e.g. - Immediately disconnecting the entire grid), then your small electronics will be damaged by that surge.</p>
<p>If you don't believe me, let's engage in a thought experiment.  <a href="https://youtu.be/_yEu2R1gYSs" target="_blank">A large neodymium magnet can't even erase a Palm Pilot, let alone kill it.</a>. Those magnets have fields that are measured in Teslas.  <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field" target="_blank">Earth's magnetic field</a> is measured in <em>nanotesla</em>, or 0.00001 Tesla, and so are the solar flares that affect it.  If a magnet that is 100,000 times more powerful than Earth's field can't wipe out your devices, then there's no way that a solar flare can do that directly.  NOAA <a href="https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/geoelectric-field-1-minute-empirical-emtf-3d-model" target="_blank">measures disturbances in electrical grids</a> in terms of <em>millivolts per kilometer</em> of cable.  To kill a small device, you would need a magnetic field so strong that it would pull every car and skyscraper off of the planet.  At that point, we have much bigger concerns than the WiFi being out.</p>
<p>It irritates me, as a lover of heliophysics, that the media sensationalizes solar activity.  Half of the time when they tell you there's a major flare that occurred, it's not even noteworthy.  </p>
<p>There is a very serious threat to us in that our power grids are very vulnerable, but the notion that every electronic device on Earth will suddenly be rendered useless is ridiculous, and is a whole cloth fabrication made up by the media and spread by the internet.  I hope this helps!</p>
<p>Note: I realize that solar flares and CMEs are not the same thing but this is ELI5 and I want to keep this as simple as possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because they are not an electronic device. Can a Magnet, Radio or a Microwave (when you are not INSIDE) hurt you? No, but try to place a WLAN Router next to it and hear your Siblings scream about the Internet Connection when you reheat your lunch!
According to Wikipedia, Sun flares emits plasma and ions  (which will most likely never reach earth in a killing amount in your lifetime), and electromagnetic radiation on the whole spectrum, Microwaves, visible light in all colours, UV, ...,</p>
<p>Theoretically some types of said radiation could kill us. But the amount that reaches the surface is not enough. Electronical devices are waaaay more sensitive to it and the Flares could have effects on electronic networks, etc too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
