<p>Once colonialism (mostly) died, the system remained.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition, GMT (or Greenwich Mean Time) which is more commonly called UTC (Universal Time Co-ordinated) is an artefact from when the British Navy was top dog.  The French refused to use it for a long time until they were bullied into accepting it.  It's a similar story that the common World map view you grew up with puts Europe in prime position, and London at the centre.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At first we didn’t. The time was given by clocks either at a church or at a town hall, but it cold duffer between towns.
When trains arrived, they carried chronometers on board, so the hour among each country became the same, each train station having the “universal” time.
Then with the telegraph, then the telephone, and finally with the internet, synchronization became easier and more and more places had the exact time.
Someone might want to use more details I don’t have time to write more rn</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There really hasn't been an agreement about it at all.
It just kind of happened. Our 24 hour day schedule comes from the Egyptians and Babylonians and was taken over by the Romans and later all of Europe. Why? Because it was there, changing it would take time and effort and wouldn't really change anything, so why would you?. The only reason such a thing would change is because some ruler would want it, like what happened to the calendar.</p>
<p>Next consider that a large part of the world used to be owned by European countries, which made them basically in charge of the world, resulted the remaining countries to comply out of convenience.</p>
<p>The timezones are an invention by the British to keep time in the kingdom and to make sure that every train station would run at the same time. That's where GMT comes from. </p>
<p>As this partitioning is as good as any, it remains. For a country it doesn't really matter at all, you can choose your own standard time and you can count back to this partitioning. Looking at the map it is obvious that these time regions are followed poorly. However, straying to far from your time region will result in unusual times for the sun to rise and set, so that is something to consider.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
