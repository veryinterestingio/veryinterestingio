		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nobody in here is really explaining it like you're five.  I'm an oncology research nurse and to explain it to medically ignorant people or children we would use the weed analogy.  </p>
<p>The original (primary) tumor is like a single weed in the yard.  If you catch  it before it goes to seed you can pluck it out (surgically remove it) assuming you can reach it.  Maybe you would then also apply a treatment like casoron granules (chemo or radiation) around the yard just in case some seeds that you didn't see got in the grass.</p>
<p>A metastatic cancer is like the original weed went to seed and now there are baby weeds all over the yard also going to seed.  There are too many to get rid of them all without killing the entire yard. There may be some products you can apply (chemo) that will kill some of them (reducing the tumor burden) but there are just too many weeds and seeds to ever get rid of completely and the product is real hard on the yard and the yard can't take it forever.  Someone may come out with a new,  really really GOOD product that targets something special in some seeds (like a monoclonal antibody) but the seeds and weeds evolve over time to make even that ineffective. If you go to the hardware store there may be even another product that works some for awhile, but the weeds and seeds are just unbeatable and eventually it's time to rest.  </p>
<p>I hope that helps.  Of course it doesn't address all kinds of things about cancer but in my opinion it's the best layman's explanation. People not in the medical field really dont understand staging and staging is always changing.  Simple analogies work best.</p>
<p>Edit, thanks so much for the kind replies! I especially value hearing from those who will apply this analogy to their practice and those who may use it to explain cancer to children.  That makes me feel so good! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Am oncologist. There is no such thing as normal cancer. The answer to whether cancer is curable or not is more simple. If all the cancer cells can be removed from the body, you have been cured. In most of the solid cancers that form as lumps this needs to be done with surgery (cut) or radiation (magic dna damaging beams in eli5 terns). In liquid cancers such as cancers of the blood (leukemia etc) there is nothing to cut and so we give drugs to mix in the body and kill the cancer. Terminal cancer means we are unable to do either (sometimes not because of the cancer itself, but because the patient is too frail to have dangerous treatments). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Stages determine how far the cancer has spread. Is it just one tumor? Has it spread to nearby lymphnodes? To distant organs?  Numbers ranging from 0-4 are established based on how far it's spread. Sometimes, it'll be broken down into smaller categories (eg: 2a and 2b) based on things like the number of lymphnodes. The lower the number, the better - stage 1 is usually very treatable or even curable, but stage 4 is usually considered terminal.</p>
<p>This is also a big factor in determining prognosis. Someone who's got one tumor is <em>usually</em> much easier to treat. If it's in an accessible place, treatment may be as simple as one surgery - no chemo, radiation, etc. At that point, the person is not expected to die of the cancer. If a cancer is not caught before it's spread, prognosis becomes progressively worse. If a cancer has spread to distant organs, it's generally not possible to cure the patient, but they may live for several years. </p>
<p>Beyond that, where the cancer is can play a big role. A brain tumor is hard (or impossible) to operate on, because you're likely to damage important structures. Cancers in some places don't directly kill you - you don't <em>need</em> a breast or testicle to live - but can spread to other places and become deadly in the new locations. Other cancers kill directly because they prevent vital organs from functioning correctly.</p>
<p>Finally, the way the mutated cells behave is a major issue. Some cancers are simply more inclined to spread, grow quickly, and &quot;survive&quot; treatment attempts. Others are slower growing and easier to treat. </p>
<p>When doctors are deciding what kind of prognosis someone has, they look at all these factors, and compare them to patients with similar cancers (stage, type, etc). If 97% of patients with similar cancers survived cancer-free 5 years after treatment, their patient is likely to do really well with appropriate treatment. If 75% of their patients died within 5 years of treatment, the prognosis is much worse. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We basically look at the type and stage. If it's a bad, aggressive cancer that is widely metastatic, we say it has a horrible prognosis (we use terminal for the lay person). If it's a relatively benign or easily excised tumor that is localized, we say it has a good prognosis or is curable. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
