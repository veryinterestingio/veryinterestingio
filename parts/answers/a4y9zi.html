<p>It's like a soup. If an ingredient is missing it is going to smell different. No need to count or even necessarily know exactly what is missing.  </p>
<p>Those impressions can change pretty quickly though. It's not uncommon for animals to forget and leave babies behind. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Livestock farmer here. For sheep and cattle, it’s mostly scent based. Any time a lamb dies at birth, you skin it to wrap any orphaned lambs in the hide. Tricks momma into adopting other lambs when they smell their own offspring. Alternatively, you can buy scent to smear onto lambs and calves who have lost their mommas. Lambing and calving usually goes smoothly, but when it doesn’t, it’s tough for everyone to make it through alive. Also, they all now each others’ calls</p>
<p>Edit:I should add that I don’t know how the store-bought scent works, and I’ve never used it...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Animals is a pretty broad group.  Birds try to keep track, but birds also try to sneak an egg into someone else's nest so that they hatch and feed it.  Fish are less selective, more than a few can see their young as potential food.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My mom’s cat could count — to 5. My mom usually have her 5 cat treats.   One day, my mom gave her 3.  The cat kept patting my mom with her paw .. so my mom gave another one.  More patting.  When the 5th cat treat was put out, the cat quit the patting.</p>
<p>My mom tried different combinations after that.   Over 5 didn’t make a difference, but up to 5, that cat could count.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Counting isn't required to detect someone is missing, just the ability to distinguish individuals. Suppose you have no concept of numbers or math but you have children Billy, Bobby, Sally, and Sarah. You see Billy, Bobby, and Sarah. Where is Sally? You don't see her, she is missing.</p>
<p>See? No numbers, no math, but it gets the job done.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
