Down is with gravity, up is against. There's a constant physical reminder of this. Imagine if gravity were always pulling you left - it would be a constant reminder of what left was. As humans are largely externally symmetrical, they need to memorize left vs right.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are 2 answers:</p>
<p>1) Symmetry: We (and most other animals) have a 2-fold symmetry. Left and right are the same, and there is no inherent mechanism you can FEEL the difference. Unless you are extremely asymmetrical (scars, moles, deformities) you could copy your left side and mirror it and everyone would still recognize you.</p>
<p>We notice however, how different our body looks along the vertical axis.</p>
<p>2) As Said before, we cannot really feel a difference between left or right - but we actually can feel a difference between up and down, whenever we are in a gravitational field.</p>
<p>Here on Earth gravity pulls us towards the ground, so we always feel a pressure coming from the contact line that tells us, where down is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gravity.</p>
<p>Take gravity away and see what happens. Disorient yourself under water, preferably in a safe setting of some sort.</p>
<p>It’s easy to tell up &amp; down because you can constantly feel it. Put something very heavy on one arm, like a weighted bracelet, and it’ll probably be easier to remember which is which.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would imagine it’s due to point of reference. As we all generally stand/sit the same way, up is always above and down is below but right and left can be different if we are facing each other. </p>
<p>That’s just my guess though</p>
