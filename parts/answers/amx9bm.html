<p>The intent of the tests were to inflict the least damage but still have a valid test.  The tests were also spread out over decades.  The 100 weapon number comes from a combatant intending to inflict maximum damage within hours.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[1] The tests did not happen at what would effectively be the same time [over a few hours]. The tests happened one at a time over the course of years.</p>
</li>
<li>[2] The surface/aerial tests were out in the middle of nowhere, and the resulting fires/waves didn't last long.</li>
</ul>
<p>The concern in a nuclear war is [1] the near-simultaneous detonations all over the world, and [2] the fine ash thrown up from every major city on the planet being consumed in fire-storm at the same time.</p>
<p>This documentary [edit: series] has a good overview of what can happen when a major volcano decides to throw huge ash blows into the air. It's an overview of volcanos affecting human history, and how scientists have worked out those events. A nuclear war is thought to likely produce similar effects. No one bomb would do it, but a full-on war could: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fR2Z880z8" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7fR2Z880z8</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>100 nukes of what yield? Detonated where? What altitude? It all matters. The study you're referring to doesn't address that, and it relies on the assumption that these weapons would be detonated basically all at once over cities which would result in mass firestorms, putting tons of ash and soot into the atmosphere. This nuclear winter scenario has been suggested but it's just a theory. It's not a certainty at all.</p>
<p>Yes, thousands of nuclear weapons were tested during the Cold War, but this was over a span of 50 years. They were tested in isolated locations, far from anything that could catch fire and put soot into the atmosphere. Many of these weren't tested in the atmosphere at all, but underground.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
