		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you involve relativity events &quot;happening at the same time&quot; depends on the observer. </p>
<p>So you can say some things are happening simultanously, but you have to say from wich perspective. </p>
<p>There is no universal neutral observer that could give you a &quot;most correct&quot; order of events.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From your perspective‚Ä¶Yes. From the distant object/incident‚Äôs perspective‚Ä¶Yes. From somewhere in between‚Ä¶No. </p>
<p>Based on the distance and amount of time it‚Äôs takes to travel that distance ‚Ä¶. No. </p>
<p>An easier way to imagine it‚Ä¶. Sound travels slower than the speed of light. Imagine The sound of thunder versus the lightning bolt. You see the lightning but hear the sound later. Did they happen when you saw it, or only when you heard it?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For any two events where there is enough time for light from event A to reach event B (whether it actually does or not), then event A precedes event B for all observers.</p>
<p>For events where this is not the case, events A and B will be simultaneous for some observers, event A will occur before event B for some observers and event B will occur before event A for some observers.</p>
<p>The closer together in time and further apart in space two events are, the wider this window is, but any two events that can be described as truly simultaneous will not be from some perspective, even if very close together.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no such thing as &quot;at the same time&quot; for things far away or moving very fast.  It is perfectly possible for one observer to see A happening before B, and for another observer to see B happening before A.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everything in the universe is relativistic for our practical purposes. You can only know something in comparison to another, and that comparison makes things different based on what is being compared.</p>
<p>That means the answer is either ‚Äúit depends‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù.  </p>
<p>Some slightly too philosophical examples üòÖ:</p>
<p>What does it mean to be a man without first seeing a woman? </p>
<p>What does it mean for something to happen in New York if you don‚Äôt first know of that which is not New York?</p>
<p>What does it mean for it to be 5am if you do not know what it means to be 4am?</p>
<p>What does it mean for something to happen at one side of the universe without first knowing what the other half is?</p>
<p>So the question of absolute time is a relative question. In comparison to what? In comparison to two particles in superposition? To a person looking through a telescope? To a ship travelling through space?</p>
<p>The only absolute in the universe is the sum of the whole universe. If you account for everything, you have everything.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
