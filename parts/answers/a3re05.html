It doesn’t generally cover for profits but it will generally cover your inputs. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They can't sell their product, BUT because farming as a business is prone to this &quot;wipe out in one event&quot; type stuff on a regular basis AND it is critical to society AND your average farmer only gets one or two crops a year; the Federal government carries a variety of subsidies. You spend a year or so of work getting your stuff done only to have it all wiped out by a single event.</p>
<p>Hail, tornadoes, too much rain [or too little], floods, plant disease, human health/contamination, insect swarms...It's easy for a farm to lose an entire year's effort in one single event, and if that happens twice in ten or fifteen years you can go bankrupt very easily. A store or a restaurant that is gutted by fire can re-open and be selling again in a couple weeks. A farm that is wiped out has to literally start from the ground up AFTER they wait until next growing season to start.</p>
<p>Today a lot of &quot;farms&quot; are corporate and held by a company that owns properties all over the place, so there is less risk to the company as a whole, but that doesn't bring the risk down anywhere close to what it is for other non-farm businesses. </p>
<p>The subsidies vary a lot on type and amount, but they do exist and for good reason. If our farms are constantly fighting bankruptcy it makes grocery costs much more volatile.</p>
<p>edit: in the US the legislation in question is the <a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/food_and_agriculture/solutions/strengthen-healthy-farm-policy/the-farm-bill.html#.XAmH8GhKiUk" target="_blank">Farm Bill</a>, though I'm sure other countries have similar measures</p>
<p>edit2: insurance may also be an option for a lot of farmers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are basically SOL. They cannot sue the other farms. </p>
<p>But it is important to note that at this time of year there are not really very many &quot;other farms&quot; growing Romaine. They are all basically in the contamination area of Arizona. During the summer there are more sources though. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In our part of the country (Midwest Bible Belt) we have local farmers that are growing and selling to locally-owned grocery stores and food co-ops. </p>
<p>Since it can be tracked back to a non-contaminated area farm they are ok to sell it. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Episode 861 of the podcast Planet Money goes over the last time tainted romaine was an issue.  Relevant listen if you have the time.  It essentially goes into all the work on how they try to find the source of the outbreak.  Like other posters have said though, you are kinda SOL </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
