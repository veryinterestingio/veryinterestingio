<p>There is something different about the hairs in that zone that makes them more sensitive to a particular hormone called DHT. There is a whole series of inflammatory events that slowly kill the follicle. </p>
<p>Now, why are the hairs in one spot more sensitive than the hairs in another spot? No one knows. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The hair on top of the head is more sensitive to the hormones that cause the follicles to shrink in people who have male pattern baldness.  This is why hair restoration procedures can implant hair from the back of your head/neck on the top and it will grow like normal hair (it is resistant to what caused the baldness).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
