		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally yes.  Chemicals that we find particularly noxious are rarely present randomly on their own, they’re sulfurous compounds that decomposing bacteria release as waste.</p>
<p>The various sulfides aren’t necessarily toxic on their own, but their presence indicates a high likelihood of nearby decay - or active volcanoes.</p>
<p>Animals that actively seek out decomposition like flies find the horrific scent of hydrogen sulfide quite attractive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but it's a two-way street: microbes also make the smells and toxins <em>because</em> they ward you away from food.</p>
<p>Microbes rotting food are actually competing with large animals for access to that food.  If you eat it, they can't grow on it anymore.  So some microbes on rotting foods produce toxins (and smells that signal the presence of those toxins) in order to deter larger predators from eating their food (and them along with it).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>we are really good at detecting decaying food. A couple examples:</p>
<p>Onions have a very distinctive smell, now when an onion starts to decay you will smell it, even if it just started. Same goes for most vegetables. </p>
<p>Especially the human, who is  an omnivorous, has a &quot;smelling system&quot; where we categorize things to unpleasent and good. There are nearly no animals that do that, because they have other senses to tell them that food is good or bad. Like vision, Frogs have very bright colors, so predators think they are not good to eat.  Nettle hurt when eating, so animals remember the look of them. </p>
<p>But also do we perceive smells as bad when we connect it with a bad experience. Cheese is a good one, there are many people that dont like cheese and really hate the smell. This can happen when your parents force you to eat certain things, i.e. cheese, when you are small. So you connect it with a bad experience, this is also the reason why wwe chaneg our taste every couple of years or so, we try to reset these bad experiences and connect them with new ones. I hope that makes sense to you, my english is not the best ngl.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Same goes for why many don’t like bitter. </p>
<p>As i heard it, we taste salt because it’s essential for the cells. We like it, so an extent. </p>
<p>Sweet, the taste of carbonhydrate. </p>
<p>Sour, can’t remember what that was. </p>
<p>Bitter, most often poisonous stuff. </p>
<p>Umami: taste of protein. </p>
<p>I’m not 100% about if i remember it right, but bitter is certainly ly like this</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Omg this just brought back memories. I was like 8 years old and at my friends house and it was Easter. They had a bowl of intricately painted Ukrainian style Easter eggs in a bowl. I picked one up to look at it closely and it suddenly exploded. POP! Teal green slime everywhere. I remember the color vividly it was like neon fucking teal. It was everywhere, all over me and the surrounding area and the smell was horrendous. Instant gag. Normally when you make these kind of eggs you pierce them and drain the contents. This one was not empty and who knows how long it was festering....years?!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
