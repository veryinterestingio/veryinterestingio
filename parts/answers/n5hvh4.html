		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It was pretty bad, especially for Europe. A giant volcanic eruption in Iceland triggered a volcanic winter. Dark, ashy, and cold weather all around which led to massive crop failures and widespread famine. And in case that wasn't enough, bubonic plague also broke out in the Roman Empire and killed a lot of people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>A weird fog fell over Europe, the known world had a pretty record low cold summer, crops failed, and the Bubonic Plague a short while later hastened the collapse of the Roman Empire.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Volcano in Iceland erupts. The eruption releases a ton of ash containing all those bad chemicals. Those chemicals and the ash reflect the suns rays and heat back to towards the sun resulting in climate unable to properly grow crops. Little to no sun light reached the earth during that period, with records of historians claiming year long darkness. Such harsh climate conditions led to incredibly poor crops and thus massive famines across Europe, middle east, and China. </p>
<p>Also had some bubonic plague outbreak thrown in shortly after this time in Roman Empire which hastened the fall of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

North America? There were people living there during this time as well! Maybe it wasnâ€™t so bad for them?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
