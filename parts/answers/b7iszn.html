		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, lots of species do this.  I can't find any actual numbers, but I think it's safe to say that a large percentage of insects in temperate climates at least have annual generations in which the adults die shortly after reproduction.  It varies a lot from species to species, but usually offspring overwinter as larvae/pupae, and do not emerge as adults until they sense that conditions are good.  I am most familiar with solitary bees specifically, and this is very common, with the larvae eating their food provisions before pupating, and then emerging in spring.  Some insects, like certain cicada species, spend many years underground before emerging as adults, which only live for a few days or weeks.  Of course, there are some insects where adults do live longer too.  Bugguide has a pretty good overview of overwintering in insects <a href="https://bugguide.net/node/view/163372" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are some species of killifish that are capable of this; it’s pretty cool. They live in temporary creeks, puddles, or ponds, and lay their eggs at the base of plants before the dry season. The water may completely dry up, stranding and killing the adults, but the next rains will trigger the eggs to hatch. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cicadas are famous for this - they disappear for 13 or 17 years at a time.</p>
<p>Triops are also semi-famous (being a bit of an easy home-aquarium attraction): they die of old age in a couple of months, but their eggs dry out and wait for the next rainy year.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of mantid species in North America all grow throughout the year, reach sexual maturity towards the end of summer, mate, and form oothecae in the fall time just before the first hard frost, only to die so that their eggs can overwinter and hatch come spring. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pacific salmon are the textbook example of what you're thinking of. Every year, mature salmon migrate upstream from the ocean to spawn, then die shortly after spawning. Their young hatch the following spring, then grow and swim downstream to saltwater. They then live in the ocean and mature over 3–7 years before going back to spawn, beginning the cycle again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
