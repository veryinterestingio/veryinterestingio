		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Did you know, if you attempted to run a marathon drinking only water, you could die. Shocking, huh?</p>
<p>Water is exceptionally important to human bodies but it doesn't work alone. Salts help this water get to where it needs to be and helps water do what it needs to do. Drinking alcohol dehydrates you, and that dehydration means your precious salts went out with the piss. Your body wants more back in there!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We all need to have a certain amount of sugar and sodium (from salt) in the body. Alcohol lowers the amount of sugar in your blood. It makes you pee a lot.  Sodium leaves you body when you pee. Your body wants to get back what it has lost and that is why you feel like salty or sugary food after drinking alcohol.
Thatâ€™s why 7up is so good to drink the morning after.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ethanol is a diuretic.  That means it makes you pee a lot.  When you pee, you lose sodium, which leads to a condition hyponatremia, which is medical for lack of sodium.  Salty foods help to replace the lost sodium.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to these answers, being drunk also numbs your sense of smell/taste (it IS an anesthetic after all!). So things taste more bland than usual. To make up for this, you crave strongly-flavoured foods, which salty/fried foods often are. That's why a lot of &quot;bar food&quot; is flavourful stuff like tacos and hot wings.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
