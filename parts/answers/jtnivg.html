		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several ways. One particularly interesting way that doesn’t depend on measuring direction is through neutrino oscillation, which is an effect whereby physical neutrinos oscillate between the three flavors of neutrino (nu_e, , nu_mu, and nu_tau, corresponding to the three flavors of lepton). Physical neutrinos come in a quantum mechanical mix of those flavors, which vary back and forth in time. This is the main evidence for neutrinos having mass, as the rate of oscillation depends on the difference in mass of the different states. The fact that this happens explains the solar neutrino problem — we see far fewer regular electron neutrinos from the sun than we would expect without oscillation.</p>
<p>The rate of this oscillation varies depending on the medium that the neutrinos are traveling through — i.e., the outer layers of the sun, or the vacuum of space, or the earth — via a process called the Mikheyev–Smirnov–Wolfenstein effect. Even though neutrinos generally travel through the earth without being destroyed (i.e., undergoing an inelastic collision where they produce a muon or high energy electron or whatever that can be detected in a neutrino detector), they do accelerate the oscillation, to the point that it is fairly easily observable. As a result of that, the proportion of different types of neutrinos seen in detectors around the world depends on the time of day and the length of the line through the earth that points toward the sun. As long as the sun is up over the detector, the flux remains roughly constant, and then it changes overnight. Therefore, even without measuring the direction where neutrinos come from, in the absence of a beam set up to shoot neutrinos at a particular detector, we can infer that a large fraction of the ones we detect come from the sun.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
