		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Definitely for the Large Hadron Collider and similar insanely large particle accelerators or that laser-bouncing tunnel for detecting gravity waves. Not just because they are huge but because their operation relies on incredible precision.</p>
<p>IIRC the LHC had to account for how the moon's gravitational pull moves Switzerland/France and if the bedrock under the east side moves slightly more than the bedrock under the west side then the beam will be out of alignment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Humber suspension bridge has a main span a little less then a mile long (4,626 ft). Due to the Earth's curvature the two main supporting towers (510 feet tall) are 1.4 inches further apart at the top than the bottom.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the LIGO gravitational wave experiment this was a serious complication as described <a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/235441/how-does-ligo-account-for-curvature-of-earth" target="_blank">here</a>. In the case of LIGO it was very important that the tunnel was straight and flat for it's entire 4km length.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Architect here. Really large buildings are actually broken up into a sequence of smaller buildings that are connected by expansion joins that allow for each smaller building to move independently. Great care is used to make these expansion covers blend in and give an appearance of continuous design both for <a href="http://www.abswest.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CS-exterior-Expansion-Joint-Covers-5.jpg" target="_blank">exteriors</a> and <a href="https://shop.c-sgroup.com/files/new-sbu-homepages/feature-wall-ceiling-covers-ejc.jpg" target="_blank">interiors</a>.</p>
<p>Better question is how long can you make a continuous structure before it is too rigid to function. And this is what structural engineers do as part of their scope. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
