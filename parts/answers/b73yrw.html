		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>10 specific rivers have been identified as probably responsible for a quarter of all ocean plastics.
All we need to do** is filter at the river mouths of these and 25% of the flow can be stopped. But do we ? No. </p>

<p>For those who don't understand what riverine filtering projects look like, it's not sticking a giant net-like filter across the entire river.
Typically barges are used, like they have on the Thames in London.</p>

<p>** this has caused some confusion. I'm not suggesting this would be easy. But at least it means we've narrowed down the target of our efforts from tens of thousands of possible emission points to 10 main ones. Low hanging fruit and all that. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A major contributor to the ocean's microplastics is fabric. Most modern fabrics whether clothes or linen, etc. are made with a poly-blend in some form or manner. While widespread ocean plastic dumping is prevalent, a certain ignored percentage comes from laundry itself. There are filters that can be installed to washing machine and dryer outlets, but these are super expensive and often not easily available over the counter. This type of pollution predominantly affects plankton across the world, which pass it on to smaller fish and so on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Difficult to ascertain what the primary sources are because this field is just so data deficient. The data we do have on Marine litter is largely informed by beach litter surveys and the odd seabed trawl. There may be some pelagic/sea surface surveys, but I am not aware of a large scale data set of this kind. </p>
<p>So that's our first obstacle in identifying the major sources of litter; we can't be hugely confident of the makeup of ocean litter. </p>
<p>Some studies estimate that 80% of waste comes from activities on land, with the remaining 20% coming from maritime activities. Pathways from land are varied, but mostly come down to littering and spillage in rivers and on beaches. </p>
<p>In response to people posting about 25% of Marine litter coming from major rivers in Asia, we should mention that for a long time, Western countries would export a large amount of their waste to be disposed of and recycled in these countries. Many of these such as Indonesia do not have sufficient waste management frameworks to deal with their own waste, let alone others. So we should be careful when pointing the finger. </p>
<p>Another important mechanism to point out is that when exposed to sunlight and seawater, larger plastics fragment into smaller pieces. The weathering of these pieces mean that the origin of much of plastic litter surveyed cannot be accurately determined; the number one item in the Marine Conservation Society's UK beach clean is &quot;plastic pieces&quot;, the origin of which cannot be determined. </p>
<p>Tldr; We can point to what might be the most problematic industries for Marine litter, but we need to consider where we are getting our data from, where we are sending out waste, and what happens to waste in the Marine environment. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
