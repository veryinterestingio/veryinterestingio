		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, live attenuated virus vaccines can be contagious since it is a live but weakened form of the virus. </p>
<p>An example of this is the live attenuated polio vaccine which was actually able to spread in some cases and cause mild polio symptoms. </p>

<p>However, before you condemn the polio vaccine, consider that it has saved countless lives and nearly eradicated a terrible disease, in addition these cases are very rare.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> There have some replies with articles talking about alarming acute flaccid paralysis cases being linked to the polio vaccine. This is not true. While the polio vaccine has caused cases of paralysis, these cases are extremely rare. AFP cases are reported by the WHO which had this to say about them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>”A total of 59,436 AFP cases were investigated in India in 2012, another 53,421 in 2013 and 53,383 in 2014. Not a single AFP case has tested positive for polio in 2012, 2013 and 2014. All AFP cases during the last 3 years have been due to non-polio causes.” (<a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/404b/365a974298050f5bd016a755500afa7a8c2e.pdf" target="_blank">WHO</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The OPV polio vaccine contains a weakened poliovirus. Non-polio AFP cases means no poliovirus was present which includes the vaccine.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> There is another conspiracy theory that the polio vaccine spread HIV. This was made up by a journalist who wrote a book on it in the 90s with no scientific evidence. It was subsequently debunked when HIV was not detected in samples of the vaccine and when it was shown that chimps were not used to make the vaccine as he had erroneously claimed.<br />

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many current vaccines are live attenuated strains.  These are so weak they rarely ever spread, but the old polio vaccine was one that did spread and sometimes caused harm.  The biggest risk is if we accidentally give the vaccine to someone who is immunocompromised - they should not be given this type of vaccine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Live” vaccines contain active viruses which have been selectively bred to be profoundly weak. This is referred to as an “attenuated” virus strain. These attenuated viruses are too weak to cause serious illness, but still offer our immune systems a chance to create protective antibodies. The following is a list of live vaccines recommended for routine use in the United States:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>MMR (measles, mumps and rubella)</p>
<p>Rotavirus</p>
<p>Varicella (chicken pox)</p>
<p>Influenza (only the intranasal “flumist”; injectable flu vaccines are not live viruses)</p>
<p>Herpes Simplex Zoster (shingles – not a childhood vaccine)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In my kidney transplant education, they made it abundantly clear that I wouldn't be able to take  (at least certain) live vaccines and being around people who had recently taken a live vaccine could be dangerous as well.  (This is a result of being immunosuppressed.)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Technically, yes, ethically, no, plus it would be EXTREMELY dangerous.</p>
<p>Viruses/bacteria mutate, if you create one that is contagious enough to vaccinate a whole population, you can be sure it will mutate and make people sick, maybe kill them.</p>
<p>Also, bacteria can transfer their genomes horizontally. A bacteria can give some of its genome to another bacteria which is not his &quot;children&quot;, just another bacteria that is there.  </p>
<p>Edit : Okay, now I know that bacteria is already plural, my bad... In french it's &quot;une bactérie&quot; and &quot;des bactéries&quot;, so you know where the mistake comes from.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That would just be a virus. Technically it might be possible, but you'd have to create a virus that: </p>
<p>-Doesn't have any symptoms or has mild symptoms</p>
<p>-Looks similar to a harmful virus to our immune systems</p>
<p>-Spreads incredibly easily</p>
<p>-Is stable enough that it can't mutate into a harmful disease, or mutate into a form that no longer works as a vaccine as it looks too different</p>
<p>-Is virulent enough that it can effectively infiltrate our bodies and then spread to others before the body eliminates it.</p>
<p>It would incredibly difficult to do, cost a lot of money to do, and doesn't really provide a real benefit over traditional vaccines or, and especially no financial incentive for a company to develop it.</p>
<p>Edit: There are infectious vaccines in existence right now, such as one of the polio vaccines and cowpox, if you count it as a vaccine. Cowpox is its own disease that caused skin legions and fever, but was noticeably less severe than smallpox, which it is incredibly similar to. So in 1796 Edward Jenner intentionally infected people with cowpox, waited for then to recover, then infected them with smallpox. The individuals exposed to cowpox would not become infected with smallpox, so Jenner called it a &quot;vaccination&quot; using the prefix &quot;Vaca&quot;, or cow in Latin. Technically though cowpox was its own disease, and still had numerous symptoms that weren't fun to have, just better than smallpox.</p>
<p>In addition, if you have an infectious vaccine that's just a weakened virus, it could infect an immunocompromised individual and actually infect them with the full range of symptoms as the regular virus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
