<p>It backs the theory that the more lethal versions of the virus stopped being passed on, because their hosts died.  More 'successful ' strains didn't cause death, and they became the most common.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Historian here, not a scientist. One of the main factors in combating the flu in the USA was the enforcement of Public Health and Social Distancing measures: bans on spitting in public and injunctions to only cough or sneeze into ones own handkerchief or elbow, with police issuing citations and arresting violators. Banning of gatherings over a certain number of people and intense social stigma against shaking hands and other physical contact in social settings. Linen masks were commonly worn by healthy people to protect again aerosol droplets expiated by sick people. Schools and churches were often closed for months and self-quarantine of sick individuals was enforced by police once hospitals became overcrowded. Finally, one of the main reasons the flu stopped was simply that so many people had sickened and died because of it. Those that survived were immune to the first and most deadly strains, and had enhanced immunity against later mutations. The most vulnerable individuals in the population died and were therefore not around to spread later outbreaks. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thus in 2006, 2 major descendant lineages of the 1918 H1N1 virus, as well as 2 additional reassortant lineages, persist naturally: a human epidemic/endemic H1N1 lineage, a porcine enzootic H1N1 lineage (so-called classic swine flu), and the reassorted human H3N2 virus lineage, which like the human H1N1 virus, has led to a porcine H3N2 lineage. </p>

<p>The modern descendants are neither as deadly nor as widespread, however.  It's typical for epidemic diseases like these to evolve to be less deadly over time; this usually helps them spread more effectively because people who get severely ill tend to not spend as much time out in public infecting other people.  That's important, because as time goes by more and more people have been exposed to the illness and become immune, meaning the virus has a harder time spreading.  That's another thing that causes epidemics to, if not completely die out, become less common.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
