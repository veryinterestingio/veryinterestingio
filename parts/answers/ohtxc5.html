		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it's difficult not to in some respect.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that pipeline issue wasn't an attack on the pipeline itself, it was an attack on the billing and administrative systems of the pipeline company--it was more like a shop shutting down for a bit because all it's cash registers and payment terminals are broken--they could find a way to operate, I guess, but it's easier not to until it's all fixed.</p>
<p>More directly, you have a monitoring problem. Anything like that is going to have a lot of devices reporting status and alarm situations back to some sort of central network monitoring center that monitors alarms and can do some things remotely. Even before COVID, but particularly with COVID, you need some way for people at home or otherwise in non-company locations to access, and thus you now have an internet connection.</p>
<p>And then you have the problems with parallel networks that probably shouldn't be able to cross-communicate but can due to a design error somewhere. The Target hack, for example, was because the building's AC monitoring system was hacked, and once the hackers got in there, they were able to find their way over to the billing systems. There's also the famous report of a Casino where there was an aquarium thermometer that had internet access because an external company maintained the tank, that thermometer got compromised, from there the hackers found some other device or server that could be exploited, etc, until they got their way to financial information for casino high rollers.</p>
<p>This kind of stuff is easy to say &quot;they shouldn't do that,&quot; but also often sufficiently complex that one engineer making a mistake can cause a problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The part that got hacked was the billing, so that they could collect and bill based on usage, not the actual pipeline operations. Why is it on the internet? Because no one wants to go back to paper bills and writing checks. Itâ€™s online because online billing <em>has</em> to be online.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>also i do know that there are some Control Computers in the local Coal Power Plant and the local Water Treatment Plant are connected at certain Times for routine maintenance since i worked in a Factory that produced alot of waste Water so we had a steady connection and we use the same Coal Unloading Station</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like a big game of six degrees of Kevin Bacon - most critical systems are only ever a few steps away from the internet.</p>
<p>Many critical devices, like those that control utilities, are not directly on the internet. But the machine that controls them is. Or maybe they are fully separated from the internet, but they may still be in some kind of risk if the rest of the network at a location were to be compromised.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>OP look up a documentary about a malware called Stuxnet on youtube.</p>
<p>Crazy story.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it doesn't matter what system anything is using, there will always be vulnerabilities.  Nothing can be 100% secure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
