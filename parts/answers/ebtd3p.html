		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe this is just related to momentum and relative velocity?<br />
When you're running normally, the ground below you is static and doesnt move as opposed to the treadmill's belt which is moving backwards.<br />
When you're on the treadmill, you move at a certain velocity relative to the belt moving backwards. So when you step off from the treadmill you're moving from a level that is moving backwards to a level that is static. Your mind at this point is conditioned to think that you're still moving at the same relative velocity as what you had when you were on the treadmill but the ground below you isnt moving backwards anymore and so you &quot;feel&quot; like you are going forward.<br />
Pretty sure this is a terrible explanation but feel free to fix it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
