<p>An easy way to get flies to leave a room (during the day) is to switch off the lights, pull the window shades down and leave the only window opening as the only source of light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are so so many bugs outside that, even though it's really unlikely for them to get in, some still do. It's just as unlikely for them to escape, but there are only a few inside so you don't see it happen as much</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are much more likely to notice a single mosquito inside your room because:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The usual value for &quot;Mosquitoes in room&quot; is 0. You would never notice the 1 fewer mosquitoes outside.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You spend a lot more time inside than outside.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mosquitoes want to be wherever you are, to drink your blood.</p>
</li>
<li>If there are lots of them outside and none inside, it only takes 1 to figure it out and get in, so there are many chances. If you're trying to get that 1 back out, there's only 1 way for that to happen.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are thousands of bugs trying to get in, millions even, and so once they are in, they already won the lotto, so to speak, and have beat the odds and gotten in.  To beat the odds and get out, is statistically unlikely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
