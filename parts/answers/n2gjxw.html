		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We haven't helped it &quot;evolve&quot; <em>per se</em>, but we have done a few things to increase its effectiveness! </p>
<p>One mechanism of bacterial resistance to penicillins is the evolution of beta-lactamase, which destroys the beta-lactam ring that is the structural cornerstone of penicillins and cephalosporins. We've created &quot;companion drugs&quot; to penicillins that inhibit beta-lactamase, protecting the penicillin and letting it continue to kill bacteria.</p>
<p>The one you've most likely seen is amoxicillin paired with clavulanic acid, sold under the trade name Augmentin (augmented amoxicillin).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most antimicrobial-producing species only produce one antimicrobial and that's after millions of years of evolution in a niche environment facing competition and natural selection. Whereas other organisms, like the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESKAPE" target="_blank">ESKAPE pathogens</a>, have spent an equal amount of time evolving redundant metabolic pathways to thwart antimicrobials.</p>
<p>This is another reason why environmental destruction is so bad, we are losing species before we even have a chance to discover them and their potential antimicrobials.</p>
<p>Another huge problem with finding antimicrobials is that they are all toxic but only a few are toxic enough to kill the pathogens and not quite toxic enough to kill us.</p>
<p>There of course are synthetic antibiotics like <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfonamide_(medicine)" target="_blank">sulfonamides</a> but the hard part is less about getting the microbes to produce the antimicrobial and more about not having it kill them, e.g. sulfonamides are great at killing yeast.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The class of penicilline antibiotics is already widely explored and additional medication to combat resistance when combined with penicilline is in fact in place.
But resistance against antibiotics in general is a huge problem in pretty much all chemical classes of antibiotics. And as others have mentioned it is largely due to misuse and inadequate prescription. </p>
<p>To develop new and effective antibiotics is actually viable, but also very costly. And with the amounts of patent free antiobiotics on the market already you would likely get outcompeted by current drugs even despite rising resistance levels. So there is an economical aspect to the problem as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We can and have made new antibiotics to help them be more effective against certain pathogens! I worked in a lab where we added side chains to the antibiotic family called fluoroquinolones (like Cipro and Levaquin) in order to help them bind better to the mucous barrier thatâ€™s produced by pseudomonas in the lungs!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
