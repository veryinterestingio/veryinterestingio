<p>So if you would two equally sized groups with either the vaccine or a placebo and in the placebo group 100 would fall ill, in the vaccine group only 6 would fall ill.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Effectiveness is not measured by a clinical trial; it is measured by &quot;real-world&quot; outcomes. A clinical trial measures efficacy. For the average person, the difference between these terms probably doesn't matter too much, but it is really important to remember that <em>they are not the same thing</em>. Effectiveness is almost always less than efficacy, and we would generally not expect these vaccines to reach 95% effectiveness. <a href="https://www.who.int/influenza_vaccines_plan/resources/Session4_VEfficacy_VEffectiveness.PDF" target="_blank">Here</a> is a good overview of these terms from a WHO presentation. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/20/health/covid-vaccine-95-effective.html" target="_blank">Here</a> is another explanation from the NYTimes.</p>
<p>The vaccine is 95% efficacious. This means that the vaccinated group experience a 94% reduction in the measured endpoint as compared to the placebo group. The primary endpoint for most of these studies was lab-confirmed (PCR) symptomatic covid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In epidemiology it means 94% fewer “events” than the control group, given equal levels of exposure. Sometimes you see increased numbers of “events” after the intervention due to there being more exposures. </p>
<p>In this wonderful world we live in, we allow the company running the trial to define the “event”. In this case the vaccine does not prevent infection, just a reduction in acute signs and symptoms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
