		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My strategy was to look at the triple point of substances and look at the one with the highest pressure below 1 atm. Looking at phase diagrams, the width of the liquid phase narrows the closer you get to the triple point, which makes sense as below it the liquid phase cannot exist.</p>
<p>The highest I could find was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrous_oxide" target="_blank">nitrous oxide</a> at 0.86 atm which melts at  -90.86°C and boils at -88.48 °C for a difference of 2.38 degrees. Someone with a more extensive list of triple points might be able to do better</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At standard, atmospheric pressure, a few solids which will sublime (turn directly from solid to gas) are iodine (at slightly higher than room temperature), carbon dioxide (dry ice) at -78.5 degrees Celsius, as well as naphthalene (used in mothballs) and arsenic.</p>
<p>These are obviously all zero, but it’s the only answer I know.  Hoped it might start you on your journey.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
