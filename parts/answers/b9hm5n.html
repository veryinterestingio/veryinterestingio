So if their whole net worth was in company stock, they wouldn't remain a billionaire. But if they cashed out shares and had that money in other investments, then it's their personal assets and not the company's. No different than if you worked for Sears or GM and their creditors tried to come after your savings account.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There is technically no difference in liability  if someone owns 0.0000001% of the shares or 100%, both &quot;own&quot; the company, just different amounts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That is specifically why there are various definitions of company from sole-proprietorship to limited liability etc. </p>
<p>In a sole-proprietorship the bank can go after personal assets. By becoming a limited liability or Corporation no individual's personal assets are at risk. Taxes work differently for different types of companies... the transfer from &quot;company money&quot; to private asset money is not as stringently regulated for a sole-propiertship... after all your only 'stealing' from yourself if you take company money when you own the company.  In an LLC or corporation there is a very well defined line between what is &quot;your money&quot; and what is &quot;your companies money&quot;... this is because companies larger then a sole-proprietership often have multiple investors who may not own the company... but if the business own just took business money then they would be stealing from those investors. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Saying... &quot;This rich guy that just F*#ed everyone, called bankruptcy and got away scott free should have the bank take their personal stuff&quot; might sound good for the rare case where it happens... but it would really, really make it difficult and dangerous for entrepreneurs to run a business without risking everything they own. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on what bankruptcy is being filed. If the billionaire is personally filing for bankruptcy, then their assets are (generally) fair game. They might protect some of them through exemptions or restructuring, but it shouldn't be possible to call them a billionaire afterwards. (In fact, it shouldn't really be possible to call someone a billionaire just <em>before</em> they file personal bankruptcy either. Any reasonable calculation would be net worth (assets - debt), and someone about to file bankruptcy typically has more debt than assets, even if their assets are large). </p>
<p>It's more likely you're thinking about a situation where the <em>company</em> files for bankruptcy. In that case, the personal assets of any owners are protected. There are some scenarios where this is obviously sensible and fair. If a company with publicly-traded stock declares bankruptcy, are its millions of stockholders obligated to cover its debts from their personal assets? They're &quot;owners&quot;, but only in a very limited sense and with very limited upside. Nobody would ever hold stock if it meant putting all your savings on the line like that. </p>
<p>A scenario where it's obviously <em>un</em>fair to protect owners from corporate bankruptcy is if the firm had a single owner who knowingly gutted it to increase his personal wealth. If the firm can't make payroll because the owner used that check to buy a yacht, you obviously have a problem. For what it's worth, that sort of thing is illegal, or there are at least ways to hold the person accountable in the way you talked about.  </p>
<p>The real grey area is firms where the ownership just did a bad job. No fraud occurred, but they failed to create a successful business in a scenario where more motivated/competent owners would have succeeded. You could maybe make an argument that these people owe their creditors more than just the assets of the business, but the general thrust of the law is &quot;the creditors knew who they were working with and knew their debt wouldn't be secured if things went wrong, so they have to deal with the consequences&quot;. To a certain extent, this is because it's much easier to structure the law to protect little guy &quot;owners&quot; by default with special exemptions for malicious behavior than it is to structure it the opposite way. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>First, despite the word &quot;bank&quot; being in the name, there isn't necessarily any bank involved in a bankruptcy. Banks are often creditors, but they don't have to be. Most bankruptcies are prompted by medical debt, for example.</p>
<p>When you file for bankruptcy, you must list out all of your creditors. If you have stuff that gets taken or sold (very rare) or you make payments to the trustee (Chapter 11/13 only), the creditors get told about it and they can them submit a request to take a piece of it (&quot;proof of claim&quot;). </p>
<p>That is the only method by which an unsecured creditor can get something out of you when you file for bankruptcy. A secured creditor can snag secured property if the person filing chooses not to reaffirm the debt.</p>
<p>You are given a number of very generous exemptions when you file for bankruptcy. These are like little stickers that say &quot;mine&quot; on them. You get one for your car (as of April 1, it's $4000). You some for your retirement accounts (literally $infinity), you get one for your house (~22K with some flucuation), etc. You also get one for anything called the D5 or Wildcard that you can use for whatever you want (~11K, varies with the house one).</p>
<p>So, let's take a rich person. His income is probably too high for a Chapter 7, so he's going to have to do a Chapter 13. If he wants to keep the unexempt stuff, he'll have to effectively buy it back from the estate over the course of the next 3-5 years. He'll make monthly payments to the trustee and the trustee will send some of that money to the creditors who ask for it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
