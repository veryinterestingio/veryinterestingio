The heel has blood vessels close enough to the skin surface, you can poke a big enough hole to get sufficient blood before it clots, you can easily bandage the site afterward, and it's relatively easy to hold the foot still while you do the collection. And the baby isn't going to disturb the band-aid by trying to walk around right afterward.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The test they are typically running is a bilirubin check. When Bilirubin levels are high in the body, you become more jaundice (Yellow). Bilirubin is formed in the liver from the breakdown hemoglobin in the blood. Primary care providers test this frequently over the first week of a child's life when bilirubin is high in the blood after birth. </p>

<p>It is specifically the heel, because if you have to perform them frequently in the first week you will be causing the baby a lot of unnecessary pain by constantly poking them with a needle for an IV and it is hard to get a good vein on a newborn. A heelstick is easy to get blood from and is less invasive to the child.</p>
