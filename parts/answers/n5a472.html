		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its not calculating this calculus. Based on knowledge about where is your hand, and seeing where is the ball, it tries to make this two meet. So its not exact calculations based on initial conditions, its more constant adjustments. Also, its not solving this problem in general setup, it is solving it for concrete setup of your body. You whole life you are using your body and your muscles, so most of this becomes hardwired. Also notice how when baby learn how to walk, at first it is very clumsy. Brain does not know body very well. But through repetition brain learns how to use body, on observe and remember base. And it works similarly with every sport. First you are clumsy, and through training your brain learns how to better utilize your body.</p>
<p>To sum up, your brain is not solving calculus for general case of catching a ball. Your brain had your whole life to learn how each action affects your hand movement. And now all you need to do is to try to move your hand where the ball is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>catching a ball isn't 4D calculus, it's 2D algebra at best unless the ball is spiraling around its trajectory and changing size as the 4D object phases through our 3D plane of existence.</p>
<p>Anyway, the first time someone tries to catch a ball, they just move their hand towards the object and hope that the two meet up. Anything other than that comes down to experience from seeing other objects fall, recreating the trajectory in their mind, and replaying it for the current situation. ignoring wind resistance, basically every object will fall in the exact same way due to the constant effects of gravity. You don't *need* numbers to know &quot;that ball is going to land...somewhere around this spot&quot; when you can see the ball heading there in real time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>it's not.</p>
<p>At best it's doing it based off of the results of a past sampling, sort of a &quot;monte carlo&quot; simulation.</p>
<p>The brain knows that when ball looks like this, hand here usually catches it.  hand over there does not.   It's why kids are so clumsy.  They haven't run the simulation enough to know where a good place to put your hand tends to be.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Also, the brain cheats.  A ball arcing through the air is a great example.  It's constantly accelerating, but with how your eyes track it, and your brain focuses on it, it can simplify the problem down to approximate a &quot;constant velocity&quot; problem.</p>
<p>This is one reason why people struggle in physics classes identifying if an object is accelerating.  Veritassium does a decent video on youtube explaining this mental shortcut.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I guess this misunderstanding comes from science fiction/tv, which often has a tendency to show brains as super sophisticated computers. But fundamentally, they don't really work the same. A computer at its very core, runs on logic and math.</p>
<p>Your brain is primarily a sophisticated pattern recognition machine. When you catch a ball, your brain is calling back to the patterns it remembers about balls being caught. Its why if the ball is a bit heavier cause its wet or something, you might fumble the catch.</p>
<p>That's not to say your brain can't do math, it obviously can't, but compared to a computer, its not very good at it. Its not running millions of complex spatial equations when you guess the volume of a room.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s a simple heuristic that allows us to catch a ball. Keeping the ball constantly in your field of vision at a certain angle and you can catch the ball no matter where it’s hit as long as you keep the angle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
