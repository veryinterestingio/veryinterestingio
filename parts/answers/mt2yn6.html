<p>Water does.</p>
<p>Edit: Pure water doesn't conduct electricity - as I've been informed 1000 times.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can wash electronics with soap and water without damaging them, so long as there is no current running in the device. Capacitors that still have a charge can cause shorts, so this is also a potential hazard when cleaning electronics.</p>
<p>Alcohol is used because it evaporates faster and it's a better solvent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most risky liquid for electronics is salt water.  It causes galvanic corrosion and can act to short circuit power components.</p>
<p>If you ever drop unprotected battery powered electronics into salt water, you have <em>seconds</em> to remove the battery;  you have <em>minutes to hours</em> to rinse out the salt water and you have <em>days</em> to let the clean water dry off.</p>
<p>You can make a galvanic cell (battery) by taking any two different metals and dipping them in an ionic solution (eg: acid, salt water etc.)  When you drop your phone into salt water, the frame (aluminum or steel) and the circuit traces (copper) form a battery.  The very fine copper traces oxidize (rust) rapidly.  You can make this happen even faster by applying a voltage to drive the reaction.</p>
<p>Clean water on unpowered electronics is pretty harmless.  Many electronic manufacturing processes flush or rinse with
distilled water.  If you leave it for a long time, the damp metal will react with air to rust and it will tend to pick up salts and contaminants that may make it act like weak salt water.</p>
<p>Alcohol evaporates very fast and is usually applied very sparingly.  The risk with alcohol is not the electronics but the structure.  Many adhesives are alcohol-soluble including hot melt (used to tack down wires and physically stressed components) tapes and, most importantly, some of the glues used to build up touchscreens.  Generally the amount of mass (for glues and tapes) or the amount of exposed surface (tapes and screens) means that you need a long exposure to do much damage.  Soaking a screen in alcohol overnight will almost certainly destroy it while doing the same with clean water probably wouldn't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water (H2O) has the ability to auto ionize. Meaning that molecules of water can react with one another to split themselves into two different ions. Hydroxide: [OH]- and Hydron: [H]+. Ions are very good at carrying charge, and if an electrical component is exposed to an ion containing solution it can short circuit meaning that the charge from the circuit is free to flow anywhere exposed to the solution without much resistance.</p>
<p>Isopropyl Alcohol (CH3)2CHOH will not ionize because molecules of rubbing alcohol will not react with one another. No auto ionization means that charge wonâ€™t run through the solution and the circuit is more or less safe</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
