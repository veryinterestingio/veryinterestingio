		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is the ELI5 version. </p>
<p>When your body is just sitting around there's still a lot of stuff you're body is doing. When you exercise your body has to be able to do those normal sitting around things better and faster to be able to keep up with the demands of exercising. If you do that enough times your body realizes it's not doing a great job and needs to get better at doing those basic body functions and it send the signal to your body hey everybody we need to do better everyone start improving things. As this happens and your body gets a lot of practice operating at a higher level it means it's a breeze to do the sitting around part and in general your body is less stressed just sitting around because it's so much easier.  Stress is okay in short bursts it reminds us we have to be better but constant stress with no break is bad for our bodies because it means we're always working hard without a break. And when we actually do need to work hard we can't because we're maxed out and at risk of breaking down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's also a theory that a lot of cellular damage is caused by slightly malfunctioning mitochondria producing more free radicals (hungry molecules that want to bind with other stuff, damaging it in the process...like your DNA or other cellular machinery) as they generate energy. </p>
<p>Exercise may force these damaged mitochondria to work harder than they would normally and &quot;kill&quot; themselves in the effort, removing them from the cell, letting healthy mitochondria reproduce to take their place and reducing the number of free radicals floating around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another reason is that when your cells replicate and DNA is copied, the DNA inevitably gets shorter. For this reason there is junk DNA at the ends of the strands called telomeres which act as a padding. It’s okay if this DNA gets shorter since it doesn’t code for anything important. Over the course of your life, the replication will make these telomeres so short that further replication will start affecting the DNA that codes for necessary proteins. This has many negative health effects, and cancer is one of them. Scientists have reported that people that exercise regularly have telomeres that look 20 years younger than those who lead a sedentary lifestyle. Exercising truly makes you live longer since it extends the amount of times your DNA can replicate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ancient humans had to hunt or gather food to get energy. At the same time, ancient humans used a lot of energy (compared to other animals): Humans hunted by tracking and tiring other animals out. Human babies spend a lot of their life burning energy and not collecting energy. Human brains burn a lot of energy. Humans need a lot of energy.</p>
<p>Thus, human bodies evolved to be very efficient: 1) Store extra energy as fat to not waste it 2) Only grow muscles that are used in order to conserve protein and energy.</p>
<p>But human society suddenly changed human behavior: We could get energy by just buying food. Because we could just buy food, we ate excess energy, which we store as fat. Because we could just buy food, we didn't have to use as many muscles to gather food so we stopped building muscles.</p>
<p>Why is excess fat bad? Fats produce hormones. Hormones are signals or messages to the body about the state of the body. Hormones mostly signal based the <em>amount</em> of the hormone in the body. Too much fat, too much of fat's hormones, and the body starts misbehaving. Fat also releases cytokines, which are not exactly hormones, but too many cytokines seem to constantly activate the immune system, which makes the immune system unable to respond to actual attacks.</p>
<p>Why is too little muscle bad? Well muscles help us move, help support us, and help prevent us from getting injured. Too little muscle and we get injured easily, can't move well, and can't support our own weight (and we get things like lower back pain and bad posture.) Muscle mass also tends to calm the immune system. And the other important muscle is the heart! If the heart isn't challenged, it doesn't get stronger and is less resilient, <del>and it pumps less blood per pump, which can contribute to high blood pressure.</del></p>
<p>TL;DR: Because energy was scarce, we evolved to store energy as fat and to only grow muscles when needed. When energy became abundant and easy to gather, we gained too much fat and lost too much muscle. Too much fat unbalanced the body and too little muscle leads to not being able to move well and more likely to get injured.</p>
<p>Cardio exercise is an attempt to reduce fat (though you can also eat less) and to strengthen the heart and breathing muscles. Resistance exercise (moving heavy objects) is an attempt to fool muscles into thinking they are needed, so the body will spend energy growing and maintaining those muscles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
