		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Butter/fat cools and hardens. Bonds between starches and proteins (from the flour and egg) are more mobile with more heat. Steam is released as the cookie cools so there is less moisture content. Chocolate chunks also resolidify. Basically, the cookie becomes more viscous/solid in the way that everything else becomes more viscous/solid as it cools.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The heat is making the water go to steam which is what makes the cookie spread. This also has a hand in the structure of the cookie. When it cools the water evaporates, some of it anyway, and shifts away from is gaseous form and let’s the cookie set up. It’s the same with breads or cakes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>2 things</p>
<p>1: it is continuing to cook. When food comes off the heat, it doesnt stop cooking. It continues to cook until its temp is at a relativley low temp. The cookies are continuing to cook on the hot pan as well.</p>
<p>2: The starches and sugars that were looser when cooking begin to harden up when cooled down.<br />
So dont get em browned in the oven. If they are brown on top when you pull them out, they will be burnt on the bottom.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's also a process called ' carry over cooking ' where the residual heat will continue to over cook the food. A lot of times when some one over cooks something its down to the fact they didnt take the carry over time into account.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sugar harden.</p>
<p>Other factor (fat, chocolate, steam) can also play a role, but in my experience &quot;standard&quot; American cookies harden fast due to the high sugar content of the recipe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
