		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The process of popping a kernel absorbs more energy than it releases. When there are still lots of un-popped kernels, so much heat energy is absorbed by all these kernels that it prevents the temperature of the oils and steam in the bag from rising to the point where an already popped kernel would burn. Once most of the kernels have popped, the heat energy has nowhere else to go and the temperature goes up, eventually burning the popped ones.</p>
<p>This is why it's almost impossible to get all the kernels to pop without burning some of them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Microwaves are really good at heating water. Dry things don't heat very well compared to wet things.</p>
<p>When you start microwaving a bag of popcorn, almost all the moisture is inside the kernels, and so they absorb the microwaves and kernels begin to heat up. A kernel pops and becomes popcorn. </p>
<p>Microwaves continue to be absorbed by the kernels full of moisture. The dry popcorn is largely unaffected. Kernels continue to pop.</p>
<p>Eventually there are almost no kernels left, they have all popped into popcorn. Their moisture was effectively protecting the popcorn by sucking up all the microwaves, but now there are almost no kernels full of moisture to suck up the microwaves, and instead the popcorn is sitting in a cloud of super-heated vapor. The popcorn begins to burn</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Kernels burn because they get too hot. </p>
<p>They get too hot because they get so much heat. </p>
<p>They get so much heat from water vapour. </p>
<p>Water vapour comes from exploded kernels and inside. </p>
<p>Exploded kernels help accelerate the rise in temperature outside as their water vapour is dissipated amongst all (neighbouring) kernels. </p>
<p>There is very little water vapour outside the kernels initially. All of it is inside. </p>
<p>Only the water inside the kernels can heat up due to the microwave. </p>
<p>Liquid water can only get to 100 deg C. Water vapour is not limited in temperature. </p>
<p>When there’s a lot more water vapour around as most kernels have opened, the outside temp can get very high and either directly burn opened kernels or the little butter/oil that was added for taste also starts heating up and burns them from below. </p>
<p>That’s why, Eli.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good question.</p>
<p>Microwaves heat up different things differently depending on how they absorb them. That's why some containers are microwave safe and some will melt if you put them in.</p>
<p>Water absorbs microwaves really well, that's what heats up when you microwave something mainly...that's why it has a funky texture when it cools down. All the water is boiled out of it.</p>
<p>Kernels pop because they have moisture inside them and when it heats up it builds up pressure and that is what makes them pop. Once they pop they heat slower because the water is gone though. You can still burn them if you go too long though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
