		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you rub your eyes you're massaging them which enhances circulation and that always feels good (basically giving your tissue fresh air). The problem with rubbing eyes is that the eye ball is pretty sensitive so try not to rub the eye ball itself but the eyelid and surrounding area. Your eyes might also be dry and rubbing the area can stimulate tear ducts.</p>
<p>People often &quot;live&quot; in their heads so stimulating areas on the face and scalp - be it scratch, massaging, etc - helps stimulate the mind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>External pressure on the eye triggers a reflex known as the Oculocardiac reflex, which involves the vagus nerve (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculocardiac_reflex?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculocardiac_reflex?wprov=sfla1</a>). The vagus nerve, which is one of the 12 cranial nerves, usually elicits effects opposite to the typical &quot;fight or flight&quot; response, which is carried out by &quot;adrenalines&quot; (epinephrine, norepinephrine). Where &quot;adrenaline&quot; would cause an increase in heart rate, increased blood pressure, etc., vagus nerve stimulation results in slower heart rate, decreased blood pressure, etc. Vagus nerve stimulation is used in medicine to treat acute arrhythmias (via vagal maneuvers such as the carotid massage, where you put pressure and massage the pressure receptor near the carotid arteries in the neck) by slowing down heart rate. </p>
<p>To answer your question, there is some thought that rubbing your eye causes your heart rate and blood pressure to drop, putting you into a more relaxed state. This &quot;stress relief&quot; may be the reason why it feels so good (among other reasons stated).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
