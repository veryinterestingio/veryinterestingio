		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has properties that make it ideal for military usage, both defensively and offensively. It's also cheap and readily available.</p>
<p><strong>Density</strong>- DU is very dense, which means it can absorb a lot of energy, like from the impact of an incoming projectile when used in armor plating. Conversely, as a projectile it can <em>carry</em> a lot of energy- meaning it can be highly destructive for its size when placed into the core of a conventional bullet or projectile.</p>
<p><strong>Anti-Tank Weapons</strong>- A big challenge on the battlefield is neutralizing enemy armor, such as tanks. Not only do you need a projectile that will penetrate its thick armor, but you also need to disable it- such as by killing the crew inside.
A DU projectile can do both of those things because it has two very appealing properties- it fractures on impact into razor sharp pieces and it readily ignites into ferocious flames when it does.
So with DU you have a high energy projectile that punches through armor plating, breaks into a swarm of deadly sharp spikes, and then incinerates the crew inside in a molten fireball. That makes it exceptionally appealing considering those rounds can be fired from a man-portable weapon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is as dense and heavy as metals can get. You want that in the core of bullet because more density/mass = more energy which, in turn = better armor-piercing capability.</p>
<p>DU also tends to break apart into deadly shrapnel rather than mushrooming like other metals do. That can be devastating to the people inside the target.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's really heavy. That's all there really is to it.</p>
<p>There's a limit to how fast you can get bullets going, and the how-hard-it-hits factor is determined by speed times mass. So you want the heaviest (ie, densest, because there are also limitations on size) projectile possible. That's uranium.</p>
<p>Pretty much everything else that people will tell you about uranium isn't really about how <em>uranium is great at this</em> as much as how <em>uranium doesn't suck at this as much as you might have though, considering we only picked it because it was super-heavy.</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
