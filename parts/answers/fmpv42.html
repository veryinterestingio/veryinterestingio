<p>The skin in the area has multiple layers, and will change depending on your habits. I see you’re a fellow cheek biter, and I have the same specks you’re talking about. </p>
<p>So ELI5 version: You’re repeatedly damaging the skin there by biting it, so your body decides create a “stronger” layer (fibrous tissue). This tissue is just your body’s way of dealing with the chronic biting. A more common presentation is what we call linea alba or traumatic fibroma. Normal skin still dominates and is everywhere because it’s what your DNA codes for. </p>
<p>You should have your dentist look into it if:
-Any spot starts to hurt, and keeps on hurting for more than three days.
-A <em>significant </em> increase in the number of them. </p>
<p>Or just shoot me a message with a picture. Teledentistry could be helpful here.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
