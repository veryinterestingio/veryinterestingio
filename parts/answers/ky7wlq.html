		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some good models in this article - mostly comparing well ventilated spaces to poorly ventilated spaces and duration of time:
<a href="https://english.elpais.com/society/2020-10-28/a-room-a-bar-and-a-class-how-the-coronavirus-is-spread-through-the-air.html" target="_blank">https://english.elpais.com/society/2020-10-28/a-room-a-bar-and-a-class-how-the-coronavirus-is-spread-through-the-air.html</a></p>
<p>In short:
“Irrespective of whether safe distances are maintained, if the six people spend four hours together talking loudly, without wearing a face mask in a room with no ventilation, five will become infected....”  “ The risk of infection drops to below one when the group uses face masks, shortens the length of the gathering by half and ventilates the space used.”</p>
<p>It also addresses the factor of whether people are speaking/singing or not which I think is underrepresented in the public discourse about COVID. For example if you have to pass closely by someone skip the “Excuse me” and just give a nod.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Last summer, virologists at the University of Washington were watching cases in Seattle very closely during the BLM protests and found <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/protests-in-seattle-and-elsewhere-dont-appear-to-be-driving-virus-surge-researchers-say/" target="_blank">no associated spike in cases</a> despite the mass groupings of people outdoors, indicating that outdoor transmissibility is fairly low at least in that context. This is noteworthy because at these events mask-wearing is common but not universal, 6 ft of distance is often not maintained, and people speak and even chant and yell fairly often; of course entirely outdoors. This lead King County (the county Seattle is in) to release <a href="https://www.uwmedicine.org/coronavirus/protesting-safely" target="_blank">&quot;safe protest&quot; guidelines</a> to minimize exposure.</p>
<p>Note that these are not peer-reviewed publications but public health decisions made with the available data.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that it takes a certain threshold of virus particles to start an infection. Haven't ever seen that quantified to anything actionable, though. Being outside with continuous air exchange helps to prevent aerosols and other suspended particles from hanging around and building up. And something about outdoor, constantly moving air being less hospitable to the virus in general and substantially antiviral/antibacterial? I'm not sure, I read those articles early on in the pandemic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
