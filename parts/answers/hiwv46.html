		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You use an SD card every now and then for a few minutes; you use an SSD for long periods at a time. The SD card doesn't have to be particularly robust, but the SSD needs to be <em>massively</em> more reliable. </p>
<p>Look at it this way: an SD card that fails after 5000 hours of use lasts damn near forever. An SSD that fails after 5000 hours of use means that your desktop is hosed in 7 months. </p>
<p>Additionally, an average SD card transfers data at, what...20 MB/s? 80 MB/s? Something like that. An average SSD transfers data at more like 500 MB/s, with M.2 SSD drives being more like 3000 MB/s.</p>
<p>All the things that make SSDs more reliable and faster take up room and increase price.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>32TB SSDs have been around since 2018.  But they are very expensive.  They are aimed at the enterprise market.  </p>
<p>I have a mess of 7.6 TB SSDs at my job.  And those are already a couple years old.  The newest models I can get I think are 32TB for those arrays.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know all the technical details behind it but while it has a large amount of storage for it's size, it's very slow. You can get a $300 M2 1TB SSD that reads at over 3500 MB/s and writes at over 2000 MB/s (compared to 160MB/s and 90MB/s respectively), so the cells used in the MicroSD probably focus more on capacity than speed. However that's not quite a direct comparison because that speed is only available due to the interface, normal SATA SSDs are quite a bit slower but still much faster than the MicroSD.  </p>
<p>I wasn't able to find endurance info on the SD card but I know SSDs are often also built for high endurance (like server-usage for 5+ years), which takes away space that could be used for higher capacity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They exist, they're just very expensive. This company makes a 100TB drive. They're aimed at big companies that need to store lots of data. I have 5 slots in my PC, if I had 5 of those I'd have 500T of storage. I've had 5TB of storage for like 5 years and haven't filled it, and I have a lot of games.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>SSD are wrappers of simple Flash memory</p>
<p>MicroSDs are simple Flash memory with nothing else wrapping it</p>
<p>Flash memory itself has a very finite lifespan based on &quot;write/erase cycles&quot; which means every time you write new data, you take away lifetime points.</p>
<p><strong>SSD is a wrapper technology intended specifically to minimize how many low-level write/erase cycles are applied to Flash memory cells by buffering data into SDRAM.</strong> </p>
<p>So SSD has <strong>duplicate memory</strong> which takes up physical space) and it also has a lot of extra logic (more physical space) to even out all the memory cells mapped to addresses so that write/erase cycles more.  This requires having a lookup table which is also a form of (duplicated) memory. </p>
<p>So an SSD has many times <strong>duplicated memory cells for every cell of non-volatile Flash</strong> which each take up space that in a non-SSD like a thumb drive or MicroSD isn't there.  All that extra memory takes up space and reduces how much memory space you can have for the same price of components.</p>
<p>The other advantage of a SSD is by caching to SDRAM also speeds up access to the memory compared to direct writing Flash memory.</p>
<p>How fast does Flash memory directly age out to failure?   Well typically they start to fail at 10\^(5) cycles.  So if your CPU is clocked at 3 GHz (3 x 10\^(9) cycles/second) and if Flash actually ran as fast as SDRAM, you'd age out to FAILURE your Flash memory in less than 1 second.</p>
<p>But thankfully (?), Flash does NOT operate remotely as fast as SDRAM - Flash memory write/erase take 100s of microseconds to 10s of milliseconds.  So only for that reason you don't age out Flash or MicroSDs in just a second.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
