Moderna could set their dose at 30ug (probably even lower) and it would work - they just didn't know that at the time so they wanted to play it safe instead of flopping.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>MRNA chose 100ug based on an early study. Later results showed their lower doses worked fine but the phase 3 was already designed.</p>
<p>MRNA vaccine had more adverse effects than PFE- Id guess because of the higher dose. But apparently thereâ€™s a non linear relationship between your immune response and the initial bolus- at some point it capped out.</p>
<p>Moderna early reports: <a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-positive-interim-phase-1-data-its-mrna-vaccine" target="_blank">https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-positive-interim-phase-1-data-its-mrna-vaccine</a></p>
<p>Edit: interesting pre print <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.06.21253058v2.full.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.06.21253058v2.full.pdf</a></p>
<p>Even 1ug dose x2 of pfe had comparable lab markers of immunity to a single 30ug.. and 10ug x2 was comparable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer. They arnt the same.  </p>
<p>Technical answer. Even though they're both &quot;messenger RNA&quot; vaccines, and this sounds the same its not, there from the same family line, but far enough apart to have noticeable differences, mainly in the delivery system which is a fat which contains the mRNA and is susceptible to temperature. Hence why the Modena vaccine doesnt need super cold storage, the Pfizer does. Modena have (total guess) worked out a way of keeping the fatty substance viable at higher temperatures by changing the quantity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
