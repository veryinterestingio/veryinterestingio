		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hiya! I'm a microbiologist and I love these questions! Many bacteria that cause diseases require an environment similar to their hosts, like nice warm temperatures, stable pH, and many others. Seawater is generally much colder and the salinity is too high for many microbes. So if you have something that causes diseases in humans they are unlikely to survive long in seawater. That's not to say that there are no bacteria in the seas but they're generally concentrated on and around corals, rubbish like plastic bottles and sediments. However these are generally not harmful bacteria and they rarely cause disease unless you get them in a open wound. Also you have a simple food chain underwater as well. Bacteria are eaten by zooplankton which are then eaten by marine animals. That Also the ocean from being overrun by bacteria. Hope this answer helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nothing really. If you have an open wound in ocean water, you'd better clean it out very well to avoid bacterial infections. </p>
<p>But since humans and primates don't normally live in the ocean, there's not a lot of ocean born diseases and viruses adapted to infect us. Plenty of nastiness going around for sea life though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Surviving in salt water isn't that easy for many living organisms that are not adapted to it. However bacterial diseases can spread in the oceans and many marine animals are vulnerable to catching infections spread this way, it is just that they are unlikely to infect humans as we are not part of the bacteria's normal life cycle</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are an enormous number of viruses in a small drop of seawater; there are thoughts they may yet play an unrecognized role in ocean ecosystems.</p>
<p>But to answer your question, the conditions inside of a human body and the conditions of an ocean are quite different in terms of salinity, temperature, pressure, etc. Viruses require living cells to hijack their machinery in order to replicate and there arenâ€™t that many humans floating around in the vastness of the oceans for this to be a concern.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A common trope in science fiction is ancient bacteria, or alien bacteria, or germs from the deep depths of the seas.  But the best way for you to think about the immune system is like security systems.  Every time criminals come up with a way to do something bad or get around the old system, someone thinks up a way to deal with it.</p>
<p>Eventually criminals become hugely specialized and so do security experts.  But its a constant battle.</p>
<p>If you found some ten million year old bacteria it would be as dangerous to us as a guy who used dynamite to open safes would be to a bitcoin exchange.</p>
<p>If you want to rob a bitcoin exchange you need to have evolved in the same system, you need to know what works and what doesn't and spent a huge amount of effort specializing yourself for that job.  </p>
<p>Unless these bacteria are practicing against us they are unlikely to pose any kind of risk to us.  That's why you are OK to go swimming but why Europeans were so deadly to native americans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
