		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mostly because of their ability to bind</p>
<p>Many ingredients can be added to bind but many of those require special considerations</p>
<p>Rouxs and starches need to be cooked and have to be added in carefully as not to clump. Additionally if prepared wrong they will add off tastes or won't work. Starches also don't freeze well either</p>
<p>Additionally other things like gums usually need to be added mechanically with a blender or stirrers to get the full effect.</p>
<p>Eggs don't require much to work, no real prep no special temps. And they're quite good binders too. Each egg yolk can hold up to about 7x it's volume in additional liquid or oil. Eggs are stable, both the whites and the yolks can be used for stabilizing. (Whites not as common because of their low binding abilities)</p>
<p>Also eggs can be eaten by themselves in many different ways so just another plus</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what others have said, eggs are very protein rich. Thus, they have a strong destinctive umami taste that most people find pleasant bevause evolutionary, eating foods with high protein content was a good idea, and that's why we evolved to like that taste (same goes for sugary and fatty foods)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mainly because you can get a relatively low-maintenance animal that regularly pops them out ready to use, in an easily storable protective container, in exchange for some grain and water. </p>
<p>But also because it's a cheap protein source, and as the proteins are in a semi-liquid form and denature into a solid when cooked, you can use that to create a variety of results like mixing into cakes to bind the ingredients together, cook the egg in its shell or outside, blend the yolk and white together or separate them, etc. It's very versatile and comes in a convenient form factor that doesn't go off at room temperature unlike meat or fish or milk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're a fantastic emulsifier, have a relatively neutral flavor, are available year round and in most climates, have a long shelf life even without refrigeration, are a great source of protein and other nutrients.</p>
<p>The near universal and year round availability of eggs is something not to overlook. Other, less widely available emulsifiers are likely to be replaced by eggs in recipes that become more widespread.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the really neat things that eggs do is they act as an emulsifier.</p>
<p>You probably know from science class that water is a polar substance, and oils (like fats) are non-polar. Polar substances don't mix with non-polar substances, which is why if you have water and olive oil in a beaker, the olive oil will float on top of the water.</p>
<p>But eggs are emulsifiers, and what that means is they allow you to mix polar and non-polar substances together. If you're baking and your wet ingredients include polar substances like milk, and non polar ingredients like cooking oil - the egg will allow you to combine those substances.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
