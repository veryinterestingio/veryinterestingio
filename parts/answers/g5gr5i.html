<p>There's also a lot of stuff written on American sign language coming from the French.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if this will answer your question specifically, but there's a book called Everyone Here Spoke Sign Language by Nora Ellen Groce about how the early settlers of Martha's Vineyard carried the recessive gene for hereditary deafness. As a result about 1/4 of the population of the island was deaf, and everyone spoke sign language. Even hearing people found it useful, for example seafarers would sign between their boats via telescope when they were far away to shout. This was before American Sign Language existed, so the Vineyarders developed their own sign language largely in isolation. If I remember correctly (been a while since I read the book) a lot of ASL was highly influenced and/or developed from Vineyard sign.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ASL, BSL, FSL, et al. are very visual languages, and I read your link and think that because it’s so visual there isn’t really any folk etymology. You should read up on ASL development because it’s quite fascinating. Many of the words and structures come from French Sign Language. </p>
<p>Syntax also closely resembles the way Yoda speaks. </p>
<p>I think the closest thing to what you’re referencing is puns. ASL is full of visual puns because of the visual nature of the language. There is pasteurize/past your eyes (milk signed passing in front of the eyes), but it’s a pun that doesn’t seem to quite fit into what you’re looking for. </p>
<p>I doubt that helps but I really hope it actually did lol</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not only is there folk etymology, but there are whole sign languages that are improvised short time period pidgins of sorts, most famously Nicaraguan sign language. There's no way ANYONE knows the actual etymology of like half the signs in NSL in a formal well documented way, so for there not to be huge effects of folk etymology would beggar belief.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
