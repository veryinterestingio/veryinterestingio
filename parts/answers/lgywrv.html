		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The very early findings are treated with skepticism, though not harsh skepticism - The samples are no longer available and so the tests can’t be validated by others. Since that data is wildly out of synch with everything else we know, the general consensus is that it represents a false positive. Some of the more recent dates (December) are more plausible but even there, the sense is that false positives are just as likely as genuine cases being exported that early. </p>
<p>The problem is really that the samples are either not available (all used up in the first testing) or almost all used up, so repeating with different primers etc to confirm can’t be done.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
