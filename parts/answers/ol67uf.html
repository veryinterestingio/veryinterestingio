<li>Very little erosion since it's in a cave.</li>
<li>The use of oxides for painting. For example, the ochre which is one of the most common pigments (in red, browns and yellows) is basically iron oxide. Since it's an oxide it can't oxidize.</li>
<li>No sunlight. Being in a cave the paint isn't exposed to the bleaching effect of the sun (light, and especially UV radiation, will break down most pigmentation bonds over time. For example the US flag on the moon is almost certainly pure white by now).</li>
<li>What little rainwater that seeps down will actually act as a preservative. Travelling through the rock the water will carry with it hydrogen carbonate (HCO3) which leeches off as it travels down the rock wall and forms a protective glaze over the painting and protecting it from future erosion.</li>

<p>How did ancient drawings <strong>in caves</strong> survive thousands of years without wearing away</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a cave, what's going to wear them away? Most weathering processes don't exist in caves (light, wind), that's why they're good dwellings.</p>
<p><strong>More importantly</strong>, there's a huge survivor-bias here. All we have to go on are ones that DID survive. There's no way to know how many more there were that DID wear away completely. Of course there's still some weathering in caves, from water, crumbling walls, moss/mould, maybe animals. But any of the ones that eroded are gone, just like you said! When we find cave drawings that survived 1000s of years, that's the 1% of initial drawings that happened to be in suitably dry, dark, stable caves. The vast majority didn't make it.</p>
<p>It's like how we think &quot;wow old machines really were built to last&quot;. Partially true, but also most machines of the 50's were in landfills by the 60s, and the 50s machines still in use today are the 1% that didn't break, <em>and</em> got super well maintained.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All of the answers so far focus on how caves are protected environments. My answer focuses on something else.</p>
<p>The question you posed already bakes in a bunch of survivorship bias. The ancient drawings <em>we have found</em> were found because, well... they survived.  The more general question might be why do some ancient art survive while others didn't and what blind spots does that create in our understanding of ancient art?</p>
<p>Lots of ancient (using the term loosely to span from prehistory through classical antiquity) art was lost because it was done without durable media (e.g. bright colors on Greek marble busts), were in sites subsequently obscured by natural elements (Maya pyramids, Nazca lines, anything in the Sahara), were destroyed by humans (Tadrart Acacus carvings), or other reasons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
