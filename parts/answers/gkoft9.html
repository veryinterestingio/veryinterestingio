		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The naked eye is very powerful. Especially in low light conditions our eyes are very good at adjusting to it so we can see better. Also when you have the whole sky around the moon itâ€™s hard to realize the actual size and most people overestimate how big it looks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The moon is always approximately the same size to us, but it is a small part of the total night sky. Your mind tends to mute out the uninteresting blank sky and focus more on the moon so it seems more predominant than it actually is. When you take a photo of the moon with your camera, it gets the rest of the night sky in the shot. When you look at your phone's picture, you see the moon, the night sky, the phone, and everything else around your phone to really put the moon to sky ratio to scale. When you're just looking at the moon, there is no other reference point to appreciate how little of the night sky it takes up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is also an interesting optical illusion that goes on with the moon.  When it is closer to the horizon it looks immense but when it reaches its apex in the night sky it appears much smaller.  You can use the quarter trick someone else mentioned to confirm it is indeed the same size.  This happens because when the moon is in the middle of the sky you brain has nothing to compare it to, but when it's near to the horizon you do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
