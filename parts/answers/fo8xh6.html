		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A thin layer of water can <em>very</em> briefly protect you from hot temperatures by absorbing the energy and evaporating before the heat transfer reaches your skin.  For an object with very little residual heat like a candle wick, this is sufficient.</p>
<p>A much more massive metal pan has vastly more heat to give, and the large volume of water only serves to conduct it to your hands more efficiently.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even if they were the same temperature to start with, there's very little hot matter in a candle flame compared to the hot pan. The total amount of energy in a candle flame at any given time is quite low, and the water on your fingers is sufficient to absorb the heat by the time the flame goes out. In contrast, a pan hot out of the oven holds significantly more heat, enough to heat the water in the mitt to sufficient temperature to burn you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I learned a similar lesson after bringing socks to the beach to help walk across the hot sand. I went back to our house at one point and thought it would be “really smart” if I dipped the socks in the cool pool water before heading back on the burning sand to our site. Big mistake.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It takes much longer for the mass of the pan to cool down. The candle flame goes out and the tiny wick is cooled off almost immediately.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
