They have <a href="http://divemagazine.co.uk/images/article-images/travel/Thresher_Sharks_DDS/SEIFERT.ThresherShark_opt1.jpeg" target="_blank">impressively long tails</a> which they use to stun fish.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you mean using a whip of their tail as a defensive mechanism?  </p>
<p>A lot of modern large lizards will do that.  Green Iguanas are well known for it, or as you can see in <a href="https://youtu.be/BZ3C7srOMyc" target="_blank">this example</a> from YouTube, monitor lizards.  </p>
<p>Size limitations keep the speeds much lower than those estimated for dinosaurs, but they are still quite capable of breaking skin, even at their reduced size.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several lizards, especially Iguanas, use their tails in self defense, though I should clarify something. Just because computer models show that some sauropods' tails could have physically moved that fast, performing such a thing would actually hurt the tail, and probably broken bones. More likely their tails would have been used like a bat or club rather than a whip.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not via a tail, but the pistol shrimp has a specialized claw that when it snaps creates a cavitation bubble which moves away from the claw at speeds of 97 km/h (60mph) and generates a sound reaching 218 decibels.</p>
<p>The bubble collapsing also produces light.  Though the light is mostly inconsequential... The shockwave is the important part.</p>
<p>Still, the little dude basically has a lethal flash bang.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
