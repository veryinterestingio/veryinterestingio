		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer is it depends on the size, location, and traits of the parasite.  Our bodies have responses beyond just antibodies, such as inflammation, defecation, digestion, &amp;c.  In most cases antibodies are going to do a better job of preventing secondary infection while our bodies try and sort out how to deal with the parasite issue.  Keep in mind that as humans, we can take medicine, get surgery, use creams, take showers, and things like that, as well.  This is probably our biggest boon.  You asked about helminths; this is a good example of how we use medicine (antihelminthics) to fix our problems.  With some parasites, however, we just don't have any defense.  Take N. fowlerii, for example.  You get those little guys in your brain, you die (about 99% of the time, at least....).  We have treatments, but those mean protists are better at killing us than we are at killing them.  The one-ish percent that do survive have a chance of serious brain damage in place of being dead, which is still a win for the parasites' column and a loss for Team Humans, I'd say.  Moral of the story: wear nose clips when swimming in warm freshwater so you don't accidentally become host to any brain-eaters, and use your unique human ability to drive a car to the hospital for meds if you get worms or whatever.  Try to just....not get these things, though, in the first place.  Eat safe, drink clean, take showers, don't roll around in sewers if it's not your job, those kinds of things.  That's honestly the best defense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One key difference between parasites and bacteria/viruses is size. Parasites tend to be much bigger and so they aren’t transmitted in the air. We get infected with them via contaminated food/water or via bites from host insects. The infrastructure in developed countries does a lot to reduce parasite infections. </p>
<p>One common parasite that exists in the US (where I live, so I’m not as familiar with other countries) is Giardia. It’s picked up by drinking contaminated stream or well water. It usually causes self limited diarrhea in immune competent hosts but can cause much worse disease in immunocompromised people. </p>
<p>There is a disease called X-Linked Agammaglobulinemia where patients are born without the ability to make antibodies. One of the classic infections for this disease is Giardia. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's start by considering the difference between parasite and other organisms which cause disease. The CDC's general information page shares this broad description geared towards human parasites: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/about.html" target="_blank">A parasite is an organism that lives on or in a host organism and gets its food from or at the expense of its host.</a> It's a little confusing though since plenty of bacteria and fungi (and viruses if you think they &quot;eat&quot;) would seem to fit this definition. [Wikipedia provides are better overview.] (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism</a>)</p>
<p>More specifically, parasites are complex, eukaryotic organisms with complex lifecycles which have co-evolved with their hosts. There are three main classes of parasites that can cause disease in humans: protozoa, helminths, and ectoparasites. Ectoparasites have  a very different interaction with the immune system as they do not enter the body, so they won't really pertain to the points which follow. Endoparasite closely evolve with their primary host species and thus each parasite has a different and complex immune interaction. [It's a whole field of study.] (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781118393321" target="_blank">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781118393321</a>) It's far too much for a reddit post, but let's just say parasites do have trouble surviving and the interplay between host and parasite is constant throughout the life of the host and parasite. </p>
<p>As with everything, there may be exceptions, you don't tend to have parasite spillover the way to do for bacteria or viruses. Humans generally do not experience low-level, constant exposure to parasites in the same way they do many viruses, bacteria, or fungi. You do have parasites which are normally cleared in a short window hangout for a longer time and cause severe disease (Giardia, as mentioned, a good example) in immunocompromised individuals.  Parasites which cannot live at all in a healthy human body don't often appear in immunocompromised individuals. This is because most of these parasites are not primarily fended off by the immune system but by limitations of the parasites' physiologies. These organisms cannot enter human tissue or cells.  </p>
<p>[You do see opportunistic infections, including parasitic infections, in immunocompromised individuals.] (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/livingwithhiv/opportunisticinfections.html" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/livingwithhiv/opportunisticinfections.html</a>) However, these infections are generally parasites where healthy human are asymptomatic incidental (dead-end) or reservoir hosts. [A good example is toxoplasmosis which is highly prevalent but mostly asymptomatic.] (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/toxoplasmosis/index.html" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/toxoplasmosis/index.html</a>)</p>
<p>Edit: typos</p>
<p>If you are interested in parasite-immune interactions, I highly recommend a detour into the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17544828/" target="_blank">hygiene hypothesis</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is depends. We have external parasites like flea, ticks, scabies, lice and... We have no defense for this outside of the skin. If they can get through (most can) the body can do absolutely nothing against them. So we try washing them, topical medications and just hope they go away (mosquitoes for example)</p>
<p>Internal parasites we can group into two groups. Multicellular and single cell parasites. Multicellulars parasites are usually the helminths. Worms.</p>
<p>Our body is not very good at dealing with these. With flat worms ( taenia saginata and taenia solium), Enterobius vermicularis (pinworms) and others being really really hard for the body to deal with. Our body uses antibodies (IgE, IgM and IgG) and eosinophils along with inflammation and other responses to flush them out but it rarely works. These helminths are usually found in the intestines.</p>
<p>However some find themselves in other body parts (most arent human parasites and are &quot;lost&quot;. The term is &quot;stranger in a strange land&quot;). Liver and muscles usually. (Echinococcus granulosus in liver and trichinella spiralis in muscles) now these our body can deal with. Macrophages come and create a sort of wall around them. Called a granuloma. These walls stop the worms from spreading and deactivate them. However most of the worms can activate and reproduce again at a moments notice. (Note: this is a very very watered down explanation. Tha actual process is unique to each worm and is very complicated)</p>
<p>Now to single cell parasites. In this category its half and half. Some of these (giardia lamblia or trichomonas vaginalis) our body can deal with and pose no problem. Some (entamoeba hystolitica) our body can deal with but will deal a lot of damage. And some are very very deadly (naegleria fowleri). </p>
<p>To recap: our body is really bad at dealing with parasites.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL:DR Complicated, but generally not very well because they have adapted to evade our immune system.</p>
<p>Vet student here. Parasites are much more common in veterinary medicine than in human.</p>
<p>It depends, but generally, parasites are better than most virus and bacteria at surviving in the body because they have adapted to be that way, in fascinating way sometimes, like tapeworms who don't have a digestive system, and almost everything is reproductive system.</p>
<p>However, as you point out, we have bias, we are accounting for the parasites (the range of animals and protozoans that have adapted to survive to living of from an animal), and disregarding all the other.<br />
Similarly, there are viruses and bacteria that stay in the body that our immune system doesn't work very good against (herpes virus in human, bovine viral diarrhea, <em>Mycoplasma spp</em> in small ruminants, <em>Mycobacterium spp</em> [lepra, tuberculosis], leptospira...)</p>
<p>As for the mechanism they have for surviving, they are quite complicated sometimes, <em>Anisakis spp</em> survives our intestinal tract in L3 form and move through our body, but doesn't evolve to adult because our body isn't exactly the same as a cetacean (their definitive host). </p>
<p>Our immune system can detect that L3, in the conective tissue and send mainly Eosinophiles, but they don't work all that well, so the body encapsulates it in a granuloma, and leaves it there to die. (parasitic granuloma).</p>
<p>As for the ones who are in the digestive tract, well, the best the body can do is send antibodies type IgA, but, they aren't much.</p>
<p>Also, parasites don't usually cause much damage. At least in their hosts. A pig's intestine can be practically chock full of <em>Ascaris suum</em>, and as far as I know, not have much of anything except some weight loss. A dog's heart can be with a lot of <em>Dirophilaria immitis</em>, and be asymptomatic, but a cat's heart can have just one of the same worm and die because of it.</p>
<p>Also, curious fact, there was a paper about a <em>Taenia solium</em> cancer in a inmunocompromised patient. Yes, the cancer was from the Taenia. Strange.<br />
Another curious fact, Trypanosoma can change their outside proteins, so our immune system can't target them effectively.</p>
<p>Inmunocompromised animals are more probable to having parasites, more parasites and symptoms from the parasitation, but I can't really say what would be the exact link. I'd say that it wouldn't kill the early forms or young parasites, and the vaccines I think work towards that goal, but I am not completely sure.</p>
<p>Well, I extended myself a lot, but if anyone has any questions, I'd be happy to answer them. I like parasites</p>
<p>TL:DR Complicated, but generally not very well because they have adapted to evade our immune system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
