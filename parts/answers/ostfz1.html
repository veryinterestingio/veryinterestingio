		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The extensive tooth decay associated with methamphetamine use is caused by a combination of drug-induced psychological changes resulting in long periods of poor oral hygiene, and physiological changes resulting in dry mouth. </p>
<p>In particular, dry mouth allows harmful acids, plaque, and food remnants to build up around the teeth, resulting in tooth decay. These would normally be continuously washed away by saliva, which protects against tooth decay.  </p>
<p>Methamphetamine itself is also acidic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, there‚Äôs more than one thing that leads to the ‚Äúmeth mouth‚Äù.
1) Meth-heads, while they are tweaking out for however long their binges are, don‚Äôt really consider oral hygiene to be a priority. I‚Äôve known meth users to go /weeks or more/ without so much as a quick little gargle.
2) Using methamphetamine causes the mouth to get really dry. And much worse of a dry mouth than weed or really anything you are used to. That dryness makes the climate of your mouth like an acid bath.
3) Also while someone is intoxicated on meth, almost everyone has this intense and uncontrollable urge to grind their teeth/clench their jaws. So just imagine months of that or even years how much strain and erosion that causes to the molars especially.
4) Finally, the last reason is specifically for the meth smokers. Not only does the dry mouth cause an acidic mouth, the vapor that one inhales from a meth pipe is /incredibly/ acidic so all those corrosive chemicals just end up sitting on your teeth that are already bathing in an acid bath.
I know I got into it a little too technical for an answer for a 5 year old‚Ä¶ but I hope at least I helped you understand what goes on at least a little better :) Peace out and stay away from meth especially. I messed around with it for a few years. Luckily I only did it recreationally like 4 or 5 times a year so the effects weren‚Äôt HORRENDOUS; but doing meth is doing meth regardless how you quantify it. Been nearly two years clean from meth tho ü§òüèº</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I‚Äôm 27 days clean in rehab for meth and heroin addiction. Just had my back molar extracted because half of it crumbled at some point last year during one of my runs.</p>
<p>I was an IV methamphetamine user, it‚Äôs mostly the grinding and dry mouth in combination with my immensely poor hygiene and near non existent diet. </p>
<p>Only after I broke my elbow crashing an electric scooter in downtown LA and then infected my eyes out trying to use contacts with broken left arm and no water, did I realize my body was falling apart and in the process of slowly dying.</p>
<p>Crazy thing is that in 2017 I was nominated for an Emmy and lived in the hills. Funny how fast we fall smiling all the way down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All of the above plus meth makes the thought of eating/drinking disgusting. Someone on meth can go for days even a week without eating and sipping the tiniest amounts. That contributes to the dry mouth and the lack of nutrients causes terrible ulcers and sores.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Obligatory not a meth addict.
Diagnosed with ADHD as an adult, started taking meds that are broadly speaking meth. </p>
<p>The dry mouth is real. Also tooth grinding is a thing, that doesn't help. </p>
<p>For me the bigger factor would be the tunnel vision that your newfound focusing superpower brings. </p>
<p>I'd find myself spending literal hours crafting six line emails. Even now I can't explain how. I'd know I wanted some water but wouldn't manage to break the hold of this focus for hours.
It also made me lose my appetite. So you're not motivated to eat properly, when you need calories you just get the easiest quickest fix like candy or chips and then back to the tunnel vision. </p>
<p>I'm talking doses that are way lower than recreational ones, combined with the fact there's plenty of the day where you're not under the influence. You take away those limiting factors and I can see how things could spiral pretty quickly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
