		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, my lab has actually done some research for NASA on this exact topic.  The term for this phenomenon is 'Spaceflight Associated Neuro-Oculuar Syndrome' or SANS.</p>
<p>The general consensus, currently, is that due to being in a microgravity environment, the systems that regulate intercranial pressure don't function normally.  This chronic increase in pressure causes two things - 1) Macular nerve degeneration/damage and 2) Retinal thickening.  We haven't been able to recreate the nerve degeneration, but if we take someone and keep them in a strict 6-degree head-down tilt (IE have your feet a little higher than your head) for 30 days in a mildly hypercapnic (extra CO2) environment, we can reproduce the retinal thickening.  This retinal thickening interferes with the interaction of photons with receptors and thus interferes with the perception of light - AKA vision loss.</p>
<p>In addition to those factors, there may be sleep disruptions associated with spaceflight that are also contributing to retinal thickening and macular nerve degeneration.    We've only shown a relationship to the retinal thickening though.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Here are a couple of abstracts(looking at sleep, and sleep/retinal thickening from the same study) that might help.  <a href="https://digitalcommons.wku.edu/ijesab/vol8/iss6/57/" target="_blank"><a href="https://digitalcommons.wku.edu/ijesab/vol8/iss6/57/" target="_blank">https://digitalcommons.wku.edu/ijesab/vol8/iss6/57/</a></a>   <a href="https://www.fasebj.org/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.2018.32.1_supplement.lb260" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.fasebj.org/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.2018.32.1\_supplement.lb260" target="_blank">https://www.fasebj.org/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.2018.32.1\_supplement.lb260</a></a>  There is also the NASA white paper on SANS: <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20180000936.pdf" target="_blank"><a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20180000936.pdf" target="_blank">https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20180000936.pdf</a></a> (It's a little outdated)</p>

<p>The folks involved in actually writing and submitting the manuscripts have been.... a little busy so IIRC, the manuscript is just now going through review.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chris Hadfield list his vision on a spacewalk because he got something in his eye and, because there is no gravity, his tears started pooling up in and around his eyes/eye sockets. He couldn’t wipe them away because he was on a spacewalk.</p>
<p>Not sure what other cases you’re referring to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
