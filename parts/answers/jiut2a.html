		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Finally my science. I am a hydrographer for NOAA. The question is complicated as it depends on what quality of mapping you are looking for . The goal right now something called seabed 2030.</p>
<p>Checkout the link below for a detailed map and explination.
<a href="https://seabed2030.gebco.net" target="_blank">https://seabed2030.gebco.net</a></p>
<p>&quot; less than 15 percent of ocean depths have been measured directly, and only 50 percent of the worldâ€™s coastal waters (less than 200 m deep) have ever been surveyed.&quot;</p>
<p>The problem is surveying the coast lines takes considerable amount of time. The technology used to map the ocean is multi beam sonar and side scan sonars. These are fancy sonars the produce multiple aonar pings at once over a large swath. Think of mapping the ocean floor as shinning a flashlight on the ground. The closer to the floor you get the smaller your light pattern gets. This is why it is going to take us a considerably long time and effort to map the enite sea floor even to the 2030 standards.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>We dont know all the things that live down there, a lot of species remain to be discovered</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There have been several manned and unmanned descents into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariana_Trench" target="_blank">Marina Trench</a>, the deepest oceanic trench on Earth. The deepest known depth is a little over 10,900 metres&mdash;that's roughly 1100 atmospheres of pressure. The first manned descent was actually as early as 1960, and the latest was just a few months ago.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What do you mean by &quot;exists in the deepest abyss&quot;? As in living creatures? The vast majority of the ocean is nearly a &quot;desert&quot;. Most living organisms tend to congregate around nutrient-rich zones: the surface, reefs, and deep-sea vents. Beyond 200 meters there is simply not enough light for photosynthesis and there is not plant life or phytoplankton, the basis of the oceanic food web.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, there <em>is</em> life everywhere, however the density and complexity drops sharply the further you venture off the continental shelf and into the deep open ocean.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We've mapped all of it but at very low resolution. Which in this case means a resolution of dozens - hundreds of kilometers per pixel.</p>
<p>The deepest abyss, because it's so interesting, is actually very well mapped with a resolution of \~ 100 meters per pixel.</p>
<p>We've only mapped \~20% of the ocean floor at this resolution but that should be close to 100% in the next 10 years thanks to autonomous ships, autonomous underwater vehicles, and the GEBCO Seabed 2030 Project.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
