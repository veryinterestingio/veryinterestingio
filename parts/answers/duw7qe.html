		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nope, you got it right.</p>
<p>If you look at the sky, the moon you see is not actually the moon. Its the light that was reflected from the moon some time ago - 1.12 seconds approximately. Which means if an explosion happened on the moon, you wouldn't see it until 1.12 seconds later.</p>
<p>But moon is close. Other stuff is futher away. Yes, if you were looking at the telescope and saw the Kilanova, that means the light from that had to have reached you already, meaning it happened previously. If the Kilanova is 130 m.l.e. away, then if you JUST saw it right now, that would mean it happened 130 M years ago. If you are seeing it in progress, then it means it could have happened even earlier than that. But never later.</p>
<p>If something happened in that same area now, you wouldn't know about it until 130million years later.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you see anything in space you're seeing it on a time delay.  The light takes a finite amount of time to traverse the distance and reach you.</p>
<p>The sun is on an 8 minute delay.</p>
<p>The galactic core is on a 27,000 year delay.</p>
<p>The Andromeda galaxy is on a 2,500,000 year delay.</p>
<p>Galaxy NGC 4993, the source of a recently detected gamma ray burst and probable neutron star merger, is on a 144,000,000 year delay.</p>
<p>Those neutron stars collided <em>before</em> T-Rex roamed the Earth, and the light has just now arrived.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually, sorta no. Because in those 130 million lightyears the light has taken to reach us, the space between us and the kilonova has been expanding.</p>
<p>Let's start by looking at our Observable Universe. The observable universe is everything you could see from where you are at any given time. The radius of the OU is about 46.5 billion light years, meaning what we can see is observed to be at the furthest 46.5 billion light years from us. However, we estimate the age of the universe to be about 13.772 billion years, give or take about .013 billion. So how can we see anything further than 13.722 billion light years away?</p>
<p>Well when that light was emitted, the object was much closer, and the observable universe much smaller. But space is constantly expanding in all directions simultaneously. Imagine an ant on a rubber line. The ant needs to walk to the other end, which starts about 20 feet away, and moves at one inch per second. But every second, the line increases in length by .01%. Eventually, the ant reaches the other side, but the ants starting position is now much, much farther away.</p>
<p>The kilonova being observed as 130 million lightyears means that once we saw it, that's the distance we calculated between that portion of space and us today. But the time it took to get to us would be slightly shorter. Not nearly as much as the difference between the Age and Edge of the universe, but still a considerable amount of time on a human timescale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would like to add that while you could look at it like something happening 130 million years in the past, that isn't the only way to look at it. Not only is the speed of light the actual speed of light in a vacuum, it's the speed of reality also. It would be just as valid to say that it happened in the instant it was observed because no effect could have reached us before 130 million years, not just the light.
It all depends which reference point you look at the event from.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
