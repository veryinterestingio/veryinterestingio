		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Catnip contains a substance called nepetalactone that interacts with the cat olfactory system. It has been hypothesized that it may be function as a hallucinogen, aphrodisiac, or just feel highly pleasurable, but we don't ultimately know exactly why cats go crazy for it.</p>
<p>Humans have used the plant to treat a variety of conditions, though I am uncertain as to the effectiveness. In general, there may be sedative effects on the nervous system. People have reported feelings of euphoria and visual hallucinations from smoking catnip.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It stimulates the olfactory bulb which send signals to the amygdala and the  hypothalamus. This may explain the euphoric effects of catnip, which would be mediated by the emotional centers in the amygdala. Activation of the hypothalamus can lead to species-specific instinctual behavior, such as feeding or mating.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cats have  certain receptors in their brains that enables them to recept the active compound in catnip called &quot; Nepetalactone  &quot;, and thats what enables them to get &quot;high&quot; from it, when on the other end human brains lack those receptors. some have said through history that catnip got them &quot;high&quot; too, but it was suggested they only felt that because it was a custom for some people to mix catnip with marijuana.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
