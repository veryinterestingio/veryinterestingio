		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythropoiesis" target="_blank">Erythropoiesis</a> is the process by which your body regulates red blood cell production.</p>
<p>If you are low on oxygen in your blood, your kidneys make more erythropoietin. This is the on switch to produce more red blood cells.</p>
<p>There's a physical limit on how much you can make since you need to replace all the red blood cells every 100-120 days as they die off. At maximum production, you could theoretically keep close to double the normal amount of red blood cells if your body constantly thought it was low on oxygen. This can happen to smokers or patients with COPD, although few people have that level of constant stimuli or the nutrient intake to keep production that high.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bone marrow and red blood cell death keep it in homeostasis. Cells throughout the body can detect anemia through decreased oxygen content delivery and tell the bone marrow to increase the blood count which can be seen by an increase in reticulocyte count. Sickle cell patients constantly have to make new blood cells and are chronically anemic due to increased red blood cell turnover therefore their bone marrow is always producing more blood and they typically always have a high reticulocyte count unless something has gone wrong. </p>
<p>Edit: a lot of this is done by the kidney releasing erythropoietin in response to decreases oxygen carrying capacity and delivery.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to point one thing out.</p>
<p>Blood in our body is CONSTANTLY replaced - fluid flows in and out of vessels, cells undergo death or get used up. A typical erythrocytes lives about 100 days, while a leukocyte lives 30 days.</p>
<p>It is consistently replaced. Water is absorbed in the intestines, so it can be urinated out. Proteins are made in the organs and are broken down or used up. Bone marrow grows most of the cells all the time.</p>
<p>In an acute state, those processes will speed up. At first, the heart speeds up and peripheral vessels constrict, to ensure bigger blood flow through central vessels. Then, water goes into blood from the cells and from between them. Meanwhile, the kidneys detect less o2 reaching them and special cells produce erythropoetin. Which gives the marrow a kick, in addition to the usual recovery.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>“Denver” residents (and colorado labs) have different normals than us lowlanders. Their kidneys sense the lower oxygen tension in the arterial blood and make more erythropoietin. Himalayan’s (ie sherpas) and very heavy smokers take these tiny American normal variations to the extreme.  Erythro (red cells) poiesis (to bring something into being that didn’t exist before). Another beautiful example of how the body regulates itself. Too many red cells and the blood gets too viscous to effectively get through the smaller areterioles and capillaries— too little red cell mass and oxygen carrying capacity is jeopardized </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It seems to me that you're asking what stops your body from overproducing red blood cells. Why does it go to a certain limit and then become static.</p>
<p>Like the others have mentioned, part of this regulation is done through erythropoietin. EPO production is activated when your body notices a low blood count (noticable by low oxygen delivery). At baseline you have enough going to maintain about 5 million per microliter. Because RBCs are constantly aging and dying, your body's baseline production is about 2 million per second. When your counts are low, production will go up, then when your counts have returned to &quot;normal&quot; production goes back to baseline. As noted before, your body knows what it's baseline is by it's oxygen delivery. This is why people living in oxygen deprived environments chronically will have a higher baseline.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
