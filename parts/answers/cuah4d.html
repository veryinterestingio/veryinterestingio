		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, kind of. But only after she stops flailing and waits a few seconds.</p>
<p>Rigid objects with no external forces acting on them <del>can</del><em>EDIT: with one notable exception* will inherently</em> only spin about a single axis at a constant speed, so all that appendage-flailing changing her moment of inertia and center of mass has to stop. When she holds still at the end of the scene, her rotation smooths out. They actually did really well simulating the physics in that specific case. <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/9-12/features/F_Human_Vestibular_System_in_Space.html" target="_blank">According to NASA</a> (and my entire aviation career) the vestibular system will actually reach equilibrium with your rotation <em>if it is constant speed</em>, causing the sensation of spinning to disappear after a short time. If she closed her eyes, she would not physiologically experience a spinning sensation except maybe the sunlight shining through her eyelids.</p>
<p>This is a famous concept in aviation which leads to lots of spatial disorientation and occasionally flying a perfectly good airplane <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graveyard_spiral" target="_blank">into the dirt</a>. Essentially your inner ear fluid catches up to your body's spin and stops giving you the &quot;hey you're spinning now&quot; signal, which causes pilots to think they're flying straight and level when they aren't. It's also what causes your eyes to repeatedly track one direction and saccade back when you play dizzy bat (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optokinetic_response" target="_blank">optokinetic nystagmus</a>).</p>
<p>*<strong>Edit part 1...</strong> I was apparently unclear about the one axis thing above for two reasons:</p>
<p>Objects with three distinct principle moments of inertia experience a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_racket_theorem" target="_blank">flipping effect</a> when spun about the intermediate axis, which hypothetically could apply here but does not apply to the general case of rotating objects.</p>
<p>Otherwise rotating rigid objects not subject to external forces experience a resultant rotation which can be described by a single axis. If you disturb this rotation by nudging the object briefly you merely change the orientation of that axis. Things don't rotate simultaneously in two different directions without external forces or mass redistribution. If she keeps her arms and legs still, she will resolve to a single rotational motion and her ears will eventually get accustomed to it. We are assuming she stops flailing and spins smoothly because A) it's the ONLY way she can get rid of the spinning sensation and B) she actually does this in the film.</p>
<p><strong>Edit part 2...</strong> For those asserting that you will still feel a &quot;spinning sensation&quot; due to centrifugal force, not quite, the axis of tensile force in your body (which is centripetal force) is stationary with respect to your body, and would feel like being pulled apart, not spun around.</p>
<p><strong>Edit part 2 episode 2...</strong> If you're going to fight about centrifugal force existing or not, take it somewhere else, we don't have to distinguish frames of reference to discuss literal feelings. You're both <em>not wrong</em>, one is just more convenient given the situation literally being about her rotating frame of reference and how it feels. In this case, centrifugal force existing is convenient.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 3...</strong> ^(HL3 confirmed?) To save a lot of extra reading ^([he says at the end of a several hundred word essay]) -- there's a lot of conflation between the astronaut and a spinning top. This is not a valid comparison, as the top experiences a force from the surface on which it's spinning which is what causes it to precess. Sandra Bullock experiences no such effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think I see what you're getting at. Velocity is relative, and you always feel like you're at rest. You only perceive speed relative to other objects by directly observing them - i.e. you see the fenceposts fly past while you feel like you're staying still in the car.</p>
<p>But this isn't the case if you're spinning. Your body is constantly in acceleration. The net acceleration of your whole body is zero, but the velocities of different parts of your body are constantly changing as you spin around. Your body has inertia and somewhat resists this change, which feels like a centrifugal force stretching your body apart. This is a <em>real</em> effect - your body really does get stretched a bit when you spin it around fast.</p>
<p>When it comes to motion in a straight line, there's no difference between you moving and everything else staying still, and you staying still while everything else moves in the opposite direction. But this isn't the case for spin - everybody will agree that you are indeed the one who is spinning. There is a real, locally observable difference between you spinning, and everything else spinning around you: the centrifugal force will be different. There's also the Coriolis force will can add extra disorientation when you're spinning rapidly.</p>
<p>On a <em>really really big</em> space station, it can be rotating slowly enough that you get a strong centrifugal force with only a weak Coriolis force, and then it's <em>difficult</em> (but not impossible) to tell the difference between rotation and gravity. But if you're just a person spinning around, it will be very noticeable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
