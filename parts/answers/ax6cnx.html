		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Is your claim that population will fall earlier than many forecasters predict based on (a) existing scientific consensus, (b) your own research, or (c) other research that is not the consensus opinion?</p>
<p>If (a), why do you reach a different conclusion from professional population forecasters at, for example, the UN? If (b), did you publish this work as peer-reviewed articles before the mass-market book? How was the reaction to them? If (c), on what issues does the scientific community disagree and why?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Is it the case that population is declining only in &quot;first world countries&quot; while remaining stable, or even growing, in poorer places?</p>
<p>If so, wouldn't the economic problems be solved through migration and adoption of foreign workers?</p>
<p>Or do you honestly see a decline in population in places such as Brazil, Mexico, and India? (sorry, most Catholic/populous places I could think of)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Isn’t this a good thing? Aren’t there WAY too many of us? Over population seems directly linked to most of the environmental challenges we face right?
Every time I’m in traffic I think we are probably due for a plague.
What are some negative aspects of an overall decline in population?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Is this decline everywhere at the same time or will some parts decline while others increase? I believe this could cause more issues especially if the increase is in third world countries. </p>
<p>If this is the case which countries would have the highest decline and which the highest increase? And what is your opinion on its impact on the world?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
