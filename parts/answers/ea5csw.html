		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically because cows are not as good at conserving water as other herbivores. Because their bodies aren’t trying to save water they don’t spend the energy to reabsorb the water in their poop. An herbivore who lives in an environment where water is scarce wants to loose the least amount of water through its poop as possible, so their bodies spend the energy to pull as much water from their poop as possible. Water is not a limiting resource for cows, so their bodies are not adapted to be efficient at saving water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cows have a digestive system heavily optimized for grazing on low-nutritional-value grass.</p>
<p>Your small intestine is 5m, theirs is 40m.  Your stomach is a small bag, theirs is a giant 4-chambered complex organ that they use like a fermentation vat.</p>
<p>Plant matter that passes through this system is thoroughly destroyed and fermented by bacteria into nutrition for the cow.</p>
<p>&quot;Non-ruminant&quot; herbivores that don't use this layout tend to leave more undigested fiber in their poo.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok so there are 2 types of plant eating animal. There are foregut digesters and hindgut digesters. Why are they called this? Because it takes a lot of time to digest plants and nature has evolved two ways of doing this.</p>
<p>Foregut digesters do most of the digesting at the START of the digestive tract. Cows have several stomachs filled with digestive juices that do this BEFORE the food enters the intestine. Ever hear of chewing cud? That's a cow swallowing some grass, then regurgitating it up into its mouth to give it another chew. The idea is it's as mashed up as much as possible. Then digested as much as possible before getting to the intestine where the nutrients are absorbed.</p>
<p>Hindgut digesters do their digesting at the END of the intestine. They normally have a very large appendix filled with digestive juices that digest plant matter. Just like the foregut digesters have in their stomachs. This means that they need to eat more plants. Because they digestion happens at the end, they don't get as much nutrients. So they need to eat more to make up for it. Some hindgut digesters like rabbits will eat their own droppings to give them a second pass.</p>
<p>Because of the different nature of their digesting systems they have very different poop. If you look at horse poop you can actually see the grass blades. Cow poop, not so much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a little different than OP, and doesn't need to be ELI5, but can someone explain why cows poop differ from sheep/goats when all are ruminants then? </p>
<p>They're going to be different than hindgut fermenters which is kinda the root of OPs question, but goat scat versus a cow's are very different even though they're in the same family (Bovidae)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
