		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of answers, not many of them ELI5.</p>
<p>Which is unsurprising. This area of physics is pretty weird if you're not already into it.</p>
<p>In laymen's terms:</p>
<p>Imagine a proton or neutron not as a hard sphere, but more like a little bubble of soup.</p>
<p>In that soup you have the main ingredients and flavours that make up the bulk of the soup, these are called &quot;quarks&quot;. </p>
<p>But in the soup, you also have thickeners and water and so on that make the ingredients stick together, we call that stuff &quot;gluons&quot;.</p>
<p>If you follow a certain recipe, combining the right quarks/ingredients, you make a soup called a proton. A different recipe and you might get a neutron.</p>
<p>Now it doesn't matter what atom you are in and it doesn't matter if the thickeners/gluons change, if you use the same ingredients, you get the same soup - whether it be proton soup or neutron soup.</p>
<p>Now there's another group of particles called &quot;leptons&quot; which include electrons. But to our knowledge, they're not made of anything else. They just exist as their own particles. If you want to torture the metaphor, call them the bread roll next to the soup.</p>
<p>But science is currently wondering if that's all there is - what if there's something that makes up the bread roll, or the potato in the soup. Is there something smaller? How can we find out?</p>
<p>These questions are, as yet, unanswered.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Protons and neutrons are made up of two types of particles called <em>quarks.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>A proton consists of two <em>up quarks</em> and one <em>down quark.</em> Each up quark has a 2/3 positive charge, and each down quark has a 1/3 negative charge, which leaves a proton with 1 positive charge.</li>
<li>A neutron consists of two <em>down quarks</em> and one <em>up quark</em> -- the same math shows that a neutron has zero charge.</li>
</ul>
<p>An electron, by contrast, has 1 negative charge and, so far as we currently know, is not made of anything -- it just is what it is.</p>
<p>These basic building blocks do not differ from atom to atom.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Nope. As somebody famous said, &quot;You see one electron, you've seen 'em all.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are made of even smaller particles. electrons aren’t made of smaller particles but protons and neutrons are. Those are made of quarks. A proton is made of 2 ‘up’ quarks and 1 ‘down’ quark, a neutron is made of 1 ‘up’ quark and 2 ‘down’ quarks. This doesn’t differ between atoms, they are always like this. What’s different is the number of electrons, protons and neutrons. The exact number of these particles is what gives elements their specific characteristics. The more particles neutrons and protons per atom, the heavier the element gets. This loosely correlates with the density of that specific element. </p>
<p>(I’m not sure what ‘up’ and ‘down’ means, I’m not a physicist. I just did a little bit of research and this is what came up. The rest of the provided info is what I’ve learned in school.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's a song by Hank Green that explains it a bit. Link at bottom.</p>
<p>A quark is a fundamental constituent of matter
Observed in 1968 through deep elastic scatter
We found that protons aren't as simple as we thought
We thought they were solid particles but they are not</p>
<p>Protons in fact are made up of three separate pieces
It just gets more confusing as our knowledge increases
But that is what a quark is; It's a piece of a proton
And they also make up other things including the neutron</p>
<p>[Chorus]
Oh, up, down, strange, charm, top, bottom
If you don't know what a quark is, it don't matter you still got 'em
And with leptons and bosons, unless something's amiss
They make up everything that we can see and that we know exists</p>
<p>[Verse 2]
Things made up of quarks including protons and neutrons
Are composite particles that physicists call hadrons
Many types of hadrons are theoretically described
But most exist for only very brief amounts of time</p>
<p>Quarks have electric charge, color charge, mass and spin
And having colour charge means they exist solely inside
Of other kinds of particles and cannot exist alone
Which is why quarks have never been studied on their own</p>
<p>[Chorus]
Up, down, strange, charm, top, bottom
If you don't know what a quark is it don't matter you still got 'em
And with leptons and bosons, unless something's amiss
They make up everything that we can see and that we know exists</p>
<p>[Verse 3]
Quarks can join together in two different ways
Baryons and Mesons, but most instantly decay
If a particle has three quarks, then it's a baryon
And if there's one quark and an anti-quark, then it is a meson
These tiny bits of matter are a part of almost everything
And there is no unified theory to make it less confusing
But the fact that we've identified that they exist at all
Is so god damn remarkable that I just sit in awe</p>
<p>[Chorus]
Oh, up, down, strange charm, top, bottom
If you don't know what a quark is it don't matter you still got 'em
And with leptons and bosons, unless something's amiss
They make up everything that we can see and that we know exists</p>
