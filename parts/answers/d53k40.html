		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don't work as well, but here's how it works:</p>
<p>2-in-1 shampoo/conditioners have silicone (in the form of dimethicone) suspended in a solution that cleans your hair. Also, silicone likes to cling to hair. When you add water, the silicone and the solution separate. The oil in your hair is bound to the shampoo solution (surfactant), whereas the silicone can now cling to the hair. The silicone takes the place of the oil (literally and figuratively), whereas the oil molecules are bound to the surfactant and are now water soluble, meaning they can be washed away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The conditioner part is a silicon product that sticks to the hair more strongly than normal hair oils so it is not washed away by the detergent part. It makes your hair feel silky, but can build up on your hair (as it is not washed away) and hair salons dont reccomend them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
