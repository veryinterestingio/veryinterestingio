Flu shot and whooping cough vaccines provide some protection to the unborn baby for a period of time after birth (e.g. 6 months). That is part of the reason that pregnant women are encouraged to get those two vaccines while pregnant. Not sure about others.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To be a little more specific, the vaccine doesn't pass directly to the baby, like through the placental barrier. The mom gets the vaccine, and the antibodies she develops from having had the vaccine will then pass through the blood supply to the baby, giving the baby some natural defenses. Babies don't have significant immune system responses at birth, so those defenses aren't long-lasting, and babies are scheduled for their own vaccines a few weeks after birth, once their systems are strong enough to handle receiving the vaccines and their systems are prepared to replicate antibodies of their own.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There are 2 different components to the answer here.  First, when you vaccinate a person they make antibodies.  The best protective antibody is IgG, which is actively transported across the placenta into the baby during the third trimester.  So a baby is born with his mother's IgG in their blood.  IgG has a half life of about a month, so for the first couple of months the baby has mom's antibodies in their blood protecting them, but this is temporary immunity.</p>
<p>The second component is that the antigens that you vaccinate with may go across the placenta as well.  If antigens go across into the fetus, the fetus may develop its own immune reaction to these vaccine proteins.  In that case, the fetus may develop an immune response, including producing its own antibodies just like his mother is producing antibodies.  This can produce long term immunity just like any vaccine can produce.</p>
<p>Colostrum is a very, very minor component here.  Antibodies are proteins, when you eat a protein you digest it into amino acids.  IgA in colostrum provides at best a minor immune component.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Whilst the child is still in the womb, yes. The mother's antibodies provide immunity to both the mother and baby. Depending on the size of the virus the mother can be infected but the child can be fine too.
Once delivered it takes time for the baby's own immune system to adapt, but it isn't guaranteed to have immunity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to the correct answers that have already been said:</p>
<p>Yes that baby will often be temporarily immune because of the antibodies that the mother made. However the mother’s immune system will remember the vaccine and be immune for a long time or maybe forever. The baby’s will not and the immunity will fade, which is why we give children so many vaccinations in their first few years of life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
