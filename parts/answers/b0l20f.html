		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It seems that a natural, sustainable way to potentially restart a planetary dynamo would be to place a relatively heavy moon in orbit around it that could exert enough tidal force on the planet to heat the core further, and induce convection, thus kickstarting a magnetic field.    Ceres seems too small unless it orbited Mars very closely to accomplish this, however perhaps a body the size of Triton?     </p>
<p>To the maths!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sure. Just build a load of electromagnets on the surface and there you go.</p>
<p>It's probably not worth it though. If we ever develop the means to give Mars a dense atmosphere over, say, less than a century then keeping it &quot;topped up&quot; against the solar wind's erosion is no problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mars is not thought to have a fully solidified core. It is just that it is stably stratified to convection (there is debate as to how). There is a theory that the Martian dynamo may turn back on (basically this assumes that there is a small temperature gradient through the core but as the surface cools this gradient increases thus becoming unstable to convection). So it is possible we dont need to do anything other than wait and Mars will get a magnetic field again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably not, but it wouldn't be necessary anyway. If we terraformed Mars, its atmosphere would last at least a hundred million years, so there's no danger of it losing its atmosphere on any time scale that we care about. Also, while a magnetic field might reduce atmosphere loss due to sputtering, there's reason to believe that loss is negligible. Even if Mars had a magnetic field like Earth's, it would lose atmosphere nearly as fast as it does now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We find that the solar wind is not a strong driver for the rate of atmospheric ion escape, which is rather driven by solar ionizing radiation. Adding up the estimated ion escape rate over 4 billion years, accounting for the stronger solar wind and solar radiation from the younger Sun, we find that at most roughly 9Â mbar surface pressure has been removed by the solar wind through ion escape. This amount is alone too small to explain the removal of the early Martian atmosphere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mars lost its atmosphere (again, over hundreds of millions of years) mostly because it has much less gravity than Earth. There's nothing we can do about its mass.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
