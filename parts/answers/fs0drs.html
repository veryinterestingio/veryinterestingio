		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The classic examples are spumaviruses (“Foamy Viruses”), members of the retrovirus family that are widespread among animals (though there doesn’t seem to be a true human version). The most studied (though “most” is relative, since these don’t seem to cause any disease there’s limited interest in them) are simian spumaviruses, since these occasionally infect humans - still, apparently, with no symptoms at all. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>FV [foamy virus] is considered non-pathogenic in natural and experimental hosts but systematic, longitudinal studies have not been conducted to verify the apparent non-pathogenicity. Humans can be zoonotically infected with a variety of SFVs originating from Old World monkeys and apes (OWMA) through occupational and natural exposures but demonstrate an apparently asymptomatic though persistent infection</p>

<p>The reason these viruses seem to be so harmless is that they infect cells that are about to be shed anyway, so they don’t end up significantly changing the natural biology. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>While FVs share many features with pathogenic retroviruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus, FV infections of their primate hosts have no apparent pathological consequences. ... We show that superficial differentiated epithelial cells of the oral mucosa, many of which appear to be shedding from the tissue, are the major cell type in which SFV replicates. Thus, the innocuous nature of SFV infection can be explained by replication that is limited to differentiated superficial cells that are short-lived and shed into saliva. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, for example many strains of HPV go unnoticed in humans. Some cause noticeable warts and some cause cancer but only in some, not all people.</p>
<p>Same goes for Herpesviruses. They can remain latent in nerve cells indefinitely and only become active/cause ill effects in some people while others can remain completely asymptomatic. Chickenpox (a type of herpesvirus) can remain latent for decades before resurging as shingles, or remain latent forever. </p>
<p>There are many other viruses like this too. Different host animals can be asymptomatic with different viruses. Bats are notorious for asymptomatically carrying viruses and infecting other bats and sometimes other animals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You’ve also essentially just hit on the main premise of zoonotic transfer of a virus. Typically reservoir host species are asymptomatic or have a mild form of a disease. This way the virus has somewhere to live indefinitely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
