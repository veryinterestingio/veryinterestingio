		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Underwater tunnels, to my understanding, there's a trench dug first, then the tunnel is dropped in in segments, and connected together through underwater welders and other such forms and then sealed. The water then gets pumped out and it all gets cleaned up. Mountains it's basically a giant drill that gets driven through the mountain making a tunnel then people build the walls and what not to keep it from caving in. That or it's built, placed, and then earth gets moved on top of the tunnel but that's generally not done for an actual mountain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We build the tunnel above water and then sink it. We build tunnels through mountains by using special equipment and explosives in a controlled way, making sure to support the mountain above and around us so it doesn’t collapse on us midway through.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s lots of different types of tunnels. The only one I have experience with is HDD (horizontal directional drilling) for underground pipelines. These are commonly used to go under water bodies. </p>
<p>As for larger tunnels such as through a mountain for driving they use TBMs (tunnel boring machines). These are truly amazing in my opinion and are obviously freaking huge. It would have been so fun to engineer this.</p>
