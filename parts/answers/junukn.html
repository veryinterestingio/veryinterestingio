		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short, simple answer. They have a bunch of huge warehouses that look like <a href="https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/blogs/wiredenterprise/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ff_googleinfrastructure2_large.jpg" target="_blank">this.</a> Each data center can hold 100's of millions of gigabytes of data. The largest data centers in the world can hold around 1.5 billion gigabytes.</p>
<p>To put it scientifically, they have several metric fucktons of storage capacity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Data storage is not nearly as expensive on a per-gigabyte basis as you might think. Technology is continually driving down the size and cost of mass storage. Companies like YouTube maintain massive data centers for their media storage. Those data centers are frequently upgraded and expanded as new technology becomes available.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What's really going to blow your mind is when you think about how much storage capacity Alphabet owns for all their properties like YouTube, Google, Gmail, Google cloud, AdSense, Hangouts, Google Maps, Google Earth, Google drive, Google Translate, Google Wallet, Google Play, Picasa, Nest, Waze, Google Images, Google Voice, DeepMind, Google Analytics, etc, etc, the list goes on and on... It's unimaginable how much storage capacity they own. I'm curious if there's an official number.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Compression, compression, compression.</strong></p>
<p>Like some other people said below, storage is relatively cheap on such a massive scale, but the real key is making each video take up the least amount of space possible. YouTube has many specialized engineers who spend tons of time perfecting their proprietary compression algorithm.</p>
<p>It is very good, and leaves very few compression artifacts while cutting the size of videos by as much as an order of magnitude or more. I would suggest you watch <a href="https://youtu.be/JR4KHfqw-oE" target="_blank">this video</a> by MKBHD that explores what happens to a video when you upload it 1000 times over through YouTubeâ€™s compression.</p>
<p>Edit: to answer your second question, improvements in compression are almost certainly the route that advancements in data storage will take. As of right now, we sit on the cusp of an exciting new age for compression. AI and neural networks will vastly improve modern algorithmic compression and will be integral towards serving our increasing need for data.</p>
<p>The premise for this is far too complicated to be reasonably explained in a single Reddit comment, but <a href="https://youtu.be/MjViy6kyiqs" target="_blank">this video</a> by Nvidia helps show the potential of AI in video manipulation. Much of this same technology can be applied to compression and lead to new nearly lossless compression techniques.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
