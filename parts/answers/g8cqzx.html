		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can answer this for protected video playback (like Netflix) in the Edge browser on Windows. It's actually part of my day job, I work on the team that makes the video rendering pipeline for the Edge browser.</p>
<p>Lots of people are mentioning events that notify the browser so it can hide the content or saying that DRM prevents you from capturing it, but that is not actually what is at play here! </p>
<p>The images that make up your video are just travelling down a different &quot;pipe&quot; than the one that the screenshotting software is looking at. </p>
<p>It might seem odd, but the screenshot isn't actually taken from your screen. The image is captured earlier in the process, before all the different &quot;pipes&quot; containing image data have converged. In the Netflix case, the video is sent to the screen via Direct Composition (DCOMP). The way this works is that we define an area of the screen where the video should be shown and we put nothing there, this is why it shows up as black in your screenshot. Then we tell your GPU exactly where this blank area is, and give it the video data so that it can put the video on your screen directly.</p>
<p>This process skips sending the images to the OS's compositor (the thing that stitches all the images from the different pipes together), which is where the screenshotting software is getting it's image from. This gives us some other benefits besides preventing easy recording of protected content, like significantly increased battery life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think other posters may have missed the question in 'How' do they do it, not why, I'm going to try and explain in terms of iPhones (this is my first ELI5 answer!)</p>
<p>When you take a screenshot pressing the button tells the app you have open that the user has just hit the screenshot combo of buttons, most apps ignore this but others either record it or even further then throw up something else for the phone to capture.</p>
<p>iOS uses something called views (I'm not an expert, only started learning last week!) which presents the information to you on the screen, when you hit the screenshot button something called <strong>.UIApplicationUserDidTakeScreenshot</strong> is passed to the app, the app can then use that notification to temporarily show the user a different (blank) view for the screenshot, before continuing on as normal.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>There is probably other calls like this on other platforms like Windows, Android etc</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you develop and app whatever tools you decide to use to develop it you're bounded to use the provided features an OS provides. One of the features you get access when you develop an app is &quot;events&quot; which occur while an user is using your app. These are &quot;Oh, user clicked <this button>&quot;, or &quot;User just <typed this>&quot;. One of those events is &quot;User just took screenshot&quot;. When that happens you as a coder/developer can decide in your code what to do. You can leave the default behavior which would be taking the screenshot, or decide to do something else. Many apps, especially apps that manage important data such as banking apps (also intellectual property apps such as Netflix) disable screenshots in order to secure the data they use within their apps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
