		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Nintendo 3DS relied on something called a <em>parallax barrier</em> to achieve its 3D effect.</p>
<p>Simply put, the 3DS' top screen is sliced into many columns, each one alternating between displaying an image for your left eye and an image for your right. In front of the screen is a physical barrier that, when the 3D slider is slid up, blocks the columns in such a way that each of your eyes sees a different set of columns, thereby producing a 3D image.</p>
<p>The upper image <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Parallax_barrier_vs_lenticular_screen.svg" target="_blank">here</a> provides an idea of how it works.</p>
<p>This is why you had to keep the device just so in front of your head, otherwise the effect would be lost.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For those who are unaware, there are even phones that have 3D cameras and 3D screens. I don't know of any new phones that do this, but six or seven years ago I had a phone called an Evo 3D. the 3-D effect work very well with the camera and the pictures look very good on the screen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what I've read now, The Nintendo 3DS' top screen utilizes a filter called a &quot;parallax barrier.&quot; One of the images necessary for seeing 3D is projected to the right and the other image to the left. The images occupy alternating vertical columns of pixels and are filtered through the parallax barrier.</p>
<p>The barrier acts as a vent to project the images and ensure they hit your eyes at the necessary angles to produce the desired 3D effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
