<p>Ants communicate and navigate by touch and smell, they’re small and nearly blind.  They live in a simple and blurry world.</p>
<p>You’re a million times their size, taller in comparison than our largest skyscrapers.</p>
<p>Imagine if you were blind and deaf and Godzilla was stomping around somewhere.  Would you even know?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because we are too large for them to perceive as anything other than landscape. To an ant? An entire human being is like an unmovable mountain. They only get scared when we move. Which makes sense because if I was climbing an actual mountain trying to scavenge for food and it suddenly started moving?</p>
<p>I would be horrified.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ol>
<li>Ants are incapable of fear of anything. They don't have emotions. </li>
<li>They can't think ahead or imagine or predict anything. Those things require much more brain (specifically a frontal cortex) than ants have. So what you're &quot;about to&quot; do is beyond anything an ant would consider. If they saw you with a can of RAID**, they'd think &quot;cylinder&quot;. Not &quot;that is a container of poison and I'm in danger of it being used on me in the near future&quot;. They can't think like that.</li>
<li>**They can't even see you, or the RAID. We're so big we're not even detectable to their senses. They can't see thousands body lengths up to our face or the can of RAID we're holding, they're nearly blind.</li>
</ol>
<p>TLDR: Ants aren't even aware of you, and if they were they're too simple to understand the threat anyway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ants, specifically, are hive creatures. They live and die for the hive. Only the survival of the hive matters. That doesn't mean they're suicidal, but that they defend to the hive to death and nothing else matters. They don't 'think' about it though; if our brains are computers, theirs are 4-function calculators, and they operate on much more of an instinctual level.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
