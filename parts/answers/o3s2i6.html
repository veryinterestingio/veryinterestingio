		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They can. But only at very specific spots and, since your ears capture sound over an area, they can't completely make you not hear it.</p>
<p>If you have a pure sine wave signal (a pure tone) and broadcast the exact opposite, you will indeed cancel to exactly zero wherever the loudness (amplitude) and alignement (phase) of the reversed wave exactly opposes the incoming wave. Assuming that the cancelling signal is louder than the incoming signal, this will always happen *somewhere*. But it'll be a very small region.</p>
<p>Your eardrum is a whole area so you can't cancel the incoming signal across your whole ear, so some will get through, so you'll always hear some of it.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the great explanations already shared, when you hear a sine wave you’re hearing the wave, plus all the slight echos from the environment. Your brain does a remarkable job cleaning it all up for you, while using those echoes and the folds of your ears to interpret the direction the sound might be coming from. (As an aside, consider this: with both ears you can imagine how your brain could figure out where something is on the horizontal axis, based on comparing the left and right input. But your brain is also able to guess approximately where on the vertical axis a sound is coming from. With your eyes closed, if there is a click straight ahead of you, you can tell if it’s up high or down low.)</p>
<p>So, what hits your eardrum is never a simple sine wave. The simple sine wave can be canceled but you still hear all the slight echoes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because there is always some small distance  between where the outside sound is sensed by some sort of microphone and where it needs to be cancelled, ie at the entrance to your ear canal. That introduces a small time discrepancy. The effect of that varies with frequency of the sound in relation to the length if time for one cycle of the sine wave.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because they're using miniaturized components manufactured to a specific cost and not lab-grade equipment in a tightly controlled environment.</p>
<p>What they can do is pretty amazing but all of the variables they cannot control makes the situation difficult. Noise bleed via physical transmission(making the headphones vibrate or noise passing through the headphones), air leaks between your ears and the headphones, physical conduction of sound (feeling the sound due to the pressure waves). They're also extremely limited in amplification and to offset a sound you have to produce the opposite off that wave in frequency(pitch) as well as amplitude(volume). If it's not the same amplitude, you'll simply get an attenuation (lower volume)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To completely cancel the sound the reversal would have to be instantaneous, but there is a finite but non-zero lag between the sound being picked up on a microphone and when it goes through the circuits reversed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
