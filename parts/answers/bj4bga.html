<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown" target="_blank">Wiki</a> According to public opinion surveys in Europe and the United States, brown is the least favorite color of the public; the color is most often associated with plainness, the rustic and poverty.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ol>
<li>Brown is not a &quot;pretty colour&quot; in many peoples eyes.</li>
<li>Brown isn't a very visible colour. Regardless of paper colour it's not going to stand out very well. Blue&amp;black have the advantage that they have a very nice contrast to the white-&gt;beige paper. However, this ability of brown to blend into the paper can be an advantage. Famously Leonardo da Vinci did all his sketches in Sepia (a dark brown) ink.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every fountain pen ink company makes a chocolate or coffee named brown ink.  It's not as popular as burgundy or teal colors, but it's readily available.</p>
<p>Stick pens have narrower choices, black blue and red are the big dogs.  Brown is a fancy color, [available in gel pens](<a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Pentel-EnerGel-Deluxe-Liquid-Refills/dp/B0713QTMMP/" target="_blank">https://smile.amazon.com/Pentel-EnerGel-Deluxe-Liquid-Refills/dp/B0713QTMMP/</a> ) like many others.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is a common colour thus a smudge/stain of the same colour as the ink may render some markings unreadable/ incomprehensible. There are a lot of brown ink pens out there. Just not as common as there are blue and black.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have plenty of brown, sepia, and sanguine pens and prefer them for artistic works over black any day.  I know that blue ink is popular for writing because it is easily legible but will show up more easily as an authentic signature on documents (or notes, edits, etc). Black is a more popular neutral than brown, so I guess companies that produce black pens already just stick with that, plus blue and red. I love browns but definitely realize that this seems to be a minority opinion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
