		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The muscle inflammation and pain is a result of white blood cells that normally repair the muscle damage being diverted to fight the infection elsewhere in your body.</p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/muscle-pain/basics/causes/sym-20050866" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/muscle-pain/basics/causes/sym-20050866" target="_blank">https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/muscle-pain/basics/causes/sym-20050866</a></a></p>
<p>Now like you’re five:  your blood contains helpers that repair cells and fights off intruders (like ninjas).  When they are off fighting the ninjas (like an infection), they can’t do their day job of repairing your other cells.  This can can cause your muscles to ache.  Don’t worry, they’ll get back to work when the battle is done.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its actually the Immune system causes the pain, not the flu itself.  As your body wages war on the virus, it sends a ton of white blood cells, and anti bodies throughout your body.  As they kill the virus they leave behind a protein called interleukin-6, which causes inflammation, and the inflammation is what your experiencing.   That protien is practically everywhere when you have the flu or cold.  Its always good to keep hydrated, and relax yourself, to help alleviate the issue, but little you can do to prevent it entirely once you have a cold/flu.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally you will more likely get muscle aches with a systemic infection, like influenza, instead of with an upper respiratory tract infection like a cold.</p>
<p>However, the aches in your muscles (&quot;myalgias&quot;) are from your body's inflammatory response to the virus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I asked my doctor that exact same question recently.  He said it was because the immune system causes inflammation.  And when we have something attacking our body, like being sick, our immune system starts working all over the body, causing inflammation all over the body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a side note. I would like to add that is has also be suggested that the body does the muscle ache thing to itself to stop you from moving to much and expending energy needlessly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
