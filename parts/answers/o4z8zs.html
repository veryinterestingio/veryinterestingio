		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I grew up in a village (UK) entirely owned by the Lady at the mansion/estate. There are many villages owned by the Crown and lord/ladies in the UK. Where we lived some of the houses were what's known as &quot;tied housing&quot; which basically means you live in the house as long as you work there and get paid on top, it can be a good deal but can also mean if you lose your job you are homeless. Dunno if the regulations have changed since I was a child from this. Also all the farmers and other people that lived there were tenants so paid rent to the estate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>3 things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There are towns, adjacent to large industrial or agricultural concerns  where most things (shops, schools, rentals, the mill/farms/plants) are owned by a single entity. These are exceedingly rare things in the US and even worldwide today vs. 100 years ago.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even in &quot;normal&quot; towns a significant portion (say many of the rental properties and a strip mall) could be owned by a single entity. This is probably the most common thing but you aren't really buying everything, just the ownership of a few key things. </p>
</li>
<li>&quot;Buying the town&quot; a la Schitts Creek is more a creature of fiction.</li>
