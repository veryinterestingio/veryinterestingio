		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of things we eat will form orderly crystals if you purify them and then allow them to condense.  Sugar crystals are probably the most common of the bunch.</p>
<p>If you’re asking specifically about ionic compounds, the relative abundance of sodium chloride on Earth has led to these ions both being incorporated into our biochemistry.  You need salt, and have evolved to like the taste - within reason.</p>
<p>There are other ions that we process out of our food too, but most of them don’t taste great on their own.  We’re specifically drawn to sodium chloride because it’s difficult to find on land - saltwater fish aren’t nearly as interested in salty food.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Salt is essential for our cells to function and also widely available. So people realized from pre-history that if you didn’t have enough salt in your (and animal) food, you started experiencing health issues, and they figured out ways of getting it (mostly by evaporating sea water, later mining the deposits), and it became the basic food additive. I’m sure there are other minerals that are water soluble that taste good (for example KCl) but they are not essential so the use must not have been so widespread.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Surely there are, but salt wasn't just a thing where it happened to taste good. It's important for our body to function, so we(and I'm assuming other animals) evolved to think it tastes good, because it's fulfilling a biological need for us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
