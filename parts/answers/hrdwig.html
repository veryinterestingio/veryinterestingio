		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So when you exercise right, your blood vessels expand to allow more blood to flow to areas of need. This is called vasodilation. It’s like having a fire hydrant with many valves that allow water to go in any direction without much resistance which is what happens during exercise. Your blood vessels open up to allow the extra blood being pumped to the muscles to flow to provide the adequate nutrients and oxygen while carrying away waste. In hypertension, the heart is pumping harder against normal vessel tension but the vessels are not dilated and that cause trauma to the vessel walls over time. Radius is the most important variable when it comes to flow. It’s like having 10 drains to a sink vs 1 drain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other commenters are right that the length of time matters here. People who have chronically high blood pressure typically have it all or most of the time. This puts excess pressure on delicate blood vessels in important organs like the eyes and the kidneys, can lead to clots, and puts undue stress on the heart. In the short-term like during a few minutes to a few hours of exercise, most of these effects are minimal. </p>
<p>Additionally, the high heart rate and high blood pressure you experience during exercise is a trade off that will ultimately benefit your cardiovascular health over time. Exercise strengthens the heart, making it more efficient. When your heart is stronger, your heart rate and blood pressure <em>go down</em> because your heart doesn't have to beat as fast or as hard to provide adequate blood flow to the rest of the body. There are <a href="http://www.worldrecordacademy.com/medical/slowest_heart_rate_Daniel_Green_breaks_Guinness_World_Records_record_214157.html" target="_blank">reports of some people whose resting heart rates are as low as 26 bpm</a> from years of intense physical training. Short-term struggle reaps long-term benefit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Cholestrol is like trash on highway . Blood cannot flow easily . Taking care of cholesterol removes trash from highway . </p>
<p>Excersing will widen the highway , so more blood traffic can move. </p>
<p>Taking care of cholesterol and exercising means having a  8 lane highway with no trash or obstacles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The same reason lifting weights for 1-2 hours 3 days a week makes you healthier and stronger, but working 12 hour shifts working in a warehouse lifting boxes will lead to back pain and carpel tunnel Syndrome. Your body can easily handle temporary increase in stimulation. Long term, constant stimulation doesn't give the body time to adapt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
