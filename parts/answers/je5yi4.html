		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;We&quot; don't overpay.  Some people overpay, some people underpay, and some people get it nearly exactly right.</p>
<p>As for why we file a tax return, it's because taxes are complicated, and can vary based on lots of different scenarios.  For instance, if you work two part-time jobs, neither of them will know about the other, and each of them will (by default) deduct taxes from your paycheck based on the  assumption that they are your only source of income.</p>
<p>Or maybe you make a lot of charitable donations that slightly lowers your tax burden.  Or you're getting a tax credit because you installed solar panels on your roof.  Or you earned money from stock investments or rental properties.  Or you got a tax break for being a student.  Or you're deducting the interest payments on your mortgage from your taxable income.</p>
<p>Since your taxes are deducted by your employer per-paycheck, there's no way they'd have access to all that extra information.</p>
<p>So you fill out a form W-4 with each employer to <em>estimate</em> your tax burden, and then you square up with the government using all of the relevant information once per year.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Due to factors like tax deductions and people working multiple jobs its difficult to identify exactly how much in taxes you owe.</p>
<p>Income/Payroll taxes are taken directly off your paycheck but if you work multiple jobs it's possible to change which tax bracket you are in which affects how much you need to pay.</p>
<p>You can discus this with your employer and adjust it accordingly, but most people prefer to get there tax returns as a lump sump once a year. Many people actually opt to pay more tax on their paychecks to avoid getting an unexpected bill at tax time. A lump sum return is better than having to write a cheque.</p>
<p>Deductions also need to be factored in, like medical expenses etc. These are not automatically given the government in most cases so they have to be reported.</p>
<p>This gets increasingly complicated the more revenue sources you have. So people that own property, businesses, etc often need to hire accountants just to sort this out. At that level tax deductions get very complex as well and corporations in particular have tons of loopholes that they can exploit.</p>
<p>Another thing to note is that it is well within the Governments ability to automate much of this, but they don't. Companies like TurboTax actively lobby the Government to prevent this from happening because it would destroy their business.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
