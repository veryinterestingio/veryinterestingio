		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You'll often see a cut to the baby crying, then back to the main actor, with the sound of the baby through the scene. This is &quot;movie magic&quot;.</p>
<p>Many actors love working with kids and most of the time it's them doing the scene, but they might use a double to get an over-the-shoulder shot when looking at the kid. It can take a lot of time, and a lot of patience, to get what you want.</p>
<p>Sometimes, babies or animals just do what you want them to do, or even better. It's really cool when that happens and everyone is just hoping &quot;Damn, I hope we got that&quot;.</p>
<p>Also, there is <em>always</em> a parent on set, and besides laws which are very strict about child actors, the parent is who decides what is mistreatment for the child. The parent knows the kid really well, and can probably get the kid to cry at any point desired. Kids are treated well. Considering they spend a lot of time crying in general, it's not mistreatment to film it. (The very rare babies who don't cry won't be cast if the part requires crying.)</p>
<p>(I've crewed several movies with kids, and even more with animals. It takes a ton of patience.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Put some Cheerios in the wrong color bowl. Drop their favorite stuffed animal on the floor. Cook their egg exactly the same way as yesterday. Cut their sandwich into squares instead of triangles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
