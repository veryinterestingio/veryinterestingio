		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>its a sequence that starts with 0, 1 and then each number is an addition of the previous term. 0,1, 1,2,3,5,8,13 etc.</p>
<p>It's important for a few reasons. </p>
<p>1 - it happens to show up in nature frequently with flowers.</p>
<p>2 - it is relevant to calculating phi, the golden ratio. This ratio is known to be aesthetically pleasing and shows up frequently in architecture. There's not a lot of science to back this but its commonly agreed.</p>
<p>3 - it appears in spirals and you can find youtube videos of fibonacci spirals</p>
<p>4 - and probably most important, its useful in computer science as a teaching point. it teaches recursion and memoization which are very important computer coding techniques.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<blockquote>
<p>Fibonacci Foolishness.</p>
<p>A search of the internet, or your local library, will convince you that the Fibonacci series has attracted a lunatic fringe of Fibonacci fanatics who look for mysticism in numbers and in nature. You will find fantastic claims:</p>
<p>The &quot;golden rectangle&quot; is the &quot;most beautiful&quot; rectangle, and was deliberately used by artists in arranging picture elements within their paintings. (You'd think that they'd always use golden rectangle frames, but they didn't.)</p>
<p>The patterns based on the Fibonacci numbers, the golden ratio and the golden rectangle are those most pleasing to human perception.</p>
<p>Mozart used φ in composing music. (He liked number games, but there's no good evidence that he ever deliberately used φ in a musical composition.)</p>
<p>The Fibonacci sequence is seen in nature, in the arrangement of leaves on a stem of plants, in the pattern of sunflower seeds, spirals of snail's shells, in the number of petals of flowers, in the periods of planets of the solar system, and even in stock market cycles. So pervasive is the sequence in nature (according to these folks) that one begins to suspect that the series has the remarkable ability to be &quot;fit&quot; to most anything!</p>
<p>Nature's processes are &quot;governed&quot; by the golden ratio. Some sources even say that nature's processes are &quot;explained&quot; by this ratio.
Of course much of this is patently nonsense. Mathematics doesn't &quot;explain&quot; anything in nature, but mathematical models are very powerful for describing patterns and laws found in nature.</p>
<p>I think it's safe to say that the Fibonacci sequence, golden mean, and golden rectangle have never, not even once, directly led to the discovery of a fundamental law of nature. When we see a neat numeric or geometric pattern in nature, we realize we must dig deeper to find the underlying reason why these patterns arise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So maybe it's just a neat sequence with some interesting properties.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Fibonacci sequence is a string of numbers where the previous two numbers are added together to generate the next (as follows):</p>
<p>1, 2, 1+2 = 3</p>
<p>Now we have 1, 2, 3 2+3 = 5</p>
<p>1,2,3,5 3+5 = 8</p>
<p>1,2,3,5,8 5+8 = 13</p>
<p>1,2,3,5,8,13 8+13 = 21</p>
<p>This continues on forever.</p>
<p>The reason the sequence is special is that many things in nature like growth patterns, waves, and other natural forces or processes follow this sequence. We do not know why, but our best guess is that the sequence is the numerical representation of the &quot;path of least resistance&quot; or the most energy economic path of growth. </p>
<p>There are a lot more complicated and mind blowing facets of the sequence that a maths person could clue you in on. I am not a maths person.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
