		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think about it on a small scale, you have a ton of DNA floating around you with a bunch of enzymes mixed in. They will cut anything they have specificity for, and it will happen. Some of the DNA will be cut once, some twice, etc.. all of these fragments would appear in separate bands through electrophoresis. But, assuming a good mixture and perfect reaction, all sites would be cut. Either way, through electrophoresis the size of the fragments can be calculated.</p>
<p>Tl;Dr It's important, for me at least, to visualize the mixture (it's all a crazy busy mess at a small scale)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both sites. I can attest to that because I have designed a plasmid specifically to do that. Basically I've inserted a short sequence about 30 bp long into the MCS flanked by 2 identical restriction sites, so that they can both be cut on 1 strand by the same nicking restriction enzyme. The enzymes are extremely efficient, as with all engineered restriction enzyme, so it will be almost impossible to select (if you only wish to cut at 1) which site to be cut.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If it can bind the restriction site, it can cut - doesn't matter if there is one or ten, though time would be a factor. If you work with circular plasmid DNA, then it is pretty important to ensure there are no unexpected restriction sites in the sequence or it may end up destroying the DNA with several cuts instead of linearizing it with a single cut.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both sites. Unless the enzyme is not very efficient under those conditions/low concentration/very short time frame, then youâ€™ll get a mix of some uncut plasmids, some with a single cut, and some with both sites cut.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
