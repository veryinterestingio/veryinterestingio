		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is the stereotype of wanting water or milk before bed. Not an expert, but I did a quick search and this is what I found. </p>
<p>I found some studies about a hormone called vasopressin and your biological clock. I guess the basic idea is that your body has an idea of when you're going to sleep because of your biological clock (circadian rhythm) . It knows it's not going to get water while you're sleeping, and and you're probably going to lose water by breathing/sweating, so it releases vasopressin out at some point before you go to sleep to prepare you. Vasopressin is basically a hormone responsible for managing the amount of water you have. It can tell the kidneys whether to let go of or retain water. </p>
<p>Whether you need water or not, you'll feel thirsty since your body knows you're getting ready to go to sleep and that it might become dehydrated. It doesn't want to wake you up during sleep, so it'll go away while you're sleeping.</p>
