		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sensory thing. Although we call stuff sweet, sour, bitter, etc., the cells in your tongue actually detects multiple things at once rather than a single thing. So, e.g., a tiny bit of salt enhances the sweetness by raising the &quot;general signal&quot; in cells responsible for telling you that something is sweet.</p>
<p>The combination isn't the same across all types.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Atoms and molecules can be neutral or ionic (meaning having a net positive or negative electric charge). The sodium ions in salt (or the magnesium ions in low sodium salt) interact with the oppositely charged ions in bitter flavorings, overall neutralizing the “bad” flavors in your food.

<p>But don’t believe that nonsense. Hot/Cold/Salty is the taste theory of the future.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Salt can bring out the umami (aka savory) flavor in meats and certain foods like kelp by binding to glutamate, a certain type of molecule called an amino acid common, and making it more easy for our tongues to detect it, thus bringing out more flavor. Sodium and glutamate stick together like magnets due to the positive charge on sodium and the negative charge on glutamate, which is why table salt (aka sodium chloride), improves the flavor of your glutamate filled meats. </p>
<p>There are probably other ways that salt increases the various flavors of foods, but I learned that one earlier today!</p>
<p>Edit: totally forgot to mention that the sodium from salt + the glutamate from meats and other “savory” foods combines to form Monosodium Glutamate aka everyone’s favorite: MSG! And for what it’s worth all the research I’ve read and all the biochemistry I’ve learned all leads to the same conclusion: consuming MSG is not anymore harmful to the human body than consuming sodium from table salt is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
