		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many things. Too many to list and explain individually (many are very technical and incapable of being eli5'd), but the biggest thing, and in many ways the thing the LHC was built to discover, was is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson" target="_blank">Higgs boson</a>. At the time of the construction of the LHC, the Higgs boson was a theorized and predicted yet undiscovered elementary particle that was a big missing piece in quantum physics. The confirmed discovery of the Higgs boson was hugely significant and answered a ton of questions in particle physics while also creating new questions for us to answer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

There are plenty of other discoveries, but leaving it as just &quot;Too many to list and explain&quot; is not helping us understand much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First off : sorry for my approximate English, I am not native. </p>
<p>So I'll try to make this as 5years old friendly as possible. You probably know that everything around you is made of matter, which is made of atoms. Basically little lego bricks that together form your Millenium falcon. </p>
<p>One of the many things they try to discover (it recently stopped for some upgrading) is what are those Lego bricks made off. Small constituants of the Lego bricks. One of the most famous discoveries was the hygg's boson. </p>
<p>I don't know much about the subject but if I recall correctly they discovered so far that there are 13 smaller bricks that intervienne in the making of matter. </p>
<p>What's incredible is that some of them seem to &quot;exists&quot; for very limited periods of time. They have thousands of very sophisticated cameras taking photos of what happens when they collide theses particules. It's like taking photos of your Millenium falcon when you smash it very quickly with a Groot replica made of Legos too.</p>
<p>By taking photos of the bricks that flew everywhere, you basically have an idea of what was used to make your construction in the first place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Atoms are like bouncy balls, they much prefer to repel eachother and bounce off than hit eachother hard enough to smash themselves to pieces. You basically have to get two bouncys to directly hit head on at insane speeds to see inside them. When you do get a bouncy ball to smash itself into pieces all the little bits go flying into the walls and by looking at all the little pieces that hit the wall we can see what bouncy balls are made of. Turns out they are made of more smaller bouncy balls which like to recombine into a stable bouncy ball and not stay as little bouncy bits</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The lhc is used in many different experiments, all trying to explain how particles interact at high energies.</p>
<p>The most important discovery is the Brout-Englert-Higgs particle an field. The particle was theorised decades ago as a solution to why the bosons for the weak nuclear force have mass. According to the symmetries that should apply to all force-bosons they can't have a mass. The theory explained how the symmetry can be broken at &quot;low&quot; energies. It also splits the electro-weak force in a electric force and a weak force. It also gives mass to the elementary fermions (do note that most of the mass of a proton/neutron/all matter is not from the individual elementary particles but from their interactions)</p>
<p>Discovering the higgs particle was nescecary to vallidate quantum field theory.</p>
<p>Their are many other experiments done at LHC, a lot of them trying to prove string theory and/or suppersymetry wich could solve some of the last problems we have with field theory and gravity.</p>
<p>One of the problems at LHC is the amount of data that needs to processed. For every usefull interaction there are billions of useless interactions. For them to find something new they need to have a good theory to test so they know what events they should look. This makes it really hard to test all possible theories.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
