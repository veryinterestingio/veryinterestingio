		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few different views being expressed so far, but nothing comprehensive.</p>
<p>It's important to note that a fever is the body's own response to infection, rather than being 'caused' by the virus. (Cause and effect here is quite blurred). The body is going through it's wired response to infection, and this has been evolutionarily beneficial to humans and other species for a long time.</p>
<p>There are three purported reasons for fever being beneficial.</p>
<ol>
<li>It kills the virus. <strong>Not true</strong> for reasons stated elsewhere. It's not enough of a change to cook the virus. This does seem to be an urban myth that is commonly believed though</li>
<li>It enhances immune response. <strong>True</strong>.</li>
<li>It prevents some viruses from multiplying or being as effective. <strong>True</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The complexity is that whilst fever is often beneficial in reducing mortality in different species, we have evolved alongside viruses and so viruses are not being caught flat-footed by it. Obviously natural selection in viruses is rapid and so those that survive with us now are less affected by the fever in our immune response.</p>
<p>Fever also has a high cost in energy use to a human, and there are some reasons why very sick people should be prevented from having a fever e.g. those in intensive care. Reducing fever has become unquestioned now, but research is being conducted into where, when and who should be allowed to run with a fever versus have it controlled. The answer to your question &quot;How much, if any, effect does fever have on how long you are sick?&quot; is &quot;It depends on who you are and what you are infected with and how healthy you are generally.&quot;</p>
<p>It's a good question, because despite fever being so commonplace and recognised as part of our immune response for thousands of years there is no solid code of practice for answering this, and a lot of misinformation floating around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
