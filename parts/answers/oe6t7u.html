		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dancing. </p>
<p>Western music evolved alongside western dance and the beat pattern is just what we are culturally inclined to dance to. </p>
<p>Walts music changes in 3s because it's written in 3/4 time. Balkan dances are written in odd times because they dance in rhythms that go &quot;long long short&quot; in terms of pulse. </p>
<p>Music and rhythm are cultural, whatever style of dancing is popular will always dictate the rhythmic pulses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A musical phrase is like a sentence. Most phrase structures have a first and second half sort of like a question and answer or subject and predicate. Because of music evolving with dance and just for somewhat arbitrary aesthetic reasons, we tend to like our musical phrases to have an even number of bars so each question can be answered. All the time you spend on the question of a phrase, you should similarly spend on the answer. There are other phrase structures, but pop music in general tends not to use them. </p>
<p>Electronic music just happens to like to use quite repetitive phrases because the melody is not nearly the most important thing in this style. 8 beats is two bars which is about long enough for a little tiny musical phrase at the tempi which this style is usually at. This is sort of like a sentence fragment. There’s clearly a point, but you aren’t really sure exactly how it fits in without context. I bet that if you look a little bit farther, you’ll actually see that the 8 beats you’re listening to will actually connect to the subsequent 8 beats in some way as well, because we typically like to have 4, 8, or even 16 bars in our phrases (16, 32, and 64 beats respectively), depending on the tempo. </p>
<p>So my answer is that the beat actually is not dictating anything. As for why melodies appear in these short, 8 beat durations? I’d say it’s likely that you have grabbed onto a piece of a musical phrase without looking at the whole thing. Electronic music repeats itself a lot, so it’s sometimes hard to hear the whole phrase — it’s easy to hear the repetition and think that it must be a new phrase. In reality, the phrases are probably much longer and just harder to detect because the melody in electronic music is far from the most important thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In western music and its derivatives, dance forms with symmetry are usually preferred. Even in asymmetric meters like 3, 5, 7, etc. the longer phrases of a melody are typically going to span over 2, 4, 8, etc. measures. </p>
<p>Example: a waltz is traditionally in 3/4 time, but the melodic phrase and direction of the dance will be 3/4 measures in symmetrical groups. Take the Blue Danube Waltz (which most people raised in Western Europe or the US would recognize), which is written and played in 3, but if you sing it to yourself and count how many measures (groups of 3) are in one phrase of the melody, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/1f52JEA" target="_blank">you'll count to 4</a> (or 8). </p>
<p>I'm not sure there's an explanation that's not purely based in culture and tradition, but if there were, I bet our inclination towards symmetric phrases in dance music is related to the phenomena where when you get hit in your arm and you want hit your other arm too so it evens out. But I'm not an expert, just a guy with a BA in music and the day off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: it means people can predict a song they never heard, and therefor dance to it.</p>
<p>Longer answer: western music has a tradition of playing music in 4/4. This is not the case for all cultures, but western music simply dominate the world. Because of this time signature of 4/4, we are used to dividing music into 4, or multiples (8, 16, 32 etc.). Because we are so used to hear this, it feels natural - and when it feels natural, we can dance to it without having to concentrate on it. Back to electronic music, there are a big part of electronic music that is made specifically for dancing, so here keeping to 8 beats makes it predictable. This is important because people might not know all songs, but they can still dance to them. It's similar to how the drop always comes in a way so everyone at a party knows when it happens. </p>
<p>In some cultures, dancing in other time signatures can be natural, if they are used to hearing it in traditional music. Many musicians have also practiced all kinds of time signatures and might feel them naturally.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's easy to count in 4s for Western music. Since electronic music is very often played in clubs, you want each song to transition smoothly into the next, and since so many songs are already in 4/4 or 8/4, other artists continue to use that timing so that their songs will be easily mixed into a DJ's set mix. This is why club music sounds like one long song. Unfortunately, this makes the genre as a whole particularly boring.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
