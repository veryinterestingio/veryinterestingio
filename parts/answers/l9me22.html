		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have mentioned the importance of earthquakes and magnetic fields.  I want to add some info on those and add another key factor: planetary shape and gravity.</p>
<p>1) <strong>Seismic waves</strong> (earthquakes) are used to probe the interior of a planet.  Some seismic waves will travel through solids, but not liquids, so a liquid core will block these waves from traveling from an earthquake on one side of the planet to seismic sensors on one side.  More elaborate analysis of seismic waves can detect changes in the type and density of solid materials, detect a solid inner core inside the liquid outer core, and so on.</p>
<p>A problem with seismology: you can only analyze seismic waves if you have a sensor on the surface of the planet, which means you have to land a delicate instrument on it.  We have good seismic data for the Moon, inconclusive data for Mars, and nothing for Venus or Mercury or any of the outer planets and moons.</p>
<p>2) <strong>Magnetic fields</strong> are useful but ambiguous.  Strong planetary magnetic fields are created by having an electrically conductive liquid in a rapidly spinning planet.  However, that liquid doesn't have to be iron (the giant planets Jupiter and Saturn, the field may be created in high-pressure liquid metallic hydrogen), and if a planet <em>doesn't</em> have a magnetic field, it's hard to say whether that's because its core is not liquid, not conducting, or not spinning fast enough.</p>
<p>3) <strong>Gravity and Shape</strong>: Centrifugal force causes spinning planets to flatten out from a perfect sphere into an &quot;oblate spheroid&quot;: they're a little bit wider across the equator than from pole to pole.  The amount of flattening depends on whether the planet's mass is spread evenly through it or not.  A planet that's all the same density throughout will be more squashed, a planet with a heavy core covered by a lightweight crust will be more spherical.  It's easy to measure the shape of the planet, by either taking a picture with a camera or measuring its gravitational pull on a spacecraft: from that you can infer how much mass is concentrated at the center, though you can't get any detailed structural info.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several different things allow us to constrain what's inside the planet:</p>
<p>1) Density. Because of the Earth's gravity, we know how much matter must be inside of it. But pretty early on, we noticed that the surface of the Earth is way too light to explain how much gravity there is— so we knew that the inside of the Earth must be much more dense, on average, than the outside. Specifically, the density of rocks on the Earth's crust is around 2.5 times as dense as water, but based on gravity, we know that the entire Earth in total is about 5.5 times denser than water. So we know that the inside of the Earth must be quite a lot heavier than the rocks we see on the crust.</p>
<p>2) Earthquakes. When an earthquake happens, ripples of shaking spread out away from the epicenter. As the shaking passes through different materials in the earth, the shaking is affected by the properties of the material— how heavy the material is; how much it resists or permits being deformed and in what way; how quickly the shaking is transmitted through it. We can use seismometers to measure the shaking far away from the earthquake, after it has passed through a lot of rock, and see how the shaking has been affected.</p>
<p>If you do this with a lot of earthquakes and a lot of seismometers, over time, you can build up a big map of all the features inside the earth that affect the shaking waves that pass through them. From this, we can very clearly see the various layers of mantle and core, because the boundaries between them bend the shaking waves in much the same way that water or glass bends light! Also, the core of the earth doesn't transmit certain kinds of shaking because it's made of liquid, and liquid doesn't &quot;hold together&quot; if you shear it, so shaking that involves shearing (rather than squeezing) simply doesn't make it through liquid layers. So if we plot where all the shearing-waves wind up, we can see a big &quot;shadow&quot; cast by the liquid core on the other side of the Earth from where the earthquake is!</p>
<p>3) Moment of inertia. Differently-shaped objects have different resistance to being turned (think of an ice skater bringing their arms in or letting them out; it changes how fast they are spinning). We can examine the detailed motion of a planet, and in combination with information about its total mass, and small variations in gravity (which we can measure from satellites), we can figure out how the mass of the Earth is distributed radially. Specifically, the more mass is close to the core, the less the Earth resists turning motion, like the ice skater. The moon also slightly tugs on the Earth (via the tides), and this affects its turning movement very slightly. By very carefully watching how the Earth and moon move relative to each other, we can figure out what the moment of inertia must be in order to explain the movements we observe. This works for other bodies in the solar system too. Knowing the moment of inertia allows us to better constrain our guesses of what could possibly be inside a planet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People have been dodging a really big part of the picture, and that is chemistry and mineralogy, and the role of meteoritic materials in revealing the very many numerous ways that planet-forming materials exist in nature.  We have density and structure (physical form) from one line of evidence (seismic/gravity/density), various natural mineral forms that we find in rocks on earth and from meteorites, and an understanding via experimental and theoretical chemistry as to how the various elements actually can and will come together, and in what crystalline forms, when subjected to different pressure and temperature conditions, and according to bulk compositions.</p>
<p>All of these different lines of evidence add small parts of the picture, and the big picture has to consider and explain them all.  It took a long time, and the work of a large number of people, to get to the model we now have of the earth's interior (and not just the core).</p>
<p>It is very much like a jigsaw puzzle, where each person has a different piece, and they all have to get together and fit the different parts together so it makes a picture that makes any sense at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One way we can find what our core is made of is through seismic waves. When the same seismic waves are measured at two different points they would differ based on what kind of material they passed through. By analyzing the properties of these waves scientists come up with a best guess of what the insides of our planet are made of.</p>
<p>For the other planets, the process is a bit more complex. It involves finding their sizes and masses and light spectrums and other stuff I don't understand enough about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
