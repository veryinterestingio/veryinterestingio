		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Specifically concerning invasion, the proteins on the outside of the virus that bind to cell receptors. If you can encourage a cell to take you inside, the rest is (relatively) much easier. As others have pointed out though, the cycle as a whole is much more complicated, but that's the most important part for invasion alone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For a SARS-CoV-2 virion, you’re probably referring to the spike proteins spread over its surface [14 +/- 9 spike proteins per virion] that give coronaviruses their name. </p>
<p>The spike protein is split into two subunits, S1 and S2. S1 recognizes and binds to certain of the host cell’s receptors, while the S2 subunit mediates viral-cell membrane fusion which enables the virion to “become one” with the cell before hijacking it. </p>
<p>So the spike protein is essential for the virus to propagate. If it can’t enter cells, it can’t hijack their reproductive capability to produce more virions. </p>
<p>This is why all the successful vaccines have been focused on helping the immune system recognise, react to and synthesise antibodies for the spike protein.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For a lot of viruses, the viral spike assembly is the primary method for entering a cell.</p>
<p>The virus spike attaches the virus securely to the outside of a human cell by binding to surface receptors on the cell.  It then shoots three harpoons into the cell membrane, and then collapses into a compact structure like a spring to force the viral envelope to contact the cell membrane.  This disrupts the membrane and the envelope and allows the contents of the virus to enter the cytoplasm.</p>
<p>Different viruses have different ways of sensing when their spikes are &quot;securely attached&quot;.  A common method is pH.  When the cell endocytoses a virus, the virus enters an endosome where the pH drops from 7 to pH 5 as a part of the cells natural digestion process.  This makes some amino acid residues in the viral spike to take on a positive charge, which then triggers a structure change that releases the harpoons and collapses the viral spike.  However, nature has evolved other triggers.  HIV for example can somehow sense attachment mechanically without a pH change in a way that we still don't understand, so it doesn't need to be endocytosed for the collapse to occur.  This might be because it's adapted to attack T-cells which have a lower tendency to endocytose virus sized particles.</p>
<p>In order for a virus to get into a cell, a number of spikes need to attach securely and collapse, forming a sort of annular ring that outlines the contact patch.</p>
<p>This video is a nice animation of the crucial part of this process:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a couple: Proteins on the exterior surface of the virus that bind to receptors on the surface of the host cell (kind of like landing gear), and membrane-fusion proteins that, just as the name suggests, fuse the viral membrane to the host cell membrane, allowing the viral genes to be introduced into the cell (kind of like two spacecraft docking)</p>
<p>EDIT: This is highly simplified, and more detailed information can be found online, of course. I only skimmed this, hut it seems like a good resource: <a href="https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-microbiology/chapter/viral-replication/" target="_blank">https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-microbiology/chapter/viral-replication/</a>)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
