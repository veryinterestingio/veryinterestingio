		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two major families of flowering plants, called dicots and monocots. There are a lot of subtle differences between them, but one of the easiest ways to tell is the <a href="http://www1.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/library/webb/BOT201/Angiosperm/MagnoliophytaLab99/LeavesDicotMonocotColor400.jpg" target="_blank">shape of the leaves</a> EDIT: and the way the veins are arranged</p>
<p>Grasses and almost all grain crops, like corn, wheat, and rice, are monocots. Most &quot;weed&quot; species are dicots. The most common types of weed killers only kill dicots, and leave monocots unharmed.</p>
<p>Other types of weed killers will kill almost all plants, but they've genetically engineered certain crops to be resistant to that weed killer. If you've planted those genetically engineered crops, you can spray the weed killer all over your field and only the things you don't want growing will die.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For killing weeds in your lawn, the most common herbicide is 2,4-D. Most weeds are broadleaf plants which means the growing part of the leaf is exposed (think a flat leaf growing wider). Grasses grow from the root. 2,4-D mimics a growth hormone and when it is sprayed on growing leaves, it makes broadleaf plants grow so fast that they canâ€™t keep up, and they eventually starve to death. The grass root is underground so the growing part of the grass plant is protected from contact with the herbicide. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the herbicide.<br />
A lot of &quot;grass safe&quot; herbicides are designed to stop seeds from growing. Weeds usually grow fresh from seeds each year, so if you kill the seeds your grass will come back but weeds won't grow. These kinds of weed killers are known as &quot;Pre-emergent&quot;.<br />
You can also find weed killers that are &quot;broadleaf selective&quot;. These usually mimic plant hormones that most weeds use but grasses don't.
You can also take the opposite approach, you use a herbicide that kills everything, but then modify your plant so it is resistant to the herbicide. &quot;Roundup ready&quot; crops are an example of this approach. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the herbicide. Glyphosate will kill both grass and weeds, while dimethylamine kills many weeds, but leaves many common grass varieties alone. Grass varieties differ in certain aspects from many weeds and the different herbicides available make use of these differences to attack some plants but spare others. </p>
<p>In the case of something like roundup (glyphosate) it kills plants by interfering with the plants use of certain amino acids. It breaks some of the cellular machinery necessary for life. Because it interferes with amino acids that grass also uses, it kills grass. </p>
<p>Other herbicides like dimethylamine work by causing vascular systems in fast growing plants to grow too quickly. Weeds tend to grow faster than grass, and it takes advantage of this fast growth to push it even farther so that growth is so fast that the plant can't circulate nutrients effectively. Slower growing plants like grass are less impacted, although some varieties do grow quickly and could die.  </p>
<p>Some weeds are members of the grass family and herbicides that work on them, would also kill most varieties of lawn grass. Here in the South we have problems with Johnson Grass. It's very difficult to kill because any weed killer that could kill it would also kill lawn grass. It has a rhizome so pulling it leaves the root system and it will re-grow later. It also grows faster than grass and most other weeds and its hard on the soil. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the context of grass and the RoundUp products that you can buy for broadleaf weeds, it has to do with the herbicide being specific for dicot plants (weeds) instead of the monocot plants (grass) like other people have mentioned. </p>
<p>However, in commercial farming herbicide is often applied to a field of crops as a mixture with a chemical called a safener. Safeners are meant to keep the crop &quot;safe&quot;, hence the name, preventing it from herbicide injury. However, an intriguing aspect of this field of study is that the molecular mechanism of safeners is not fully understood. The one thing that we do know is that safeners cause the overproduction of an enzyme called glutathione-S-transferase (GST) that detoxifies the herbicide by breaking the molecule into smaller parts. The signaling pathway that safeners use, however, is the big mystery. </p>
