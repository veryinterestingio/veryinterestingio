		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As the previous comment said, older cameras had a lower frame rate. The methods that they used to capture the light for each still image in the video took longer, and they couldnâ€™t switch images as quickly as we can now. It looks sped up because the projectors being used to play it go at a much higher frame rate. If a camera can capture one frame per second, but the projector plays at two frames per second, then it would only take one minute to play two minutes of footage, and everyone in it would be moving at double the real speed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the old style of camera could not capture film at high frames rate( pictures taken ), it appears sped up because there was only so many pictures that could be captured for every second. For example 24fps is 24 pictures shown in a second. In old videos it was maybe 10fps so it appears sped up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A good example of an old film being converted to make it appear more natural is &quot;they shall not grow old.  Peter Jackson took hours of footage from WW1, colourised it and gave it the correct speed for his documentary.</p>
<p>The transition effect at the beginning is especially good.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of these old films were hand-cranked at around 10 or 15 fps to save money on film.  Modern broadcasters intentionally speed them up to 24 fps or 30 fps so we don't see the jerky motion, and they figure the Benny Hill chase style animation is an acceptable compromise.</p>
<p>Thanks to high tech frame interpolation tools (SVP is one that works on desktop) it's possible to reconstruct the correct frames in between to simulate 30 fps, or even higher, so if you look around on YouTube you can find HQ high frame rate videos constructed from 10 fps movies that look &quot;normal&quot;.</p>
<p>That said, some older movies were in fact cranked at much slower speeds as artistic or industrial experiments.  I don't know where they are, but they do exist.  The single one I know of is a WWII D-Day landing video produced for Winston Churchill or FDR (one of the two) that was intentionally filmed at 48 fps so they could get a much higher quality showing back in the 1940s, and it looks amazing.  This video is on YouTube at its original 48 fps frame rate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
