		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi there, I work with carbon sequestration and carbon stocks, particularly in the realm of blue carbon ecosystems (mangroves, seagrass and saltmarsh ecosystems) and while there has been no studies done with plastic pollution so far, I reckon that plastics in the sediments are being included in the total carbon storage capabilities of an ecosystem, thereby overestimating its contribution to the mitigation of climate change, since the plastics would not easily remineralise into CO2, it would not need the protection offered by burial in the sediment. <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/493262v1" target="_blank">There has already been work done on this in the field of black/pyrogenic carbon from the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels in the Southeast Asian region</a>, but those studies are but one of a few in a very young field. What are your thoughts on this, especially given that microplastics seem so pervasive in all environments?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
