		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There isn't a clean answer to this, because it depends on how you define sleep. Most sleep researchers interested in this question have defined a &quot;sleep-like state&quot; as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A (reversible) state of reduced activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A state in which the organism is less responsive to environmental stimuli.</p>
</li>
<li>A state that is <strong><em>homeostatically regulated</em></strong>, meaning that if the organism is prevented from entering that state, they will later attempt to catch up on the state (if given the opportunity). There may also be commensurate deficits in behavior until homeostasis is restored.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last point is critical, since homeostatic regulation is a key feature of sleep in all vertebrates and a clear sign that the state has important functions.</p>
<p>Some examples of organisms that engage in sleep-like states are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982217310230" target="_blank">Jellyfish</a></p>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06535" target="_blank">Nematodes</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that there isn't likely to be a clear singular definition of what sleep is/isn't, nor is there likely to be identified a single point in evolutionary history at which sleep 'first evolved'. This is because sleep is an amalgamation of many processes. In animals with a central nervous system, sleep has clearly identified functions for most (arguably ALL) systems of the body, so it clearly isn't <em>just</em> about the brain. While sleep has clearer physiological traits in mammals (e.g., REM and NREM sleep), where it is most often studied, sleep still has quite different features between mammalian species. For just one example, see unihemispheric sleep.</p>
<p>More universal than sleep is the existence of circadian rhythms. Virtually every form of life on earth is capable of generating its own ~24-hour rhythms, which are synchronized to the 24-hour day. These are the basis for timing all daily rhythms, including alternation of states (such as sleep) around the clock. Even in single celled organisms, you will see daily alternation of metabolic activity, DNA expression, and cellular repair, for example. You can debate to no end where you draw the line on identifying these collective temporal processes as &quot;sleep-like&quot; or &quot;wake-like&quot; states.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sleep scientist here.</p>
<p>All animals with a brain sleep, as far as this has been carefully examined. We can define whether an organism sleep by checking off the following criteria: </p>
<ol>
<li>The animals experience behavioural quiescence</li>
<li>The animal has a stereotypic, species-specific postures</li>
<li>The animal has elevated arousal thresholds, which means it takes more stimulation to elicit a response</li>
<li>The animal must produce a rapid state reversibility with moderately intense stimulation</li>
</ol>
<p>Simple animals with a nervous system but no brain, such as worms and jellyfish might have sleep-like states but they do not meet the criteria needed to define them as sleeping organisms. Currently, the simplest organisms (with a simple brain) that are known to sleep are various insects like fruit flies.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The jist of it was: if you flip a jelly fish over, the time it take to right itself varies in a way that looks like it's inactive or sleeps some of the time.</p>
<p>The link below is the best I found in the 30 seconds I looked.  It talks about the research.  But doesn't mention any details.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So most organisms, including unicellular organisms like bacteria, show a 24-hour cycle of rest and activity. These 24-hour cycles are driven by some sort of internal circadian rhythm, and their purpose is to address both external factors (you should behave differently when it's day vs. night) and internal factors (lots of internal rhythms need to be timed specifically). So, in a way, you could call these cycles of rest and activity &quot;sleep,&quot; and claim that almost every organism, including unicellular ones, sleep. However, that's losing sight of some of the intricacies of sleep, and it's worth exploring further what exactly we mean when we say &quot;sleep.&quot;</p>
<p>Before we can talk about which animals sleep, we need to discuss what exactly it means for an animal to be sleeping. Humans have broadly 6 stages of being awake-- waking, drowsy, stage 1 sleep, stage 2 sleep, stage 3 sleep, stage 4 sleep, and REM sleep. For each stage of sleep, an EEG will show a distinct signal. However, EEG measures activity produced by the neocortex, and you immediately run into a problem since not all animals have a neocortex, and so not all brains are capable of generating EEGs specific to sleep stages. Thus, sleep researchers have come up with 6 criteria used to define sleep. They are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The animal needs to be in a state of immobility with reduced sensory responsiveness that they can quickly exit out of. The caveat of being able to quickly leave is important because it excludes things like hibernation and being in a coma.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The animal needs to have increased arousal thresholds (needs more noise to be woken) and needs to have decreased responsiveness to external stimulation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All animals in the species need to have somewhat similar postures when they sleep and need to sleep in somewhat similar places</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Animals have specific behaviors before sleeping. These are thinks like circling territory, yawning, or &quot;making the bed&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A circadian rhythm needs to exist and last around 24 hours.</p>
</li>
<li>To quote /u/whatthefat, &quot;A state that is homeostatically regulated, meaning that if the organism is prevented from entering that state, they will later attempt to catch up on the state (if given the opportunity). There may also be commensurate deficits in behavior until homeostasis is restored.&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>So using these 6 criteria, plus distinctive EEG signatures, let's look across the animal kingdom and see who sleeps.</p>
<p><strong>Mammals</strong></p>
<p>All mammals definitely sleep. When mammals are sleep deprived, they sleep more the next night. In humans, for example, pulling an all nighter will result in more stage 3+4 sleep the next night. Certain other mammals like rodents, cats, dogs, and monkeys fulfill all 6 behavioral criteria and show distinct non-REM (stages 1-4) and REM EEG patterns. All known mammals show REM sleep of some kind.</p>
<p><strong>Birds</strong></p>
<p>Birds are pretty similar to mammals in sleep EEG-- they show both REM and non-REM EEG patterns when they're inactive, and they have specific sleep postures. When birds experience REM, they also show rapid eye movements and experience muscle paralysis, just like we do, although their REM sleep is extremely brief (only 10 seconds or so). Some people have theorized that birds actually have more lengthy REM cycles, but only at the level of the brainstem, not the cortex. Broadly, birds fulfill all 6 of the behavioral criteria that I mentioned, but there are differences when compared to mammals. For example, birds don't &quot;catch up on sleep.&quot; When you disrupt mammalian sleep, they'll get more sleep the night after. When birds are migrating, their overall sleep is reduced by 70%, but we don't see any signs of sleep rebound or reduction in cognitive abilities.</p>
<p><strong>Reptiles and Amphibians</strong></p>
<p>We don't know much about how reptiles and amphibians sleep. Back in the 60s, people noted sleep-like states in frogs and toads, which show &quot;sleep behaviors,&quot; have higher arousal thresholds, and some studies talk about how they have signatures of non-REM EEG. We do know that reptiles show some elements of the 6 criteria I listed. Turtles will show rest periods that are accompanied by decreased sensitivity to stimuli, and there's pretty good evidence that they experience rebound sleep. Lizards and crocodiles show something like non-REM EEG when they were resting. There's very little evidence suggesting, however, that reptiles exhibit REM at all.</p>
<p><strong>Fish</strong></p>
<p>Most bony fish exhibit resting states that fulfill the 6 criteria I listed. Many fish show reduced respiration and increased response thresholds at night. Some fish also have sleep-specific postures. The wrasses will lie on their side on the sand at night, partially buried, and often in groups. Some species float in open water. Fish in coral reefs will retreat into small holes in the coral when they rest. Zebrafish have been shown to respond to sleep deprivation by getting more &quot;sleep&quot; the next day, suggesting some sort of homeostatic sleep rebound. There's no evidence that fish have non-REM or REM like brain patterns, but that's probably because their brains are too simple</p>
<p><strong>Invertebrates</strong></p>
<p>Invertebrates are by far the most diverse group I'm talking about here, but we don't really know much about how they sleep. Many invertebrate species fulfill some of the criteria listed. Squids and octopi will show increased arousal thresholds with narrowed pupils and colour changes during rest phases. Insects will show periods of reduced sensory response in a 24 hour day. Bees show increased responsiveness to visual stimuli and less at night, as well as show some signs of sleep rebound.  </p>
<hr />
<p>So, to finally answer your question, who sleeps? It looks like sleep exists in some form or another across all animals, but it's easy to refute this The fact of the matter is that very few animals fulfill all 6 of the behavioral criteria I listed. Other people say that you should measure sleep defined on EEG alone. If you try to define sleep by EEG alone, then invertebrates don't sleep at all, and all vertebrates sleep. </p>
<p>However, if you exclude species that don't show a very clear EEG, then you'd exclude all the fish and amphibians.</p>
<p>If you exclude species that don't engage in REM sleep, you'd exclude most reptiles.</p>
<p>If you exclude species that have non-REM but don't show clear REM or have very brief REM, then you'd exclude birds.</p>
<p>And now you're left with only species that show clear nonREM + REM cycles, and we only have mammals left, but then we run into the problem of defined sleep based on what <strong>we</strong> do.</p>
<p>So which animals sleep? All of them.... or none of them, depending on what exactly you define sleep to be.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
