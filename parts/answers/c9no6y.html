		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You often hear things like &quot;We've only explored X% of the ocean&quot; but this is very misleading because it depends on what you mean by &quot;explored&quot;. It certainly doesn't mean that we know absolutely nothing about the majority of the ocean, because we do. Whilst it's true that only a very small proportion of the ocean has been observed <em>visually</em> by humans, the entire ocean floor has been mapped to a resolution of <a href="https://topex.ucsd.edu/WWW_html/srtm30_plus.html" target="_blank">at least 1km</a> through a combination of satellite-derived gravity measurements and measurements from ship-borne instruments. Whilst it's technically true that we cannot entirely discount the existence of some extraordinarily steep and deep fissure that has evaded our remote sensing techniques, we can confidently say that the Mariana Trench is the deepest significant point in the ocean.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While we haven't been to the deepest parts of the ocean in person, we are able to measure them from a distance.</p>
<p>By using technology like sonar, we can map out the sea floor, determining things like the depth. Map out the whole thing (even if on fairly poor quality) and it is simple enough to pick the deepest point.</p>
<p>If you are referencing the comment of 'we have only explored x% of the ocean', what that is typically saying is that while we have basic knowledge of the whole area, we have not visited it in person and explored it in detail.</p>
<p>Imagine flying over a mountain in a plane - it is easy to look out the window, spot the highest point and get a basic idea of what sort of landscape of is and how many trees there are. At the same time, from that height you won't have a clue what sort of animals live there, how the plant life has adapted to the area and so on, which you will only ever learn by landing and having a closer look.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
