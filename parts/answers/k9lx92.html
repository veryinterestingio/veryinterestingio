		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You might be suffering from conditioned sleep anxiety - associating the bed with stressful activities or thoughts. If the couch is often where you relax and you bring worries or work to bed (physically or mentally), you'll have a hard time sleeping in bed.</p>
<p>Responses to this problem are called &quot;sleep hygiene&quot; (you can start here <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about_sleep/sleep_hygiene.html" target="_blank">CDC - Sleep Hygiene Tips - Sleep and Sleep Disorders</a>). It can often take some tweaking to get these habits to stick and be effective.</p>
<p>Also remember- if you can't fall asleep in 15-20 minutes, it's always better to get up and do something relaxing (e.g., reading in soft light) out of bed. Otherwise, the longer you wait in bed, the more you associate the bed with anxiety, which exacerbates the problem!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you're on the couch you're in a relaxed state not thinking about whether you're gonna fall asleep or not so your body goes to sleep as it is tired. When you're in bed you're thinking about going to sleep or rather how hard it is to sleep. </p>
<p>Think less about sleeping and more about relaxing or getting comfortable in bed and you'll pass right out. </p>
<p>I've been known to fall asleep on almost anything including treadmills, under beds, work out bench, trunk of a car. The point is it doesn't matter where you lay your head so long as you are relaxed and comfortable and not stressing yourself out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
