<p>This is a common question, and a common one to which /u/astromike23 provides a comprehensive answer. If they want to join in and provide more context, they're welcome, but I'll also spare them the effort and point out that ultimately, this is a common misconception. In detail intrinsic magnetic fields are not as crucial to the preservation of planetary atmospheres as is commonly assumed. This is well explained in <a href="https://orfeo.kbr.be/bitstream/handle/internal/6980/Gunell%282018a%29.pdf" target="_blank">Gunnell, et al., 2018</a>. With reference to the Gunnell paper and borrowed from one of /u/astromike23 answers on this: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The basic premise is that terrestrial planets with magnetic fields lose their atmospheres faster than those without magnetic fields. While magnetic fields do block the solar wind, they also create a polar wind: open field lines near the planet's poles give atmospheric ions in the ionosphere a free ride out to space. Earth loses many tons of oxygen every day due to the polar wind, but thankfully our planet's mass is large enough to prevent too much escape. Until you get to Jupiter-strength magnetic fields that have very few open field lines, the polar wind will generally produce more atmospheric loss than the solar wind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, if you look at the loss rate and estimated history of the loss of Martian atmosphere (e.g., the recent review by <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-earth-062420-052845" target="_blank">Jakosky, 2021</a>), it's important to remember that Mars lost its atmosphere over 100 of millions to billion(s) of years. So, hypothetically assuming we had the ability to rapidly (even if by rapid we meant a few hundred years) add an atmosphere to Mars, it would take an extremely long time for it to escape.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  If you can build an atmosphere, bleed off of atmosphere already has a built in counter:  you just add more back.  Bit simplistic and glossing over how it’s done, but if you can build it, you can add more later.  Perpetual anything doesn’t matter if the standard is building.</p>
<p>Inherent mass has more to do with keeping an atmosphere than having an active core.  On Earth, escape velocity can be achieved by discrete energy of specific particles.  We can lose Hydrogen pretty easy under certain conditions, good luck with Oxygen or Nitrogen bleed.  On the moon, atmosphere would bleed of just about any kind under common sunlight conditions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One possible solution to the magnetic field is a manmade sattelite at the Lagrange point between Mars and the sun that generates a field. It wouldn't have to be a huge field because of the location. It would basically be a shield to prevent the sun from leeching the atmosphere away. </p>
<p>There are some genuinely interesting options out there to solve the magnetic field issue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Slightly off-topic but I'd like to promote the idea that building an atmosphere on the moon is a really bad idea. That hard vacuum is a valuable natural resource, useful for all kinds of industrial processes and scientific research. It's not easy to create a vacuum that good in a lab, or that vast.</p>
<p>Lack of atmosphere also means trains can go hyper-fast without resistance. Magnetic rail launch systems are feasible. Etc.</p>
<p>For human habitation, fill a few of those giant lava tubes with air and build a city there. Paint the ceiling to look like sky and the walls to look like mountains and forests. Have a &quot;sun&quot; creep down the length of the tube to simulate days and time zones. You can even simulate weather.</p>
<p>Just something to think about before we go mucking up a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>Edit to add:<br />
Bigger telescopes! No atmosphere to distort the view, low gravity makes bigger<br />
mirrors possible. Far side of the moon means zero light pollution for<br />
almost two solid weeks. Imagine the astronomy that could be done there!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>You need a magnetic field so solar winds don't blow the atmosphere away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a common misconception. A magnetic field can reduce or increase the rate of atmosphere loss. Far more important for retaining atmosphere is the planet's gravity.</p>
<p>While Mars would lose its terraformed atmosphere eventually, this would happen on a time scale of about 100 million years. Far too slow to ever be a problem for us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
