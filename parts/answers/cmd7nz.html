Once it gets below a certain threshold, microorganisms don't have enough free water to function and reproduce, and decay is prevented.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Along with the dehydrating effect, you are also preventing most air from getting to the leaf, which some if not most bacteria need in order to grow and thrive. Although this is likely minor compared to the other factors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Any leaf that dries first, doesn't decay afterwards. A leaf in a book is not so fundamentally different from any other leaf stored in a dry place. If you pick a leaf from a tree and put it right next to the heater or even just on the table in your living room (unless you live in a very damp climate), you'll find the results are very similar to the leaf in the book in terms of decay. The only thing that a book does, is speed up the process by pressing moisture from the leaf quicker than a natural drying process would, reducing the amount of contact with oxygen in the air and flattening it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Placing the stuff between pages of a book - or any other pressing tool - is to make sure that the leaf doesn't curl as it dries. It is the drying that preserves it, the pressing just makes sure that it looks OK when it is dry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
