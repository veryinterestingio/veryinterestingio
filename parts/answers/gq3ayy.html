		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You create a business in both places. </p>
<p>Then you transfer assets to the one in the tax haven, then you license those assets back to the company not in the tax haven. </p>
<p>You set the price of the license at the income in the country you want to avoid the taxes in. Thats transfers all the profits to your tax haven corporation.</p>
<p>To use numbers:</p>
<p>High tax company makes $100 in revenue, license price set at $100. </p>
<p>100-100 = 0 profit in high tax country</p>
<p>100-0 = 100 profit in tax haven country</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's say you own a company called Globocorp. You're doing pretty well, making $100m a year in profit, but you're paying a lot in taxes as a result. So you start another company, Globocorp Land Holdings Ltd., &amp; you base it in the Cayman Islands. Globocorp transfers the ownership of its real estate to GLH Ltd., &amp; GLH Ltd. rents the buildings back to Globocorp for $100m a year.</p>
<p>Now Globocorp is making no money at all! For tax purposes, it literally makes $0 a year because there's nothing left after paying the rent. Globocorp Land Holdings Ltd., however, is making serious bank, &amp; is doing so in a country with almost no corporate taxes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The entire concept of corporate taxes gets extremely complicated and unintuitive as you dig into it.</p>
<p>At a simple level: a company's annual profit = revenue - expenses, and the government takes X% of the profit as tax. This works great for a mom-n-pop store on Main St., but say (as in your example) there is a company with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Offices and employees in US and UK (thus incorporated in both countries)</li>
<li>Suppliers and vendors in Asia</li>
<li>Customers in US, UK and most other countries around the world</li>
</ul>
<p>The company needs to file taxes in both US and UK, and so needs to figure out exactly what the profit in each country was.</p>
<ul>
<li>Which country's entity claims the revenue from global sales?</li>
<li>Which country's entity pays the suppliers?</li>
</ul>
<p>They could come up with some formula to figure it out, but then they realize - US has a much lower corporate tax rate than UK. So the accountants work overtime and declare that all the production costs are incurred by the UK office, and all sales happen via the US office. Thus the latter shows a massive profit and the former pays no taxes because of a loss.</p>
<p>Another accountant then discovers that the Cayman Islands have <em>no</em> corporate taxes. They register a third corporate entity there, and all sales start flowing through them. The UK and US businesses now both operate at a loss, and thus pay no tax.</p>
<p>Taking this even further, the Cayman Islands corporation assumes ownership of all intellectual assets of the company, and the US and UK corporations have to pay licensing fees to it every year. Now no matter where the sale happens, it can be offset by exactly the same amount going to the Cayman Islands and there is a 0 on all balance sheets.</p>
<p>&quot;But this should all be illegal!&quot; Probably, but that would require every country in the world to sit down and mutually agree on a single sensible tax plan and enforcement guidelines. So, won't happen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let’s imagine you’re operating a business in the United States, and you’ve been making healthy profits. However, the end of the fiscal year arrives, and you discover that you have to pay a significant portion of your earnings to the U.S government as corporate tax.  This means you’ll be left with less money to pay for your expenses next year. </p>
<p>So how do you save that 21% corporate tax rate??</p>
<p>Well, you could form a subsidiary (aka shell) company of your business in the Cayman Islands, (with just a PO Box mailing address) where the levied corporate tax rate is around zero.  </p>
<p>Your business will now perform all services or make all sales through this subsidiary instead of through the US based parent company. By doing this, you have effectively established tax residency in the Cayman Islands, and your earnings will be taxed there (at least the percentage of the earnings that are generated there). </p>
<p>This is how you effectively save 21% of your income while avoiding a reasonable corporate tax rate.</p>
<p>Many companies set up shell companies inside shell companies, etc to make the money trail extremely hard to follow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To follow up on this line of questioning, what then keeps these tax havens in existence? I would've thunk that some government somewhere would've done something by now to shut them down or at least impede them from siphoning taxes away.</p>
<p>It seems that these places continue to survive as they earn from the corporate taxes that they levy on businesses, but the government/tax bureau doesnt strike me as an entity that would play by the rules and just &quot;give up&quot; against this blatant loophole that is costing them so much every year.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
