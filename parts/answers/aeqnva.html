		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First ask yourself this: How does something with no surface spin with an angular velocity measured in units of linear velocity?</p>
<p>When you realize the answer, you will understand where that number came from: <spoiler>bad reporting</spoiler>.</p>
<p>OK, but seriously, it's actually the estimated velocity of material in the accretion disk around a black hole that emitted a huge quasi-periodic pulse of X-rays. By looking at the frequencies of the periodicity, you can figure out how often the material is swirling around the black hole. Then, you use some reasonable guesses about where the material would be and how big the black hole is to figure out what valid orbits would be for a Kerr spacetime geometry.</p>
<p>The paper isn't super-readable, but you can take a look at it here: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10713" target="_blank"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10713" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10713</a></a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

But we can figure out its rotation speed but knowing the orbital velocities of the stars and such going around it and the mass within its gravitational influence </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
