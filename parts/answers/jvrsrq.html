		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Will the data be publicly available? I know any data NASA collects generally is, but I don't know if the partnership might affect that.</p>
<p>What kind of instrumentation is aboard? Since it's a Sentinel satellite, I assume at least one high-resolution camera, but because of the scientific mission, perhaps you might have added additional instrument packages, such as a laser altimeter?</p>
<p>What sort of orbit is it planned to be in? I would guess polar for maximum coverage?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Out of curiosity... How is exactly that collaboration? I imagine the satellite was built with American and European equipment, but it will it be operated from a single team now? EUMETSAT?</p>
<p>How does this satellite interact with the rest of Sentinels/Copernicus? What is the endgame here when all are active?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Compared to other satellites already up like this one, what makes this particular vessel unique? Trajectory? Is its equipment far superior? If so, care to put a % on how much better Sentinel-6 is then its predecessors?</p>
<p>Good luck on your mission!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't have anything to ask, but I just wanted to say that the Sentinel satellites and their publicly available data really opened up a new hobby and way to contextualize the earth we share. </p>
<p>Using sentinel2 to look at wildfires here in Colorado has been really transformative to the way I think about the natural world and conservation.</p>
<p>I can't wait to poke around and learn about the functionality of the Sentinel6!!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>isn't one decade such a short period of time for longterm data collection and its efficient use? or are there other missions (within this partnership or otherwise) to follow to ensure continuous process? what are they, if any?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
