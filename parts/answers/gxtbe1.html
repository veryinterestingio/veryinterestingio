		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Atoms have a natural tendency to want a certain number of electrons around them. There are reasons for that, too, but let’s just take that as given to keep it shorter. If you look at a periodic table, you will see the inert gases on the far right column. Those guys are the only atoms which are happy on their own, any other atoms need to bond with other atoms and share electrons to be happy.</p>
<p>Take CO2 for example, the C needs 4 more electrons to be as happy as an inert gas, each O wants 2 more electrons to be as happy as an inert gas (yes, it would help if you looked up the table). So now they bond, 2 electrons are shared between each O and the C, and they have what they want. That is the base of all chemisty.</p>
<p>However, not only do atoms want to have a certain number, some atoms are more eager to get there, this is called electronegativity or what my teacher called &quot;being a bigger bully&quot;. So some atoms are quite agressive and violent when it comes to getting those.</p>
<p>So while in H2O, water, the oxygen is already quite the bully and pretty much takes the &quot;shared&quot; electrons for itself, along comes sodium (Na) who really, REALLY wants to have his ideal number, but for Sodium that means giving one electron away.</p>
<p>So now look at the players:</p>
<p>O really wants 2 electrons</p>
<p>Na really wants to give one away</p>
<p>H is like, whatever, I am happy if you are, I either want to have one more or one less, if possible, thank you.</p>
<p>So NA and O are like made for each other, they take one H and form NaOH, any leftover H becomes H2 and flies away (and likely ignites with O2 in the air, forming water again)</p>
<p>It may seem silly and a step backwards, but even for teenagers and adults basic chemistry becomes easier to understand if you see the atoms as characters with a certain goal, to lose or gain a certain amount of electrons in their vicinity, sharing counts.</p>
<p>Look at the 3 &quot;character&quot; again, and you see the &quot;needs&quot; of H are not as important as the &quot;needs&quot; of Na and O.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Explosions are chemical reactions that happen very fast.  The others have explained the chemistry between sodium and the oxygen in water; the explosion is because it happens extremely fast.  </p>
<p>High explosives, for example, &quot;burn&quot; / react faster than the speed of sound, so the gases they produce push the air away very &quot;suddenly&quot;, creating a shock wave.  Comparatively, gasoline and other fuels burn &quot;fast&quot; but not THAT fast, and they don't explode, they &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflagration" target="_blank">deflagrate</a>.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sodium metal has a single <em>very</em> loosely bound electron that circles outside all the others.</p>
<p>Oxygen is a highly aggressive “oxidizer” that loves to rip electrons off of other atoms - even if it’s already bound up in a water molecule.</p>
<p>So you’re adding a block atoms that are super ready to give an electron into a puddle of molecules that are super ready to take an electron - and that predictable reaction proceeds with great violence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have explained how sodium in water releases hydrogen, but not what causes the explosion.</p>
<p>The reaction that releases hydrogen is exothermic, there's a lot of heat produced. The hydrogen mixes with oxygen in the air and the heat sets it afire, that's why it explodes.</p>
<p>The explosion only happens when a relatively large chunk of sodium, a hundred grams or more, is dropped into the water. A small piece, let's say like a grain of rice, will not explode. It will fizzle when the hydrogen is released, but it will not explode because there isn't enough heat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason is because sodium has a weak attraction for its outer electron (as with all group 1 metals), and tends to lose it to the water. You can think of water as kinda like an H+ and an OH- put together. Two sodium atoms release 2 electrons, which find two water molecules. In each, H+ accepts an electron to become a neutral hydrogen atom, which goes on to make an H2 gas molecule. The two OH- anions left over remain in solution, so the solution now has sodium ions and hydroxide ions - i.e. sodium hydroxide solution.  </p>
<p>It used to be throught that the H2 gas released would ignite because of the energy released and then explode. This is now knows to be false. If you watch the reaction on a high speed camera, you can actually watch the metal explode BEFORE the flash of light from hydrogen igniting. It happens because the sodium loses its electron so rapidly, you end up with a whole bunch of positive sodium cations next to each other. positive and positive repel, so they fly away from eachother explosively, revealing even MORE sodium to the water, so more explosion occurs.  </p>
<p>I recommend watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmlAYnFF_s8" target="_blank">this youtube video</a>, made by the youtuber who actually discovered this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
