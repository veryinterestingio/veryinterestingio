		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: It's really complicated and we don't entirely know.</p>
<p>Long answer:
Memory is one of the most interesting and challenging brain functions to study.</p>
<p>We know there are different kinds of memory:</p>
<p>Short term memory lasts seconds to a few minutes. We think it lives mostly in the front of the brain, and it seems to work most like a tape recorder playing back experiences. </p>
<p>We also seem to have a 'working memory', where information is messed with. These two systems are thought to work together. Imagine you've just gotten the bill at a restaurant with some friends. You read that your meal cost £80.00. You quickly count heads, and there's 6 of you. These two pieces of info get plonked in your short term memory the moment you get them. Then, when you want to do the maths, your brain will copy them to your working memory, do some maths, and save the result. </p>
<p>We don't really know what this might physically look like in the brain, to be honest. But there's a good amount of psychological experiments that back up this model. </p>
<p>Some stuff we think we know about long term memory:</p>
<p>It lasts possibly forever, but it seems to store information very differently to short term memory. We know that long term memory is very much <em>not</em> like a tape playing back information, but more like a set of ideas. When you actively remember something, your brain seems to 'rebuild' the memory from parts it knows are there. This seems to be a layered process. </p>
<p>For example, if I try to remember having lunch with my mother over the weekend:
The big ideas in that are lunch, mother, and the recent weekend. I have a collection of ideas that are all tied to the recent weekend. Two groups of those will be tied to the idea of lunch. One group will be tied to the idea of my mother. These ideas are probably related to the event I'm trying to remember. </p>
<p>The idea of lunch is strongly connected to the idea of a table, since my whole life I've been having lunch a table. So I'll assume there was a table there, and look for any ideas in my lunch-weekend-mom collection that are table-ideas. There will be ideas about shape, material, covering, and location in there, which will help me build a mental image of the table. </p>
<p>The idea of my mother is, similarly, strongly linked to ideas about face shapes that are like hers, hair colours that are like hers, etc etc. This means that I can easily rebuild an accurate image of her. Mom+table+lunch are all probably connected to ideas about sitting, and mom+sitting is connected to ideas about what my mother, and people in general, look like when they're sitting. </p>
<p>So on and so forth, until I've rebuilt a 'memory'. This is called 'semantic memory'. We think the connections are literally connections between neurons (brain cells). You can re-enforce a connection either by turning the volume up on the existing connection, or making new, duplicate connections between the same ideas. </p>
<p>The strength of connections matters a lot. I've seen lots of lunch tables, so I have lots of clustered ideas about lunch connected with lots of clustered ideas about tables. This makes it more efficient for me to connect 'lunch' and 'table', so I almost immediately remember that we were sitting at a table. </p>
<p>But I have very few memories about tulips. So while I may remember that there was a flower there, it would take me longer to remember that it was a tulip, since my brain has to scan through 'flower' ideas till it finds one that seems to fit. It'll take me longer still to picture it, for the same reasons. But if I stumble over more information about the flower (I might remember my mother's favourite cardigan, and that might be connected to the tulip because it's the same colour), then that gives me more pathways to find the right information. </p>
<p>Your brain also seems to take into account how important it thinks information is. Some of this is instinctive - if something is dangerous, nutritious, or might help you get laid (if we're being honest), your brain is more likely to think it's important. These ideas will make strong connections faster than boring ones, and so will be easier to 'remember'. </p>
<p>Repetition also tells your brain that something is important. If I learn a word, and then discover I need to use it constantly throughout the next two days, it gets flagged as 'important'.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Apparently every time we remember something the original memory gets overlaid by the memory of it, if that makes any sense, so if you’re remembering something from years ago you aren’t recalling it exactly, you are remembering a memory of a memory... x  however many times you’ve gone back to it.. that was what I picked up from a YouTube video on memory years ago</p>
<p>This doesn’t really answer your question but I always thought it was interesting so thought I’d share</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
