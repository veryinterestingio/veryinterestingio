		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you consume a lot of salt, your kidneys need extra water to process it.  It gets that water by making you feel thirsty and drink more water, and holding that water in reserve for your kidneys.</p>
<p>Your body actually handles both saltwater and salty food in the same way.  You are only in danger of dehydration if you don't have access to regular water after.  If you drank seawater followed by regular water, you'd retain water and be fine, if you ate a bunch of salty food without drinking after, you'd risk dehydration.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your kidneys need the water to process the salt. There is not enough water in salt water to process the amount of salt in it. You would need additional water to process the salt water so you would die if you only drank salt water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1 cup has almost 9 grams of salt.</p>
<p>a salt packet from standard fast food places is around .75 grams </p>
<p>so around 10 salt packets into 1 cup of water is how salty it is. sea water is almost deceptively salty but it's not even thirst quenching.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have two kidneys, they are in the lower part of your belly, sticking to your back from the inside. They clean your blood, like a coffee filter catches coffee grounds. Your kidneys are very effective, they clean lots of waste materials from your blood. Now you can't clean the mud on your bicycle without water. Similarly your kidneys needs water to clean your blood.</p>
<p>One of the things the kidney remove from your blood is extra salts. </p>
<p>When you eat salty foods, you add extra salt in your blood. Your kidneys will now need some extra water to clean it, which is why you'll feel thirsty. You drink water. Now your kidneys are working and they're slowly cleaning all the salt using the water you drank. Until all the cleaning is done, your body will keep the water inside, to help the kidneys clean properly. That means you retained the water. </p>
<p>In case of drinking sea water, it's the same process. You drank sea water which added lots of extra salts in your blood. Your kidneys need water to clean the extra salt. You'll feel thirsty. Now if you drank one cup of sea water, your body now needs one and a half cup of normal water to clean up all the extra salt in your blood. This is where the problem arises. If you don't have one and a half cup of normal water available, your body will use its own personal supply of water to do all the cleaning. Since your body does not have much stored water inside, you'll feel dehydrated and more thirsty. So you see, only cup of sea water made you dehydrated. That's why if you drink enough quantities of sea water, you can die of dehydration.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Instead of salt, let's say it's fire for this analogy. Your body naturally wants, say, 1 part water, 1 part fire. If you intake 1 part fire, you naturally need 1 part water to put it out. Ocean water is 2 parts fire, 1 part water. Sure, you get water and fire, but there isn't enough water to put out all the fire you're taking in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
