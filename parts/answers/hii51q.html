		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I got asked this on a work site before, I’m a geologist but a few of us couldn’t come up with a solid answer. I thought that maybe when it rains in the winter the smaller grains of sediment get washed away and fill in tighter spaces surrounding the rock. These spaces fill with water, freeze and expand. The expansion creates more space that then allows the process to repeat. As the smaller sediment is slowly pushed down around the larger rock it gently pushes the rock up.</p>
<p>Another geologist friend suggested the rotation of the earth pushing the rocks outwards but I was sceptical.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Frost is one reason. But where I live, there’s no frost. My property is little more than soil and sand covering an ancient river bed of cobbles. The cobbles work themselves up.</p>
<p>Put stones in a coffee can, cover them with sand, and shake it gently. The stones will float to the top as the sand works its way down between them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
