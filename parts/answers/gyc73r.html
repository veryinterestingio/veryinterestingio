		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For many intents and purposes, the nucleus is just a point at the center of the atom. In reality, it's not a point, it has some spatial extent on the order of a few femtometers. </p>
<p>And it's not quite the &quot;center&quot; of the atom either. What you really have is the quantum version of a many-body system, which classically would consist of multiple objects (the nucleus and the electrons) orbiting around their common center of mass. Particles don't really &quot;orbit&quot; in quantum mechanics the same way they do in classical mechanics, but the idea of decomposing the problem into motion of the center of mass plus motion <em>about</em> the center of mass still applies. Because the mass of the nucleus is much larger than the mass of an electron, the center of mass of the atom is approximately the nucleus, but not quite.</p>
<p>Responding to your edit:</p>

<p>Edit: The reason why I'm asking is that in one scene in Iron Man 2, Tony says, &quot;Jarvis, what does that look like to you? Looks unlike an atom, in which case the nucleus would be here,&quot; pointing to the top-right corner of the holographic projection of a spherical atom. </p>

<p>This has nothing to do with reality. It's a fictional movie, and they're not precise about scientific things.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some other comments establishing the location but of your post- I’d like to address the nucleus movement part.</p>
<p>You can essentially divide the atom into two important parts- the nucleus (which contain protons and neutrons, and hold mass of the atom) and the electron cloud (where electrons can be found- in a quantity matching the protons for an uncharged particle).</p>
<p>The electron cloud can move- as electrons are attracted to positive charge- and that allows atomic bonds to form, as one atoms electron cloud is drawn towards another positive portion of another atom. This will create an area of overlap between the two atoms’ electron cloud- which both atoms are attracted to. This overlap is known as the bond.</p>
<p>Nucleus’s will have can have their own movement, separate from the affects of electronegativity, and can vibrate in place as well. The more an atom moves, the more energy it has. This energy, when measured across many many atoms- is temperature. The faster all the atoms move in a space- than the higher the temperature of that space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Isn't the nucleus, by definition, the center of the atom? Even it moves, wherever it is is the center. Or am I wrong?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
