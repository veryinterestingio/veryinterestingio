		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can gene editing ,specifically CRISPR, be used to target no only specific sequences but also specific locations such as the pancreas to repair the genetic components of diseases like diabetes or would it have to be coupled with an antibody or activity target that specificaly targets these areas?
Thank you

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The idea of genome editing for many, myself included, conjures up visions of horrible accidents or spiraling dystopian futures. Has anyone earnestly quoted Jurassic Park or the like to you; something along the lines of, “Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether they could, they didn't stop to think if they should”? How do you, either individually or with your colleagues as a collective, re-educate and reassure those whose education in your field consists of science-fiction movies and literature?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
