		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is one of the things that makes translation challenging and exciting. Not only do you need to know two languages, but you need to be a wordsmith with your target language. When encountering puns, we first have to determine if the humor is essential to the meaning of the passage. If not, we can just gloss over the pun and convey the overall meaning of that section in straight-forward language.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If the humor is essential, than we have a couple of strategies. Is there a similar pun in the target language? If there isn't, then can we switch out some of the words to create a pun in the target language while still maintaining the feel of the original? Failing that, can we just replace it with a completely different pun that can still be humorous in this situation?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Sometimes, though, the language pair you are working in can make puns easy to translate or neigh impossible. With so many cultural similarities and shared vocabulary, working between, say, French and English would be much easier. Working between Japanese and English, on the other hand, presents serious challenges, as the languages and cultures are drastically different. Ultimately, though, all languages are complex, organic creatures. There is no fail-safe strategy to translating puns, and it is something you really just need to approach creatively on a case-by-case basis.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You never translate perfectly, that's a fact. When it comes to puns, you try to find something close enough. You try to aim for similar themes, similar structure, or to find an idiomatic way to wrap the thing up.</p>
<p>And sometimes, you're not even aware the name of someone is a pun. You only discover that much later when they are kindly asked to hold a door.
GOT translators had a very, very bad day when they found out. Believe me.</p>
<p>But we always manage something. It's what makes it fun. Translating songs is a bit like that, only more flexible. If you go and literally translate Disney songs from different language, you'll find they are the same, but different. But still the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was translating a speech over in Malaysia given by an American from English to Malay, and the speaker said, &quot;it's a jungle out there.&quot; It was funny in English because that's a saying and we were literally in the middle of the jungle. I paused mid-translation, and decided to just say that it was &quot;absolutely not like America outside of this building&quot; so that I could get them to laugh so that the guy thought that I did a good job translating it. So. Live translation makes it a little more difficult.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some puns can be translated, some cannot. There are even translators who try to make a pun somewhere else if they cannot make it in the same place as the author (like the Czech translator of Terry Pratchett's work).</p>
<p>It's what I love about translating - how creative you need to be.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
