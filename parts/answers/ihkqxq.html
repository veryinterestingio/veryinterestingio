		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tattooing involves the placement of pigment into the skin's dermis, the layer of dermal tissue underlying the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(skin)" target="_blank">epidermis</a>. After initial injection, pigment is dispersed throughout a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogenization_(biology)" target="_blank">homogenized</a> damaged layer down through the epidermis and upper dermis, in both of which the presence of foreign material activates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system" target="_blank">immune system</a>'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phagocyte" target="_blank">phagocytes</a> to engulf the pigment particles. As healing proceeds, the damaged epidermis flakes away (eliminating surface pigment) while deeper in the skin <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulation_tissue" target="_blank">granulation tissue</a> forms, which is later converted to connective tissue by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen" target="_blank">collagen</a> growth. This mends the upper dermis, where pigment remains trapped within successive generations of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage" target="_blank">macrophages</a>, ultimately concentrating in a layer just below the dermis/epidermis boundary. Its presence there is stable, but in the long term (decades) the pigment tends to migrate deeper into the dermis, accounting for the degraded detail of old tattoos. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First thing, it isn't true that cells replace themselves completely once every seven years. It's the &quot;humans only use 10% of their brain&quot; of cell recovery. <a href="https://www.livescience.com/33179-does-human-body-replace-cells-seven-years.html" target="_blank">https://www.livescience.com/33179-does-human-body-replace-cells-seven-years.html</a></p>
<p>What is true is that cells in your body die periodically and get cleaned up by phagocytic cells, leaving room for new cells to grow. Different parts of the body have different rates of this replacement, and a specific cell might die off earlier because of damage or trauma.</p>
<p>More to the answer of your question:</p>
<p>1) A tattoo is less like injecting skin cells with ink and more like depositing ink in the dermal layer, but between individual cells. </p>
<p>2) The phagocytes are for cleaning up a lot of things, but not really meant to handle the large particle size of tattoo ink. Laser tattoo removal actually works largely by breaking up the ink particles  into smaller ones so your body can &quot;clean up&quot; the tattoo properly. Tattoos will fade a bit over time on their own, though not disappear, as the smallest particles are removed and/or breakdown of the ink particles makes them small enough to be removed. </p>
<p>3) You could assist tattoo removal by removing a lot of the cells in the inked area at once, allowing the ink to migrate and diffuse. Methods of chemical or physical abrasion have been used for this purpose before and frankly sound incredibly painful. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;seven years&quot; is an average, many cell types vary wildly from that (red blood cells only live a few months, your heart muscle cells last decades, etc.)</p>
<p>in any case, your body isn't just cells stacked on top of each other; there's a lot of connective non-cell tissue. tattoos' ink particles tend to be too big to get cleaned out by your immune system, and so they stay embedded in that extracellular matrix and collagen and stuff</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your cells aren't replaced every 7 years.  That's a myth.  Many cells do replace themselves at varying rates, and skin cells are replaced regularly.  But much of your skin is made up not just of cells, but of a mesh of protein called extracellular matrix.  This is not replaced as quickly, if at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The study that this understanding comes from actually says that our cells replace themselves on average (!) every 7 years. So that’s already a big misunderstanding. Some cells supposedly don’t replace themselves ever in our lifetime, like grey matter (Neurons and other brain matter). Others do it a lot more often than every 7 years like the inner lining of our stomach. But to your question of why tattoos don’t disappear, I would assume that it has something to do with the ink which gets deposited in lower layers of your skin, and the ink then stays there. If it was just drawn on top it would probably disappear quite quickly.</p>
<p>Just read an interesting article in the independent about the reaction of the body to being tattooed which basically ensures that the colour is taken up by cells that then remain there to be seen. </p>
