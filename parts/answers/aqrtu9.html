		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_simplex#Prognosis" target="_blank">Some</a> viruses will integrate into the host DNA, and go dormant until they receive a trigger to reactivate, usually when the host is under stress or otherwise has a weakened immune response.</p>
<p>Some will simply be in areas that are hard for the immune system to get at such as the brain/spine, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV" target="_blank">t-cells</a> themselves.</p>
<p>Some coat themselves in host tissue (usually cell membrane), so have very few exposed antigens. </p>
<p>Some have high mutability and change as fast as the body adapts.</p>
<p>And <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebola_virus_disease" target="_blank">some</a> simply kill you before you have a chance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on where the virus likes to live. For a viral gastroenteritis or the flu, the GI tract is lined with immune cells that release antibodies and are protective against those cells. Not to mention that the GI lining is constantly regenerating itself and sick cells can be cleared out quite easily. </p>
<p>On the other hand, you have stuff like herpes and rabies. These are things that stick with you for life because they hang out in neurons and in the spinal cord. Your central nervous system has the blood brain barrier, which keeps most of the junk out. Beyond that, there isn't a whole lot of immune protection once the virus is inside. This is because immune cells can cause inflammation this can actually cause additional damage to host tissues. We don't want that happening in the brain. Furthermore, neurons are permanent tissues. While there is a limited ability to regenerate, they're pretty much there for life. </p>
<p>To sum it up, our immune system has an easier time getting to certain parts of our bodies (lungs, gi tract), but it has a very difficult time getting into the nervous system. These are just a few specific cases, and this doesn't explain viruses like HIV.</p>
<p>Edit - I'm wrong about rabies as explained by some of the comments below. I was labeling it as permanent since it's often fatal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Replication rate is one factor, also the level of virulence and the location which the virus takes up residence. For instance, the chickenpox virus (varicella-zoster) is located in the dorsal root ganglia of the spinal cord, because of its strategic location your body can’t send in virus-fighting factors. Inflammation is a universal side-effect for fighting viruses and your spinal cord is probably the last place you want inflammation to occur. Also being in the dorsal root ganglia is a great area to go undetected by the body due to the lack of cell-signaling molecules.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What about mono? I heard it stays with you forever and you can’t get it twice but it can become active again and you show symptoms. Yet you’re only contagious in the beginning. Can someone explain? I ask bc mono almost killed me. Worst case the DC children’s hospital had ever seen. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
