		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of other combustion products that can be more damaging than CO2. For diesel engines, one of the big pollutants of concern is ozone. Diesels don't directly make ozone, but they do make precursors like oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOC's). In sunlight these can react and create ozone and other stuff that's not good, and cloud cover really doesn't change that fact because these chemicals can end up above the cloud cover where it's always sunny. </p>
<p>Pretty much every city has a problem with ozone, because pretty much every city has a lot of cars that are already constantly driving around. That means there's a lot of NOx and VOC's just by default. By banning the worst contributors to that problem, a city can make a first step towards solving a pretty much unsolvable problem. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fine particle emissions.</p>
<p>Fine particle emissions are damaging to old buildings, particularly those with soft stone facades.  Many European cities have huge collections of such buildings, and a thriving tourism industry dependent on them.  I see fewer calls for this sort of ban in the US.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>NOx emissions and particulate matter (soot, the black cloud from the stack of old big rigs). Diesel engines burn hotter than their gasoline counterparts and a byproduct of that is nitric oxide emmissions. Soot is a byproduct of incomplete combustion meaning all of the fuel in the cyclinder wasn't used fully before being discharged into the exhaust.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because CO2 is not a human-health dangerous pollutant, while other pollutants like NOx and VOCs are actually dangerous to human health. CO2 matters for climate change, but it doesn't make you less healthy directly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
