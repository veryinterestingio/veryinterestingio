		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is exactly what it means. Countries in Europe like states in the US have specific connection points where they can share/sell electricity. The price you pay for electricity is usually an average but the generators and distributors and sometimes even large buyers are always negotiating the price. If electricity is too cheap in your area you are willing to sell your electricity for less than the sellers in another more expensive country, then you can sell your electricity to those other countries.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Despite the fact we buy energy from different suppliers, it all comes from the same grid.</p>
<p>The way this works is that the energy companies note how much energy they are supplying into the grid, and also how much energy their users take out. Ideally for each company the energy in = energy out, but where there is an imbalance companies have agreements to buy and sell energy between each other so that the grid balances and everyone has electricity.</p>
<p>The same can work on a country scale too - often the physical wires carrying the energy will be interconnected between countries, with agreements between the companies and governments involved to but and sell</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The act of selling power does not necessarily mean that power is actually delivered to any particular buyer.  </p>
<p>Power is openly traded on open power markets.  The electricity you receive at your house may have been traded  (bought and sold) many times, in many physical locations around the world before it got to your house.  </p>
<p>In reality, the power companies have to balance generation against moment to moment demand.  If they are not generating enough for any given moment, they must buy to balance.  If they generate more than they have demand for, they sell the excess.  They periodically true up to make the accounting work.  The markets help them achieve that balance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
