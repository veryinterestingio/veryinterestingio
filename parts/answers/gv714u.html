<p>I think to the stone, copper, bronze, iron ages and wonder how the technologies spread. Will patenting begin to hurt or help the development speed of material methods? (No patent, no funding vs. 'slowed' XX year improvement cycles)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am interested in the current push back against single use plastic.  I see the fact of plastic being such a cheap solution for businesses as a huge economic factor against this movement.
With your knowledge, do you think that people can influence a significant reduction in single use plastic?
Or will the economic factors in favour of single use plastic keep it common for years to come?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
