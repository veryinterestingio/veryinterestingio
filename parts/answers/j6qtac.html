		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This isn’t the best topic for ELI5, but I’ll see what I can do. The first evidence we saw is based on the speed of light. </p>
<p>At first scientists expected that light would move at a fixed speed and it would be possible to catch up with light in a really fast spacecraft. The earth moves around the sun at a speed of about 30 km/s, which is a decent starting point. If we saw light from behind the earth moving slower than light coming from in front of the earth, it would have proven this idea was true, and time would not have been able to be warped. </p>
<p>Instead we see that the universe conspires to keep light moving at 299,792 km/s relative to the earth, no matter what direction the light is coming from. If you were to be in an extremely fast spaceship you would still see light from every direction moves at that same 299,792 km/s. This in turn means it is impossible to catch up with light. The best explanation for this effect is that as you move faster, your perception of time changes.</p>
<p>Another piece of evidence can be seen by our gps satellites. Time moves at different rates on the earth’s surface than it does for things high above the earth. We have very precise clocks on both the ground and on those satellites, yet we always see that the clocks on our satellites slowly drift compared to those on the ground. The  best explanation for this is that the earth’s gravity is warping time, and the closer you are to the earth, or to any other heavy object, the slower you will experience time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is theoretical proof that that is the case, since for the speed of light to work correctly in the theory of relativity, you need time dilation to be a thing.</p>
<p>This was proven when gps came around: scientist debated whether they should account for time dilation from the lower gravity in the satellite orbit, and once they launched the satellites they discovered that indeed they needed to compensate, otherwise the system would drift by hundreds of meters per day</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To get to this point, we need to go back in time a bit. Back in the 1800s, people discovered that light behaves as a wave (also as a particle, but let's focus on the wave bit for now). Now, since sound waves and water waves move through a medium, it's safe to assume that light moves through one as well. In an attempt to show this, they did an experiment. In this, they tried to show that Earth drags this ether, as they called it, along with it like the wake of a boat. In one direction light would move slower than in the other.<br />
What they actually found was that light moves at the same speed, no matter what. This is a big deal (side note: also a good example of the negative outcome of an experiment mattering!), and it led people to theorize a lot, and see what the implications would be. One of these folks was called Einstein, and did a lot of theoretical work.</p>
<p>First he just considered stuff going in a straight line, and see what would happen. From this, he deduced that time and space are relative, and that simultaneity doesn't exist. Special relativity is a big thing, and has a lot to unpack, so I'm just going to focus on the time bit here.<br />
Let's imagine a train, it's hurtling through space at speeds close to the speed of light. On it, there are two mirrors: one on the floor, the other on the ceiling. Between these two mirrors, a beam of light is moving. Each time the beam hits the bottom mirror, some time has passed. Let's call that length of time t. Now, for someone inside the train, the light just goes up and down. And if the carriage is 7 feet high, the time t is about 14ns.<br />
Now we take a look at what someone outside the train sees. Someone who sees it passing by at an incredible speed. They'll also see the light going up and down, but they'll also see it going sideways, with the velocity of the train. As a result, to an outside observer, the light goes diagonally. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Time-dilation-002-mod.svg/1280px-Time-dilation-002-mod.svg.png" target="_blank">This image shows both side by side.</a> Because the speed of light is constant, the light beam the outsider sees takes longer for a round trip. So this rudimentary clock aboard the train is ticking slower to the outside observer.<br />
Einstein then went on to look at what happens if the train isn't going in a straight line, but what happens if it undergoes acceleration. Now, I'm honest, I don't really understand how all that works theoretically, but at lower altitudes, ie closer to the gravitational centre of the planet or star, time moves slower, than at higher altitudes.</p>
<p>But that isn't what you asked. You asked how we confirmed these theories. Well, there have been some experiments that showed this. For the special relativity case, the easiest to explain is the one with muons. These particles are created high in the upper atmosphere when sunlight hits on it. They are scattered around, and some move towards Earth. These muons have a very short lifespan. In fact, so short that they would decay before getting to the surface of the Earth. But we've mezsured them down here anyway. That is because they move fast enough to have a significant time dilation effect, meaning that they can survive just long enough.<br />
An example for the gravitational time dilation is a bit more complicated. Scientists have found that light with the same frequency gets its frequency shifted a bit depending on where on Earth you are, or rather how close to Earth you are. After all, the frequency of light is just how often stuff moves in a second. The results they found are in accordance with Einstein's theory.<br />
But then there are also examples of both at work at the same time. GPS is the best example of this. Because of how it works, an accurate time stamp is needed. The issue is that if you only account for dilation from velocity, or only for dilation from gravity, the results are off. But if you account for both, then you know where you are. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m surprised no one said this yet, but the first notion of time warping would be Einstein’s famous theory of general relativity. It explores the idea that gravity is in fact warping space time.</p>
<p>Without getting too much into the details, the actual physical proof was <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_May_29,_1919" target="_blank">the solar eclipse of may 29, 1919</a>, where in order for gravity to be the warping or space time itself, it must be able to bend light, which in itself should not be bendable as it is independent of any mediums (several other posts here had mentioned the experiment of “Aether”).</p>
<p>What that means practically is that you should be able to see stars directly behind the sun from the edges of the sun as the sun’s gravity should be able to bend and redirect the stars light from the opposite side of the view on earth. To observe this phenomenon, a solar eclipse is needed as the sun is far too bright. Lo and behold during 1919, there was a solar eclipse where upon close inspection, it appeared as tho stars were peaking out from the edges of the solar eclipse! Thus the theory of general relativity was accepted.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the simplest demonstrations that this is possible is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafele%E2%80%93Keating_experiment" target="_blank">Hafele-Keating experiment</a> from 1971. They took atomic clocks, which are very precise clocks, and synchronized them. They then loaded a few of them onto airplanes and flew east and west. After the flights were completed, they brought all the clocks together and compared them. The clocks told different times, and those differences agreed with Einstein's predictions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
