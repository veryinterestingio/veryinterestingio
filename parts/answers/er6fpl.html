		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tarter is caused by a bacteria that resides in your mouth, plaque. When plaque builds up it creates a biofilm. If you leave this biofilm on your teeth it will eventually harden which is commonly known as tartar. Toothpaste uses a combination of “cleaning” chemicals that interact with the biofilm to dispel it, however, biofilm are hard to get rid of which is why we use toothbrushes to physically remove it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your toothbrush and your technique are much more important than any toothpaste.</p>
<p>Make sure you're brushing and cleaning past the gum line to remove plaque that builds up there so that tartar doesn't form in the first place.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm9c5HAUBpY" target="_blank">This ADA video shows you how to brush your teeth.</a></p>
<p>Also, use interdental bottle brushes -those work better for me than floss- to clean the otherwise hidden surfaces of your teeth before you brush each evening.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dental hygienist here. It starts with plaque which is a biofilm made up of common bacteria in your mouth. It's constantly forming, which is why we brush &amp; clean in between our teeth daily to disrupt it. If it's not disrupted from a particular area, it continues to develop. The bacteria in the initial areas eventually die and provide a substrate for the minerals in your saliva to deposit, forming tartar (aka calculus), which can no longer be removed at home. The problem with tartar is that it provides an even more favorable environment for more biofilm formation.</p>
<p>Tartar control toothpaste uses tetrasodium pyrophosphate to inhibit tartar formation. It does this by interfering with calcium deposition on your teeth. If your hygiene technique is poor, or you have a higher than average salivary pH, you're still going to get calculus though. It also has the unfortunate side effect of making your teeth more sensitive to cold, because it prevents calcium from clogging up dentinal tubules, the microscopic tunnels on root surfaces.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tartar (dentists call it &quot;calculus&quot;) actually comes from your saliva, which contains minerals. That's why the tartar deposits most commonly appear inside lower incisors - where the major under-the-tongue salivary glands are.</p>
<p>Tartar control toothpaste has some kind of pyrophosphate added to it. This keeps a film of something on your teeth that inhibits the formation of the tartar.</p>
<p>This additive WILL NOT remove tartar, it will only lengthen the amount of time between required hygiene visits to remove it. And I guess, you may endure less scraping during the hygiene, which I find unpleasant.</p>
<p>See: <a href="http://www.icl-phos-spec.com/about/p205-applications/oral-care-dental/tartar-control/" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.icl-phos-spec.com/about/p205-applications/oral-care-dental/tartar-control/" target="_blank">http://www.icl-phos-spec.com/about/p205-applications/oral-care-dental/tartar-control/</a></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tartar control agents help prevent both the formation of tartar, a mixture of calcium phosphates on organic matrices, and the deposition of plaque on teeth to form tartar (calculus). Plaque is a critical reservoir of calcium, phosphate, and fluoride ions needed for remineralization. Protease enzyme levels depend on individual physiology, a tartar control formulation is of interest to one segment of the consumer market. Pyrophosphates act to inhibit the crystal growth (deposition) of the minerals in the plaque on teeth by forming a soluble complex with the calcium in the plaque, and thus control the tartar formulation. Pyrophosphates are typically chosen as anticalculus agents in tartar control toothpastes.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Brushing won’t remove calculus though, you need to have your hygienist physically removing it with scalers. Once it’s gone, brushing twice a day (with any toothpaste) helps keep it from forming. Also make sure you use a soft bristle brush and don’t use too much force which can actually damage your gums.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
