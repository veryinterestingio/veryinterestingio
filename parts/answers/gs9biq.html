<p>Experts don't have consensus on why yet (they haven't even confirmed it's an actual phenomenon), but a strong hypothesis is that climate change is altering the locations which are most conducive to tornadoes. Tornado formation requires a lot of weather and geography elements to line up, and even a slight change in average temperatures or wind speeds of various regions (these averages make up the climate of a region) could have significant impacts on the chances of the specific weather requirements for a tornado all being met at once in that region.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
