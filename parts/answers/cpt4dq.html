		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s easier to stack a cup that’s wider at the top than one that’s the same width the whole way up or one that’s wider at the bottom. It also makes it a little easier to drink, but I don’t think that’s as much of a reason as the stacking since just making it wide enough to drink easily the whole way down would also work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Slippery cup + wet hand = dropped beverage.</p>
<p>So, cups have this design so that as gravity pulls the drink downward, the flaring taper counteracts that effect keeping it safely in place inside your hand.</p>
<p>If the taper went the other direction, as you squeezed your hand tighter, you could actually force the cup through your closing fist (kind of like squeezing a slippery bar of soap and it popping out of your hand.</p>
<p>Also, it's WAY easier to store 100 cups if they all fit inside each other, than if they have to be individually placed on the counter.  Uniform width, and fat bottomed cups can't stack inside each other.</p>
<p>Edit: Typo</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When molding plastic it helps to have a &quot;draft&quot; or an angle, so when you pull the 2 halves of the molding tool apart, they separate easily without rubbing on the part being made, like the Cup. It simplifies the tooling and reduces the amount of time per mold cycle by speeding up the release. It also helps with stackability of the items.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
