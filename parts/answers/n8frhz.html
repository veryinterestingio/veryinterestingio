		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can actually answer this because of a podcast my 3yo son loves.</p>
<p>Two methods: Some birds will fly for weeks at a time non-stop, and they sleep in burst of only a couple seconds, and usually glide while doing so. They do this a few times a minute, so it builds up.</p>
<p>Others essentially sleep half their brain at a time, like some whales do. Like, they literally keep flying on autopilot while the left half or right half of the brain sleeps, then they switch sleeping to the other side.</p>
<p>Science-wise, we have NFI how animals do either of these things, but that's because we have NFI about the sleep mechanism in general.</p>
<p>Edit: NFI = &quot;No fucking idea&quot;. I wrote this on my phone when I woke up at 2:30am, so got lazy towards the end. Apologies for any confusion. Where I live, I think it's a normal acronym/phrase. My bad.</p>
<p>Edit 2: The podcast is &quot;Imagine This&quot; which is done by ABC Kids here in Australia. The ABC Kids Listen app has a few really good ones for young kids, from educational to fun to go-the-fuck-to-sleep. The ABC Kids Listen live streaming is geoblocked outside Australai, bit you can still download the app and listen to most podcasts anywhere in the world (according to their FAQ's). Also they have transcripts of almost all their podcasts for the deaf and hard of hearing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some birds have the ability to sleep uni-hemispherically. Meaning one half of their brain goes to sleep while the other half takes the wheel, and vice versa. This is how a lot of fish sleep too so they can keep swimming. In birds that don’t have that ability, I’m fairly sure I saw a David Attenborough documentary where some butterflies did an endurance flight across an ocean. Those who weren’t strong enough drowned, and those who were made it to land. I’m guessing this applies to the birds too?</p>
<p>Edit - for those asking for links etc, the book: Why We Sleep by Dr Matthew Walker is one of the most fascinating things I’ve ever read, and my source. Thanks for all the upvotes guys.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
