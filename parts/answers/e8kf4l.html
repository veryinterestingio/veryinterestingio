<p>Chiropractors can and do end up killing people by doing that. Here’s a recent example: <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.fox5dc.com/news/man-dies-of-broken-neck-after-chiropractic-treatment.amp" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.fox5dc.com/news/man-dies-of-broken-neck-after-chiropractic-treatment.amp</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Physical therapist here. If you do have neck pain or a dysfunction in your neck (limited range, impingement, headaches, etc) go to a PT instead. We are trained in many of the same techniques, however we perform lower grade mobilization. These techniques are often the same motion as a manipulation just not as fast. The big thing I tell all my patients with back or neck pain is the importance of exercise. If I improve the alignment of your neck or hips or back but don’t reteach your muscles how to move in the proper sequence, that joint or area of the body will simply return to the misaligned state as it has become the body’s preferred way of moving. My thinking is to see you a couple of times, improve your symptoms, and not see you again because my techniques, exercise, and a home program have vastly improved your symptoms. If a chiropractor tells you you have to see them every week for the rest of time, run like hell. All they are doing is creating a hypermobility which can lead to a host of issues down the road.
Bottom line, go to a PT, get good exercise, and get better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
