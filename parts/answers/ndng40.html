		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sexual dimorphism always has some evolutionary advantage due to natural selection. This ranges from something less noticeable like differences in size to something more obvious like coats, plumage, horns, etc. While all felids are genetically similar, each species has gone down its own evolutionary path based on factors such as climate, habitat, species that co-evolve, etc. This is true for all evolutionary traits in all species from insects/ birds/ mammals to trees and other plants. Even if an organism has a trait that is seemingly obsolete, then at the very least, that trait was once useful and is now just a residual characteristic. </p>
<p>A more direct answer to your question:
You may also take note that lions are the only felid that lives in groups, so the distinct mane of a male lion likely has more to do with their communal behavior (you can Google that, thereâ€™s quite a few theories)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lions live in prides while the other big cats are mostly solitary animals. Because these.prides have varying roles whereby the females hunt and the males protect the kill and the pride from other males, they need to be shaped differently. A large lion with a thick mane is like a tank that can take punches while dishing out pain to hyenas and potential rival male lions that might try to take over the pride or steal the kill.</p>
<p>This body structure isn't the best for hunting. Lionesses stalk in tall grass until they are close enough and then chase prey down. A large bulky body built for fighting is not a great option stalking nor chasing.</p>
<p>For tigers, cougars, pumas, leopards, and cheetahs this social structure with specific roles don't really exist, so the build is fairly similar. However, I think sexual dimorphism also relates to body size and some of the weight differences in the other species may be characterized as sexual dimorphism, but this likely has to do with males needing to compete for mating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sexual selection often occurs much faster than other forms of selection, so its not very surprising that sexually selected features can be distinct between otherwise similar species. The felines have just branched out long enough ago that there's been time to evolve sexual dimorphism but not to have vastly differing body plans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
