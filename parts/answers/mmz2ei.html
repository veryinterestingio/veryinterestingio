		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Geologist here. There are at a few basic reasons the water won't seep into the ground beneath lakes (from what I can remember off the top of my head).</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Some lakes are a 'window' into an aquifer, where subsurface water has collected and sat for thousands of years. This water can be depleted but as long as the incoming water is greater than or equal to the outgoing water it will remain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Soils (or bedrock) that make up most lakes have a low hydraulic conductivity (the rate at which water permeates through). Soils such as clay or glacial till are excellent soils if you wanted to create a lake. (Fun fact: many landfills are lined with specific types of clay for this exact reason so no pollutants will go into the surrounding earth). If you have terrain where water will pool and sufficient rain or streams, it will create a pond or lake.</p>
</li>
<li>A surface depression with incoming water may create a lake or pond as long as that water flow is enough to keep the water there. Over time dying plants and the deposition of silt and clay can create a hydraulically restrictive later, ie, peat and organic silts and clays.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are some great answers here.  I'm going to try to break it down a bit for you.</p>
<p>It's pretty obvious that water flows downhill.  It might not be as easy to see but water flows downhill where you can't see it too.</p>
<p>Imagine you are at the beach.  A common fun game is building a sand castle.  Every castle needs a moat, right?  So you dig down, and boom... you strike water!  You found the water table, or water level.  </p>
<p>The water table at the beach is <em>very</em> nearly the same as ocean level (or lake level if you are at a beach on the lake... <strong>spoilers</strong>).  If you go further and further from the beach the land elevation generally increases.  But the water table generally increases too!  At least near stream, rivers, and lakes.  So if you are in an imaginary house, digging an imaginary well, <em>near</em> a stream, then the well will be pretty shallow.  If your imaginary house is <em>far</em> from an imaginary stream, the imaginary well will be deep.  Don't be fooled by soil, clay, or rock.  They all hold bunches of water in different ways.</p>
<p>Here's the thing if your imaginary well was a few feet/meters closer to the stream, at the same height, your well would be correspondingly deeper.  The water, underground, is flowing downhill!</p>
<p>A lake (sea or ocean) is temporary place where the surface ground is lower than the water level.  Most of the time a lake is like a hidden waterfall moving water over the &quot;edge&quot; in slow motion and hidden from view.  </p>
<p>There can be exceptions due to spring fed lakes.  They can be <em>higher</em> than local water table because the spring that feeds them is from an artificially higher water table.  Central Florida USA is famous for them.  Water from &quot;high up&quot; in Georgia gets trapped beneath impermeable ground and is kind of under pressure.  It's positively asking to get out and up.  As it flows &quot;downhill&quot; to flat old Florida it finally pops out, making lakes and rivers galore.</p>
<p>Lastly all lakes (seas or oceans) are geologically temporary things.  Lakes silt up into marshes really &quot;quickly&quot;.  Seas too.  Oceans open and close all the dang time (geologically speaking).  In current news there is a volcano in Iceland going bonkers.  That volcano is on the Mid-Atlantic-Rift.  A place where the ocean floor is <strong>spreading</strong> and making the ocean bigger.  Other times it gets smaller, even till it has disappeared altogether.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both of these things are happening constantly, but the rate at which they happen (overall) is not fast enough to make the lake be empty =)</p>
<p>For water to seep into the dirt it has to have somewhere to go.  The dirt at the bottom of the lake is already saturated, so it can't absorb more water.  Usually you have to go pretty far away to find soil that can hold a lot more water for the exact reason you asked about.</p>
<p>Likewise, water is constantly evaporating from the lake.  But a lake only has so much surface area so it can only evaporate so fast.</p>
<p>In contrast, lakes are typically areas where lots of rivers/streams/runoff feeds into a single location (the lake), so they are constantly refilling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lakes are usually fed by rivers, streams, springs, or regular rainfall.</p>
<p>They do lose water to seepage and evaporation, and that water is replaced by new water coming in. If no water comes in, the lake eventually dries up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ground is like a sponge, it can soak up water but once the sponge is soaked it can't soak up any more.</p>
<p>Put the sponge in a tub the water can't escape through the sides and the excess water pools on top.</p>
<p>The ground under lakes is at saturation point so can't drain any more (or at least at a rate faster than water is being added by rivers).</p>
<p>If you've ever had a lot of rain in your garden you see this in miniature. The ground becomes really wet (to the point you can squish water out by walking on it) then if it keeps raining you can get puddles in the middle of your lawn.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
