		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Banks are reliant on the Federal Reserve to process most interbank transactions.  The Federal Reserve processes transactions once daily Monday through Friday.  Traditionally the Fed was closed weekends because it was a government entity and the government is closed on weekends.</p>
<p>More modernly it would be possible to automate all of this to update in real time.  However, banking regulations are written in such a way that they wouldn't really work if transactions were processed in real time/over the weekend.  </p>
<p>Essentially, banks needs to maintain a minimum amount of capital or they get declared insolvent and that declaration has a really big impact on their ability to function.  Banks are also encouraged to only maintain that absolute bare minimum amount of capital and most do.  This means that throughout the day they are constantly popping above and below their minimum requirements, but that's ok as long as they are above it at 8am every weekday.  So if a bank accidentally goes below its minimum capital requirements during the nightly transaction process it has a few hours to borrow money from someone else to get back above insolvency and this basically allows the system to work.</p>
<p>Typically Friday's transaction batch is much larger than the other days, which means that banks might be substantially below their capital requirements Friday night, but this also isn't a big deal because they have all weekend to fix it.</p>
<p>The banking regulations could be completely rewritten to account for real time processing, but frankly there's no point in doing that when the current system works fine and if money really needs to be transferred in real time its possible to do that, you just have to pay more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work with it systems in a bank in Denmark. I have not worked directly with the issue but coworkers have. I cant speak for other countries as this area is highly regulated and i think there is many differences between countries.<br />
One answer is that in &quot;old&quot; days there were not much computing power and you were reliant on the weekend to &quot;batch run&quot; alot of numbers and reports. When all systems are not doing anything it is easier to sum up accounts and stuff when there is not constantly being changes to the data. That also removed complexity in the code. Also in the weekend everything was closed so why would you make transactions ?<br />
Fast forewared to 6-7 years ago. The Bank suddenly got the project of removing this constraint. It is not needed anymore and the customers dont want the batch days where they cant get a correct amount on their account.<br />
The job here was to clean up in old legacy systems and remove the batch jobs that run in the weekend, to run continuesly. This was easier today with improved technology, better programmers with increased architecture understanding and ofcourse the improved processing power of todays computers.  </p>
<p>The main issue was that this is the code incore of the bank you need to change. So every system built on top of it has to be retested and often changed. I think this last step was what took the most time, not the actual change in the &quot;core&quot; code.  </p>
<p>Why have we not removed this constraint before ?.<br />
Its a massive project and the implications are hard to foresee. Sometimes we get caught in the &quot;this is how we always do&quot;</p>
<p>Tl:DR<br />
Because of missing computing power and for the simplicity we have used batch jobs in weekends.<br />
With improved technology and knowledge we can remove this constraint.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An extra bit of information that hasn't appeared in other answers:</p>
<p>In addition to the transfers between banks being blocked in weekends by the federal Reserve, many smaller banks are unable to do internal operations in weekends. This is because they don't actually own the software or computers that their bank runs on, but instead pay a company to do that for them. The largest company, FiServe, actually does turn their machines off for the weekend (or did in 2017 when I was working for one of their clients)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's an IT point of view of this (EU) - we need the weekends off to be able to upgrade/update/correct/etc our systems. The weekend is the only time we actually can freely take down our entire ''platform'' so to speak, and go nuts on it. If we were operational 7days a week, that would leave us with only 4 hours a night to work with (and by 4, I mean when you hit that 4:00 you need to be done done) - and the system would have to be perfectly up and running after it immediately.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Obviously, this would be a clusterduck because you would not have time to manage any errors/ newfound production issues/ observe systems and logs/ etc. Due to regulations, its is unacceptable that we are offline during ''work time'' - some systems operate on a limit with few seconds - downtime of even 1 minute is considered a super critical problem and would make the bank liable for some serious penalties. Other systems need to be brough up within hours, and some have a &quot;one time a day&quot; window - you miss it, you're in the toilet.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Shutting down a system and bringing it back up is a nerve wracking thing. Even when you are doing only a restart with no changes. Any glitch will absolutely ruin your day/weekend/week/month depending on how bad it gets, with ton of business people and regulators barging down the hallway screaming in panic and asking a million questions while you are desperately trying to get things back in working order.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I know this isn't exacly what is being asked, but figured people might like some more insight into what goes on behind the scenes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
