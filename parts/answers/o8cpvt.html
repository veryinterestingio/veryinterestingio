		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Same reason we eat the potato and the apple. Even though one is a root and one is a fruit. It is the 'good' part of the plant.</p>
<p>Edit: thanks for all the up votes and awards.
Also, many people saying a potato is not a root. In reply I would say that to a 5 year old they are.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Maybe people missed the 'GOOD PART OF THE PLANT' part? Plants have many parts, some are good for humans, some are not.
Some cactus is amazing, but don't eat the spines.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>you CAN drink the tea made by extracting the dried cherry flesh.   it's called Cascara.   it's ..   erm.   it is.    it's like drinking the most tannic tea you've ever tried, tastes somewhat like cherry, and has a mild caffeine buzz to it. </p>
<p>the Seed however is what was initially drunk, because if you leave coffee cherries out in the sun for a few days, you'll end up with a pile of dried coffee beans (or, more correctly, a pile of green coffee beans.).   the thing is though, they dont really keep all that well, unless you wash the cherry flesh off first.  </p>
<p>it's not too difficult to see that someone, in an attempt to speed up the drying process accidentally dry roasted a pile of beans..</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tea camellias don't have berries to speak of. Their seeds are in a husk with no real flesh or body. I don't think there's any caffeine in the seeds themselves either, but I'm not sure about that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>The same with tea. Yu could potentially put roots in hot water, but it would not have the same taste...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Tea&quot; is technically leaves from the tea plant infused into hot water.  &quot;Herbal tea&quot; is basically the same thing made from any plant other than tea plants.  </p>
<p>You <em>can</em> indeed prepare leaves from coffee plants in the exact same way and steep them, which gives you &quot;coffee tea&quot;.  It tastes much more like tea than anything like coffee.  The oils and flavorful compounds that make coffee taste like coffee just aren't in the leaves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
