		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ear is shaped in a very funny, but very specific way.  The shape of the ear makes sound very slightly different, depending on front or back, or even above and below (specifically not left and right, funny enough, but that's why 2 ears are nice).  The way you tell is more trained than an actual knowledge.  The sounds you hear from behind are always very slightly muffled, but your brain recognizes them as sounds it's heard before and makes them sound normal, but &quot;from behind&quot;.  This also helps explain why sounds you don't normally hear can be hard to pinpoint the location of.  Your brain's spacial mapping plays a big role in how you hear sounds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

This means that if you see something that should make noise it will help you locate the source of the sound, if you don't see the source your brain might interpret that information to indicate out is behind you. </p>
<p>Also, sound sources are almost always moving relative to you. This means that you also have movement information that can add into the equation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with the shape of your external ear. The structure is able to direct the sound waves into our ear. In the internal ear there are neurological pathways that cross over and the strength of the actual signal allows our brain to recognize if the sound is coming from the left, right, front, or back. There are certain portions of that pathway that when lesioned produce very specific symptoms. For example, if there is a lesion at the first point where the left and right signals cross over, we can hear sound perfectly fine but have no direction of whether that sound came from the right or left.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
