		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probiotics are colonies of good bacteria. Taking them is suppose to repopulate the gut with said bacteria, but if you get too much, if they have to fight with the existing bacteria and either die, or you are eating a diet that causes them to produce a lot of waste you will sometimes have discomfort. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your guts are host to a <strong>lot</strong> of different kinds of bacteria.  Some are good, some are bad.  The good ones are often in charge of digesting or otherwise handling substances that the human body can't handle itself, such as fiber.  Everyone's gut microbiome (the kinds of bacteria you have in your system) is different.  If you are lacking tolerance to a kind of food, and it can be resolved by introducing a new kind of bacteria to your gut, then there may be a probiotic that introduces the bacteria for you.</p>
<p>As for discomfort, try to think of the bacteria as little chemical factories.  They take in something the human body cannot (completely) digest, and start a series of chemical reactions, usually get get energy out of it.  At the end, they have some waste product that is typically spit out by the bacteria.  If there is not some <em>other</em> bacteria to put this to use, and the body cannot handle the waste product on its own, it may cause discomfort.  Additionally, having too many kinds of bacteria will cause them to compete with each other and dying bacteria usually make products that are harmful to people.  Frankly there are many reasons why discomfort can arise from usage of probiotics - I don't know very many specifics, but you are essentially introducing invaders into your guts hoping that they will help out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Most of the answers you see on here are about how they are &quot;supposed to work <em>in theory</em>,&quot; but they aren't regulated by the FDA or USDA and the companies selling them offer no proof of their advertising claims. Most of them even have a disclaimer about this right on the bottle... below all the descriptions about their &quot;wonderful benefits.&quot; </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You've got lots of little workers in your tum tum. They like to help you out with the foods you eat! There are some that help you get rid of the yucky broccoli, some that help you get rid of the cheesy mac so you can eat more, and even some that get rid of the things you love like your cake and icecream!!</p>
<p>Well bud, the more they have to work, the more friends they bring! So you've got your happy little workers taking care of the broccoli and mac and cheese and they're bringing all their friends, and it's basically a party goin on in your belly all the time and some of their friends even stay around a while and have their own happy lil belly families.</p>
<p>But you know how you feel sick when you eat too much ice cream? That's cuz the ice cream thieves all come in and steal from the workers which makes them and your belly sad. (This is a lie. You should lie to 5 year olds to make them be healthier.) Some of these thieves also stay around and they can build up ?</p>
<p>What we have here though are these little happy worker space ships! We can fly in some extra good workers and then your own belly workers get to make new friends! If there are too many thieves though they might all get in a fight and then your tummy will hurt! Also there's only so many that can fit down there!! If the party gets too big some of them are going to have to take the emergency exit..</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
