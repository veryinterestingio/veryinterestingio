		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know you said you couldn't think of a machine that could do that, but fabric factory owners certainly can!</p>
<p>It is basically exactly as you'd expect: vast numbers of sequins pour into the machine, which has multiple sewing needles. Each needle is supplied with a specific colour of sequin, and a computer controls which needle fires at any point therefore deciding which colour is placed where.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of short videos that will give you the rough idea: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGSE3YE6n3Q" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGSE3YE6n3Q</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jd5kW0AAYTY" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jd5kW0AAYTY</a> (neither are particularly high quality, unfortunately)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Essentially, take a solid, two sided sheet of the sequin material - solid colour or printed patterns; then use a sewing machine like a serger that instead of cutting the material, it holepunches out a piece of sequin and sews it on in one motion, then moves on to the next spot. Repeat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're trying to do one yourself it's really easy ( but a time consuming pain)</p>
<p>Just put a sequin on where you want it, and dont stitch so tight. Give it some slack to roll over</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
