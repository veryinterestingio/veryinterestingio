		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a humanitarian aid worker. Currently not working in camps, but have done it before. Feel free to ask more specifically.</p>
<p>For simplicity I will just be talking about refugees, not Internally Displaced People (IDPs).</p>
<p>Before talking about how camps end, lest talk about how they start. Usually through one of these three ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Governments/local authorities set up a camp. It is quite common that a host government set up a camp. They often do this with the help of international NGOs (INGOs). The NGOs may be running the camp day-to-day, but the final authority always lies with the host government</li>
<li>Refugees settle where they see fit. Refugees may set up for the night somewhere on the way. Then one night turns to two etc. An suddenly you have a camp. Quite often this are caused my external factors, such as a government not letting refugees pass further. Look up &quot;Idomeni camp&quot; for a good example.</li>
<li>NGOs set up a camp. This is quite rare, as NGO's usually work on the acceptance of a government. Governments rarely want to give up control. But it does happen sometimes. Good examples are some of the camps in the DRC during and after the Rwanda genocide.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, they can also end in many ways. If they end at all. Here are a few common scenarios:</p>
<ol>
<li>The host government decides to close a camp. The residents dispatch elsewhere.
<ol>
<li>I mentioned Idomeni above. That camp was eventually closed by the Greek government. As a result, many of the residents started walking south. Some setting up imprumptu camps on the way (all were eventually shut down as well) or settling in different, government-controlled, NGO-run camps.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>A camp may fall out of use. Maybe some day all the residents have returned home. Or have been relocated to a more permanent solution</li>
<li>Or a camp may never close. The more people live in a camp and the longer it runs, the more it will start resembling a city. If you were to visit famous camps like Za'atari in Jordan or the camps around Cox Bazar in Bangladesh, they may at times be hard to distinguish from a non-camp.
<ol>
<li>Sometimes they merge together with nearby cities or communities, appearing much like a suburb. Here the most famous examples are all decades old Palestinian camps, like Shabra and Shatila in Beirut or Aida in Bethlehem.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>There's lots of individual stories out there, but I'm looking for hard data and statistics on the long-term fate of refugee camps worldwide.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is lots of data available through UNHCR. It might be a bit difficult to find what you are looking for though.  <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/figures-at-a-glance.html" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.unhcr.org/figures-at-a-glance.html" target="_blank">https://www.unhcr.org/figures-at-a-glance.html</a></a>  </p>
<p>Edit:<br />
Thanks for the gold. Never thought I would get that from telling about my job. Next time I will tell you about how i just spent two entire working days yelling at an Excel sheet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All of your questions depend on a lot of different variables. For instance, how long a refugee stays in a camp depends on where the refugee camp is located, how many refugees there are, which countries are willing to sponsor them, when they arrived at the camp, etc. </p>
<p>Whether a population chooses to return also depends on the nature of the conflict (intrastate, interstate, ethnic) the level of destruction, length of conflict, level of displacement, whether genocide or population transfers were an aspect of the conflict, the nature of the ensuing peace agreement, the likelihood of violence returning, the number of parties involved, the nature of the claims/grievances, etc.</p>
<p>For example, most <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00045600903260671" target="_blank">Bosnians returned</a> not only to Bosnia but to their homes after the war. Only a fraction of the Jewish population after the Second World War, however, returned home. Tony Judt has a good account of return rates in the introductory chapters of <a href="https://books.google.ca/books/about/Postwar.html?id=10oPnprPjcgC" target="_blank">Post War</a>.</p>
<p>With all that in mind, however, although individual and group experiences will vary depending on the nature of the conflict in question, the consensus in the literature is that the majority of a population will typically try to resettle in a location as safe and as close to possible as their <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0962629811001909" target="_blank">previous place of residence</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, refugee camps are typically run by host governments in coordination with the United Nations Human Rights Commission's Refugee Agency.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can speak to natural disaster. We were in south Mississippi for hurricane Katrina. Virtually all homes were damaged and a major number of residential areas were just obliterated. There were many fema camps, including at least one school. Within a year, most people had repaired homes/found other accommodations/moved on. Of the ones remaining people began getting the option to purchase their fema trailer, and/or notice to start working out alternate accommodation, as it was never intended to be a permanent solution. I know that one middle school was still operating out of fema trailers several years after Katrina, but do not know the current state of that situation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
