		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Brussels Sprouts are regulated by TAS2R38, a.k.a. “the brussels sprouts gene”.</p>
<p>TAS2R38 controls the bonding of a specific chemical called phenylthiocarbamide (PTC). If you have the gene, PTC will be detectable to you. Sprouts and cabbages are laced with PTC. </p>
<p>I love the story of the sensitivity’s discovery. There were two scientists working in a lab, one was decanting phenylthiocarbamide, and had no idea the other could smell the horrific stench. Intrigued he basically gassed family members until he had a working hypothesis and went from there. While he didn’t have the ability to inspect the genes, it was clearly genetic in nature even in the 1930s.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every TAS gene is about this.  That's the whole point of the TAS(te) classification.</p>
<p>Tas2 is just a type 2 taste receptor.  </p>
<p>The shape of the question is problematic - almost everything has a slightly variant taste.  What you seem to want is night-and-day differences.</p>
<p>Those ones, like the cilantro, cucumber, and brussels sprout examples so common in here, tend to be that someone has inherited a defective taste gene that fails to pick up a noxious chemical.</p>
<p>This is actually quite common.  One of the human superpowers is we're really, really good at ignoring poison.  There's a reason you can't feed your pets half the stuff you eat.</p>
<p>And so, as our liver ranks, our tongues have learned &quot;oh, guess we don't have to worry about furolinase anymore&quot; over the years.  </p>
<p>Those are mutations that lose tongue protections we used to have, but don't need anymore, because what used to be poison has gone through the liver and is now food.  And so it should be tasty instead of noxious now, because as animals in the forest, we need all the food we can get.</p>
<p>Those mutations aren't universally distributed.</p>
<p>Those foul chemicals you're tasting were dangerous to our weaker ancestors.  They're mostly natural pesticides.</p>
<p>Caffeine, THC, nicotine, opium, capsaicin (hot peppers,) theobromine (tea,) and theoxanthan (chocolate) are all poisons meant to keep insects in check.</p>
<p>Delicious, delicious poisons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
