		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no evidence to support the claim that the horses' lifespans are so drastically reduced. All of the answers here are just speculation to explain that unsupported statement in the article. </p>
<p>The WHO makes no mention of reduced lifespan of horses during antivenom production in their guidelines; neither <a href="https://www.who.int/bloodproducts/snake_antivenoms/snakeantivenomguideline.pdf" target="_blank">here: &quot;Selection and veterinary health care of animals used for production of antivenoms&quot;</a> nor <a href="https://www.who.int/bloodproducts/AntivenomGLrevWHO_TRS_1004_web_Annex_5.pdf" target="_blank">here: &quot;The Ethical Use of Animals&quot;</a>. Those are links for snake antivenom production, but the horses would be treated the same.  And again <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12676433/" target="_blank">here: &quot;Report of a WHO workshop&quot;</a> they have a nice discussion about how important the health of the horse or other anti-venom producing subject is, but never address a drastic reduction in life expectancy. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23524-synthetic-spider-venom-makes-a-kinder-safer-antidote/" target="_blank">This NewScientist article</a> from the same year makes no mention of this adverse effect on the anti-venom producing horses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's two aspects to this - the first is that direct venom injection will (as one might expect) have a pretty significant effect on the animal's health, especially because a relatively large amount of material needs to be injected in order to induce a robust immune response and obtain good yield.</p>
<p>The second is that development of an antibody is not immediate, nor does it necessarily convey full protection to the foreign substance in question. In most typical horse <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:FpfLrxzuIZAJ:https://bezoar.georgiapoisoncenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Chapter_115a_-_Antivenom_Spider1.pdf+&amp;cd=12&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us" target="_blank">antivenom production</a> operations, peak antibody response is observed on the order of weeks, which reflects the fact that the proper B cells need time to be identified/selected/proliferate to produce appropriate antibody. While this is happening, the horse will continue to be subjected to whatever negative effects the venom may exert.</p>
<p>As a side note, presence of antibody alone does not guarantee full neutralization of a foreign substance. Older, so-called &quot;third-generation&quot; HIV tests looked for the presence of antibody, because a person would only develop antibodies targeted toward HIV if their immune system had been exposed to the virus - but we know that HIV infection essentially cannot be controlled without external intervention.</p>
<p>As for why brown recluse toxin in particular is so deadly to the horses (most antivenom production does not result in such dramatically harmful effects to the horse) and humans, it is reflective of how dangerous the toxin itself is. One of the major components of brown recluse toxin is sphingomyelinase D, which breaks down a component of cell membranes and leads to widespread cell death. This can lead to very serious <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/sphingomyelin-phosphodiesterase-d" target="_blank">complications</a> such as breakdown of red blood cells and platelets, which can lead to even worse multi-organ complications such as kidney failure and so-called disseminated intravascular coagulation (out-of-control bleeding and clotting due to the consumption of clotting factors resulting from microscopic damage to blood vessels).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
