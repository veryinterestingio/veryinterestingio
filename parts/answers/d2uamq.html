		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They do.
They are referred to as an MVNO (Mobile Virtual Network Operator).</p>
<p>They buy bandwidth on the host network at wholesale, and resell it at lower margins than the parent company. </p>
<p>Think of it this way...</p>
<p>Your local mini-mart buys soda from their distributor, who buys it from the bottling company. Each person adds a fee, as well as the mini-mart, and you end up spending $2 on a can of cola.</p>
<p>Costco buys directly from the bottler. Since they do so much business, they buy large enough quantities that the bottler will run trucks directly to Costco, so the local distributor is cut out. Additionally, the rent per square foot, and the staffing per product for Costco is much lower than for the mini mart, so overhead is lower. Because of this, and their overall business model, Costco is willing to work on a thinner margian, and bank on volume to make their money, and you might pay 20c for the same can of cola. </p>
<p>Buying straight from the wireless company costs more because they have to pay for customer service reps, stores, and advertising for each customer they bring in. The MVNO's buy in bulk, and spend less on all of these things. Many MVNO's have little or no phone-based customer service, no retail locations, minimal advertising (especially no primetime advertising), and overall low overhead, so they pass the bulk savings on to you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing that others did not mention is that MVNOs typically don't have the same roaming rights as their host networks. I.e. when you sign up with one of the Big Three, they would typically have coverage outside of their own towers through peering contracts with other operators in the area. MVNOs don't get access to those contracts, so they might have less coverage even though their base network is the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's possible to &quot;rent&quot; access to the cellphone network, and so for example, Ting uses the Sprint network, so for the minutes you buy from Ting, a percent go to Sprint to pay for the network.</p>
<p>The <em>amount</em> of access you have varies depending on Ting's agreement with Sprint.  You also may have limited options for roaming, or lower data speeds, that would be different from the regular Sprint customer because Sprint may not prioritize access for these leased-service customers versus their direct customers.</p>
<p>But, for the most part, the people I know who go with the cheap plans don't have any complaints, because they don't use the service enough for it for the difference in quality to be a problem versus signing up with Verizon to get all the bells-and-whistles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/spasticpoodle addressed how MVNOs rent time on other networks, but in regards to your question of why more people don't use them: </p>
<p>Generally speaking, you get what you pay for. Verizon (or Sprint, etc.) customers get priority on congested towers and get more speed. Verizon works internationally without a lot of hassle. Verizon has higher end flagship phones, whereas most MVNOs offer previous generation phones. </p>
<p>Most MVNOs are &quot;unlimited&quot; but throttle you dramatically when you exceed, say, 1.5 GB in usage. </p>
<p>As with everything else, there are different products to meet different budgets. My personal experience with MVNOs has been that they're cheaper, but not as robust and reliable as top tier carriers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
