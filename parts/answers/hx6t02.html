		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The human body’s natural rhythm is slightly longer than 24 hours. This makes it easier to be awake slightly after your normal bed time, and harder to be asleep slightly before your normal bedtime. This is a reason why it is important to go to bed at the same time every day, to train your body to be on a 24 hour cycle, rather than its natural cycle that is a little longer than 24 hours.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The need to sleep isn't only mental, it is also hormonal and involves many different systems in our body. It isn't just about making yourself mentally able to sleep, but you need to get your body to the state that it can sleep.  How hard changing your body changes from person to person, some people seem to be able to just lay down and fall asleep even after just doing something that would wake others up, others need a strict pattern and long calming down period to even have a chance at sleeping. Human body is controlled by many different mechanisms that all affect each other in a sort of a never ending feedback loop.  </p>
<p>There are thousand and one ways to change your sleeping pattern, but there is one thing that is common between them, it requires time and effort. How long and how much depends on your body.   </p>
<p>The worst thing you can do for your sleep, is to stress about sleeping. Best advice I ever got was to respect the energy you have. If you slept very little last night, that is OK, just use whatever rest you got and try again next time you should go to sleep. Sleeping poorly or little for some time isn't deadly. The longest human has gone without sleep has been 11 days. After 3-4 days (without any sleep at all) you will start hallucinate. But before that in a normal situation you have gotten to the point that if you just get in to any situation where you relax, you will fall asleep.   </p>
<p>Adjusting sleeping patterns takes time, effort and discipline. The best method is something that you have to figure out yourself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Once your body develops a rhythm, it takes a long time to change it.</p>
<p>There is nothing magical about it, and it is not impossible to change. It just takes time and effort.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s hard to reset, but the best way to change your sleep schedule isn’t to focus on when you go to bed, but to start with when you wake up. Go to bed at 2 am like normal, then set and alarm and force yourself up at 6 am (or whatever). Do that for several days, and you’ll be tired and want to fall asleep earlier.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because as you stay up later, your body will kick up its adrenaline production to keep you awake if it thinks it necessary (ex. You’re engrossed in a video game). </p>
<p>Combine that with the fact that our circadian rhythm is longer than 24 hours (as someone else noted) and you have a recipe for elongating your days waaaaay easier than shortening them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
