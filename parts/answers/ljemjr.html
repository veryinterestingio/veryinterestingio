		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cold causes your blood vessels to constrict, which causes more pressure in these areas. Smashing a finger is just applying hard pressure really fast. When you already have a lot of pressure, this is going to feel more intense and cause pain</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your blood is drawn out of your limbs when its cold to reserve heat for the core. That means ur fingers arnt getting as much fresh blood to flow over the nerves and sooth it. Blood and saliva have natural painkillers in them. This is why papercuts hurt so much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was sledding when I was very young in Indiana and my finger got caught under the sled. </p>
<p>I still remember the agony that was my fingernail being ripped off and a lot of skin going with it. There was also ice and snow on my finger and it had to be vigorously scrubbed because it was bleeding pretty bad. </p>
<p>That part was the worst. Hell no. I'd rather die.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
