<p>All of these fields can be expressed in terms of potentials, and the potentials can be expanded in a multipole expansion. The multipole expansion is an infinite series consisting of monopole, dipole, quadrupole, octupole, hexadecapole, etc. terms.</p>
<p>In all three cases the field due to a monopole goes like 1/r^(2), the dipole field goes like 1/r^(3), the quadrupole as 1/r^(4), etc. The 2^(L)-pole field goes like 1/r^(L+2).</p>
<p>So a point charge and point mass produce 1/r^(2) electric and gravitational fields respectively. If a point magnetic charge existed, it would produce a 1/r^(2) magnetic field too. But as far as we know, magnetic monopoles don’t exist. There’s nothing fundamentally stopping them from existing in theory, they’ve just never been observed. Since the monopole term is observationally always zero for magnetic fields, the lowest-order multipole that has a chance of being nonzero is the dipole, and the field of a dipole is 1/r^(3).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
