This is known as the motor theory of perception. &quot;</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It may be a by-product of the mimicry systems humans needed to evolve language. There's <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982209009154" target="_blank">a study by Irene Pepperberg</a> that suggests many other vocal mimicking species (parrots, elephants, dolphins (yes, elephants and dolphins are vocal mimics)) instinctually entrain to (mentally match, essentially) strong rhythms, while no non-mimicking species do. </p>
<p>There's also evidence to suggest that while most species can entrain to vocalizations of their own species, few can entrain to vocalizations of other species, and even fewer can entrain to artificial sounds. All of those that can are vocal mimics.</p>
<p>In other words, the ability to mimic sounds (a prerequisite for language) may involve or result in animals instinctually trying to understand/match/figure out how to imitate the sound. You can see how this would translate to music fairly easily.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From an evolutionary point of view, we still don't really know why human being like music. And yet virtually every civilization on this planet, likes some kind of music. Some call it an &quot;auditory cheesecake&quot;: something that doesn't have much benefits to our body, that we gorge ourselves on nonetheless. Some speculate that the rhythm of the beat mimics the one of our heart/steps, etc. But how could you be sure? Still, it doesn't explain why we all like it, something that everybody shares, and yet not vital. Maybe it's been useful for bounding, then it would make sense that you communicate it externally with your body in some way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
