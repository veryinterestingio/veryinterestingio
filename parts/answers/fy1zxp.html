<p>You get sleepy for two reasons. </p>
<p>Your body senses light and knows when it's day time and when it's night time. Based on the time of the day, it sets the time to an internal clock. When this internal clock tells your body its close to night time, it makes chemicals that make you sleepy.</p>
<p>Another reason you feel sleepy is that when your body uses energy, it makes chemical called adenosine. When you stay up for a long time, there is more and more adenosine in your body and it makes you feel sleepy. When you sleep, your body destroys this chemical from your body and that is why sleeping helps when you feel sleepy.</p>
<h4>More technical answer</h4>
<p>The level of a one's sleepiness depends on the time of day in relation to the their internal clock and sleep pressure.</p>
<p>The internal clock controls our physiological circadian rhythm in many ways. For example, it controls how much melatonin and orexin are released into our bodies. Melatonin is a chemical that helps us fall asleep and orexin is a chemical that helps us wake up.</p>
<p>The circadian rhythm is naturally synchronized, based on the amount of ambient light, in such a way that the middle point of sleep takes place at around 4 am. Although the rhythm can adapt to changes when we travel to different time zones, it can only adapt about 15 minutes per day which is why we experience jet lag.</p>
<p>Even more than the circadian rhythm, sleepiness is based on the so called sleep pressure. As soon as you wake up, your body starts producing a chemical called adenosine. As long as you stay awake, your body keeps producing more adenosine and it slowly builds up in your body. The more adenosine you have in your body, the sleepier you feel. </p>
<p>The effect of caffeine is based on removing or dampening the effect of adenosine. Caffeine prevents adenosine receptors in our body from detecting adenosine and thus alleviates sleep pressure. However, caffeine does not remove adenosine from our body which leads to a strong sleep pressure once caffeine is no longer affecting us.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting that your brain has what is essentially two separate systems in it, each of which is basically always trying to do its task, one to keep you awake and one to make you fall asleep, with their actions being mediated by various chemicals in your brain. The longer one of them is dominant, the stronger the pressure from the other one becomes, resulting in you eventually falling asleep or waking up. So, when you're fighting to stay awake, you're basically stimulating the part of your brain that keeps you awake and trying to resist the one that makes you fall asleep. These systems are always doing this and are kept in balance by chemical signals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The awful feeling of losing consciousness.  Sometimes I feel it slipping away and it snaps me awake for hours. It feels like drowning or death coming. Not pleasant. Most times I never notice it, but when I see it coming, the feeling of dread is awful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
