<p>Gunnery Chief:
This, recruits, is a 20-kilo ferrous slug. Feel the weight. Every five seconds, the main gun of an Everest-class dreadnought accelerates one to 1.3 percent of light speed. It impacts with the force of a 38-kiloton bomb. That is three times the yield of the city-buster dropped on Hiroshima back on Earth. That means Sir Isaac Newton is the deadliest son-of-a-bitch in space. Now! Serviceman Burnside! What is Newton's First Law?</p>
<p>Serviceman Burnside:
Sir! An object in motion stays in motion, sir!</p>
<p>Gunnery Chief:
No credit for partial answers, maggot!</p>
<p>Serviceman Burnside:
Sir! Unless acted on by an outside force, sir!</p>
<p>Gunnery Chief:
Damn straight! I dare to assume you ignorant jackasses know that space is empty. Once you fire this hunk of metal, it keeps going till it hits something. That can be a ship, or the planet behind that ship. It might go off into deep space and hit somebody else in ten thousand years. If you pull the trigger on this, you are ruining someone's day, somewhere and sometime. That is why you check your damn targets! That is why you wait for the computer to give you a damn firing solution! That is why, Serviceman Chung, we do not &quot;eyeball it!&quot; This is a weapon of mass destruction. You are not a cowboy shooting from the hip!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gravity is still a thing. As you get closer to or further from heavy objects (the sun, stars, planets, black holes, etc) gravity will pull you in various directions. Such things are not possible to predict without actually seeing which direction you're going to be travelling. You might even get caught in orbit of something like a planet.. or worse, crash into it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a prefect flat space-time? Yes.</p>
<p>Newtons law: an object in motion will remain in motion until a force acts upon it. </p>
<p>However any minor object, even as small as photons or hydrogen atoms will affect your speed.</p>
<p>So someone shines a Lazer at you, your speed changes, you get hit by the stream of particles coming from the sun, your speed changes.</p>
<p>You pass a large body and get affected by the gravity, your speed changes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
