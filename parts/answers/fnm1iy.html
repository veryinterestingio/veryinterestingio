		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Certain pills can cause severe esophageal irritation even to the point of an ulcer if they get lodged there instead of moving to the stomach. So things like iron, doxycycline, bisphosphonates (osteoporosis treatment) can all do it, so it is generally good practice to take water to flush it down and let gravity help by being upright. </p>

<p>PS You should know there is evidence that oral iron is better absorbed by being taken every OTHER day instead of daily. Seems counterintuitive but it is related to a hormone called hepcidin in the small intestine. I would recommend taking only every other day or MWF</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Iron is incredibly hard for the body to absorb. A really good iron supplement should be taken on an empty stomach, with a liquid form of vitamin c, and should be given 30-60 minutes before eating or laying down. Iron needs a very acidic atmosphere to be absorbed. The empty stomach and Vit C help to make your stomach acidic. But if you lay down, that acid can hurt the rest of your upper digestive tract. Donâ€™t chase with water or food though or it could undo the taking of the supplement in the first place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
