		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The things in the lotion,  when applied to raw or cracked skin from drying, irritate and cause the stinging sensation. </p>
<p>Skin damaged from drying out can be thought of similarly to a scrape. There's a bunch of small abrasions from the dried layers of skins losing flexibility and cracking slightly with movement. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on your skin, but it’s most likely the alcohol content. It could also be other ingredients irritating your skin. Personally, I can’t use skincare products with alcohol or fragrance.</p>
<p>Hurting or burning is not good, and will mean the moisturiser is doing more harm than good, so don’t waste your money.</p>
<p>I’d suggest researching common irritants in skincare products and try something without them. Good luck!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the lotion knows you're not going to put it in the basket when you're done. It is punishing you. You might get the hose again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had chronic eczema and I was covered in bloody scabs that my parents would bathe in Cetaphil. Then they would cover my entire legs, arms, and neck with bandages every night so I wouldn't scratch in my sleep.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It felt like my skin was on fire when the lotion was applied.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
