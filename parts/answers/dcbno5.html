		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This isn't necessarily a loss / retention example, but the chimpanzee / bonobo lineage has had a considerable contraction of their Y chromosome, resulting in the loss of a handful of genes and the pseudogenization of others. One specific lost gene of interest is USP9Y, which is involved in semen production. I've attached a citation that talks more about it, but they think that the loss of this gene might actually further encourage sperm competition between males, encouraging quality vs quantity for fertilization success. Evolutionary genomics might not be as sexy as morphological differences, but I still think it's pretty cool.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since I don't think anyone's mentioned this yet, there has been some suggestion that our hand shape (e.g., proportional lengths of fingers and thumb) has changed more in chimps than in humans over the past few million years.  <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms8717" target="_blank">Alm√©cija et al. 2015</a> studied this in detail, and their results suggest that the proportionally longer digits seen in some apes evolved convergently in chimps, orangutans, and gibbons, while gorillas and humans retained hands more similar to the ancestral condition for apes/old world monkeys (<a href="https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fncomms8717/MediaObjects/41467_2015_Article_BFncomms8717_Fig3_HTML.jpg?as=webp" target="_blank">see figure 3</a>, where branch colour denotes different categories of hand proportions).</p>
<p>Nice question also, it's always nice to see people thinking about this sort of thing rather than just assuming that all characteristics of another species must be primitive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are numerous mutations, pseudogenes, <em>Alu</em> elements, endogenous retroviral insertions, et al. that are unique to or within the <em>Pan</em> genus and that are not seen in the other great ape genomes, but it is difficult to find a paper discussing the phenotypic differences from these that make <em>Pan</em> unique. Not surprisingly, nearly all of the papers comparing genomic changes between <em>Homo</em> and <em>Pan</em> focus on the human-specific changes</p>
<p>One unique phenotypic change I can think of is the unique physiology of <em>Pan</em> genitals. While great ape genital shapes are varied across the 8 species, a distinct feature of <em>Pan</em> females is the exaggerated swellings in the perineal part around their ovulation period. In bonobos this is present even when not ovulating, so they always appear to be estrous to partners. Also, bonobo clitoral size is proportionally larger than in most mammals, and is frequently made use of for common female-female bonding (tribadism). These differences are likely contributors to the bonobo social hierarchy where females appear to be in a higher position relative to other great apes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way our scapula and clavicle are oriented allows for a pretty good overhand range of motion suggesting our ancestor species was a brachiator. Chimpanzees, Bonobos and Gorillas all have evolved knuckle-walking as their primary means of locomotion on the other hand. NB I believe knuckle walking in our closest primate relatives is the more derived trait, so it's not that they've 'lost' these traits, our lineage just didn't evolve them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I have a follow up question. It's my understanding that many of the traits that characterize hominids are neotenic--as in traits which are present in juveniles of common ancestor species but are not &quot;outgrown&quot; in the later species (I hope I'm understanding the concept correctly, this isn't really my field). Things like jaw structure, face size/shape, etc. of hominids more closely resembles the juveniles of our common ancestors.   </p>
<p>So, my question. Is the genetic information for the adult traits of chimps, bonobos, etc. no longer present in human DNA? Or is the information which directs the change in traits from juvenile to adult just suppressed? Or perhaps neoteny as a phenomena does not occur the same way from species to species? I'm aware of--I believe it's axolotl--which the vestigial &quot;maturity process&quot; can be can be artificially induced, is this just a random chance type of thing? Or is that how this evolutionary process just tends to happen?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
