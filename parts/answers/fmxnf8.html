		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>“While sleeping, the bottlenose dolphin shuts down only half of its brain, along with the opposite eye. The other half of the brain stays awake at a low level of alertness. This attentive side is used to watch for predators, obstacles and other animals. It also signals when to rise to the surface for a fresh breath of air. After approximately two hours, the animal will reverse this process, resting the active side of the brain and awaking the rested half.”</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Only half of their brain sleeps at a time. This means that they are still aware of their surroundings, and can escape from danger if need be. They are also able to swim to the surface for air. So, they sleep underwater quite easily</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>During certain months, hundreds of dolphins do their half awake/half asleep routine drifting down the Kona coast of Hawaii in the early morning. One of the best experiences ever is swimming alongside them as they do this. Highly recommend! Just don’t bother them or try to touch them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to live in a house on Sydney's northern beaches right on the edge of a cliff on the water's edge.  One late afternoon I noticed a pod of humpback whales seemingly lifeless with their heads down in the water beneath my balcony.  They were still there early next morning so I emailed the National Parks &amp; Wildlife experts.  They emailed me back telling me this was how they slept and called it &quot;logging&quot; saying much the same as the top comment.  What a privilege!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
