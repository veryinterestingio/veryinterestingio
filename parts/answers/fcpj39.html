		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As the other user already stated this is usually considered as part of the cocktail party effect, the reason it happens is because of the way our brain perceives information and “chooses” what to pay attention to. </p>
<p>Hearing your name has a relative small threshold and therefore bypass the filter that your brain uses when determining what to pay attention to. Once you hear your name attention is diverted to that sound. </p>
<p>Uncommon or unimportant words to you have a high Threshold and won’t trigger your brain to pay attention to them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I took some Psychology classes in University and I believe it has something to do with the Cocktail Party Effect.</p>
<p>Similar to being at a party, with lots of noise, the brain is able to filter out that noise of the party and focus onto something specific, such as your named being called out among that noise. </p>
<p>Basically our brains have the ability to chose which noises (stimuli) are important among many others.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Years and years ago had some friends notice this while having lunch at E3. Sitting around chatting when through the din of the crowd the only word that could be recognized was &quot;EverQuest&quot;. Ever since then we've referred this phenomenon as &quot;blah blah, EverQuest, blah blah&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's your brain, not your ears. You filter out all kinds of incomprehensible noise all the time. Your name is instantly familiar to you and is therefore not filtered out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Reticular Activating System. I know a lot of people on here are talking about the Cocktail Party Effect, and using computer or internet analogies but it's actually the RAS, a small part of the brain which is a bundle of neurons that are responsible for essentially, (in laymans terms), filtering things out and letting important things through. It not only works with your own name but anything that is important to you, like the names of your children. It's also the reason why, when you learn a new word, you hear that word being used everywhere, or in the case of one freind who bought a new Subaru, began to notice Subarus everywhere. </p>
