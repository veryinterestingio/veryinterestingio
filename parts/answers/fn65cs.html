		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to make clear &quot;repressed memories&quot; isn't a medically sound diagnosis. There are known issues related to people struggling with memories around a traumatic event or time. </p>
<p>The two more common issues are:</p>
<p>Denial- Something really traumatic happens and as a protective measure, your brain won't allow  a solid memory to form the way a pleasant memory would. Your brain is literally denying an event ever happened. </p>
<p>Diassociation- During a traumatic event your brain refuses to accept it/checks out. You kinda start experiencing the event like someone watching a movie, it's not really happening to you. At it's most extreme you can lose time all together and your understanding of what happened can differ extremely from the reality of it.</p>
<p>ETA:</p>
<p>The idea of &quot;repressed memories&quot; is hotly debated within professional circles, and people should be wary of &quot;memory retrieval&quot; therapies as they haven't been proven 100% sound and false memories are a known phenomenon. </p>
<p>In disassociation and denial, your brain is still forming memories, they just don't look 100% right. Sort of the difference between a photograph of something and a stick figure drawing you are trying to do with your non-dominant hand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Memories aren't like video recordings that you can rewatch, with the file being exactly representative of what you recorded every time you open it. </p>
<p>A memory is more like 1000s of little Christmas lights that activate into a recognisable 'image' when you push the button.</p>
<p>Following that analogy, the brain can 'disconnect' the lights from the electricity so it doesn't form the lightshow when you push the button. Or the brain didn't write down how the lights were arranged at the time so it doesn't know how to put them back together. Or it messed up the arrangement or wiring so it either looks like something else or only part of it lights up giving an incomplete image.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Researchers have found little evidence of repressed memories where memories of entire parts of someone's lives are missing and recovered by therapies like hypnosis or leading questions. Repression is more typically like the avoidance of recalling memories that sometimes occur as part of PTSD or similar disorders.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
