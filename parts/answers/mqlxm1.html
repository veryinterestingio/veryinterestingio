		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, instant coffee is freeze dried. It is first brewed, either by immersing the beans into water, or by forcing water through them, and then it us freeze dried. This is done by finding the sweet spot of temperature and pressure so the water goes from solid to gas without it boiling off.</p>
<p>This process means the coffee is not burnt or scorched from boiling it, and the resulting coffee residue is very porous, so it will dissolve really easily when water is added back.</p>
<p>Espresso is made by forcing water through ground coffee beans at high pressure to get the shot of espresso.</p>
<p>The difference between these two processes is that there is a lot of things that are done to the instant coffee before it arrives in the store, and a lot of time as well. You can get roasted coffee beans, or even roast them yourself at hime, grind them, and then make yourself an espresso. It will be a lot fresher than the instant coffee, and will likely have more complexity, because it has not been done on an industrial scale.</p>
<p>As to what you prefer, that is up to you. I find instant coffee to have an unpleasant gravy-like taste to it, and am willing to spend the extra time to have freshly ground espresso.</p>
<p>Others will find instant coffee perfectly palatable, which is perfectly fine, as it is all down to preference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Much like a lot of frozen or dried / canned goods, certain &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatile_organic_compound" target="_blank">volatile organics</a>&quot; and other flavour-carrying components of the coffee don't survive the process intact, whereas grinding a bean and immediately making a fresh cup of coffee from it gives them no time to escape or oxidise or otherwise break down or get lost.</p>
<p>It's a little bit like how fruit &amp; vegetables go mouldy if you leave them, wine goes corked (and turns to vinegar) if air gets in, etc. etc...</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>FLAVOR. There are many, many flavor components in coffee. The freeze-drying process results in the loss of many of them. That’s why freeze-dried coffee tastes bland or processed compared to a freshly pulled shot of espresso.
Incidentally, Starbucks’ freeze-dried coffee ain’t that bad, because in addition to freeze-dried coffee they’ve added some “micro-ground” roasted coffee beans to add (back) extra flavor and body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All answers here are about instant coffee like Folgers, but not fresh beans you ground yourself.</p>
<p>If I ground my own fresh roasted beans, what's the difference between a coffee maker and espresso? Is it just that with less contact with the grounds, espresso has less of the undesirable tannins?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
