		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They likely work for preventing C. Diff infection in patients who have been taking antibiotics, based on a <a href="https://www.cochrane.org/CD006095/IBD_use-probiotics-prevent-clostridium-difficile-diarrhea-associated-antibiotic-use" target="_blank">meta analysis of 39 randomised controlled trials</a>. </p>
<p>The evidence for other benefits from probiotics is not as strong. There isn't a good standard for reporting such studies to disclose the strains used, how dosage is regulated, how controls are defined, how well those strains &quot;take&quot; within the GI tract. Mostly, studies give people a dose and then check for any beneficial effects, which means that they are susceptible to other factors which are not necessarily associated with probiotic colonisation of the gut.</p>
<p>For example, most probiotics are delivered in yoghurt. Let us say you have an experiment comparing bacteria + yoghurt, and plain yoghurt. People drinking the bacteria+ yoghurt are healthier, does that mean the &quot;good&quot; bacteria has colonised the gut ? No, because the bacteria can digest the yoghurt and produce nutrients which can produce health improvements. </p>
<p>So I can still imagine that they are getting health benefits from the probiotic regimen. But it may not be due to &quot;good bacteria&quot; settling in their digestive tract, and it could be a number of other factors. </p>
<p>Even if we discount the nutrient content of the probiotics themselves, other behavioural factors can play a role.  If the commitment to be healthy is altering their decision making, then they may see positive results which they can attribute to the probiotics colonising the gut.</p>
<p>I'm not saying that probiotics can't work for improving health, but the evidence isn't clear yet due to a number of factors, including (but not limited to) the potential confounders I have mentioned above.</p>
<p>If your friends are seeing benefits, more power to them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Microbiome bioinformaticist here.</p>
<p>It helps with very few diseases if any besides C diff mildy. Might help your GI tract a tad.</p>
<p>Pretty much all the leaders in the field from the microbiome conferences I've been to seem doubtful at best that it does much more than that. Those probiotic species rarely establish themselves in your gut long term. FMT(fecal transplant) is what the field seems interested in atm because it has helped some people immensely, but it needs more research to see if it could help more broadly.</p>
<p>Edit: More backing for this, a huge percentage of the top specis in the gut based on the Human microbiome project samples seems to be Bacteriodes, Faeculbacterium, Alistripes, akkermansia etc. Not lactobacillus and bifidobacterium that are commonly found in probiotics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Immunologist here.  There are some beneficial effects from taking probiotics.  However, they are not long lasting.  As soon as one stops taking probiotics the beneficial effects go away.  This has also been observed with fecal transplants for the treatment of IBD with only transient improvements in clinical outcomes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
