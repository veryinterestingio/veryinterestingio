<p>When you get enough sleep, you feel as though time has passed, because part of getting enough REM sleep cycles per night, your brain will records some fragments of memories and/or dreams.  That's why you sometimes remember parts of a dream, or have an instinct to know that you were rolling around.  Usually not with a high detail, but enough for your brain to at least keep track of time passing.</p>
<p>If you fall asleep and feel like you woke up a moment later, but hours DID in fact pass, it's a sign that you're probably not getting a deep enough / long enough sleep for your brain to do the multiple REM cycles it needs each night.  You might be getting zero or one REM cycle in max before you're woken up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
