		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not much anymore, but 60 years ago when you could get a gallon of gas for a quarter gas stations actually used that fraction of a cent spot to set prices.</p>
<p>They're measuring your purchase to the thousandths of a gallon, so most people technically end up owing some fraction of a cent anyway.</p>
<p>As the price went up, changing that last tenth of a penny became pointless and stations began permanently setting it at 9 - so much so that most newer stations have it permanently painted on.</p>
<p>I've seen both the $X.XX9 and the 9/10ths variants.  They round to the nearest cent when billing you, not always up to the next cent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Canada, you see similar pricing but also different because metric.  We see prices like 97.7 cents per liter.  “Back in the day when gas was cheap” (sorry euro friends) you’d almost always see xx.9 as the price.  Now stations mostly use the last digit for pricing wars.  They’ll undercut the next guy by 0.2 or 0.3, which looks cheaper but really is only a marginal amount.  Rounding happens as described elsewhere here, on the TOTAL amount, and is done using correct rounding rules.  On top of all that, we don’t have pennies (because pennies are dumb), so if you pay cash, you get rounded again on top of the tenth cent rounding.  If you pump $60.02 (after the first rounding) and you pay cash, you only actually pay $60.00, if you pump $60.03, you pay $60.05 cash.  Debit and credit, you still pay accurately down to the cent.  Bonus fact: our cents are smaller than yours too, so we’re splitting a smaller cent on a smaller volume of gas, so we’re really splitting hairs up here!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some people in this thread are extremely confused. Gas stations do not &quot;round up&quot; - the tenth of a penny less is definitely included in the price (check the next time you fill up - if you buy more than 5 gallons you should be able to detect it). Almost every retailer rounds in one direction or the other on every purchase *on the final price* because of sales tax, and they do it in the correct direction - less than half a cent, down, more or equal, up. So if you bought one gallon at a time, you'd be getting rounded up every time. But if you buy 5.01 gallons, you'll be getting rounded down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here (Ireland, and EU in general) petrol is sold by the cents per litre, priced also to the one-tenth of a cent.  My local petrol station is 147.7 at the moment (so €1.477/l, or USD$5.952/gallon).</p>
<p>It used to be the case that the stations here were all xxx.9 for a similar reason to the 9/10 you see at your US gas stations, but recently some have started changing that last tenth of a cent.  I've seen stations beside each other where one was xxx.9 and the other xxx.8, thus looking cheaper.  If you were to buy 50 litres of petrol this would amount to a 5c difference in the total price -- not totally insignificant.  (or for €50 you get an extra 34ml of petrol == 1.15 fl oz)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
