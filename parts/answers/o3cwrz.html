		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A related question to this, why is my right hand colder than my left hand? Seriously, my right hand which I use for mouse on my pc feels like an icicle while the left hand which is most of the time on the keyboard is nowhere near as cold.</p>
<p>Edit: Alright, after reading all these, the solution was quite simple. To not put too much pressure on my right wrist. No need for doctors or similar. I couldn't even afford one if that was the case.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
