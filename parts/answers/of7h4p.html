		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a polymer chemist actively trying to develop competitive sustainable polymers. Unfortunately the simple answer is the field just isn't there yet. We cannot compete with the physical properties of petrol based plastics yet. There are also huge economic hurdles to overcome. That's the unfortunate but straightforward reality.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the last 70 give or take years we have designed and built everything around petroleum based polymers. Likely billions have been spent on machinery during that time. Even if hemp polymer was amazing in multiple ways compared to petrol polymer besides being biodegradable you would need to convince how many thousands of companies world wide to make a huge investment in money, time, or both to change. Let's say the equipment has to be completely different, you have to convince them to reinvest into new equipment when their current stuff works fine. Maybe you don't need new equipment, but if you are going to make this change you need to make everything you currently make and retest it with this new material. Maybe hemp poly makes your product less durable. Make sense?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Money.</p>
<p>The petroleum &amp; manufacturing companies are looking to make as much profit as possible.</p>
<p>Once hemp or other alternatives start to really compete on price, things will change.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Combination of reasons:</p>
<p>Biggest in my mind is cost as others said.  Petroleum is cheaper.  Often it's cheaper to make new plastics than to recycle - specifically Styrofoam.</p>
<p>Material properties also matter.  There are many types of plastic.  There are six types of unique chemical structures and properties just in the recycling program with many more.  Some properties can be imitated, and when prices match or customers prefer the non-petroleum version it gets used.</p>
<p>Shelf life is the last hurdle.  Petrol products will last for as long as needed on a store shelf.  A biodegradable plastic needs to maintain integrity for shelf life or life of use (non food packaging) but still degrade when disposed.  It isn't easy to control when that happens.</p>
<p>Progress is being made though.  Small purchases add up to incentivize companies to change what they use.  As the non-petrol products gain popularity, they'll get more funding to perform better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
