		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a really great question, but anxiety is much, much more complicated than being caused by a lack of serotonin. As I assume you know if you are asking this, drugs that change serotonin signaling like SSRIs and SNRIs are more effective than placebo on average for treating anxiety. Some people interpret this as meaning that anxiety is caused by lack of serotonin, but this is an extreme and misleading oversimplification. </p>
<p>It seems that SSRIs and SNRIs treat anxiety partly by calming down a part of the brain called the amygdala (often called the brain’s “fear center” in popular science books/articles). These medications can also allow other parts of the brain to connect more strongly to the amygdala in a way that quiets it down as well (in technical terms: increased inhibitory modulation from the prefrontal cortex). The exact chemical pathways that lead to these changes are still somewhat mysterious. </p>
<p>The gut-brain axis also affects serotonin signaling in the brain, but the role or significance of gut-brain signaling in anxiety disorders is still mostly unknown. However, it is known that there are a lot of different ways for your gut to talk to your brain and vice versa, and many of these signaling pathways involve serotonin. Depending on where in the brain the activity is and what kind of activity it is, increasing serotonin signaling from the GI tract can lead to anxiety or other perceptual states (for example, nausea/vomiting is also a common effect of increased serotonin signaling resulting from gut-brain communication). Sometimes, increasing serotonin signaling in the gut can decrease anxiety (look up the probiotic L. rhamnosus if you want further reading). </p>
<p>tldr: anxiety is more complicated than this, and gut-brain communication can have many different effects that depend on the context (not always increased anxiety).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other posters make great points that our neurobiology is vastly more complicated than most people think, but it’s also important not to make the mistake of biologism which states that who we are and how we think/feel is totally a product of our biological makeup. </p>
<p>Our thoughts/feelings/environment affect our biology just like how our biology affects our thoughts and feelings - it’s not a one way street.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Anxiety is not just caused by lack of serotonin. If that was the case then SSRIs would be extremely effective at dealing with anxiety, but they are not. </p>
<p>Many people are helped by benzos, which work on the GABA receptors (alcohol does too) and don't touch serotonin. </p>
<p>It's a complicated issue with no real answers yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think anyone else mentioned this previously in this post, there are several good comments here, but serotonin does cause inflammation in the gut lining.  Also, Serotonin in the gut is produced seperately from that inside the blood brain barrier and begins immediately after introducing Vitamin D into the environment.  This inflammation based irritation can be mitigated by taking your fluid Vitamin D supplements with food.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Anxiety has to do with something that causes a mixup between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, not serotonin. SSRIs happen to help, but so do many other, non-serotonin substances. So it's easy to conclude that it's not a serotonin issue, but rather one we don't quite understand, like most things involving the brain and nervous systems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
