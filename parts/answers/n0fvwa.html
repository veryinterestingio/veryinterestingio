		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Math is way more universal than language. You can change words and their definitions, but you can't change logic.</p>
<p>Although the old Babylonians split numbers in steps of 12 rather than 10.</p>
<p>Most peoples split them into steps of 10 because that's how many fingers we have.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, yes and no. A few advanced civilizations (including one American one) were able to derive the trigonometric ratios, but in general people learned them from the Indians. The Babylonians and Egyptians were generally aware of the trig ratios but it was the Greeks that were able to (Hipparchus of Nicaea) created the first trig table. The Indians learned in the 12th century and we use their terminology in modern math. Algebra (invented by a gentleman named Al Kharizmi) solved problems that previously required complicated geometry. This was learned by Europeans like Descartes who advanced mathematics significantly. Then calculus came along by later Europeans. </p>
<p>So, really, we all use the same math because it all came from the same place. That place is generally ancient Greece and Baghdad (we systematically undre-represent the Arab contributions to modern science) for the fundamentals and then Renaissance Europe for advanced algebra and calculus. </p>
<p>Math has had a far shorter evolution than spoken and written language, and since it is practiced by far fewer people its evolution forks less frequently. Not everyone in the world will know algebra, but everyone in the world will speak a language. With that many contributors fast evolution is realistic, leading to wildly different languages like Mandarin and English. Math isn't similar in that respect, it is practiced and understood by not nearly as many people, and the people that do tend to come from educated households, so sticking to tradition and learning it without bastardizing it into your own language or methods is more practical. It is why we still use Latin and Greek in the sciences, we could anglicize everything but the only people who use that lexicon regularly will know enough Latin and Greek that it isn't a problem. There is no pressure to adjust that vocabulary to one spoken by the general population. </p>
<p>TLDR; Most people learned math from the same sources as one another, so the opportunity for evolution in terms of a unique language is small. Additionally, those who become intimately familiar with the art tend to take on the vocabulary of the art, as opposed to changing the vocabulary to a local dialect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many answer mention the universality of math, which is true (and a great philosophy discussion)</p>
<p>However, math looked really different in the past, or in ancient culture. Old math is mostly text, the usage of symbols appeared only with calculus (\~16-17th century)</p>
<p>So yes many different culture developed mathematical method to calculate the perimeter of a circle, but it doesn't mean that they could use other's discovery that were using very different form</p>
<p>Nowadays math are very well standardized, and the main reason for math is not its universalism but colonialism and cultural expansion of Europe</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Math is not as human invention, it's a human discovery.  Math is a constant.  It's the building blocks of the universe.</p>
<p>Language is simply something that we made up in order to communicate and different people will have made it up differently.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>how come math has been able to stay globally consistent</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The simple answer is that Math was only used by a few, and developed throughout the world. When ~95% of the population is illiterate, it's easy to spread a single kind of math worldwide, but those 95% still speak their own language.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
