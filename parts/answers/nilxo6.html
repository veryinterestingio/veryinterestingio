		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have spent much time looking for any type of study or experiment finding a link between inoculum and severity of symptoms of Covid.</p>
<p>But of course, I could not find one, because purposely infecting subjects with various levels of SARS-CoV-2 to see levels of Covid symptoms in unethical. And there does not seem to be a way to determine level of inoculum post accidental infection.</p>
<p>However, the closest experiment to what you are asking involves the purposeful infection of Syrian Golden Hamsters with SARS-CoV-2. The hamsters suffer symptoms and:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using the Syrian hamster model, we demonstrate that the severity of pneumonia induced by the intranasal inhalation of SARS-CoV-2 increases with virus inoculum.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379120301634" target="_blank">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379120301634</a></p>
<p>So yes hamster suffer worse pneumonia with higher inoculum.</p>
<p>But that's hamsters and unless someone can link to a study with humans it is still conjecture for now if severity of human Covid symptoms are tied to initial viral dose.</p>
<p>We don't know yet.</p>
<p>Edit: the closest thing I could find to an &quot;unintentional study&quot; where subjects were possibly given low doses of Coronavirus is this cruise ship that had high levels of masking: <a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19/88692" target="_blank">https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19/88692</a> . The hypothesis is that many cruise goers had asymptomatic cases because they were exposed to only low doses of virus during initial infection because of the masks. Of course there is no control and it's just a theory but it's a data point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In general, there is a positive correlation between initial inoculate and disease severity that has been shown for several viruses including this one. This at the population level, at the individual level it can be that 2 get infected by a similar inoculate but one does worse than the other etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The severity of the infection is tied to the cytokine storm released by the immune system to fight the virus and not the virus itself. Whats malicious about this virus is the incubation period and the infective stage where most infectees show no symptoms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
