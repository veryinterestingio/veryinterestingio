		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Stars are much, much farther away, and also very bright. The distance would make the light dim if it were not for how bright the stars are. The light from exostars arrives to earth as a pin point, meaning the actual area of sky taken up by the star is incredibly small. By contrast, planets are physically a lot smaller than most stars, but also far, far closer and dimmer. The result is that the light from our own planets does not come to us as pinpoints, but instead as an area. The twinkling of stars is caused by atmospheric perturbations. Changes in the upper atmosphere of the earth change how the light bends when passing through. For pinpoints, all of the light is affected by these perturbations the same way, which allows us to observe it. With planets, the light interacts over a larger area and is not all affected the same way. The interactions destructively interfere, meaning that what we observe is the average of the different perturbations. This average may vary slightly, but nearly imperceptibly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well first, they can twinkle, it just requires far more turbulent air. But the reason for this is that planets have a larger angular size than stars do. This isn't noticeable in our vision, as they are all small enough to appear as point sources, but when magnified, planets resolve to larger discs with much less magnification than is required for a star. Thus, their images are more stable through the air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as the reflected light being polarized, it was explained to me once that light that reflects off of something maintains the same electric field variation (by direction). So if light is oscillating in the x direction, traveling in the y-direction it would not be able to bounce off of something and move in the x-direction or it would be a compressional wave instead of a longitudinal wave. A fun way to show scattered light as polarized is with a column of corn syrup.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVN9f_2aXg" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVN9f\_2aXg" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKVN9f\_2aXg</a></a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR:  The artifacts of atmospheric distortion are larger than the apparent sizes of stars, but smaller than the apparent sizes of planets.</p>
<p>Here is a video of a twinkling star:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooeRUOZ0Gi4" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooeRUOZ0Gi4</a></p>
<p>The star, if the air weren't interfering, would appear to be a point much tinier than the halo of atmospheric distortion.</p>
<p>Now, the image of a planet of about the same apparent brightness would be much dimmer but much larger.</p>
<p>I can't find a video of that, so you'll just have to imagine this:</p>
<p>The same optical phenomenon occurs around the edges of that dim planetary disc, but the disc's interior is more or less uniformly bright.</p>
<p>So planets actually twinkle just a tiny bit, but not enough to notice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nice question!</p>
<p>Stars have no angular size, they're point sources. Any slight deviation affects them, as they have no size.</p>
<p>Planets do have an angular size (it's relative to the sizes of the cells in the upper atmosphere), so a slight refraction may alter their colour a little due to chromatic aberration, but won't shift their position as you see it.</p>
<p>A very low planet with a small angular size can twinkle. Mercury does it, but Mercury is hard to see in the first place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
