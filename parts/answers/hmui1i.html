		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a logical fallacy because it allows you to evade the argument by defining it away. </p>
<p>Let's say we have an argument. I say that it's okay to wear underwear under a kilt if you feel more comfortable that way. You say that it isn't, that in Scottish culture it's completely unacceptable, and nobody would wear underwear under their kilt. I respond with an example, maybe many examples, of Scottish people who say they wear underwear under their kilts, and as a counter argument you say no <strong>true</strong> Scotsman wears underwear under a kilt.</p>
<p>The problem here is essentially that you have now redefined the word Scotsman. It no longer means a Scottish person, or perhaps a Scottish man. Now it means a Scottish person who doesn't wear underwear under their kilt. But that's at odds with the common understanding of what a Scotsman is. and you only came up with this definition because I provided examples that ran counter to your argument. if somebody is allowed to redefine what words mean in the middle of an argument, the other party can never win, because they will never be able to meet the shifting definition of whatever word is at issue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;No True Scotsman&quot; fallacy is <em>not</em> a logical fallacy. It's what's known as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy#Informal_fallacy" target="_blank"><em>informal fallacy</em></a>, which is essentially a problem with reasoning rather than logic.</p>
<p>This fallacy occurs when somebody arbitrarily defines a group to support their argument, rather than on the basis of the generally accepted definition of that group. For example:</p>
<p><strong>Person 1</strong>: All Scotsmen love Haggis</p>
<p><strong>Person 2</strong>: I'm a Scotsman and I don't love Haggis</p>
<p><strong>Person 1</strong>: You're not a true Scotsman then</p>
<p>Person 1 has therefore defined &quot;loving Haggis&quot; as a condition for being a Scotsman, which means their argument is irrefutable. This is fallacious because, of course, &quot;loving Haggis&quot; is not generally regarded as a condition for being a Scotsman. But note that this isn't a logical error. If you define &quot;loving Haggis&quot; as being a condition for being a Scotsman (which Person 1 is doing), then if Person 2 does not like Haggis, Person 1 is correct that they are not a true Scotsman under their definition. It isn't a fallacy due to logic, it's a fallacy because Person 1 is arbitrarily redefining a group to make their argument irrefutable.</p>
<p>This raises an important point though - since definitions are often subjective, the &quot;No True Scotsman&quot; fallacy is also subjective to some extent. How subjective it is depends on how well defined the group in discussion is. The example above is fairly uncontroversial - very few people would agree that &quot;loving Haggis&quot; defines a Scotsman. But consider this example from the Wikipedia article of the fallacy:</p>
<p><strong>Person 1</strong>: No pacifist stabs people to death</p>
<p><strong>Person 2</strong>: I know a pacifist who stabbed someone to death</p>
<p><strong>Person 1</strong>: They're not a true pacifist</p>
<p>This may not be fallacious because most people <em>would</em> agree that &quot;not stabbing people to death&quot; is a condition for being a pacifist (but even that is potentially subjective). </p>
<p>It's therefore important to be careful with this fallacy, because accusations of this fallacy can often themselves be fallacious. Without wanting to get into an argument, the example /u/blindeey chose is a poor choice to illustrate this fallacy because what defines a &quot;Christian&quot; is itself a highly debatable question (even though they may not agree). The &quot;No True Scotsman&quot; fallacy only works with groupings that are very well defined.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it's incorrectly denying a thing is a category of which it belongs. To use the example of a Scotsman and porridge: the only thing that makes one a Scotsman is whether they're Scottish. Not their dietary habits. I often see this in religious apologetics: Well this group isn't a real Christian because they do this. In reality the only defining thing that makes one a Christian is believing in Christ and whatnot. Not whether they act in any particular way, or any other particular beliefs, etc.</p>
<p>Does that clear it up at all?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You make a claim such as &quot;No true Reddit user enjoys being outside&quot;.</p>
<p>I provide a counter example, like &quot;I enjoy sitting on my deck and drinking a beer&quot;.</p>
<p>You double down on your first statement &quot;No <em>true</em> Reddit user enjoys being outside&quot;.</p>
<p>You did nothing to prove your first point, all you did was try to exclude me from your sample by using the very definition you're trying to prove.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because you keep moving the goalposts in an illogical manner. You stated a universal qualification, and then whenever you get a counterexample you simply say &quot;But that one doesn't count&quot;.</p>
<p>The common qualification of &quot;Scotsman&quot; is &quot;Someone who lives in or has cultural roots in Scotland&quot;. Sure, you might faff it about a bit depending on the context of the definition, but most people have a fairly standard idea of what traits will make you Scottish.</p>
<p>It's a failure to actually define your group properly, and then adjusting it to better fit your own argument. &quot;All men have two hands&quot; I probably am thinking of the common definition of &quot;a man&quot;. If you then point out the numerous people who are one-handed I can't exclude them just because it isn't beneficial to my case that one-handed men exist without some rigorous justification. Just slapping &quot;No <em>true</em> man&quot; to the argument doesn't really explain anything or define the group any better, I've just dismissed your counterexample because I don't like it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
