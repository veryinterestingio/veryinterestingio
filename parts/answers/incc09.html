		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the simplest terms, light on the longer end of the visible light spectrum (reds and yellows) is able to pass through the smoke and other small particles in the atmosphere, and the shorter wavelengths (blue and violet) are scattered.</p>
<p>This is the same reason that sunsets are red.  The light has to pass through more of the atmosphere, thus having to travel through more of these small particles, which creates the reds and yellows we know and love.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's late, and I can refine this in the morning, but simply put, the peak absorption of a particular wavelength of light absorbed by a particle is roughly equal to the particle size (look up mie). A lot of the smoke particles, especially the fine ones that get carried high, are between 400-700nm in diameter, with more if the finer particles being carried greater distances.</p>
<p>400-700nm happens to be roughly the visible range for humans.</p>
<p>Close to the fire the sky probably looks fairly gray, but as you get farther away and the larger particles settle out the sky probably turns more red, then yellow (red+green) before finally turning more normal colored as all but the smallest particles have fallen to the ground.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
