		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok so in a sense, the sex determination of an animal is sort of a multi step process. Before I begin I just want to define terms I'm going to use throughout: female will mean an individual which has a uterus, ovaries, etc. ie a female reproductive system, and who is very likely to have XX chromosomes.   Male will mean an individual which has a penis, prostate, etc. ie a male reproductive system, and who is very likely to have XY chromosomes. </p>
<p>Another term I'll throw around is 'gonads'- a gonad is a general term for the reproductive gland/organ of an individual- its important because mammalian embryos in the womb have gonads which are very plastic and can form either testes or ovaries- depending on the things I'm going to talk about in a second.</p>
<p>Anywho... So in mammals you're right, the 'first' sex determination step is the chromosomes you get given. The egg provided by your mother will always have an X chromosome, while the sperm provided by your dad will have either an X or a Y chromosome. In this sense, the sperm is the 'sex determiner' in mammals. </p>
<p>Now a common misconception is that the Y chromosome encodes the whole of male characteristic- this is not true. Crucially however, the Y chromosome contains the single-most important gene for male characteristic- the Testis Determining Factor / Sex Determining Region Y (SRY) gene.</p>
<p>To quickly get an image of the embryo right now. We are presently at ~6-8 weeks in the embryo, right now, regardless if you are XX or XY, you are almost entirely identical. You don't have testes or ovaries, you have a primed, ready-and-waiting precursor gonad organ near to where your stomach will be. These gonads are waiting for a signal telling them what to do.</p>
<p>This is where the concept of 'secondary' sex determination occurs. Individuals with the Y chromosome will turn on the SRY gene around now. The SRY gene triggers a cascade of hundreds of genes, which tell the gonad to become a testis and to not become an ovary. In this way, the SRY gene is almost completely seen as the sex determiner in mammals. </p>
<p>Interestingly, if you were to fire an amazingly accurate laser to cut out the SRY gene from an XY embryo, it would not trigger the cascade of events needed to make the testis, and so the testis couldn't do it's job of producing testosterone and other 'male' hormones, making you become more male. Instead you would default into the normal female characteristic, and your gonad would become ovaries and you would physically appear female, despite being XY!</p>
<p>So to get back to your question. Technically speaking, men don't start as women, but nor do women start as men. Embryos up to 6-8 weeks are identical, but are primed with the necessary genes to become one or the other, XX or XY. After a few weeks these genes will then 'kick' the gonad into either becoming testes for males or ovaries for females, but in this way the 'default' sex is female. </p>
<p>Let me rephrase that for simplicity. In order to become male, the SRY gene must be present to 'kick' the gonads into becoming testes. If for some reason you don't have a SRY gene (maybe you're XX- or maybe you're XY but your SRY gene is missing), this kick won't happen and your gonad will defaultly become ovaries.</p>
<p>I hope this answers your question. If you want to read this up more terms to google include: &quot;mammalian sex determination&quot; &quot;SRY gene&quot; &quot;XY sex determination&quot; </p>
<p>Also before I finish, my mentions about having XY but SRY missing is important- a whole area of this is &quot;Disorders of Sex Development&quot;, which may affect as many as 1:5000 births. These can have an array of genetic backgrounds like XXY etc.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason people say this is because the paramesonephric ducts which eventually become the fallopian tubes and other stuff are present in all developing fetuses but degenerate in males due to androgens. The reality is people start out more unisex because fetuses also have the mesonephric ducts which become the vas deferens and epididymis in males while degenerating in females due to androgens.</p>
<p>Because you have to have the sry gene active to turn on and maintain these structures while an inactivation of the sry gene will lead to a &quot;default&quot; state of the mesonephric ducts degenerating it is easy to say that everyone starts out female.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok so every healthy child starts the same way, as a single fertilized cell in the womb.  Is it a woman or a man?  Bit early to tell right?  That is what you are driving at here.  Every healthy child goes through the same sets of stages up until the stage were sexual organ formation starts.  Then they follow a different path to make them male or female.</p>
<p>I like to think of it as folding origami or a paper plane.  At first it's just a piece of paper.  Bit much to call it a swan with only a fold or 2, but get 3 or 5 folds and clearly you'll know it's a plane versus something else.</p>
<p>That said, we know from genetic disorders where the fetus cannot process testosterone normally that without the hormonall &quot;you are this sex&quot; stage the default sex of humans is female.  Still they don't really have a sex until the organs start forming so it is disingenuous IMO to call all fetuses female until the organs form.  </p>
<p>Also this whole talk of picking female or male traits is completely separate from being a man or woman.  Gender is not sex.  Current science understands that gender is a psychological phenomenon that is correlated with sex not causated by sex.</p>
<p>Edit a word or few.  Proofreading is hard.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a really cool Radio Lab series called Gonads and they go through a lot of stuff. That some of the other answers mention. They get doctor's and scientists on to talk about all of it. Very fascinating</p>
<p>The first one is called &quot;Gonads: The Primordial Journey&quot; published on June 18 2018. There are 6 total:</p>
