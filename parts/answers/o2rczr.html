		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would guess that nature figured out that if all chickpeas sprouted at the first sign of water and there was a dry spell after this, nothing would make it to the next generation if they all had the same characteristics. If a small percentage of chickpeas require longer to sprout, this would allow for less predictable weather patterns and help the survival of the plant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
