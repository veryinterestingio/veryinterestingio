		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A couple of reasons. Being a thickener is the main one.  But raw flour tastes bad so you need to cook it. You can make a roux separately and then build your stew (similar to how gumbo is made) or you can kick it up a notch and coat the meat that youâ€™re using. </p>
<p>When you do the latter, you are increasing browning both in the flour as well as on the meat. The caramelization that takes place in browning is called the Maillard reaction and it massively increases flavor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a class of chemistry called &quot;milliard reactions&quot; which are when you cook fats/proteins/sugars without water. Long story short, milliard reactions are DELICIOUS. They are the cause of toasting bread, browning meat, frying bacon, etc. Our brains are simply preconditioned to desire milliard reaction compounds. By coating the beef in flour prior to browning you are adding additional carbohydrates to the beef to encourage even more milliard chemistry in the dish.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because you're making a roux with the rendering beef fat and whatever cooking oil you're using.</p>
<p>So like for anything that needs to be thickened, like a gravy, stew, or sauce, you want to cook the flour in oil to bring out it's flavor before it's added to whatever carrying liquid will eventually be in the dish.</p>
<p>I mean, only if you want it to taste better and take less time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
