I read a lot about new species being introduced to handle the problem species (a natural predator brought in to stop a population boom of a pest, etc) but that seems like now you'd just have 2 invasive species.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many restoration ecologists have this fundamental view that the natural world is separate from humans.  But we now know that Native Americans had a heavy influence on the land and its ecosystems throughout North America before contact.  Fire management, gathering practices, hunting of large herbivores all interacted with systems and these are just a few examples.  How do you account for this in your restoration practice and philosophy?  Are you making any attempts to re-create these influences?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
