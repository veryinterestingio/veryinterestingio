<p>During REM sleep (the part where you dream) your body stops regulating body temperature. That's why most people will need a blanket to keep their body temp up at night. It also stops or slows down a lot of other non-essential functions like digestion (why it's not good to eat right before bed). If you're waking up sweating after a few hours it means you've either got far too much bedding or there's a possible health problem. Night sweats are a common symptom of menopause, hypoglycemia (diabeetus), some cancers like lymphoma, hormone imbalance, or some neurological conditions.</p>
<p>It is not normal to wake up often covered in sweat. If this happens to you regularly go see a doctor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
