<p>Also, you would still want fresh water to your house for showering and cooking, so you'd have an additional set of pipes running to each building.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, there are problems with salt water.</p>
<p>The solution is &quot;grey water&quot;. This is water that is relatively clean but not drinkable. Think rainwater, or what goes down the plug in your shower or bath, even what comes out of your washing machine. All of this is perfectly good to flush a toilet with and basically wasted. You can install a secondary system that takes and filters grey water to use for toilets. But as piping fresh water to your house is mostly trivially cheap, it's usually more expensive than its worth. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>2) It would only be viable near coastlines.</p>
<p>3) The mineral deposits would quickly clog the pipes.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some places do use seawater! Most notably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_Hong_Kong#Seawater_flushing" target="_blank">Hong Kong</a>. The problem for most cities, even ones on the coast, would be having to build an entire separate water main just for sea water. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gray water or recycled water would be more compatible with existing fixtures. There is an existing but limited infrastructure of recycled water in my area for irrigation, mostly parks/commercial. You would also need backflow prevention or risk contamination of the public water supply. The end user could also taint their own water if incorrect repair or modifications are made. Possible but would require substantial investment. As a licensed plumbing contractor in CA I'm all for it ?.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
