		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Did you find it in some kind of body wash or cosmetic? If so, it's likely a different name for &quot;2-octyl hydroxystearate&quot; or possibly &quot;ethylhexyl hydroxystearate&quot;</p>

<p>It would probably have similar functions as other stearic acid derivatives...</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Looks nonstandard IUPAC naming. If you search just &quot;octyal&quot; you get results for 2 ethyl hexanol from India, so it may be a local common name. Or a typo.</p>
<p>My guess is it's stearic acid esterified with octyl? alcohol (8 carbon chain with an alcohol group stuck on it, not sure the name since I've never seen it).</p>
<p>As for use, it's probably there like most molecules that shape, emulsifier, thickener, surfactant, whatever, it helps to give the formulation its consistency usually.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My chemistry is honestly  a little rough (my degrees are all in bio/genetics), but based on the chemical composition of Octyl Stearate C26H52O2, I believe that Octyal Hydroxide Stearate is the oxidized state of Octyl Stearate meaning is is C26H53O2, and would look exactly the same except the double bonded O would be a single bonded OH group.  I don't see how this would be functionally different in application as the compound would likely change between these two forms in the body anyways. So to answer your question it looks like its effectively the same thing in a biological setting, and not completely different at all.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit: Looking at this again, I think Octyal Hydroxide Stearate is more likely the carboxylate intermediate that forms during the formation of Octyl Stearate when the Octyl chain is attached to Stearic acid via whichever synthesis reaction. But I still don't doubt that it spontaneously forms from Octyl Stearate when it is exposed to water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is simply a misspelling of &quot;octyl hydroxystearate&quot;. Misspellings on ingredients lists are fairly common. The name as written is nonsensical.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
