		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water is in higher volumes during warmer weather. This water, or humidity, creates a super conductive “gel” so to speak that stretches from the upper atmosphere down to the ground. </p>
<p>The water on the ground and the heat creates a friction and charge that attracts the instability of the cloud formation. A static connection is made and a discharge of energy stretches between the colder, dry atmosphere and warmer, wetter ground. This discharge is a flash of light and it creates a shockwave across the entire stratosphere and troposphere. The light is called lightning. </p>
<p>This shockwave presents to humans as a pressure differential. Closer to the discharge, it will shake things and will be felt. Farther away, not so much. But within a few miles of the discharge, you’ll hear a rumbling or loud noise. Closer experience will hear a loud crashing noise. Farther away, more a rumbling. This is thunder. </p>
<p>Anyways, in the winter the ground dries up and the moisture in the air recedes to the point where the friction between troposphere and stratosphere is too low to sustain a discharge between the two. </p>
<p>While you can have thunder with a snowstorm, it usually happens as a rain storm experiences a sudden drop on tropospheric temperature. This transition allows you to have the two things that would scare the poop out of Anyone. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
