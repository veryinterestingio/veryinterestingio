<p>A question about antibiotic resistant bacteria I've been having for a while: </p>
<p>Does the number of &quot;useless&quot; antibiotics continually increase over time due to more bacteria evolving resistance against these antibiotics, or do specific antibiotics that fall out of use eventually become useful again? </p>
<p>Are there any examples of antibiotics that we have stopped using due to antibiotic resistance, but could plausibly be more useful now as the pool of bacteria that developed resistance against them has shrunk sufficiently?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>As an epidemiologist, I'm curious what you meant in your op-ed with this line:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We need to hear more from these superbug hunters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Also if anyone is interested in infectious disease news: r/ID_News</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Q1) Are there currently any ground breaking treatments ongoing in any trials to combat superbugs? What I mean by this is any novel approaches that are different from past methods. If so, how do these methods differ from previous ones?</p>
<p>Q2) What makes superbugs &quot;super?&quot; What sets these apart from other bugs that makes it more difficult for our own immune system to deal with them?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
