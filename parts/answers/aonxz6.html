For some, like whey, it's simply the liquid whey left over from cheese making that has been filtered to remove the sugar and fats, and then dehydrated.  Then they can season it with various flavorings to make it more appealing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Take something that has protein in it, and use processes to remove water and other unneccesary things so you just have protein. ie take protein-y things, remove all the non-protein, so you got just protein. Dairy products are an obvious choice. Separate just the whey, and then dehydrate that. Whey is one of the key componenets of protein powder. The other types are vegetable (often pea), and Soy. </p>
<p>Whey protein powder is a by-product of the creation of cheese and milk. Whey is typically considered one of the best since it helps with muscle growth and repair. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Itâ€™s actually very simple. Most protein powder is whey protein powder, which is made from regular milk. You can make a very crude protein powder at home by curdling some milk, separating the solids, dehydrating the leftover liquid, which is known as whey, and processing it into a powder. It still has some impurities like lactose. To make whey protein isolate, which is typically the purest form sold commercially as a supplement, whey would be filtrated to remove everything but the whey proteins. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
