		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can take pure oxygen and pure hydrogen and combine them to form water. By measuring how much oxygen or how much hydrogen is left over after all the water is formed, you can deduce the proportions that were used to make the water. When we do this, we can tell that two parts of hydrogen are used for every one part of oxygen.</p>
<p>What makes molecules stay together are things called intermolecular forces, of which there are a variety and rather complicated to explain. But basically there are attractive forces between the molecules that keep them together rather than just flying apart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll answer each of your questions in turn.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do we know that anything is made of specifically these elements and not something else?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chemists use a technique called spectroscopy. There's a quite a few kinds, but I'll explain mass spectrometry because it's the most relevant here.</p>
<p>Let's say you have an unknown substance and you want to know what it's made of. We can fire a beam of electrons (negatively charged particles), which breaks the bonds holding the molecules together. In other words, we can break it down into smaller components. We use a magnet to deflect these components - heavier pieces will be deflected less and lighter pieces will be deflected more. From that data we can see how heavy each piece is, and how abundant each piece is. From that we can extrapolate the chemical makeup of the substance.</p>
<p>Water, for example, has a <a href="https://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?ID=C7732185&amp;Mask=200#Mass-Spec" target="_blank">mass spectrum that looks like this</a>. Without going into too much detail, we know it's H2O because the biggest peak has a mass of 18 (the mass of 1 oxygen and 2 hydrogens), the next peak has a mass of 17 (the mass of 1 oxygen and 1 hydrogen), and the last peak has a mass of 16 (the mass of just oxygen). Since there's only 3 peaks*, there's only three pieces to the molecule. So we've stripped water of each of its hydrogens sequentially, each giving a different mass reading. From this we know water is 89% oxygen by mass, and 11% hydrogen.</p>
<p>This technique works for pretty much any molecule, though more complex molecules become more difficult to analyze. There's other techniques that can be used in conjunction with mass spec to provide more information. NMR and IR are common, but that's beyond the scope of this post.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And what makes molecules stay together (like in a human)?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bonds are like magnets. The negative electrons surrounding an atom will be attracted to the positive nucleus of another atom. It gets really complicated really fast, but the easiest explanation is that some atoms are more negative than others, and some atoms are more positive. The attraction between negative and positive holds atoms together to form molecules.</p>
<p>*For the peaks above 18, this is because hydrogen has multiple isotopes. That complicates things, but we can usually get away with ignoring these peaks and just focusing on the tall ones.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's something known as Avogadro's law (which can be proven mathematically) that says equal volumes of gas have the exact same number of particles in them. By extension, twice the volume of gas must have twice as many particles.  </p>
<p>Take an every day 9 volt battery and immerse it in a cup of water. Now add a little salt to the water as an electrolyte, and voila. You'll see bubbles forming at the anode and cathode of the battery. Those bubbles of gas are actually the hydrogen gas and oxygen gas being produced as the battery power is used to &quot;split&quot; the water into its elements. Hydrogen is made at the cathode and oxygen is made at the anode (we can prove this by collecting the gas and seeing how it reacts - the hydrogen &quot;pops&quot; when exposed to flame and oxygen will re-light a wick that has been recently snuffed out..  </p>
<p>If you collect that gas, you immediately notice there's twice as much hydrogen gas produced as there is oxygen gas. Hey presto, water is H2O. Two parts hydrogen for every one part oxygen.  </p>
<p>But I mean, really that doesn't solve it for you. We still need to know how many hydrogen atoms are in hydrogen gas molecules and how many oxygen atoms are in oxygen gas molecules.  For all we know, maybe water is 2 parts hydrogen gas to one part oxygen gas because hydrogen exists as one atom but oxygen exists as two??  </p>
<p>So to go even further with this, Avogadro's law can also be used to measure the relative masses of different substances. Just get the same volume of a bunch of different gases, then compare their masses. You quickly see that water vapour weighs 9 times as much as hydrogen gas, for the exact same number of particles.  </p>
<p>Do this for heaps of gases, which you make up from known proportions of reactants. Each gas will have its own &quot;relative&quot; mass compared to hydrogen gas. Oxygen gas is about 16 times hydrogen's mass, NO is about 15 times hydrogen gas, NO2 is about 23 times hydrogen gas, NH3 is about 8.5 times hydrogen gas... etc.  </p>
<p>You'll notice that last one isn't a whole number. As it turns out, if you do this every gas is either an exact multiple of hydrogen gas' mass, or is like a half-integer multiple like 8.5  </p>
<p>If we let hydrogen gas have a mass of 2, then everything else's mass ends up being a whole number. So we say Ah! hydrogen must be two atoms of H, and each H weighs 1.  </p>
<p>You can therefore go through and say hmm.. if every H is 1, and NH3 is 17... that means N is 14. But if N is 14 and NO is 30, that means oxygen is 16. But oxygen gas was 32, so each oxygen gas molecule must have two oxygen atoms.  </p>
<p>so oxygen gas is O2... Hydrogen gas is H2... and we know 2 volumes of hydrogen gase + 1 volume of oxygen gas gives 2 volumes of water.. so our only choice is:  </p>
<p>2H2 + O2 -&gt; 2H2O  </p>
<p>water has to be H2O, since it has a relative mass of 18, and each hydrogen is 1 and oxygen is 16.  </p>
<p>As for what makes molecules stay together... man, that's a whole chemistry course.  </p>
<p>TL;DR: Avogadro.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
