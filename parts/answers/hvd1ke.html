		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, a clarification, the core of the Earth (and the Earth as a whole) is losing heat, but it is relatively slow. The reason it is slow is a combination of four main factors: (1) The core (and more broadly the Earth as whole) started off with a lot of heat, i.e. enough for the entire planet to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magma_ocean" target="_blank">a liquid initially</a>; (2) Radioactive decay of uranium, thorium, and potassium in the mantle and crust continue to contribute significant amounts of heat, and probably ~50% of current heat flux is from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_internal_heat_budget#Radiogenic_heat" target="_blank">radiogenic heat</a> (plus there were even greater rates of radiogenic heat production early on from short lived isotopes like ^(26)Al); (3) Rocks are not great heat conductors, compare the thermal conductivity of <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256372062_Rock_Physics_and_Phase_Relations_A_Handbook_of_Physical_Constants" target="_blank">rocks (0.5-5 W/(m x K))</a> to the thermal conductivity of efficient conductors like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_thermal_conductivities" target="_blank">metals (e.g. copper, ~400 W/(m  x k))</a>, though this is partially overcome by convection in the mantle being the primary process by which heat from the core is moved toward the surface, but rate of heat conduction through the crust is still limiting; and (4) air is an even worse conductor so the rate of heat loss from the crust, to the atmosphere, and eventually space is not efficient and serves as an insulator to a certain extent (again here though, heat in the atmosphere can be more efficiently transported through convection than just conduction).</p>
<p>EDIT: Just to expand on point 2 a bit, because radiogenic heat production is tied to the amount of radiogenic isotopes, this means that even without considering extinct isotopes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_internal_heat_budget#/media/File:Evolution_of_Earth's_radiogenic_heat-with_total.svg" target="_blank">heat production was greater in the past</a> (because there was a larger concentration of isotopes which have since decayed away) and the amount of radiogenic heat production will continue to decrease (as the concentration continues to decrease). This reduction in radiogenic heat production through time is slow though given that the half lives of the relevant elements are 100s of millions to billions of years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add a little anecdote to /u/CrustalTrudger 's great answer: the 19th century scientist Lord Kelvin used exactly your argument to estimate the age of the Earth.  He assumed it started off completely molten, and calculated how long it would take to cool off to match the heat flow we see today.  The answer he settled on was 20-40 million years.  This is way way too small, because since he didn't know about radioactivity, which generates new heat inside the Earth, and because he didn't realize the Earth's interior was convecting.</p>
<p>Anyway, he went on to use this wrong answer to argue that geologists' claims about the ages of rocks were impossible, and to suggest that Darwin's theory of evolution must be wrong because there's no way it could act in such a short time.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: It's losing heat, but it does that over billions of years because it's an immense amount of energy captured in a decent insulator (the earth's crust). The amount of heat lost during a human lifetime, or even lifetime of all humanity, is so insignificant that from our perspective it's negligible as basically nothing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is cooling down. It's just being really slow about it because it's surrounded by a blanket of rock 2,900 kilometres thick! Even though the mantle convects on geological timescales, it still effectively insulates the core.</p>
<p>Radioactive decay helps too. It's thought very little of that is in the core itself, rather it heats the mantle and the crust, because the chemistry of the common radioactive elements means they end up in rock-forming minerals. But it still impairs heat loss from the core.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The laws of thermodynamics say that the core of the earth is cooling, it must be cooling, it will continue to cool until it reaches an equilibrium.  The reason for your question is that it's happening impreceptively slowly. In 2 billion years, it's probable that the core will cool so much that it no longer creates an electromagnetic field, rendering earth uninhabitable to human life as it exists today.  In which case there are three possibilities:</p>
<ol>
<li>Humans are extinct.</li>
<li>Humans evolve and adapt to the new environment</li>
<li>Humans have migrated off the planet.</li>
