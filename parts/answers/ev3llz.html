		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On a related note, Measles can actually wipe out the immune systems “memory”.  So if you had any sort of immunity to chickenpox for example, then got measles, it becomes difficult for your immune system to recognize the chickenpox virus. And, if you come in contact with that chickenpox virus again, you may experience symptoms, as if your immune system had never seen that virus before.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plain and simple: No. There is no 100% secure immunity when it comes to infections or infectious diseases.</p>
<p>Take the EBV (infectious mononucleosis). Years ago the credo was that if once gone though a mononucleosis, you're safe for at least 25 years. Today we know, that there's a high probability that you'll never catch it again after being infected once, some time in your life. But there are documented cases where patients with no other conditions or any immune suppressive circumstances (like medication or other illness) catched it again and went through another cycle of infectious mononucleosis.</p>
<p>Also, there are virus infections like herpes. It's just not curable. It's treatable, but once the current infection has been &quot;defeated&quot; the virus itself persists in tbe body, just to wait for another opportunity to become active again and give you another hard time, another active infection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No.  Herpes is a virus and after the body fights off the infection it will go dormant hiding in the body.  When immunity becomes depressed (fatigue, stress, etc.), it can resurface causing another episode.  there is no known cure for it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Measles is particularly insidious. You may end up resistant to measles, but measles causes your immune system to have amnesia, and to forget your prior immunity. That leaves you vulnerable to al the diseases you've previously fought off. Think about how terrible that is. If you acquired immunity to dozens of viruses, but didn't get immunized against measles (due to being raised by antivax parents, for example), catching measles will wipe that slate clean and leave you to fend for yourself with a compromised immune system for years to come, against diseases you already successfully fought off. </p>
<p>That's how evil measles is. And those who don't immunize their kids against it are putting their kids at risk of this terrible fate totally unnecessarily, because they are distrustful of the wrong people for the wrong reasons.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If a person has a flu and takes antiviral medication and recovers, did the medication kill the virus or did the person develop immunity which killed the virus? Is it better to take antiviral medication or have your body try to fight it off by itself first?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
