		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes they do, but not very often, obviously.</p>
<p>Prey animals panic, get exhausted, and go limp. Also There's no air to breath in an animal's stomach and it's highly muscular and constricting so the prey rapidly dies of asphyxiation.</p>
<p>However it's not entirely impossible for prey to escape from a stomach and it's been documented occasionally. Here's an eel pulling a chestburster <a href="https://www.livescience.com/snake-eel-bursts-out-of-heron.html" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.livescience.com/snake-eel-bursts-out-of-heron.html" target="_blank">https://www.livescience.com/snake-eel-bursts-out-of-heron.html</a></a></p>
<p>A pigeon is a pretty wimpy animal, though, it doesn't have a sharp strong beak or sharp claws.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Check out this gruesome (but cool) photo of a heron flying around with an American eel that burst out of its neck. It's a tough world out there.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Snakes in particular will usually strangle their prey first. While it might not fully kill them, they’re not alive enough to fight back. </p>
<p>Pelicans will sometimes scoop up water to drown their prey before consuming. </p>
<p>Once inside, the prey doesn’t really have a whole lot of room to move about so it’s hard to get a good peck or scratch in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
