		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It really depends on what you think good music is. That feels like a throwaway statement, but what I mean is that theory just describes what you're hearing and puts a name to it. Consonant music (what you're probably thinking of as &quot;good&quot; sounding right now) is described by music theory in a particular way so that if you want to hear or make more of that music, you know what pitch intervals to use, what time signatures to use, etc. </p>
<p>In terms of what sounds good to people, it's all based on personal history and historical/cultural context. If you live in a western country, you probably are familiar with music that uses 12 notes. That's not the case everywhere, and if you heard music that uses more notes than that, you'd be really likely to think it sounds out of tune. Likewise, if you started listening to lots and lots of dissonant music, you'd probably eventually form an emotional connection of some sort and learn to appreciate it. But again, music theory as an entity doesn't have an opinion about that, it just describes what's happening and organizes it in a way that's easy for people to reference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a field of study called &quot;music theory&quot; that involves finding common patterns in music that has already been written. </p>
<p>However, there's no mathematical method to <em>predict</em> musical &quot;goodness&quot; any more than there is a formula to predict a great poem or a funny joke.</p>
<p>And personally, that is a huge relief.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
