		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Housefly</strong> (<em>Musca domestica</em>) has a very soft, fleshy, spongelike mouth and when it lands on you  and touches your skin, it wonâ€™t bite, it will suck up secretions on the  skin.</p>
<p>It is interested in sweat, proteins, carbohydrates, salts, sugars  and other chemicals and pieces of dead skin that keep flaking off.</p>
<p>This type of fly also gets its nutrients from sitting around the eyes  of livestock. It is hard to get it from anywhere else on hairy animals,  which is also why they land more often on human skin which is  comparatively less hairy.</p>
<p><strong>Here are some reasons why they are attracted towards humans:</strong></p>
<p>- They are attracted to carbon dioxide which human beings breathe out.</p>
<p>- They are attracted to the heat of the warm body, to sweat and salt, and the more the person sweats the more flies they attract.</p>
<p>- Flies feed on dead cells and open wounds.</p>
<p>- Oil is an important food for flies. Oily hair is an attractant.</p>
<p>- Less hairy skin gives the fly spaces to vomit. A fly vomits on solid food to liquefy it. The house flies taste with their  feet so if there is food on the skin, and space to liquefy it, they  will land there.</p>
<p>- Some of the body odors are more attractive to flies than others. This is apart from the quantity of carbon dioxide that is emitted.</p>
<p>Houseflies are scavengers .The human body like some of their favourite food sources - faeces, food and rotting flesh radiates a sense of warmth and nourishment. With a voracious appetite, aided by an excellent sense  of smell and a pair of complex eyes that covers half its head, the fly lands on us because it is constantly on the hunt for a warm place to eat, defecate, vomit and lay eggs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
