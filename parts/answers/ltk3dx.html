		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>If radon is radioactive, and leaves radioactive material in your body, why does it mainly (only?) cause lung cancer?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because it's a gas that enters your lungs. It gets trapped in the lungs, and the lungs get the heaviest radiation dose from the daughter products.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If radon is 8x heavier than air, and mostly accumulates in the basement, wouldn't that mean that radon is a non-issue for people living on higher levels?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Essentially correct. Norwegian recommendations is to not measure if you live above third floor - due to the weight of the gas and the fact that it seeps out of the ground.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This map shows radon levels around the world. Why is radon so diverse across a small continent like Europe, yet wholly consistent across a massive country like Russia? Does it have to do with measuring limitations or architecture, or is the ground there weirdly uniform?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On that map it seems to be reported per country. Russia is a big country, Europe apart from Russia is a lot of small countries. While I don't know details about radon in Russia, far more detailed maps exists for other countries. You may for instance have a look at <a href="http://geo.ngu.no/kart/radon/" target="_blank">this one, for Norway</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>5: Radon mostly surfaces after it has rained, and decays within days. This is why frequent ventilation is recommended, especially after it has rained, or if you live in a basement or any place where it tends to accumulate. </p>
<p>Your soil/underground affects your exposure, along with the materials your house is built of, the way it is constructed, and how often you ventilate. Some of these factors are tied to regional and cultural differences, so it is not convenient to link everything together.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1.
People have mentioned that you get lung cancer since you breathe it in, an additional point is that when radon decays it does so with alpha radiation which can easily be stopped by something thin as a sheet of paper, it can't penetrate your skin, but your lungs are soft tissue with no protective layer, so that is one of the few places alpha radiation can do you harm.</p>
<p>2.
That is correct.</p>
<p>3.
That is a simplified map, radon gas is usually found in rock, so if you build on bedrock you have to take precaution against radon gas.</p>
<p>4.
Radon gas is pretty easy to prevent, you put a layer of special plastic in your foundation and that's about it.</p>
<p>5.
you can easily get radon detectors online, if you are worried, buy one and put it in your living room, you do not have to be worried about radon gas outside as there is such a small amount of it that you can realistically breathe in that exhaust and other gases is more of a concern.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Radiation therapist here. There have been several comments about Radon being the  “second leading cause of lung cancer” among non smokers is a critical point. The rate of lung cancer in non smokers is tiny to begin with. When assessing these risks you have to keep in mind that the numbers don’t correlate even a little. Yes Radon is a hazard and needs to be abated when in concentration, but smoking especially when combined with regular alcohol consumption is very dangerous and produces significantly higher rates of cancer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On question 4: cancer statistics can sometimes be a little strange. For example, as general health in a country improves, more people may develop cancers and/or die from them. This is because they're not dying from other things. I don't have a good answer to your question, this is just a comment to say that there may be other confounding factors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
