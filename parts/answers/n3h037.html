		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A pattern you'll notice with a lot of the examples given in this thread: often times the trouble is with <strong>infinity</strong>. If you ask for example, does the Fibonacci sequence contain any square numbers besides 144 (12x12)? I can write out the first couple numbers in the sequence, or have a computer generate the first billion - and each one is trivial to check if it's a square - but it's fundamentally impossible to check ALL of them, because the sequence is infinite.</p>
<p>The only way to solve such a thing is come up with a mathematical argument - a proof - that employs some clever logic to prove something about an infinite set. As a very simple example, consider the question, &quot;are there any even prime numbers besides 2?&quot;. We can answer this by saying, <em>suppose there were such a number. Then since it's even, it can be divided by two - and since it can be divided by 2, it can't be a prime!</em> So we have proven something about ALL numbers, even though we never had to check them individually. A slightly harder problem in this vein, <em>is there a biggest prime number?</em></p>
<p>Problems like this arise all the time when mathematicians are just playing around - exploring patterns, asking questions, finding neat arguments that then lead to other natural questions. Some of the most famous unsolved problems are famous because, if we knew the answer, it would unlock truths about a lot of other related questions. (An example is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem" target="_blank">&quot;P vs NP&quot; problem</a> in computer science).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a big difference between solving a math equation and solving a generalized math problem</p>
<p>If you have 2 + X = 7 you can solve for X this one time and know that right here, right now, it must be 5</p>
<p>But the unsolved problems are wayyy harder than that.  Fermat's Last Theorem was unsolved for a few hundred years it goes &quot;For any integer n&gt;2, the equation a^n + b^n = c^n has no integer solutions&quot;</p>
<p>You're probably already familiar with the case of n=2, that's a^2 + b^2 = c^2 or Pythagoras's Theorem.  But how do you prove that for n&gt;2 there are no integer solutions?  You could try brute forcing it but what if it works out when n=51,437?  You'd have to try literally every combination of numbers which is, by definition, infinite</p>
<p>Its problems like these that you can't just set a computer to and crush through the numbers, you have to fall back onto the basic properties of math and other postulates and theorems to show that there is no way that any n&gt;2 results in a, b, and c all being integers.  These are the hard ones that require people and hundreds of sheets of paper to prove.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My favorite unsolved problem, because it's so easy to understand, is the Collatz Conjecture. We have a game that goes like this:</p>
<p>1) Pick any number and check if it's even or odd.</p>
<p>2) a) If it's even, divide by 2</p>
<p>2) b) If it's odd, multiply by 3 and add 1</p>
<p>3) Take your new number and go to step 1.</p>
<p>For example, if you start with 10:</p>
<p>10 -&gt; 5 -&gt; 16 -&gt; 8 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1...</p>
<p>Starting with 10, you end up going to 1 and then getting stuck in a loop between 4, 2, and 1. If you start with 9, it takes 20 steps (and goes all the way up to 52 at one point), but it also goes to 1. The conjecture is:</p>
<p><strong>Every positive whole number eventually reaches 1 when using this pattern.</strong></p>
<p>To <em>disprove</em> this, all you have to do is find some starting number that gets stuck in a different loop. We've tried that, though - we've tried every number up to 20 digits long, and they've <em>all</em> hit the 4,2,1 loop. To <em>prove</em> this is true, though, you'll need to come up with some creative insight about the way that numbers relate to each other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Unsolved math problems aren't just difficult equations that you can solve with algebra. They are questions that require creativity to solve. A well known unsolved problem is the Goldbach Conjecture: prove that every even whole number over two is the sum of two prime numbers. People have been working on that one for 250 years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes, even if there is a solid answer, we don't have the ability to get to it.</p>
<p>Take Chess for example. What's the best move at the start? There has to be an answer, even if that answer is &quot;multiple opening moves lead to a draw/win&quot;. However, we do not have the computing power to go through all the possible moves that could prove the answer to this question. That's an unsolved problem. </p>
<p>We can come up with many of these very easily, just by asking &quot;given a set of rules, is a statement true?&quot; And if that question hadn't been asked and answered, then presto, you have just found an unsolved math problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
