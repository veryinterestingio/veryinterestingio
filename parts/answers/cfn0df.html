<p>There are studies that have shown that meditation can slow a heartbeat. This is the result of the 'relaxing' mindset lowering the amount of cortisol being produced. Here's a link:  <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/003193849190543W" target="_blank">Effect of Buddhist Meditation</a></p>
<p>I've also read some articles about monks that claim to be able to do this at will; they can force themselves into the meditative mindset almost instantly. Can't find the links ATM, but will update when I do.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, that does not mean you can <em>control</em> the heartbeat. Your heart does not have the correct nerve connections for this; you'll never be able to control it like your arm muscles, you can only influence it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The actual heartbeat is involuntary and locally generated by the heart itself, but the heart rate is modulated by the vagus nerve and circulating neuroactive hormones, both of which can be controlled by the subconscious brain. </p>
<p>But it takes much more than simply meditating or concentrating on your heart. You would have to reinforce neural pathways that are necessarily obscure and involuntary.  Simple biofeedback with an EKG and meditation techniques would make that possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
