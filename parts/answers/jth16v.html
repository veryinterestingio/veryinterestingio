When you add in the psychological implications of the trauma (depression, guilt, etc) that change the person's affect, the combined result is that the person seems ages older than they were.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s definitely stress and cortisol, but also self care. When I had a traumatic birth experience and my daughter was in the hospital for months I feel like I aged 5 years and part of it was I wasn’t taking good care of myself. I didn’t get my hair done or take good care of my skin. I wasn’t exercising or eating great. Those things can age you, appearance-wise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
