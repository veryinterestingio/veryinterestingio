		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for joining us here in AskScience! How do you go about identifying particular victims in a setting like this? Is it context + the general info you can get from the skeleton like gender, height, and age range? Or is there more detailed info you can get from individual skeletons that narrow down the identity of the remains to a specific person who we know was murdered in this event?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a more personal question - how does this work impact you emotionally? I mean from the the actual human moment you have when interacting with a deceased person? Do you have support when you need it? Does your profession have things in place to prepare you for that? Are you expected to just toughen up? Do you get mad at people who did things in the history youâ€™re discovering?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Dr. Stubblefield!</p>
<p>I had to do a doubletake when I saw your photo on my feed. You're one of the people I respect most in our field and seeing you promote science education through non-traditional channels affirms this. </p>
<p>Does you contract have restrictions on the depth of your analysis? For instance stopping at the biological profile or do you plan to incorporate evidence of embodied structural violence (if present) or cultural context to help in identification for this and or subsequent publications?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
