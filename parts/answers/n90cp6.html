		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes soap can get infected by bacteria.</p>
<p>However, usually the bacteria that come into contact with it don't survive (for long), for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The soap is generally kept dry, and dry porous surfaces tend to suck the water out of the majority of bacteria and kill them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Liquid soap isn't dry, but is usually very viscous, and this will also &quot;suck&quot; the water out of bacteria through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmosis" target="_blank">osmosis</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Soap is generally made by boiling fats in sodium / potassium hydroxide (lye), and as a result it's very alkaline (pH of 9-10), and the majority of bacteria thrive in a &quot;neutral&quot; pH of 7.4 or so.  Cells are quite sensitive to pH values (acidity, alkalinity), and will stop growing / multiplying with values far from the &quot;neutral&quot;.  </p>
</li>
<li>Sodium and potassium also play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_channel" target="_blank">crucial roles</a> in most cells, and high concentrations of either can disrupt the function of a cell.</li>
</ul>
<p>So all in all, several factors make it relatively &quot;toxic&quot; for bacteria to grow on/in soap, but of course there are always strains that are tougher and can survive, so ultimately it IS possible for soap to get infected.  If it happens, I'd guess it would be a mold that gets in there; molds are resilient microorganisms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, soap can become infected. This is because regular soap is not sterilizing. It does not kill all types of germs. It can kill a few types which have a cell membrane consisting of oils which gets dissolved in the soap. But the main way that soap gets rid of germs is by breaking the surface tension on the water so it can get into tight spot and flush out everything. But regular hand soap does contain a lot of fat to help keep your skin moist and this can provide a good feeding ground for bacteria and fungi. And using infected soap can give you a nasty skin infection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of standard soap doesn’t actually kill bacteria, it merely displaces it from your hands. However, soap can’t really become contaminated. germs can sit on a bar of soap for example, but this bacteria is extremely unlikely to make you ill or cause any skin irritation. If for example you were talking about a bar of soap you found in muddy ditch, the chances are any harmful bacteria would come from the mud and not the soap, likewise if you were to shave the dirty layers off the soap you would likely find ‘clean’ soap intact underneath.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Soap by itself does not much and could be a breeding ground due to various ingredients. </p>
<p>The tensides stick to fat and also to the cell membranes of germs. When you thoroughly rub your soaped and wet hands, the fat gets dissolved and the germs torn apart and killed.
Whatever survives is either washed away or too few to pose a threat short term.</p>
<p>Bar soaps should be cleaned and allowed to dry.</p>
