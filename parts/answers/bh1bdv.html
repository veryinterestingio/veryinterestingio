		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Technically we don't &quot;know&quot;</p>
<p>We know</p>
<p>1) The chemical composition of the atmosphere contains a good chunk of methane based on light reflection analysis.</p>
<p>2) We know the mass/volume/density of saturn based on lots of other math and observations.</p>
<p>We put those together and realize that in certain areas of saturn there is enough pressure/temperature to form diamonds.  These would form for a bit <em>sorta</em> like rain/drops and hail do in our atmosphere and then &quot;rain&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>by diamonds scientists dont mean large rocks or even small stones. The pressures and composition of the atmosphere is such that nano crystals of diamonds OR graphite might be produced and rained down like a very fine glitter</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While not exactly answering your question (others have) if you find this interesting you may be interested in knowing <a href="https://www.space.com/18011-super-earth-planet-diamond-world.html" target="_blank">55 Cancri e</a>, a planet twice as wide as earth is made largely up of Diamond. As a result it’s also 8 times more MASS. Crazy.</p>
<p>EDIT: swapped density for mass.. apologies</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Is it also true that the only way a human being could “experience” this phenomenon would be through some kind of VR headset connected to an explorer robot? All these planets where one might find fantastic phenomena like “diamond rain” have gravity, pressure and temperature conditions that are so extreme, we could never really “visit,” right?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
