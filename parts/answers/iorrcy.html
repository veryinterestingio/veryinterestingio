<p>Nobody knows! There are a lot of theories - sheering forces, lactate buildup, “repairing” - all of it not supported by evidence.</p>
<p>We know that it happens when we do an exercise that we aren’t used to, that trained people rarely get it, and that it has no predictive value of how good you worked the muscle out.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called &quot;Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness&quot;, and guys and girls both get it. It's actually not too well understood why it's delayed.</p>
<p>If you <em>really</em> work a new muscle HARD, it could even take 48 hours before feeling sore.</p>
<p>If you feel sore before 12 hours after a workout, you could actually have an injury.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, we don't exactly know. The general consensus is that it's caused by microscopic tears in the muscle fibers, but many exercise physiologists are skeptical and think there's more to it that we don't fully understand yet. What we do know is:</p>
<p>It's not a build-up of lactic acid in the muscles. Lactic acid gets buffered out and dealt with within 60 minutes of your workout. However, it's possible that the initial high concentration of lactic acid in the muscle during and immediately after exercise causes it. But when we wake up the next day and muscles are sore, they are not &quot;full of lactic acid.&quot;</p>
<p>DOMS (the official name) happens when someone does a new type of workout. Squatting heavy weights in the gym will produce DOMS like crazy, but you stop getting DOMS from squats if you keep lifting regularly. However, if you switch squatting rep schemes (going from 5x5 reps to 4x12 reps) DOMS may occur since it's &quot;new.&quot; A lot of people, especially gymbros, call this muscle confusion; and draw the conclusion that you need to switch up your workouts every few weeks or else your body gets used to one particular style and stops adapting. That's not entirely true. The severity of DOMS is not a good indicator on the effectiveness of the workout.  Just because you stopped feeling soreness after workouts, doesn't mean you're not improving.</p>
<p>It's possible to get DOMS the same day. Ultrarunners (crazy people who run 30-200 miles at a time) will talk about getting DOMS during a race, and having to suffer through it. I used to think they were mistaking it for another kind of soreness/fatigue, until it happened to me. It's real.</p>
<p>Sometimes, DOMS won't kick in for me until 48 hours later. I've tried to figure out why, but no luck. I've tried to supplement my workouts with extra stretching, extra walking/cool-down, extra hydration, excessive protein or carbs, creatine powders, ice baths, saunas, etc. to see if anything was a surefire way to prevent DOMS. I've tried to find a correlation between sprint intervals, high rep schemes, low rep schemes, explosive high-speed lifting, isometric holds, etc. and what causes the most DOMS and when it hits. I can't figure out any correlation or preventive measures, but I'm also not very good at record keeping and doing controlled studies on myself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Anecdotally, it happens to me anytime I lift a weight that I haven't lifted before for a number of reps I've never achieved in the past. This applies for main lifts like bench, squat and deadlift - but also applies to lower weight assistance or bodybuilding lifts like DB bench or rows. Again, anecdotal, but really consistent and predictable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body goes through a repair process.</p>
<p>This is generally a timed thing where your body starts of by treating exercised muscles as injured so produces natural painkillers.
It then goes to work on the fatigued muscle but seeing as it is not actually damaged, it stops the pain relief.</p>
<p>Muscle fatigue is painful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
