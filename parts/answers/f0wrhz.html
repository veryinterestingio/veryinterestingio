		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>sleep have 4 stages. At stage 3, it's called Deep Stage, meaning you basically black out, and have 0 idea on whats going on. Extremely difficult to wake someone up in this stage, a Good night sleep will spend a good period of time going between stage 2 and 3, thus it feels extremely short because you have no awareness.</p>
<p>But sometimes when you sleep, whether stress or anxiety, you don't spend much time in deep state, you arn't fully shut off, thus you have some awareness of time passage, thus the sleep feels extremely long.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
