		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A cognitive phenomenon called semantic satiation causes this. Basically what we think happens is that in the brain, there are specific patterns of neutron activity linked to recognising the meanings of words. If you repeat the word over and over (or, interestingly, read the word over and over) the brain starts seeing the constant reaction of this same pattern over and over again as strange, and 'turns it down' so to speak. The brain is good at this, it doesn't want your cognitive processes to get 'hung up' on a certain pattern or stimulus like a computer with a frozen program, so it will naturally turn them down if they are repeated. The result is that with the pattern that recognises meaning temporarily suppressed you start hearing/reading the sound rather than the meaning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This phenomenon is called 'semantic satiation.' As far as we can tell, this happens because of an inhibitive effect which happens in our brain cells associated with language, when they fire repeatedly and rapidly. It's almost like the cells responsible for connecting words to meanings, get tired out with repeated use and become more reluctant to fire again until they've had some time to rest.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
