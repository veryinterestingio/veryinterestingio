		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no direct blood flow between mother and child in mammals. Their blood vessels come in very close contact, close enough to transfer nutrients, oxygen in one direction and CO2 in the other.</p>
<p>In eggs there is a small &quot;empty&quot; compartiment. Like an air bubble, that holds temporarily enough oxygen for the developping bird/..., but the shell isnÂ´t as tight as is seems. There is possibility for gas exchance (O2 in, CO2 out) .Breaking the membrane of that reserve when the chick gets too big and causing high CO2 levels, induces the chicks to break out of the shell.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

And rather  than having to absorbing nutrients etc from the mother, all the nutrients needed for the developing chick/baby reptile/baby monotreme come from the yolk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
