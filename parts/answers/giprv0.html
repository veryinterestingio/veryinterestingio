<p>It is quite a significant effect at mid latitudes.  For instance,  a flight going east is probably 25% or so quicker (and less expensive) than the same flight going west.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well first consider, the rotation of the Earth definitely does affect rocket launches. You only launch a rocket retrograde when you are desperate (for example, Israel due to not wanting to drop stages on neighbours).</p>
<p>But your question is not about rockets, it is about air travel. Airplanes are not in trajectory but rather, push through an air medium; so to fly they constantly work to maintain a difference in speed versus the surrounding air mass. And Earth's rotation has a huge effect on the movement of air masses. Specifically, </p>
<ol>
<li>Coriolis: the air around high pressure spots rotates in one direction, while the air around low pressure spots rotates in the other direction. </li>
<li>And secondly, the jet streams. When an airplane is able to route its trip through a jet stream, they gain about 100kts advantage in ground speed.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simple answer as to why the rotation of the earth doesn't directly impact travel times by air is that airplanes start out moving at the same speed as the ground. So they have no problem traveling with or against the rotation of the Earth because they're already in a rotating Earth-centric reference frame. </p>
<p>As others have mentioned, the rotation of the Earth does have indirect effects on air travel, for example by influencing wind patterns.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you're in a helicopter on the ground. You fly straight up, and hover for 4 hours. Where do you land? Answer is more or less the same spot you took off from, not 4 rotational hours distance away - the whole planet, including the air, is moving at roughly the same speed.  Winds will effect air travel times, which is why it's generally faster to fly west &gt; east than east &gt; west, by a few minutes to an hour or so. The jet stream runs in one direction, so in that direction your travel is slightly faster than if your flight is having to fight the jet stream.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Jet streams and coriolis effect.
At a certain altitude, there are paths of high velocity air that long flights typically try to take advantage of if its flying east in the northern hemisphere or west in the southern hemisphere.
To combat this they either fly at a different altitude or just fly at a higher throttle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
