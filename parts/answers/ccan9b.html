		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, they don't! The simple explanation is this:</p>
<p>In one hair follicle, the hair grows in &quot;phases&quot;. In Phase 1, you have new cells attaching to the end of the hair (at the base/root) and pushing out, &quot;growing&quot; the hair. In Phase 2, new cells stop attaching and you basically have a 'dead' hair follicle - your hair won't grow any longer.</p>
<p>In Phase 3, NEW cells start forming a NEW hair right underneath that last hair, and eventually push it out completely - now you have one long hair that fell out, and a new <em>tiny</em>  hair that's growing in its place.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Every type of hair has different lengths of time for this cycle - this is why your head hair can be three feet long, but you never end up with 10&quot; long eyebrow hairs or arm hairs. It's mostly related to genetics, but in general head hair cycles are a lot longer, while those &quot;baby hairs&quot; are shorter life cycles.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>As an extra piece of information - each follicle is on its own clock, which would be good - otherwise, once every 6 months, all your eyebrows would fall out at the same time and you'd have to wait for them to regrow again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
