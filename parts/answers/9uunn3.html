		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OK follow up question why does O3 block certain wavelengths of light? is it simply the angle of the triple bonds and space between the atoms that causes those wavelengths of light to cancel themselves out through refraction or do they bounce off for some other reason?  I just spent 2 minutes googling it and all I found were videos about how it breaks down and I am lazy so I am asking here.  Thanks</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you are referring to the recent news story, it is because we stopped using CFCs (CFCl3), which catalytically destroy ozone (meaning it destroys an ozone molecule, and then regenerates as a CFC so it can destroy another). This means that a single CFC molecule getting loose could deplete the ozone layer entirely. However, side reactions, such as those with nitrosyls, will consume the CFCs, &quot;quenching&quot; the reaction, and essentially removing the CFC from being able to do damage to the ozone. As other people have said, ozone is always being generated by the sun creating oxygen radicals. So by us not adding any more CFCs, and the ones we did add in the 60s slowly being consumed, the overall amount of ozone reequlibrates to around what it was like before we started dumping CFCs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A single oxygen atom must chemically interact with an oxygen molecule (O2). This happens just by randomly bumping into each other. The free atom has enough &quot;bonding energy&quot; to create a 3 atom molecule called ozone (O3). </p>
<p>So where does this single oxygen atom come from? Sun rays can sometimes break the double covalent bond holding together an oxygen molecule (O2). With enough energy, the atoms will fly apart instead of bonding with each other again. </p>
<p>Lastly, how does the layer heal? Given enough time, these interactions happen enough to overcome the damage created by CFCs and other ozone destroying molecules. But this is only because the human race over the last 20-30 years has decreased the amount of CFCs being released into the atmosphere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
