		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are right. When you open the fridge you let hot air into the fridge. When you close it the hot air will cool down which means that the pressure gets lower sucking the door to the frame. There are small vents in the back which will let air into the fridge (these can freeze up with ice and should be checked from time to time). However it takes a bit of time for the pressure in the fridge to equalize. So the fridge door will be sucked into the frame of the fridge for a bit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbZLJWpJEP4" target="_blank">Sci-show did an exact episode on this recently!</a> the basics are that the inside of the fridge is cold, and the pressure inside the door and outside are equal. When you open it, hot air goes into the fridge. Then you close the door, and the fridge cools down the air. Since cold air is more dense than hot air, it lowers the pressure of the air on the inside creating a slight vacuum. Over time, air slowly leaks into the fridge to eventually equal out the pressure again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
