<p>Why does U-235 split when hit with a neutron instead of becoming U-236?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It can do that too. Fission is not the only possible outcome. It can scatter (elastically or inelastically), or undergo radiative capture, or a whole host of other nuclear reactions. Each of these reactions has its own probability, and all of them are functions of energy.</p>
<p>But the ^(235)U(n,f) (neutron-induced fission) cross section is pretty high. For thermal neutrons, the fission cross section is almost 6 times higher than the capture cross section, so fission is about 6 times more likely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, it does become U-236 just before it undergoes fission, but the amount of time that it's U-236 is fractions of fractions of a second. What happens is that the U-236 nucleus that's briefly formed has a lot more energy than U-236 wants to have, so usually the U-236 nucleus splits into two smaller nuclei (\~1/3 and 2/3 the mass) and a few extra neutrons. It <strong><em>can</em></strong> stay as U-236 and give off a gamma ray to release the energy, but that's a lot less common than fission.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
