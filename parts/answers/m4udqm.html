<p>When you see people scooping up bees or wearing clumps of bees on their face etc this is because the are handling the bees when they are swarming.</p>
<p>When bees are swarming they are less aggressive due to the fact they have no hive or honey to defend.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Believed that my whole life &amp; never had a problem with bees. When I was 28, a friend came over for drinks on the patio. A bee is present. She's freaking out &amp; asks me why I'm not worried. I tell her I can't get stung again, to which she instantly demyths. At which point I look at the bee, &amp; it suicide bombs the back of my knee. Brutal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They do sting the keeper, occasionally. In general, the keeper knows how to handle them, how to not trigger their defenses. For instance, they can use smoke to calm them down. The smoke doesnÂ´t anaesthesize the bees, it makes them instinctively fill their bellies with food because they associate smoke with wildfires, which means hard times and chances of starvation. They become full and dull. The smoke also masks smells, or pheromones they normally use to navigate the environment. When inhibited, they go passive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both commentors are absolutely right. I'd just like to add my two cents as someone with two colonies.</p>
<p>As a bee keeper you know when the bees are going to be angry or not. If the weather is somewhat cold and damp (shouldn't be entering the hive) if you're in the hive for an emergency they're going to be pissed off. Similarly if it's extremely hot or windy. Bees gst wound up just like human do even with smoke.</p>
<p>Also, I wear my suit every time and I've still been stung through it. Just comes with the territory. It's kind of a right if passage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know the video you saw. At the beginning she was using a smoker. That tells the bees there is fire. In a fire emergency bees swallow as much honey as they can carry for the escape which has the same effect as you post-big-stuffed-dinner.</p>
<p>That said, I guarantee she got stung during that whole process. Bee keepers are just so used to it they don't jerk, jostle or anything. For them it's as everyday as bumping your elbow on a table. Think Steve Irwin whenever he got bit or stung. He kept a smile and a happy tone of voice that never faltered as he continued narrating.</p>
<p>Also it was for a commercial/promo video, so they cut to clips where she is smiling and had perfect hair and makeup instead of showing the whole process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
