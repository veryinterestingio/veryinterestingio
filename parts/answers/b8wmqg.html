		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA in our genomes is probably just neutral and doesn't have any noticeable effects.  However, it's generally thought that Neanderthal DNA has a higher chance of containing mildly deleterious regions, either because they just don't match perfectly with the <em>Homo sapiens</em> background they find themselves in, or because they already had minor negative fitness consequences in Neanderthals too, but were too weak to be removed by selection.  So it's likely that the percentage of Neanderthal DNA in our genomes has actually been slowly decreasing over time, and though this isn't totally proven, there is support for this idea from both <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/11/161108145257.htm" target="_blank">mathematical modelling</a> and actual <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4943878/" target="_blank">study of historical DNA</a>.</p>
<p>However, there are some regions we've inherited from these interbreeding events that are beneficial too.  For example, it's been shown that some populations living at high altitude in Asia have a <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/07/tibetans-inherited-high-altitude-gene-ancient-human" target="_blank">gene that comes from Denisovans</a> and helps increase the amount of hemoglobin in their blood to deal with lower oxygen levels.  So basically, this gene helped the <em>Homo sapiens</em> who were spreading across Asia to live in habitats that Denisovans were already adapted to.  In the case of Neanderthals, there is some evidence that they gave us <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/10/181004112547.htm" target="_blank">genes that increased resistance to certain diseases</a>, which again would have been beneficial as our ancestors spread into Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>This phenomenon is called &quot;adaptive introgression&quot;, and basically results in humans keeping a few useful genes from the species we hybridized with, but getting rid of most of the rest, which are often weakly detrimental.  So, as far as I'm aware, there are no direct examples of diseases caused by Neanderthal genes specifically, but they could potentially have lots of very small effects which may influence your overall health.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd just like to point out, that just because there are some DNA bits, that have come form other races of the Homo Genus, those are not outright &quot;non-Homo sapiens DNA&quot;. Modern humans are not just a single DNA-sequence but a range and those bits are well within the definition for humans, too, even if there were not in the archaic humans during the time they coexisted with Neanderthals</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><a href="https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/dtcgenetictesting/neanderthaldna" target="_blank">https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/dtcgenetictesting/neanderthaldna</a></p>
<p>Studies have suggested that certain genetic variations inherited from archaic humans may play roles in hair texture, height, sensitivity of the sense of smell, immune responses, adaptations to high altitude, and other characteristics in modern humans. These variations may also influence the risk of developing certain diseases. However, the significance of Neanderthal or Denisovan genetic variants on disease risk is still an area of active study, and most direct-to-consumer test results currently do not include them.</p>
<p>Not Enough study has been done to prove.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First off, there's some dispute about how non-modern-human-but-still-human subspecies should be classified. Most anthropologists use <em>Homo sapiens sapiens</em> to refer to modern humans (or HSS), while <em>Homo sapiens neandertalis</em> refers to Neanderthals. Denisovans and Floresiensans get a little more complicated and seem to come down to personal bias (e.g. <em>Homo sapiens floresiensis</em> or <em>Homo floresiensis</em>).</p>
<p>Second, all species are comprised of a great deal of DNA which can be traced to species other than their direct lineage. This is more the impact of retrovirus infections far back in our ancestry than anything else, but it's still important to understand that DNA is much closer to a drunken transcription of a crowded room than it is to a nicely organized encyclopedia. Most genotypes simply have no meaning at all, at least in our cells. So a large part of your question can be answered by simply understanding that much of the DNA which is not attributable to our &quot;direct&quot; lineage is simply… irrelevant.</p>
<p>But not all of it. We've now fully sequenced the Neanderthal genome (with some significant reconstructions), which gives us a relatively precise idea of how they differed from us, genetically, and also more precisely what stretches of <em>our</em> DNA likely came from them (via interbreeding). This has allowed us to conclude some interesting things, such as the fact that most of our Neanderthal DNA comes from female lineage, meaning that HSS men were breeding with HSN women much more frequently than HSN men were breeding with HSS women (though the latter definitely happened). This in turn probably says something about the cultural relations between the two people groups, but now we're getting into weird speculative territory.</p>
<p>Anyway, the answer you're probably looking for…</p>
<p>The Neanderthal genetic strands which are most commonly expressed in modern HSS descendants have been associated with increasing odds of several expressed traits, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increased clavicle size</li>
<li>Larger forehead</li>
<li>Higher risk of schizophrenia</li>
<li>Higher incidence of genius-level IQ</li>
<li>Higher risk of dementia</li>
<li>Lower susceptibility to certain diseases</li>
</ul>
<p>That's just off the top of my head. There are certainly other impacts, and remember that all of these are just &quot;thumb on the scale&quot; type effects. For example, the higher incidence of genius-level IQ point should <em>not</em> be interpreted to mean that populations with more Neanderthal DNA are on average &quot;smarter&quot; than other populations of HSS. It's a very small effect from a relatively small percentage of certain populations, and who knows what &quot;smarter&quot; means anyway?</p>
<p>I think the real takeaway from the fact that we carry DNA from our contemporary homo cousins is that they, truly, weren't all that different from us. Neanderthals in particular were a remarkable people, and we're only starting to scratch the surface of understanding what they were like and what they achieved, but everything we find points to something remarkable. There's evidence that they invented art before we did. They had very complex burial rituals and there's evidence of organized religion. They had <em>substantially</em> larger brains than we do, and given other genetic markers, it's likely they were on average more intelligent than the average modern human (directly flying in the face of the stereotype that they were brutish, grunting &quot;cavemen&quot;). They survived in significantly hardier environments (notably the European steppe) long before we developed the technology to do so. They lived in harmony with our ancestors for hundreds of generations, again flying in the face of more sensationalist theories that we wiped them out with our superior knowledge of war. Our ancestors saw them as people just like themselves, to the extent that they regularly fell in love and raised children together (we have far too much DNA from them for it to stem from isolated rapes, particularly since the offspring survived and were obviously accepted into HSS society).</p>
<p>In the end, they died off for a very complicated set of reasons probably mostly stemming from the changing environment in Eurasia, while we survived and became the dominant species on Earth. It could have just as easily been them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people have answered this in great detail, especially u/That_Biology_Guy. But the ELI5 version is basically humans are known to have hybridized with two other human-like species; Neanderthals and Denisovans. Largely, we are getting rid of that DNA through time since most of it probably has bad effects on human fitness. However, any bits of Neanderthal DNA that have managed to stick around are in genetic regions that associate with RNA virus variation. Essentially, we think that when humans met with Neanderthal, we were exposed to their viruses. Their DNA was adapted to deal with those viruses already, so when human and Neanderthal had babies, their DNA helped humans cope with the newly encountered diseases. Denisovan DNA is particularly associated with human populations living at high altitudes in places like Nepal. Denisovans lived in places with high altitudes, and had adaptations for coping with things like low Oxygen. So we think that, as humans expanded into Asia, capturing bits of Denisovan DNA helped humans adapt to those new, high-elevation conditions that they weren't used to.</p>
<p>TL;DR- Most DNA from other hominid species has slightly bad fitness effects in humans, so we got rid of most of it. But, we got some DNA from Neanderthal to help cope with new diseases, and some DNA from Denisovans to adapt to newly encountered conditions, particularly high altitudes, and those bits have stuck around in our genomes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
