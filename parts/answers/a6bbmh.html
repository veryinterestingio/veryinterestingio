		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A knife that has stabbed into you has pierced through and severed your arteries and veins. It also, while inside you, is (mostly, sort of) physically blocking the blood flow from those severed connections. It's not a total block, but it's blocking it more than it would be if it were pulled out and left a gap between both sides of the split.</p>
<p>If you leave the knife in, your blood loss is slower. This gives you more time to get to the hospital where you can be stabilized and helped before blood loss is a more fatal concern.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Disclaimer:  I'm an ER doc.  </p>
<p>That is standard advice for any sort of impalement injury (where a stick, sword, rod, knife, or other penetrating object is retained in the body.  </p>
<p>This is done because the retained object is sometimes tamponading (compressing) a nearby vascular structure, and removal can relieve the pressure on that vessel/organ, leading to rapid blood-loss and death.</p>
<p>When I was training, we had case where a man fell off some construction scaffolding onto a metal pipe, impaling himself through his abdomen.  The EMS crew (with the help of the construction crew) cut the pipe where it was sticking out of his back, and brought the patient into the hospital with the pipe still in place.  He was conscious, sitting up on the stretcher, with a pipe sticking out of his abdomen.   He couldn't lay down because the pipe was also sticking out of his back.</p>
<p>They took him straight to the OR.  With a vascular surgeon, trauma surgeon, and a full OR crew poised at the bedside, they literally did a &quot;Ready everyone?  On a count of three...&quot; induction, where they put him under anesthesia still sitting-up.  They pulled out the pipe, rapidly laid him down as they opened him up, and got control of the bleeding.  </p>
<p>It was a good thing too... the pipe had clipped the aorta, and was tamponading the bleeding.  If they'd removed it any other way, he'd have died.  </p>
<p>As it was, he survived.</p>
<p>And that is why you don't pull out impaled objects.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>AHA and Red Cross Instructor:</p>
<p>We teaching leaving imbedded objects in place for the reasons other people have listed: severed blood vessels.  When the knife (or other objects) penetrate, they could sever blood vessels.  The knife may create pressure or block the blood from flowing out of the wound.  The is also the possibility with other types of objects (or a knife) that you could cause more damage. </p>
<p>If possible, place clean gauze padding around the wound and then wrap roller gauze around the area.  This is meant to stabilize the object, preventing further injury and keep the object in place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
