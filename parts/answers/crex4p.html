		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it is different types of hair, and they react differently to hormones!  </p>
<p>The main culprit is Dihydrotestosterone, a hormone that starts being produced during/after puberty, which causes both the production of beard/body hair, and also has the side effect of causing baldness. </p>
<p>It obviously isn’t as simple as getting more bald as you get more beard hair, because there are other factors, including genetics, that contribute to both, but Dihydrotestosterone is a contributing factor to both, and there is not currently anything that we are aware of that contributes to “beard balding.”</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
