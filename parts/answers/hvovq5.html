		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neuroscience major here. Covered this in my physiology class last semester in uni. /u/PavlovsHumans is partially correct. Theres a 3-point model:</p>
<ol>
<li>Younger children have a lack of vasopressin release</li>
<li>Younger children tend to have poor bladder control, either due to low capacity (they tend to hold in pee as long as they can) or have overactive bladders (uninhibited bladder contractions)</li>
<li>Children have a developing central nervous system and spinal cord, meaning they may not have the full capacity to interpret and respond to a full bladder as well as an adult</li>
</ol>
<p>Interestingly, children who are born premature or have low birth weights have higher rates of bed-wetting for longer periods of time. This again is probably due to the developing central nervous system.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>*** Edit: It looks like PavlovsHumans answer has been drowned out by the other comments. Vasopressin is a hormone that makes you produce less pee (anti-diuretic). Sorry if that was confusing!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An adult produces anti-diuretic hormone (vasopressin), and so make less urine during sleep. What usually happens is the adult wakes briefly in sleep and feels the sensation of fullness (rather than waking because they need to pee)</p>
<p>A young child doesnâ€™t produce this hormone, and so will continue to produce large amounts of urine through the night, and often the bladder will be full during the sleep cycle, leading to the child to pee during their sleep.</p>
