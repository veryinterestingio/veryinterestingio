		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know how when the moon is in the sky and you drive in your car the moon seems to follow you at the same speed you're travelling.  This also happens for a bug, like a moth, so when it wants to travel in a straight line it puts the moon in one spot in its vision and keeps it there as it moves.  If it wants to turn it will move the spot the moon appears to be to its eye. (I hope this is clear enough).</p>
<p>So when a light is close by the moth thinks it's the moon and it wants to travel in a straight line, but in  order to keep the light in the same spot in its vision it needs to be constantly turning (like try to keep a spot on your wall in the same spot of your vision as you walk by it, you'll need to turn as you walk by it to maintain its position relative to your eye).  This circle quickly tightens as you move around the object and get closer to it until you run into the object, like a moth into a flame.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are not really attracted to it. when you see then running aimlessly they are using the light to go straight. </p>
<p>Imagine wanting to go straight by only using your sight. You can try doing it by always keeping the sun on your left and it will work fine.
Now do that with an artificial light and you will find yourself going in circles.</p>
<p>If you instead go straight towards the light you will bump against the bulb and seem to be attracted to it, even though you're just trying to go straight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Birds do this also, especially migratory waterfowl.  Some building managers and / or cities have policies and ordinances that buildings turn off or dim their lighting after certain hours to allow endangered birds safer passage.   Some cities have bird rescue groups who search for birds who get disoriented and exhausted and end up on the sidewalks.  In Chicago, the group is “Bird Collision Monitors”.  I see them frequently in the mornings on my walk to work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of good, but slightly misleading information in this thread. Most everyone has stated that insects are attracted to lights because it interferes with their navigational instincts - i.e., they confuse the light source with the moon, and in trying to keep it in the same relative position fly in ever-tightening circles around it until they hit a wall or some other surface impedes their movement.</p>
<p>This is one of the most popular theories among scientists, but unlike most of the comments would have you believe, this is far from accepted fact. The honest answer is: <strong>entomologists don't know for sure!!</strong> Anyone who presents their favored theory as more than just a theory is either not aware of the science or being disingenuous. </p>
<p>Here are two popular science channels which cover this phenomenon and various theories surrounding it:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nocturnal bugs navigate by moonlight. When they see a light in the dark they'll move towards it as a result. This can also be due to looking for water reflections on sunlight or a similar reasons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
