		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The adult brain of a holometabolous insect is a direct continuation of the original, larval brain. The original larval neurons are indeed lost during the pupal stage, but the adult neurons are being added and wired up at the same time. From a &quot;zoomed out&quot; view, you would just think the brain was growing and changing shape. So I guess the question of whether it is still the original brain is probably a &quot;ship of theseus&quot; argument.</p>
<p>There's an awesome image series here: <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/1179/fnsys-04-00007-r2/image_n/fnsys-04-00007-g006.gif" target="_blank">https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/1179/fnsys-04-00007-r2/image_n/fnsys-04-00007-g006.gif</a></p>
<p>And the paper on how they got it: <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2010.00007/full" target="_blank">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2010.00007/full</a></p>
<p>That paper also links to a couple of other papers describing in more detail how the brain develops.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just for some clarity on the process of metamorphosis: butterfly caterpillars don’t “encapsulate” themselves in a cocoon; this would imply they build something around themselves and that’s not what happens. </p>
<p>Caterpillars, along with a lot of other animals, grow by moulting. When they want to grow into the next life stage, they shed their exoskeleton, revealing a new soft exoskeleton underneath which quickly hardens and allows them to become larger. Most caterpillars have five larval stages (or instars), before metamorphosis. The fifth instar sheds its skin, just like it’s about to grow again, but rather than revealing a new soft caterpillar exoskeleton, a pupal case (or chrysalis) forms. Later, the butterfly will emerge from this. </p>
<p>The imaginal discs don’t form in the pupa; they’ve been there all along through all the caterpillar stages and were actually initially formed before the caterpillar even hatched from the egg. So inside the pupa, these pieces can be put together kind of like IKEA flat pack furniture. </p>
<p>Contrary to popular understanding, not much “dissolving” of tissue happens at all. It’s only really the gut, muscles and some trachea that must be broken down. However, in the very early stages post-pupation, the tissues and structures inside the chrysalis are very thin and very soft, giving the impression that there is just mush in there. It’s actually highly ordered mush! I think “they dissolve their tissues” sounds really cool though, so science communicators often run with that line rather than with the (imho) much more interesting reality. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You should probably investigate the Theseus Ship. The notion that some kind of durable physical continuity makes you <em>you</em> doesn’t take into account the fact that virtually every cell in your body is replaced many times, with “only the genetic information in common.”</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
