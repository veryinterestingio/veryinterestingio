		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When they go deep more air (Mainly the nitrogen but, you know, eli5) soaks into their blood and if they come up to quick it comes back out and makes painful/deadly bubbles inside their blood and body. </p>
<p>When they hear the very loud noise from the sonar it scares them and they swim too fast to the surface making those bubbles form in their blood and kills them. </p>
<p>You may have seen a similar effect with a two liter of soda, the dissolved co2 gas that makes soda bubbly stays dissolved because it is under pressure. If you remove the cap and let the pressure out slow the gas can start to come out slowly and will go flat eventually. This is like your lungs slowly taking out that extra gas. </p>
<p>If you take the cap off very quickly there’s a short rush of bubbles that form, this is like the air bubbles that form in your blood of you don’t give your lungs time to breath out the extra air. </p>
<p>eli12:
replace “air” with “nitrogen”
Replace “scares” with “likely is the excruciatingly painful equivalent of blowing out their sonar eardrums a-la tremors/dynamite combo”</p>
<p>Edit- thanks kind strangers for the silver and GOLD, never had that before, gotta figure out how to use it now :)</p>
<p>Edit: to all those saying you have to breathe compressed air to get the bends there are free-divers confirmed to have gotten the bends after extreme, freakishly superhuman deep dives. Herbert nitsch used a torpedo like sled to Freedive to 831 feet(wholly crap) and got the bends so that confirms it.
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Nitsch" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Nitsch</a>
Keep in mind that was straight down and straight up as fast as he could go in an apparatus pulling him along faster than you can normally swim on one surface breath of air. The bends he got caused permanent damage and now he has balance issues. Neat youtube vid on it, worlds deepest man. He actually passed out due to nitrogen narcosis(ie you are literally drunk on nitrogen) and fell asleep under water, was raised to the surface too quick, and got the bends</p>
<p>The culviers beaked whale can dive to 9,874 feet  and on that dive the whale stayed down for 2 hours 17 mins. Plenty of time to get the bends coming up too fast. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone here is saying its because the whales surface too quickly - and they are correct, but there's a bit more to it than that:</p>
<p>Low frequency acoustic signals permeates through a medium more easily than higher-frequency acoustic signals. This is why outside of a club you can hear the bass, but not the vocals. Sonar uses this property to send signals far through the water and even below the ocean floor to search for oil deposits, and even look for objects in the water such as submarines, old shipwrecks, and even tracking marine life. Much the same as bass from music doesn't physically hurt you (you can sense it and it can be uncomfortable and annoying), low frequency signals don't hurt whales - they just scare them.</p>
<p>So that's great! These low frequency signals are just scaring the whales, and they surface too quickly essentially giving them the bends right? Why are whales so dumb and just leave slower? Well, the answer to that is: whales aren't that dumb. A scary noise doesn't cause them to surface so quickly they hurt themselves, there is a bit more to it than that. We have to talk about <em>how</em> we generate sonar signals to understand why whales are surfacing so quickly.</p>
<p>The downside to low frequency signals is that they take a <em>lot</em> of power to generate. In fact, the only reliable way we have to do this right now is through the use of air guns (which compress a column of air and then releases it underwater), or explosives. Both of these methods have the unwanted side-effect of generating very loud broadband (or &quot;all frequency&quot;) noise. This means the whales hear very loud signals in their hearing range, which very similarly to us can cause pain and deafness. It's these signals that cause pain that cause the whales to surface too quickly, because they find themselves in a lot of discomfort. </p>
<p>Another downside of this is that most whales use a form of bio-sonar to search for food - they &quot;clap&quot; their blowhole together very rapidly and listen for echoes to find krill and other food sources. This loud noise can deafen the whales, which effectively blinds their bio-sonar, and then they starve to death.</p>
<p>So, the best solution for this is to develop some sort of source that can generate low frequency signals, without generating the high-frequency portions. An underwater sub-woofer if you will. This would give us the penetration power of the low frequency signals without causing whales actual discomfort. While it may have other effects (such as diverting whales away from a mating area), it would be much less impactful than our current solutions. There is a lot of research in this field, but there are no commercially available products just yet.</p>
<p><strong>ELI5</strong>: Sonar surveying is not the problem, its the side effects of generating the signals required for surveying that is. Normally, scary noises would just cause them to leave at their own pace, however the side effects of our scary signal generation causes whales discomfort and pain as well, which is why they surface so quickly.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two ways:</p>
<p>First, the sound itself can cause microbubbles of air to form on and in the whales' skin.  This is a well-known effect and is described in detail in <a href="http://www.thecre.com/sefReports/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Crum-L.A.-Mao-Y.-1996.-Acoustically.pdf" target="_blank">Crum &amp; Mao, 1996</a></p>
<p>Additionally, the sound may cause whales to panic and think they are under attack; they will rise rapidly, causing &quot;the bends&quot; in the same way that divers rising too quickly will suffer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's been a known thing in Sperm Whales for a number of years, they dive real deep, and sometimes they stay down too long. Some drown, others end up with the bends.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It's mainly offshore gas and oil ocean mapping doing the damage with their ridiculously loud sonic cannons that creates a pressure/sound wave that can be heard underwater thousands of m,iles away by marine life.</p>
<p>&quot;  The cannons emit sound waves louder than a jet engine every ten seconds for weeks at a time. &quot;</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>edit: Additional</p>
<p>&quot;Low frequency sound waves can propagate for thousands of miles underwater,&quot; said Moir, who has also worked as a certified marine mammal observer during seismic surveying in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>'In addition, the airguns used in the seismic surveys can cause hearing loss and mask mating calls and other biologically important sound for whales, fish and other wildlife.</p>
<p>Most research on the issue revolves around the sound impact on marine mammals. The impact on sea turtles is less clear. Sea turtles don't have ear drums or external ears, but their auditory sense is adapted to vibrations in the water.</p>
<p>A federal environmental study of the proposed seismic surveys includes several alternatives for ways to avoid harming wildlife. Proposals include closing certain offshore areas to seismic surveying during the main sea turtle nesting season and during right whale migration.'</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also, whales have a large organ that directs and detects sonar, this is found to be ruptured in some whales. They even been spotted trying to swim to shore to get away from nearby vessels pinging in the bays and fjords. It hurst so bad they are trying to beach themselves to get away.</p>
<p>It would be like exposing humans to sonic blasts of hi pitched noise from which they can't escape.</p>
<p>Sound devices they use at riots and sonic alarms they employ to thwart burglars cone to mind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
