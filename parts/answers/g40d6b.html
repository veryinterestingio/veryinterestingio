		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tetanus is a disease that causes muscles to contract, and the vaccine contains just enough of the active substance to induce a slight but persistent (and luckily temporary) contraction at the site of injection. That's why the nurse or whomever is administering the vaccine asks which arm you want for the shot; it's generally easier to tolerate in the non-dominant arm.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Luckily as a boy, when the other boys found out one of us got a tetanus shot in the arm, we were all kind enough to help loosen up the muscles by unexpectedly punching the patient in the spot where the shot was administered. Real friendship kinda stuff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This explained a lot to me.. As a 6 year old child (uk) I got mine in the thigh.. what was a 5 minute walk from school turned into a 45 minute walk. For three weeks it really felt like someone was stabbing me in the leg. turns out I'm allergic to the vaccine and its life threateningly dangerous for me. hearing with my adult mind how tetanus vaccine hurts most folk it now make more sense as to why it was so painful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey Op. I got a tetanus shot 2 years ago and it wasn't nearly as bad as when I got it done in middle school. Not an explanation, I just wanted to let you know it may not be as sore this time around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've had 3 TDaP and 2 TD. I can tell you everyone reacts differently. I did not move my arm around after on some of them and those were the worst reactions. The last TD I got I babied and it was swollen and painful for at least 2 weeks.</p>
<p>Be sure to move that arm around a bunch afterwards. </p>
<p>I give vaccines at a pediatric clinic. I always tell the kid and parent it's super important to move their arm afterward and I recommend shoveling the driveway, folding laundry, doing dishes if the kid doesn't seem to believe me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
