		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Medications can work in a lot of different ways. One type that is prone to building tolerance are drugs that work in the brain by changing the strength of different chemicals. If a drug increases the effect of one chemical, then it works well at first, but the brain often adjusts one area to compensate for another. The brain might get rid of some of the receptors that are used by that chemical if it decides there is too much of it, making the drug less effective. Sometimes that just means the person needs a dose increase, because usually this balances out and you can still end up with more of that brain chemical than you had before, even after the brain tries to compensate for it.</p>
<p>This is also how drug addiction and withdrawal can work. If a drug causes your brain to reduce activity in an important area, then stopping the drug can leave not enough of it. This is really bad if that chemical helped your brain slow down when it needs to, and that's how withdrawal seizures can sometimes happen.</p>
<p>Other medications work in different ways that don't cause your body to compensate for them and are less likely to lead to tolerance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Vast topic- here is a quick attempt-
1- receptors get used to drug. Take some pain medicine- body makes more receptors for that medicine- now you need more pain medicine to fill up those receptors. Feed your puppy- he grows bigger- now you need to feed it more
2- liver- some medication rev up /down the system. Produce or reduce the amount of enzyme. Alcohol is good examples... 1 beer after a long time is a good buzz.. drink it everyday- you don’t event feel it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An important distinction to make here, as it's often misunderstood: <strong>tolerance</strong> and drug <strong>resistance</strong> are not the same thing. </p>
<p><strong>Tolerance</strong> is the reduced reaction of a human patient to drugs due to repeated or prolonged use. </p>
<p><strong>Resistance</strong> is the reduction of effectiveness of antibiotic and antiviral drugs due to the acquired resistance of the bacteria or viruses they are meant to treat. Simply put, resistance is a bacteria learning to defend itself against antibiotics, resulting in stronger pathogens which cannot be fought against with routine antibiotics. This endangers patients in the long-term as antibiotics simply stop working to protect us. Routine surgeries become more dangerous as a minor infection can become deadly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another good example is the overexpression and/or increased activity of drug efflux transporters. These transporters are present on the cell membrane and can export drugs out of the cell, thereby reducing the overall intracellular concentration and reducing the efficacy of the drug.</p>
<p>Alternatively, there may also be increased expression/activity of enzymes such as the CYP450 family which metabolise drugs into a non-active form (if the drug isn’t a pro-drug), similarly reducing the concentration of active drug in the system. The activity and expression of these enzymes can be pre-determined by our very own genetic make-up but also modulated from the things we consume (food, drink, other medication), things we are exposed to (chemicals in cigarette smoke) and even our current state (age, pregnancy). </p>
<p>As for the specificity of drugs which a tolerance is built up towards. These drug efflux transporters and enzymes typically interact with a subset of drugs and it is these drugs which become less effective over time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends if the body has a system which is able to measure the influence of the medication and also counter balance the effect. This is called homeostasis and is mostly a problem for long time steady dose medications or drugs ie. coffein that you throw in every three hours is easier to get a tolerance than ibuprofen that you take every two weeks. </p>
<p>Some drugs target system that are just not balanced in the body, insulin would be an example as far as i know. The amount of insulin is control by bloodsugar and as insulin effects bloodsugar it is its own regulator making an additional feedback loop unnecessary. But take that with a grain of salt i could imagine such a loop exists and i just dont know about it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
