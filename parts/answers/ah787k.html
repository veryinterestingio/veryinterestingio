		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The biggest reason is eggs are a natural source of lecithin. Lecithin is an emulsifier that binds both fats and water together. With out it, many foods wouldn't have the texture that it has. </p>
<p>Unfortunately my chemistry knowledge is rather weak, hopefully someone else can explain more about it, because i'd also like to know more. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Someone mentioned binding water and fats together and what happens is this:</p>
<p>True ELI5: Imagine the egg yolk as a piece of fabric but one side is the rough side of a piece of velcro and the other side is the soft side of a piece of velcro. One side binds to water really well and the other binds to fats and when we mix up the egg into our recipes, we can bind to both fats and water at the same time. If we dont use eggs to bind them, they repel each other and we end up with a much less dense product that is often tougher and doesn't have as nice of a texture.</p>
<p>ELI12: Egg yolks contain phospholipids and the phospholipids in egg yolks have hydrophilic (water-loving) heads and hydrophobic (water-repelling) heads and together they work together to bind water and oils/fats together to create a lighter more flavorful dish.</p>
<p>edit: corrected myself; it's the yolk not the white. Also, I learned all of this from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79_IsTV8X-c" target="_blank">THIS</a> video a few days ago, the egg situation starts at about 8 minutes in</p>
<p>Edit2: holy cow GOLD AND SILVER thank you so much!!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Eggs are amazing, they
foam (increase volume/rising agent ie. Pavlova, souffle), </p>
<p>coagulate (when heated over 60degrees Celsius begins to set, perfect for creme brule), </p>
<p>and emulsify (lecithin in egg allows two liquids, that usually separate, hold together ie. The oil and vinegar/mustard in a mayonnaise) Which has many many uses in cooking/baking</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are other things you can use other than eggs as a binder.  Using apples - peeled, sliced, boiled for 10 minutes, and then pureed- works really well if you know someone that has an egg allergy.  Bananas work as well - you just mash them- but they make everything taste like...banana.  Works well in chocolate chip cookies or in a chocolate cake but not much else.  Apples just add a hint of sweetness but not an &quot;apple&quot; taste.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s a cultural element to it as well. For a large chunk of history, keeping chickens was one of the cheapest ways to have a steady stream of nutrient dense food on the table. It’s no wonder that eggs show up in so many recipes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
