If everything that you ate had grain in it then you were just considering sickly and having digestive issues. it wasn't until Holland during World War II when they had bread shortages and a doctor noticed that when they had no bread some of the people got healthier and then relapsed when they started having bread again.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The thing about Celiac's is that it isn't like an allergy to peanuts where you have an allergic reaction. It damages your intestines, which not only isn't as obvious over long periods of time but also takes years to fully cause an impact, and when it does after 10+ years of eating gluten the impacts are usually severe enough to kill you. </p>
<p>Also we didn't only eat bread, a lot of the world are exclusively potatoes or rice. It depended where you came from</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In my wife's case, doctor's think another illness triggered celiac in her. She was the biggest pasta / bread lover with no issues for the first 35 years of her life. Then she got sick out of the blue and wasn't getting better. Finally they figured out she had celiac which they think was triggered possibly by the norovirus. It's just a guess by the doctors but it's the best they can come up with. Never had an issue and suddenly she cant eat bread.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the other responses I'll point out that a growing number of people are recognizing that they have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FODMAP" target="_blank">FODMAP</a> sensitivities. You can think of it kind of like an allergy in that when they consume something that contains a particular type of ingredient (fructans, sorbitol, disaccharaides, etc.) they don't feel well. One of the FODMAPs is fructans/fructose (which is a sugar, think high fructose corn syrup) and is naturally found in many things including brussels sprouts, garlic, and wheat. So for a lot of people it's not actually gluten that they have an issue with, it's fructans. And like lots of medical things, this has probably been going on for thousands of years, but since people up until recently had no idea how complex gut chemistry was they just didn't label it as anything.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
