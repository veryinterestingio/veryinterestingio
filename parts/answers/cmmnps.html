		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lot of mostly correct stuff below, but here's the ELI5 skinny:</p>
<p>Over a hundred years ago, a guy named Dow came up with a concept of tracking &quot;the general market&quot;, instead of each individual stock. He, along with a stats guy named Jones, created an index called the Dow Jones Transportation Index (DJT) in 1884 - this was a price-weighted index of (initially) nine railroads; eventually this grew to 20 companies in areas such as freight, airlines, etc.  In 1896, they added the Dow-Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) of 30 major industrial companies. (The industrials are what most people think of when they refer to the &quot;Dow&quot;.) Finally, the Dow-Jones Utility Average of 15 major utilities - electricity, gas, etc. - was created as well. Together, they form the DJ65, although that is not followed as closely as the DJIA. </p>
<p>Each index was an attempt to gauge the overall movement of the market. For example, suppose Exxon is up $3, but GM is down $1.50, while Caterpillar is up $0.75 but Apple is down $1. Did the overall market go up or down that day? All stock indices attempt to answer that question. The Dow is considered the narrowest of these indices, as it only includes 30 stocks, whereas the S&amp;P500 contains 500 stocks, and the Russell 2000 and Wilshire 5000 contain even more. </p>
<p>One of the tricks to keeping the index meaningful is adjusting for stock activity (like splits), and for corporate activity (many companies have been removed from, and added to, the Dow over the years). For example, Apple splits their stock 2:1, so what was a $100 stock is now $50. How does this get reflected in the average? The DowJones people came up with a mathematical technique to adjust for this called the Dow divisor, which is too far beyond ELI5 to explain here. </p>
<p>In addition, some companies fail. For a long time, Woolworth's was a member of the Dow, but in the early 1990's, after many terrible years, it was removed from the DJIA, and replaced by Wal-Mart. Similar fates have befallen such former stars as Western Electric, Bethlehem Steel, US Steel, and International Harvester. Each time a company is added/removed from the list, the Dow is recalculated so that the effect of the change isn't noticeable. This allows us to use the index over the years. </p>
<p>A fall of 500 points today is not the same event as a fall of 500 points in the 1960's, because the index is so much higher. In the 60's, the Dow was trying to top 1,000; today, it's about 25,000. A fall of 500 points in 1968 would have been 50% of the Dow's value, and would have been a catastrophe, but a fall of 500 points today is 2%, and while troubling, is not nearly as bad. </p>
<p>In general, rising markets signal confidence in the economy and business; falling markets signal the opposite. But one day's movement is generally just noise; you need to look at longer trends to see what's happening.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>PSA: The Dow is actually a pretty crappy gauge of the stock market. The only reasons why it still gets referenced are: 1) tradition and 2) Dow Jones owns one of the best financial news sources in the world (Wall Street Journal). Itâ€™s the WSJâ€™s one flaw, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Better stock index: S&amp;P 500, which is market cap weighted (instead of stupidly price weighted like the Dow). And the S&amp;P 500 tracks the largest 500 stocks (instead of only 30 industrial stocks like the Dow).</p>
<p>Even better stock index: Total US Stock index, like VTI for example (Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF). This index includes essentially all US public stocks, so there are 3,600 companies in it instead of only 500 like the S&amp;P 500 or 30 like the Dow.</p>
<p>Even better stock index: Total WORLD Stock index, like VT for example (Vanguard Total World Stock ETF). This index includes essentially all public stocks in the world, so there are 8,300 companies in it instead of only US ones like VTI or only the large US ones like the S&amp;P 500 or only a few large US industrials like the Dow.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like the OP really wants to know what an INDEX is. I'm not a finance expert but maybe someone can build off of this:</p>
<p>As people have said already, the Dow or other market &quot;indexes&quot; are an attempt to measure the health of the economy. They look at the performance of a group of stocks. The price of each company's stocks may go up or may go down independent of how other companies are doing. The index provides a big-picture look across multiple companies.</p>
<p>If I asked you to give me a snap shot of how these companies are doing on a day-to-day basis, you might be tempted to give me the AVERAGE of all the companies' stock prices over each day. Like tracking the average price of milk/gallon over time.</p>
<p>However, stock from company A is not the same as company B. When you buy stock in a company, you're actually buying something called a &quot;share&quot;. Different companies have different number of shares. A share is very much what it sounds like; if I had a pie and I wanted to share it with multiple people, I'd cut it into several slices. But how many slices? Now if I wanted to sell a piece of that pie, how much would I sell it for?</p>
<p>What's worse is that I can change not only the price per piece of pie, I can change the number of pieces (shares).</p>
<p>Let's say there are other people selling pie, but some people have bigger pie, smaller pie, pies with more pieces, less pieces, and the prices per piece are all over the place because maybe apple pie is selling better than peach at this time of the year.  Now I ask you to tell me how the pie market is doing, accounting for all of these differences. It probably seems like taking an average of the price/piece of pie doesn't really cut it.</p>
<p>So instead you, you make a pie &quot;index&quot; which is just a fancy way of saying, you're looking at multiple VARIABLES or PROPERTIES of each pie provider, not just comparing price/pie. You take into account how large the pie is, how many pieces there are and how much people are willing to buy the pieces for. Maybe you can come up with some other useful properties to measure the health of the pie market. Then you take these variables from all of the major pie companies, put them into a fancy formula you've developed where you multiply things or divide things and at the end, you get a number. </p>
<p>Though this number might have something called a &quot;unit&quot;, like &quot;$/lb&quot;, it's probably something very complicated and ugly. So you decide to make your pie index sound cooler, and you name the number that your formula spits out a &quot;point&quot;. It sounds way better to say that the pie market has increased 10 pie points rather than 10 $/cubic-inches-of-pie/piece-of-pie (yuck).</p>
<p>Lastly, let's say you were looking at 10 different pie providers for your index (even though there are many others who produce pie). Suddenly, peach pie--one of your 10 providers--goes out of business. If you took the average of share prices, this would be a HUGE deal. But you were smart and accounted for multiple variables which does something called NORMALIZING. This means, regardless of the price per piece of pie, you can swap pecan pie in for peach pie and your magical &quot;points&quot; aren't affected that much. This makes your pie index way cooler than a boring average!</p>
<p>Fun fact, similar mathematical gymnastics (indexes) are used in science and engineering (but the units are different). </p>
<p>//</p>
<p>TL;DR: Indexes help compare the performance of dissimilar things. In the case of the economy, stocks from Company A are not the same as Company B so if you want to look at the performance of a market as a whole, you need to create an &quot;index&quot; which looks a many important properties of a stock. Because indexes look at many properties, the actual units of the index are complicated and &quot;points&quot; is used because it sounds better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Points are referring to the general dollar value of the stock based on how many people are trading it versus own it.</p>
<p>And the Dow is just an average of all the stocks in its index, so if one company has a bad day, the Dow doesn't move much.</p>
<p>If multiple companies in the Dow index have a bad day, the Dow suffers and its average moves down.</p>
<p>While usually a sign of bad news, sometimes it is an overreaction where people sell to protect their investment but repurchase days later. </p>
<p>So, the Dow could be down 789 points today, but by next week it has gone up 1500 and recovered all that was lost.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing that is kind of funny is that everyone will tell you that the S&amp;P 500 is more relevant--and they are right, and this is something I've known for like 20 years--but I always look at the Dow first.</p>
<p>If you follow baseball, the Dow is kind of like batting average--it's a benchmark that's been around a long time, but other far more useful measuring sticks have been developed since. And I still look at batting average first before looking at WAR or OPS. Old habits die hard.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
