		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its a matter of degree.</p>
<p>Let's say an isolated event happens in an area that favors Genotype 1 over Genotype 2.  Over time that will impact natural selection.  But if the event stops, and the populations interbreed that limited impact gets diffused.</p>
<p>So killing a few percent of the world's population may have had some impact, but it was a short-lived event.  It wasn't as widespread or long-lasting as the Black Death.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a matter of the nature and severity of the pressure. </p>
<p>Selective pressure acts on phenotypes (expressed traits), not genotypes. </p>
<p>If a disease completely wipes out a dominant gene (e.g. 100% death rate if you have brown eyes, less than 100% if you don't) then the brown eyes gene would be gone from the gene pool forever. </p>
<p>If the disease is slightly more lethal for people with a recessive gene (20% death rate with brown eyes, 30% death rate with blue/green) then you might or might not lose enough blue eyes genes to be measurable. A lot of them would survive in heterozygous people, who have one blue eyes gene but their eyes are still brown. </p>
<p>Other scenarios shake out somewhere in between. </p>
<p>If there happens to be a gene that provides specific immunity, let's say it codes for the antibody, then you might see a huge increase in the prevalence of that gene, because only the people who had it would have survived.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had a look in the literature and couldnt find any studies that have specifically address this question, but it would have likely caused a detectable change in gene frequencies in the human population as:</p>
<p>A. Genetics is known to have a fairly substantial role in influenza resistance</p>
<p>B. 2% of the human population was wiped out,  which is a substantial selection pressure</p>
<p>Based on what we know about the genetic of flu resistance, the immunity likely involves many genes, so its a difficult questions to address. For HIV we known several single gene mutations which results in higher resistance, so thats easier to go back and test to look at changes pre and post HIV. To answer the question with spanish flu you would need to do whole genome analyses with a good number (thousands at least) of museum specimens of pre-Spanish flu humans and post-Spanish flu humans, so no small task.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
