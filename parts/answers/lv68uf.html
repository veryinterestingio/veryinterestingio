<p>I'll focus on petroleum (oil &amp; natural gas) as opposed to coal, and while many of the details will be different, the end conclusion is basically the same for coal. To answer your question, we need to think about how petroleum is formed, a decent &quot;simple&quot; view of this is provided by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/026481729598381E" target="_blank">Pepper &amp; Corvi, 1995</a>. In summary, petroleum is produced of the thermal breakdown of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerogen" target="_blank">kerogen</a>, which in turn is from the breakdown of various components of organisms (i.e., lipids, carbohydrates, etc). It takes a very specific environment in the first place for significant quantities of kerogen to form, requiring abundant organic material to be deposited in a location where burial is very fast (and/or in anoxic conditions) to prevent decay of the organic compounds before burial. In such environments, the key parameters are then the composition of the kerogen (not all kerogen will produce petroleum, some kerogen will produce primarily oil, others gas, etc) which is linked to the type of original organic material plus some of the trace components present (e.g., sulfur) and the thermal history the kerogen experiences as it continues to be buried. As discussed at length in Pepper &amp; Corvi, while we often talk about an &quot;oil window&quot;, i.e., a temperature range that kerogen must be heated to for petroleum to be produced, this is overly simplistic. The key points here are (1) that the rate of kerogen breakdown (i.e., petroleum formation) like many chemical reactions are temperature dependent, so it's not that it doesn't happen until the kerogen is in the &quot;oil window&quot;, just that it happens very slowly until it's near the window and (2) the temperature range of the &quot;oil window&quot; (which is really just the range of temperatures over which the bulk of kerogen is broken down) is a function of both kerogen composition and heating rate, where the temperature range of the window is higher when the heating rate is faster.</p>
<p>What this means is that the time it takes for petroleum to form (assuming there is sufficient kerogen available, i.e., the right organic and depositional environment, and we ignore the kerogen type details) is dictated by the heating rate. The heating rate will depend on a lot of things, but the two most important ones would be the geothermal gradient (i.e., the rate of increase in temperature with depth) and the rate of burial and subsidence (i.e. how quickly sediment and kerogen deposited somewhere is covered and its depth increases with continued deposition and isostatic &quot;sinking&quot; of the column of deposited rock).</p>
<p>With all of the above, we can use some of the data in Pepper &amp; Corsi to estimate how long it would take for material deposited somewhere to reach sufficient temperature to produce petroleum. We'll assume that material starts at 5C when it is deposited (our answers would change a bit for different starting temperatures, but not really that much if we consider reasonable ranges of starting temps). For a heating rate of 0.5C/million years (a slow heating rate, that is a decent approximation for what kerogen deposited in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_margin" target="_blank">passive margin</a> setting might experience) the petroleum window is ~95-135C with the upper (i.e., lower temperature) portion mostly producing oil and the lower (i.e., higher temperature) portion mostly producing gas as the oil begins to thermally crack at higher temps (e.g. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/19953" target="_blank">Dahl et al, 1999</a>), though this again depends on the kerogen composition. If we assume that heating rate stays constant (and that the heating is driven by burial and essentially moving through a static thermal field) then the material would enter the window 180 million years after it was deposited and exit the window 260 million years after it was deposited, so it would spend 80 million years in the window producing oil and gas. At the other extreme, at a heating rate of 50C/million years (which could be found in some <a href="https://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~polsen/nbcp/breakupintro.html" target="_blank">rift basins</a> where subsidence and sedimentation rates are very high and geothermal gradient is also high), the oil window is ~180-250C and thus the material would reach the oil window about 3.5 million years after it is deposited, exit the window at 4.9 million years after it is deposited, and spend ~1.4 million years in the window.</p>
<p>So some caveats to the above. Petroleum formation is very complex and there are a lot of things that influence the details of the rates of the reactions occurring and the influence of temperature on those rates (e.g. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/34391" target="_blank">Lewan, 1998</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/35018046" target="_blank">di Primio et al., 2000</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264817203001624" target="_blank">Schenk &amp; Dieckmann, 2004</a>, etc). Importantly, all of the above is considering how long it would take for the petroleum to form and isn't thinking about how long it would take to migrate into usable concentrations (though some of that is happening at the same time as it is forming, etc). Finally, geothermal gradients might not be linear and in general, heating rates as a function of burial can get complicated. While all of these might influence the exact numbers, the order of magnitudes will stay the same, meaning that the short answer to the original question is &quot;a very long time&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>In summary,</strong> organic material of sufficient volumes that is buried quickly enough to not be decomposed significantly provides the raw ingredients for petroleum and only occurs in a relatively narrow set of environments. These conditions are not omnipresent, so there are specific intervals (and specific areas) where the correct conditions have existed in the past. Even if we assumed constant existence of the right conditions <em>somewhere</em>, i.e., there is the right material being deposited, depending on the heating rate it can take anywhere from a few million years to hundreds of million of years to reach sufficient temperatures to produce petroleum. With all of this, the rates of extraction and use of petroleum outpace the rate at which new deposits are produced by multiple orders of magnitude, hence why we typically discuss fossil fuels as a &quot;non-renewable resource&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
