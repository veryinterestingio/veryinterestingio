		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5 Answer: Think of an API like the controls to a car.  You've got a gas pedal to go forward, a brake pedal to stop, a steering wheel to turn, etc.  You've also got information about the car - how fast it's going (speedometer), how fast the engine is turning (tachometer), how much gas is in the tank, etc.</p>
<p>You don't need to know <em>how</em> the gas pedal makes the car go forward or the details of how the fuel tank reads its level.  In fact, the 'under the hood' operation varies wildly from car to car, but since the car's interface is (roughly) the same, you can get in just about any car and drive it.</p>
<p>The set of controls and information is like the car's API.  &quot;Turn this wheel to make the car go to the right.  Look here to see how fast you're going.&quot; is like a website's API saying, &quot;Give me a string of text and the ID of a parent comment, and I'll post a reply to that comment&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>API stands for &quot;Application Programming Interface&quot;. It isn't so much a piece of software that you create, but rather the interface that programmers can use to interact with the software you created. API's take a lot of different forms, but broadly, they tend to fit into one of two categories.</p>
<p>A <strong>Web API</strong> is an interface that works through the internet, in most cases speaking the same language that your web browser uses (HTTP/S). In this case a company will have software running on their servers that provide some service and developers and users send requests to this API over the internet. For example, you could send a request to Twitter's API to get a list of tweets from a particular user.</p>
<p>A <strong>Library API</strong> comes with a code package or library that someone creates. These are re-usable bits of code (usually for some programming language or other). But for developers to be able to integrate that code into their project, they need to know how to use it and that's where the API comes in. For example, say I'm writing a Python program and need to do a bunch of math on large data-sets. That will be a real pain to do myself (especially if I want it to be fast), so instead I could use download the numpy library, and use the functions it exposes as parts of its API to do all the heavy-lifting for me.</p>
<p>EDIT: Replaced the last example with something a little easier to understand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>API = Application Programming Interface, which I feel does not help anyone who doesn't know what those words really mean.</p>
<p>Application = for your apps</p>
<p>Programming = intended for programmers / other software to use</p>
<p>Interface = a specification for how you should talk to this piece of software. what endpoints are available, how you should format data going in, what it looks like on the way out, how you login or authenticate with the API, etc. This &quot;interface&quot; is what you or your application &quot;talk to&quot; to make stuff happen or retrieve information.</p>
<p>These days, an API is often contrasted with an SDK (software development kit) in that you have to install SDKs on your own machine, whereas most modern APIs are just HTTP requests / web pages you load to &quot;talk&quot; to a piece of software or a service. This is not always the case, but it is the modern, trendy usage of the terms.</p>
<p><strong>Since we're on Reddit, why not take a look at Reddit's API?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/#GET_api_info" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/#GET\_api\_info" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/#GET\_api\_info</a></a></p>
<p>And if you're logged in, you can even load this URL to see your current profile data:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/api/v1/me" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/api/v1/me" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/api/v1/me</a></a></p>
<p>I don't know what's safe to share from that response, but you'll notice it's a bunch of { data: { in: { curly: brackets } } }</p>
<p>You might be wondering, why that weird curly brackets data instead of just a plain paragraph that says something like, &quot;You are /u/thefuckouttaherelol2 and you've been using this app for 3 months. You have the following features enabled, etc. etc.&quot;</p>
<p>This is because most modern APIs follow the same protocols, which in programming, are just standards for how different pieces of software or hardware talk to each other. For example, Reddit's API appears to be a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YcW25PHnAA" target="_blank">RESTful API</a> that returns a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#Syntax" target="_blank">JSON</a> response.</p>
<p>Since these are very well-known standards that are supported pretty much everywhere, it becomes really easy to write applications that communicate with Reddit and other APIs that use the same standards.</p>
<p>This basically means I can write a piece of software that makes a <strong>request</strong> to Reddit's API in a well-known format. Reddit returns JSON as the <strong>response</strong>. My software understands both the HTTP/Rest structure requirements as well as the JSON Reddit responds with, and can convert the JSON into actual data in my program. This back and forth translation of internal program data (ex: data in a C++ or Java program) to a general purpose format (ex: JSON) and vice versa is known as <strong>serialization</strong> and <strong>deserialization</strong> - I can turn stuff into JSON and JSON into other stuff pretty easily because this is all standardized. XML is another popular serialization specification you may have heard of.</p>
<p>Again, I have tools for all of this stuff. I never have to write any of it myself unless I'm deep in network programming or something like that. The tools to convert my data to/from JSON, make the HTTP requests to the server, etc. is almost always available in my programming language and platform of choice. Pretty much out of the box.</p>
<p>Reddit, Shopify, Google, Amazon, Fidelity, etc. all publish documentation and usually offer tutorials on how to use their APIs. Most of the time, you need to sign up for an account, login through your program by calling the API with your username + password, save your login token (kind of like a cookie session ID in your web browser, but instead it's for your app?), and then supply that token for all future API requests until it expires and you're &quot;logged out&quot; by the API. Some (comparably far fewer) APIs, however, let you use them freely without requiring an account or any username/password credentials! Wild.</p>
<p>I know this was beyond eli5 but I hope this helps someone. If you have any additional questions, just let me know! :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
