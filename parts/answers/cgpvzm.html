		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two types of FTM bottom surgery that people get, but I think this question is probably more in reference to phalloplasty. In that case, it depends on multiple factors like graft area, blood flow, and whether the person chooses to have implants placed for erection. In general people can make size requests up to the size allowed by those factors (i.e. could choose to be smaller if they wanted to). It's also possible that due to complications some of the new phallus can be lost which may affect size. Generally people are discouraged from choosing sizes significantly larger than 5-6&quot; even if it is possible based on their body type because phalluses created from these procedures don't retract and expand the way a cis penis typically does, so people sometime have difficulty managing a large penis in day to day situations, especially during the healing process when significant support is required.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
