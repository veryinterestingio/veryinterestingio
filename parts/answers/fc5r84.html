		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The brain is <em>very</em> energy-hungry -- it is  responsible for something like 20% of bodily energy consumption despite being around 2% of body mass in a typical adult. Like all organs, the brain needs to be fueled, and actively engaging a cognitive task will increase the brain's energy expenditure from baseline, meaning there is less available elsewhere.</p>
<p>EDIT: for clarification, the 2%/20% figure is for resting metabolism as far as I have read. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6041938/" target="_blank">This</a> review article examines studies of brain energy consumption, cognitive tasks, and blood glucose -- you should read that; it will do a better job of elucidating the basic idea than I can.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>None of the answers really address why it causes physical tiredness. Yes, the brain is an organ. Yes, it requires fuel and especially so during increased mental activity. We all know that. It is not a muscle so it doesn't stretch or contact. The synapses are communicating amongst each other, creating new connections and processing input and feedback. How does that make you tired though? Is it stress? Increased heart rate and blood pressure? What is it?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s the same as when you work out too long and your body gets tired. The brain, like the heart, is an organ, and can only take so much before it needs to rest. When the brain is stressed, although your mentally being worked out, your brain makes you think like you’re physically tired because it’s had enough work. </p>
<p>The brain is a sucker like that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
