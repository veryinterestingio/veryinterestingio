		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called the bells reflex. It's a primitive protection mechanism to protect your cornea during blinking.  Because it's a reflex, it takes a lower consciousness to occur than your tonic eye muscle balance. So when you lose consciousness and your muscle balance goes, the reflex is still present.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s loss of muscle tone. If you slow down footage of someone blinking, their eyes roll back a tiny bit before the lid closes, and you can see the same thing in heroin use, in extreme pleasure and in sleep. </p>
<p>The direction you eyes look is controlled by six muscles and if all of them relax (for whatever reason) the eye rolls back.</p>
<p>The last time I read about this would have been twenty years ago so happy to be corrected.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>This is thought to be an evolutionary reflex so that if you were to get hit in the eye, your first reflex would be to blink and your eyes would naturally roll back and hopefully your cornea would not get hit. It’s suppose to be a defensive mechanism so your vision would be less affected</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
