		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The law of gravitation applies equally to all objects near a planet.  So if the planet has a moon of its own, we can observe the moon's motion and use that to determine its mass.</p>
<p>If the planet <em>doesn't</em> have any moons, then you're right that its mass is a bit of a guess.  But the first time we send a space probe past it, it's like giving it an artificial moon: we can measure the motion of the spacecraft as it flies by, and use that to accurately determine its mass.  </p>
<p>All &quot;gravitational slingshot&quot; maneuvers we've done so far have been on planets that either have a moon or that we've visited before.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
