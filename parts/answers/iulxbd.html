		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So tiredness is caused by a chemical in your brain called adenosine. Coffee has caffiene in it, and caffeine blocks the adenosine receptors in your brain, which prevents your brain from accepting the adenosine. This means that caffiene doesn't actually reverse the effects of the adenosine that has already been accepted, as it may seem.</p>
<p>Caffeine also stimulates parts of the nervous system, which is why it can increase heart rate and blood pressure. I think it just becomes more noticeable when it hasn't blocked the adenosine receptors in time to prevent drowsiness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Caffeine acts as a Tireness Blocker in most people by binding to the Cell Receptors that recive the &quot;You're Tired!&quot; neurochemicals.  It can also act as a Dopamine Substitute (as do many chemicals that end in -ine).  Dopamine is a neurochemical used as the activator for a lot of Executive Function Behaviors- emotional regulation, the wake/sleep cycle, feeling hungry, knowing what time it is, and remembering things.  When people drink coffee but are have been awake for Too Long according to thier bodies, the caffeine is shuffled off to go do other things Dopamine normally does, resulting in flooding some of your higher functions and getting sent to the mental shadow realm.</p>
<p>When people who drink lots of coffee stop, the withdrawal can really feel like a sudden onset of depression, because thier body got used to having caffeine and not making as much dopamine, and one of the first things to be affected is Serotonin Production.  They will feel low, irritiable, and suffer from headaches, nausea and sometimes tremors until they return to normal.  People who have clinical depression often feel that awful all the time, becuase they cannot manufacture enough Serotonin at any time.  </p>
<p>Relatedly, people with ADHD, Bipolar Disorder and Clinical Depression and other mental illnesses caused by insufficient Dopamine often find coffee to act as a mild sedative- Dopamine helps regulate and maintain a lot of your basic maintainence functions, and if you don't have enough, you can't produce the &quot;You're Tired!&quot; Chemicals your brain needs to begin the Sleep Cycle. People with ADHD will often drink a cup of coffee and then be ready to got to bed because the caffeine acts as a dopamine substitute and finally gives them the 'energy' to start the Sleep cycle.</p>
<p>Yes, it takes energy to fall asleep normally.  Not a lot, but it's a mental process that has to boot  up and if you can't boot it up from insufficient neurochemicals, it's impossible to fall asleep normally and you end up in a 4 AM feuge shitposting to reddit before your brain hits the emergency Sleep Brake and you black out at your computer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well Billy, I’m glad you asked!  Here’s the deal:  “sleepiness” is just a bunch of messages in your brain that say “you need to rest” kind of like how Harry Potter was getting all that mail inviting him to Hogwarts to be a wizard.  Coffee works like how the Dursleys did:  it hides and messes with the messages as they arrive.  But just like in Harry Potter, eventually there are too many messages to hide and your brain (Harry) finds out that it needs some sleep (gets to be a wizard!).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually go through this all the time and had to do some research when I thought I was going to have a heart attack.</p>
<p>So, caffeine is just a stimulant.. just.</p>
<p>It speeds up your heart a little, increases your BP a little, etc. But keep in mind it's not a robot.. it doesn't much care what else you are going through. Your body, however, does. </p>
<p>So if you are sleeping well and have your head together, maybe it will shake you up a little and give you a little wakey boost. </p>
<p>However.. if you are not sleeping well and have a nice little sleep debt going, it may not affect you noticeably at all. Or worse, if you are going through some emotional disruption or severe sleep issues, it can actually do the opposite and knock you out. </p>
<p>Worse, if you have large anxiety or hypertension issues, which themselves can cause disruptions left and right , you may, instead, OVERreact to it, making the anxiety shoot through the roof. </p>
<p>Note that having anxiety can also make you notice your heartbeat more, which can make a normal heartbeat speedup seem like you are going to die (your heart is a drama queen and loves attention. Don't believe me? Take your own pulse at your neck for a minute. It will speed up as you notice it.)</p>
<p>So tl;dr, it's not the coffee that's changing how it works, it's your body going through it's own drama and dealing with it differently. If you are constantly having panic attacks when you drink coffee, take a break from it for a few days and try to catch up on some sleep so your heart doesn't overreact.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
