		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're not perfect, but neither is traditional screening for early detection. Use of sniffer dogs is promising enough that we've worked on it since 1989. There are a lot of studies on it (use key words &quot;sniffer dogs cancer&quot; on Google Scholar), but the quality of those studies varies immensely. As /u/ondulation has pointed out, some may use a very limited amount of person-specific samples and the dog may simply learn to recognize the person/sample. Approaches that focus on isolated biomarkers may be more promising, but an issue is that we struggle to find biomarkers that are exclusive to cancer. The markers may appear based on someone's diet, other mundane health issues or even genetics.</p>
<p>Also, while dogs are cheaper than some traditional techniques, they're still expensive. Just like with using rats to detect landmines, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-15355-z" target="_blank">sniffer mice</a> and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lee_Suan_Chua/publication/339230677_Sniffer_bees_as_a_good_alternative_for_the_current_sniffing_technology/links/5e4535b4a6fdccd9659fe4f7/Sniffer-bees-as-a-good-alternative-for-the-current-sniffing-technology.pdf" target="_blank">sniffer bees</a> for cancer are emerging options.</p>

It's not a stretch to think that other conditions in the body cause similar changes that are too subtle to be picked up by us but can be detected by dogs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a documented experiment where a woman was able to detect Parkinson's by smell.</p>
<p>She claimed that she was able to do this and a team of researchers put her to the test.</p>
<p>She was able identify all the afflicted patients, with one false positive. However, the person, whom was falsely identified as having Parkinson's disease, was diagnosed roughly six months later.</p>
<p>I don't doubt a dog can smell all sorts of ailments which we don't even realise have an odor.</p>

There are many articles about this but the source I linked happens to mention the first experiment I spoke of.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
