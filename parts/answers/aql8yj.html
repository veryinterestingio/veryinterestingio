		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I couldn't find any research to back-up the doctor's claims regarding the <em>pathophysiology</em> of myopia progression from near work, but the actual relationship between near work and myopia is a hot debate. A review article [1] from 2012 summarises the results of key studies but the results are very inconclusive.</p>
<p>I found a couple of interesting papers published in well peer reviewed journals that came out after the publication of this review article.
A 23 year follow‐up study published in Acta Ophthalmologica found that at least in females, a short reading distance predicted higher myopia in adulthood. [2]
The other study published in JAMA Ophthalmology, there were no associations between myopia and near work. [3]</p>
<p>There are loads of other studies I can try and find but the gist of it really is that there is no solid evidence that the link actually exists in the first place.</p>

<p>Attractive though the idea was, it did not hold up. In the early 2000s, when researchers started to look at specific behaviours, such as books read per week or hours spent reading or using a computer, none seemed to be a major contributor to myopia risk<a href="https://www.nature.com/news/the-myopia-boom-1.17120#b5" target="_blank">5</a>. But another factor did. In 2007, Donald Mutti and his colleagues at the Ohio State University College of Optometry in Columbus reported the results of a study that tracked more than 500 eight- and nine-year-olds in California who started out with healthy vision<a href="https://www.nature.com/news/the-myopia-boom-1.17120#b6" target="_blank">6</a>. The team examined how the children spent their days, and “sort of as an afterthought at the time, we asked about sports and outdoorsy stuff”, says Mutti.  </p>
<p>It was a good thing they did. After five years, one in five of the children had developed myopia, and the only environmental factor that was strongly associated with risk was time spent outdoors<a href="https://www.nature.com/news/the-myopia-boom-1.17120#b6" target="_blank">6</a>. “We thought it was an odd finding,” recalls Mutti, “but it just kept coming up as we did the analyses.” A year later, Rose and her colleagues arrived at much the same conclusion in Australia<a href="https://www.nature.com/news/the-myopia-boom-1.17120#b7" target="_blank">7</a>. After studying more than 4,000 children at Sydney primary and secondary schools for three years, they found that children who spent less time outside were at greater risk of developing myopia.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It sounds like nonsense, and I can't find any literature that supports that eye strain can damage your eye muscles permanently. </p>
<p>Of course it's much more difficult to prove something CAN'T happen than to claim it CAN happen, but every medical source will tell you that most of what he's saying is myth.</p>
<p>As far as evolution is concerned, humans and monkeys use their eyes for more than just looking into the distance. The use of tools is one of the more significant differences between humans and most other animals, and most tools are used at arms length or closer. 1.76 million years is a long time to assume our eyes haven't evolved.</p>
<p>However, the claim that 'glasses make the eye weaker' is 100% bunk, and probably indicates he's trying to sell something. Glasses cannot make your eye weaker, nor can wearing glasses with the wrong prescription ruin your eyes. That's like saying if you blink too hard your eyelids will fall off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A 2002 paper by Mutti et al in  <em>Investigative Opthalmology and Visual Science</em> concluded that heredity is the most important factor associated with juvenile myopia, close viewing or reading having smaller independent contributions.    In later life or young adulthood, studies such as Kinge et al (2001) have shown a significant relationship between reading scientific literature and myopia progression ( p≤0.001).   Yes, there is correlation but we do not have conclusive evidence for causation.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The eye has muscles just behind the iris (coloured part of the eye) called the ciliary body.  The ciliary msucles are attached to bungee cords (zonular fibres) which are attached to the human lens.  As the ciliary msucle flexes, the zonular files tug on the lens which changes its shape.  This change in shape of the lens is what allows us to focus up close, a process called accommodation.  In hyperopes (opposite of myopes) it also helps them focus in the distance.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>As a person ages, their ability to accommodate or focus at near reduces.  This is separate to myopia.  Instead it is called presbyopia.  The process of presbyopia has not been well elucidated but there are generally two main theories, lenticular or extra-lenticular.  Lenticular theories suggests hardening of the lens  Extra-lenticular theories suggests dysfunction of the ciliary muscle and loss of elasiticy of zonular fibres.  As a person age's their ability to change the shape of their lens therefore reduces, and they begin having trouble with near focus. This processes becomes manifest at around age 40 and continues until age 60, when there is no more accommodation remaining.   Therefore reading prescriptions tend to increase from ages 40 to 60.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>With presbyopia,  adults over age 40 begin to feel that their reading vision is getting worse.  Conversely, one may intepret it as reading making their near vision worse.  In hyperopia which uses the same focusing power as accommodation, these individuals may feel that after reading their distance vision becomes worse.  While presbyopia is natural age related change, anecdotally speaking, information may be conveyed such that parents may intepret this information as near work making their vision worse, therefore near work makes their child's vision worse.  When in fact, presbyopia has nothing to do with children's issues - other accommodative issues affect children but that is a whole other topic.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I am not certain if wearing spectacles will cause prescriptions to worsen.    Even if I was told that spectacles worsen the myopic prescription, I am not going to stop recommended spectacles.  Without spectacles, how can we even expect the individual to see.  Your eyes are naturally changing, prescriptions will change.  Not wearing spectacles or wearing partial prescriptions, seeing the world blurry, just to maybe reduce the rate of change by a small amount doesn't make logical sense.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I feel that the podcaster may be trying to explain effects of presbyopia, in the wrong context (childhood), to make parents empathise with their child's changing vision.  This is not correct, the science is not correct and is preying on parental emotions to sell a treatment which is non-evidence based and will not work.   We can slow down myopia changes, but we cannot reverse or cure myopia.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>search google scholar for &quot;near induced transient myopia.&quot;</p>
<p>There is a transient spasm of the ciliary muscle (which, when flexed, deforms the lens so you can see close up). Clearing this spasm with lots of outdoor time (looking far away in bright light) is thought to prevent this spasm from causing a permanent lengthening of the eyeball.</p>
<p><a href="https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2164051" target="_blank">https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2164051</a></p>

<p>If you have transient myopia and get glasses, you are likely to induce real myopia (search scholar.google.com for lens induced myopia).</p>
<p>TL,DR: it's more complicated than that, but it's a strong contributor. Genetics also play a part</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
