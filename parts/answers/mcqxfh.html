		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sure, it's always possible for a virus to mutate towards a variant that will not be detected by antibodies trained for all variants, but that is still worth getting shot with already existing vaccines. The old variants are not going anywhere if a new one appears, they're still there and as dangerous as before, because a new mutation is not a system update for all viruses out there, there is no viral internet in the air to make all new cases use a new spike protein etc.</p>
<p>The only thing we can do is to limit the infections to such a low number that we have time to get new methods of counteracting new strains while the amount of infected people is low enough to guarantee slow mutation rate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There have been reports that some mutations in the Spike protein allow the virus to remain infectious and make the vaccines less effective. </p>
<p>But it's not all or nothing. Less effective than 95% can still be very good.</p>
<p>It would be hard for the virus to mutate enough to completely and reliably evade our immunity from the vaccine or from prior covid infection. </p>
<p>We are also already in vaccine clinical trials for some of the variants. </p>
<p>All things considered, humanity is raining on COVID's parade. We are winning this race and we will win this race.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is possible for mutations (or a combination of mutations rather) to the spike to be enough to abrogate vaccine efficacy and remain infectious/pathogenic.
However, very unlikely due to the polyclonal nature of the vaccine response. and a benefit of the mRNA vaccine platform is that it is easy enough to continually test against new variants and alter the expressed sequences. </p>
<p>This paper <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.15.426911v1.full.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.15.426911v1.full.pdf</a>
Talks about the vaccine-elicited antibodies and compares it to antibodies produced by natural infection as well as looking at efficacy against various mutations/combinations seen in the circulating variants. </p>
<p>“  Human neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD can be categorized as
belonging to 4 different classes based on their target regions on the RBD20. Class 1 and 2
antibodies are among the most potent and also the most abundant antibodies6,7,30,31,34. These
antibodies target epitopes that overlap or are closely associated with RBD residues K417, E484
and N501. They are frequently sensitive to mutation in these residues and select for K417N,
E484K and N501Y mutations in both yeast and VSV expressing SARS-CoV-2 S proteins10,13,24.
To avert selection and escape, antibody therapies should be composed of combinations of
antibodies that target non-overlapping epitopes”</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s not only possible, it’s definitely happening. See <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00722-8?fbclid=IwAR2iGIAtmBmzABh4FEbQgBHhU6aXxVdE5Q1N5Oc4JO3-QF4BUo1Cjozzf44" target="_blank">this article</a> in Nature. </p>
<p>It’s not all bad news, of course. Some antibody responses are “broader” and can protect against more variants of the virus. It’s not totally clear what induces a broad vs. narrow response. As we discover more resistant variants we have chances to improve our vaccines. </p>
<p>Your last question is a good one. Short answer is no, AFAIK. The term of art to describe what you are taking about is an “epitope” — the region of a protein targeted by an antibody.  You are right that an antibody targeting a highly conserved epitope might be less likely to see resistance evolving. As far as I know it’s not clear exactly which epitopes on S get targeted by the immune response to each vaccine. We would have to go in and characterize the antibody response after vaccination. </p>
<p>My guess is that the vaccine responses are probably targeting epitopes that are at least somewhat variable. So virus mutations could evade immunity while maintaining function. This is also true for other “slippery” viruses like influenza and (extreme case) HIV.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As mentioned before, the mRNA sequence that was synthesized to illicit an effective immune response is from quite a conserved region in the viral genome. So although mutations in the spike protein could make the vaccine less effective, it wouldn’t hinder it completely useless, as of now.</p>
<p>However, it all depends on how many variants arise from these mutations. It’s quite possible a decade from now we would see a completely different variant with a completely different sequence that encodes for the spike protein. Which yes, would escape the current day vaccines. But then, voila, we now have a year vaccine against COVID just like influenza. </p>
<p>On the other hand, I’ve read reports that we are starting to see very similar variants arise in different regions of the world simultaneously. This hints at the possibility that COVID may be reaching its “mutation cap”. There are only so many different combinations. But again, it all depends on whether there are a limited amount of spike protein variants or an endless amount. Time will tell</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
