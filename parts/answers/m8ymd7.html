As the other person said, yeah the dig usually ends when the funding blows out. But that said, ethics dictates you always leave at least some portion of a site undug. The reasoning is that some day in the future, someone might come along with far better methods and technology than what you have available, so you want to leave them something untouched to study. If people hadn’t at least sometimes followed this rule in the early 20th century, we would have lost a lot of stuff that can now be dated by radiocarbon and other means. It’s also why I’m reluctant to wash excavated artifacts any more than is absolutely necessary, and I always keep a portion totally unwashed. Who knows what kinds of residues or other data someone might be able to pull from that 50 years from now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally they stop digging when the funding runs out. Although they can also take some reasonable guesses as to whether an area is likely to be worth the time. If they're digging in an established area and they see signs that they've reached the edge of the habitation, either in area of in time, there probably isn't much point in continuing to dig. There <em>might</em> be--there could be an adjacent settlement or one that existed earlier in time--but the chances are lower. It ends up being a bit of a judgment call.</p>
<p>When establishing a new dig area, they typically conduct a number of different surveys to try to predict where they'll most likely find something. Satellite photos have become very popular for this but other methods exist, including picking an area and digging some random test holes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
