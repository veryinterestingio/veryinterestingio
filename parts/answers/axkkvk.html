		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Without commenting on the effect of ions on your body (because I'm a physicist), magnets do not affect ions in an appreciable way. Placing magnets around you has no effect on whether you're surrounded by ions or not.</p>
<p>While I'm not a biologist, I can say with certainty that any magnetic product that promises more positive/negative ions around you is a complete scam.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A static magnetic field won't cause standing water to take on a net charge. Faraday's law describes how a moving magnetic field can induce an electric current in a conductor if you want to get into the math behind the physics.</p>
<p>Pure molecular water is a very poor condcutor - in fact  be used as an insulator. Water only acts as a conductor when electrolytes are dissolved in it (salts, trace metals, etc). Tap water is not pure and has lots of stuff dissolved in it, and I'd assume that's what you're using.</p>
<p>Charge is difficult to measure directly, but you could measure voltage or current pretty easily. You could get a voltmeter and place one electrode in a water bath and the other electrode in a second water bath and then move the magnet over the water to see if you can induce a voltage drop or transient current from one bucket of water to the other. However, it may be a very small voltage/current that is generated and not detectable by a hobbyist voltmeter. I would expect that adding table salt to water to increase the measured voltage. Could be a fun experiment for you to try.</p>
<p>Basic cellular physiology is governed by electrochemical gradients across insulating plasma membranes. As electricity and magnetism are 2 sides of the same coin, there are magnetic fields generated when ions travel across membranes. However these currents and magnetic fields are super small (incredibly challenging to measure - on the order picoamps). The body's electromagnetic field is generally negligible for most applications.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Magnetic fields will not cause a charge unless the water is flowing (in that case you'll get a hall effect), and the charge imbalances that can feasibility be achieved are tiny, as in a difference of 0.000001% or less in ion concentrations using a supersonic jet and a beefy neodymium magnet. </p>
<p>You're much better off using a corona discharge or a Tesla coil if you want to put charge into water and even then I doubt the water will retain the charge long enough to do anything useful with it, because charged sollutions tend to exchange charge with the surrounding area through gaseous ions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It looks like your question has been answered already, but it's worth adding some fundamentals for clarity.</p>
<p>Electromagnetism describes both electric and magnetic fields, but they are distinct forces that only interact when in motion relative to one another. A stationary magnet will not interact with (or induce) an electrical charge at all. Hence, a magnet won't interact with an ion simply because it has an electrical charge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A (static) magnetic field will increase the energy level separation of spin states of magnetically active nuclei (eg 1H, 13C), the stronger the field the greater the separation.
MRI machines have strong magnets for this reason.
But even with a strong field, as in an MRI machine, the energy level separation is equivalent to radiofrequency radiation.</p>
<p>Radiofrequency radiation is too low energy to cause to cause ionisation. Typically uv radiation is needed to ionise biomolecules, and even then we see that in sunlight every day.</p>
<p>Energy: uv &gt; visible &gt; infrared &gt; microwave &gt; radio</p>
<p>Admittedly I don't know much about radiofrequency radiation. Perhaps blasting yourself with a radiofrequency laser would do some damage</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
