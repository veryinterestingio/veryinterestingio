<p>In short (and without rehashing all of these answers or parsing out the spurious ones), there are a variety of mechanisms / properties that impose limits on the height of mountain ranges on average and the height of individual peaks within those ranges. These limits are not precise (despite what some comments in the various links above suggest) and depend a lot on the details, many of which are hard to estimate for extant mountain ranges let alone past mountain ranges. With that uncertainty in mind, we generally think that the Himalaya represent something near the limit of the absolute height mountain ranges can reach. In terms of quantitatively estimating the height of past mountain ranges, there are techniques that allow us to make rough estimates (e.g. <a href="https://geosci.uchicago.edu/~rowley/Rowley/Paleoaltimetry-Intro.html" target="_blank">paleoaltimetry</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermobarometry" target="_blank">geothermobarometry</a>, etc), but in general these would only tell us about the average elevation of a range (and with pretty large uncertainties again), not the height of individual peaks. Thus, <strong>the question isn't really answerable</strong>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I read  somewhere that the very,  very old Appalachian mountains In the eastern US COULD have been higher at some ancient time,  but it's nearly impossible to tell for sure.</p>
<p>They are a very old and massive range that has been eroded for as long as they have been around.   They haven't seen any new uplift in just about as long.  </p>
<p>But that is all a guess until we get a hold of Bill and Ted's time Machine... or if someone fixes up their old DeLorean</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

I saw a documentary that showed the exact inverse to your query. Apparently the Mediterranean Sea used to be a valley before the ocean broke way at the Strait of Gibraltar. That used to be the lowest spot on Earth, and also the hottest. The documentary was called Earth 4D I believe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You should check out plateaus too. The Tibetan Plateau is the biggest. Plateaus also move up and down like mountains, but with other factors involved. Bouyancy is involved and the plates can move up and down or side to side. It's pretty cool. The Grand Canyon is an elevated Plateau too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
