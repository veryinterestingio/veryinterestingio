		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://youtu.be/tJcTy-SIIP4" target="_blank">Here's</a> a slow motion video of a similar rocket. You can use the YouTube controls to slow it down even more. The jet is basically smooth until the rocket runs out of water, then there's a rough/wavy burst. My guess is that once the water runs out, the pressurized air jets out of the rocket faster than the water did, so it hits the water and makes a pattern. That doesn't fully explain the pattern in your photo, but maybe some of the other users can clarify.</p>
<p>Edit: The oscillations look like <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh%E2%80%93Taylor_instability" target="_blank">Rayleigh--Taylor instability</a>, specifically the Kelvin–Helmholtz instabilities in the &quot;Late-time behavior&quot; section. Either air or air-infused water is accelerating into denser water, which can create this pattern.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

You have elastic energy being released in a step function with a fluid inertia throttling it's release rate. It oscillates like a basic spring mass system or a bell being struck by a hammer</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The water hammer explanation sounds like a possibility, but here are a couple things to figure out:</p>
<p>1) try and calculate the frequency of the pulses.  If it’s a wave traveling up and down the water column, it should relate to the frequency ( Pressure wave travels at the speed of sound thru water).</p>
<p>2) Calculate the mass flow of the water, and try to calculate the thrust. If you have a way to rig a thrust stand, measure how much thrust it’s generating and maybe you can even see a change during the pulse.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
