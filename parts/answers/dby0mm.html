		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both entities both care about speed and data limit. However, the general assumption is that you wouldn't be downloading that much data on mobile vs home. So, the speed is what is advertised for home. You're going to be downloading but look at how fast you can.</p>
<p>The fine print still has limits.</p>
<p>I pay for 1gb down. My data limit is still 6tb though.</p>
<p>I couldn't hit that even if I had Netflix.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ul>
<li>If a home customer wants super fast internet, the ISP can install whatever equipment it needs between the customer's house and the ISP's central office to make that happen.</li>
<li>Once it's in place, it stays there, and the customer pays the ISP enough extra money to cover the upgraded equipment and to earn a profit.</li>
<li>A cell phone customer will be moving around and constantly changing which cell site they connect to.</li>
<li>The cell company cannot possible guarantee that customer a certain speed at every single cell site they own across the country. </li>
<li>Charging based on data usage on the other hand is easy to do.</li>
<li>Also some ISP are moving to that model as well. Home users in many parts of the US face a 1 TB cap each month. If they go over that cap they get charged more.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two main reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is much easier to guarantee internet speeds when you are physically connected to the providers network. There are no physical barriers and other sources of interference obstructing the providers signals from reaching your devices.</li>
<li>Mobile broadband providers have to deal with huge barriers that affect their signals, as well as an increasingly large number of people connected to their cellular towers. This means that there is a lot of wireless traffic to deal with and that can lower performance. So it's much easier to guarantee that you will have X amount of data served to you at varying speeds. This data limit is also an incentive to use less of their resources so that everyone has a relatively fast connection.</li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>PS: A lesser reason, but still worth mentioning is that not every cellular tower will have the same speed of wired connection to the providers network. So even at equal distances from two totally different towers with no obstructions, you may get a much faster connection on one than the other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The airwaves are a finite resource.  There is only so much bandwidth you can put over a radio channel.  Wired on the other hand is more plentiful.  If you need more bandwidth you add another wire/fiber.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Broadband providers run a wire to your door so they can control the actual speed and make some level of commitment to that.  Many (most?) still sell a quantity of Internet, but it's usually very high and difficult to max out through normal use (browsing, email, movies etc...)</p>
<p>Mobile providers can't reasonably set a speed because it's very dependent upon where you are physically, relative to the tower, and it can change if you walk 10 feet to the right.  They brag about higher speeds overall, but really don't sell specific rates because people would complain when it does run slower.   Since wireless bandwidth is a shared medium, <em>more than wired</em>, they also have lower data limits than wired so that's the figure they &quot;sell&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
