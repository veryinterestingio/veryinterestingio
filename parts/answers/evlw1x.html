		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Automatic cars have what's called a &quot;torque converter.&quot;. It's basically a fluid coupling between the engine and the transmission. When the engine is at low RPM, the fluid isn't spinning all that fast so it's easy to overcome the torque with the brakes, but it's still applying a force (but with barely any friction because of three fluid, as opposed to a clutch). When you speed up the engine the coupling applies a greater force on the transmission and you go faster. </p>
<p>This is not only simplified for ELI5 bit also because that's the extent of my knowledge so hopefully I didn't mess it up too bad. Like most things in automatics, torque converters are 80% magic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An automatic transmission connects the running engine to the wheels with  what is essentially a liquid clutch. This liquid clutch is called the &quot;torque converter&quot;.
The torque converter is designed in such a way as to apply very little torque to the wheels ( it allows a large RPM difference) when engine RPM is very low, like when at idle. As the RPM increases the converter no longer allows a large RPM difference and the wheels get full torque from the engine.</p>
<p>In short. The engine is never really disconnected from the wheels. The transmission allows enough slippage so that you can hold the car stationary with brakes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The engine is still kind of tugging on the wheels. You're just holding the wheels back from turning. Once you turn off the break then the engine moves you forward unless there's too much resistance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
