		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You probably know that skin tanning is a defensive mechanism against UV radiation. This type of radiation has a lot of energy - enough to kick electrons out of atoms, therefore high-energy radiation is also called ionizing.</p>
<p>This can wreak havoc within the cell, creating free radicals and damaging cellular machinery and DNA. This could lead to mutations and, eventually, cancer.</p>
<p>So specialised cells (melanocytes) start producing melanin which is reasily absorbed by surrounding skin cells. Melanin is a shield that helps prevent UV radiation from doing damage. This protection is effective, but far from impenetrable.</p>
<p>A study examined the effects of exposure to UV light at different time points. Here is what they found, in short:</p>
<p>Firstly, they noticed immediate darkening within minutes of exposure which only lasts a few hours. This is thought to be caused by the UV light oxidising already existing melanin, not new melanin being produced.</p>
<p>Secondly, over the span of a few hours, melanin production becomes noticable. This remains for a few days.</p>
<p>Then there is pigmentation which takes a few days to develop, but stays for several weeks.</p>
<p>Finally, this can lead to long-term switching on of melanin production, leading to darkening which lasts upwards of 9 months.</p>
<p>Interestingly, some people retained pigmentation for very long periods of time - even without further UV exposure of any significance. It's not yet clear why only some people experience this, but it is definitely possible.</p>
