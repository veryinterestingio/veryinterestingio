		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, here's what's fun. Whenever we experience something emotionally significant, it gets &quot;bathed&quot; in hormones that strengthen our memory of that event. </p>
<p>This is fantastic for fun memories of playing in the mud, baking cookies with Grandma, first kisses, weddings, babies. etc. But our brains don't differentiate. </p>
<p>If something really insignificant happens- but we have a strong emotional response to it- our brains still act accordingly. The hormonal &quot;bath&quot; strengthens the memory, making it easier to recall. This is part of the reason why we're so good at remembering embarrassing events, awesome moments, harsh break-ups, etc. They're all emotional, and they've all been reinforced by our brains' recall mechanisms. </p>
<p>It's not always terribly helpful for modern times, but you can imagine how effective it would be for our ancestors. &quot;OH SHIT, I'm being chased by a tiger again! What did I do last time this happened?!?&quot; -This is what our brains are trying to accomplish, but the end result is you recalling that time you farted in 3rd grade, next to a cute girl. As you're trying to fall asleep before a final exam. Brains are great.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Remember this: </p>
<p>Not a single person ever thinks about your cringy moment except for you. Usually. </p>
<p>If I ever feel a tinge of cringe, I tell myself what is written above and I feel at ease.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to Vsauce, embarrassment (felt for yourself and empathetically for others) activates the same part of the brain that processes physical pain, so we exhibit a similar reaction.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You shrink from any kind of danger. Whether it's a fearful dangerous situation or a humiliating moment. </p>
<p>When you remember or observe either of them, you shrink sympathetically. Whether it's an electronic screen showing you someone getting hit in the nuts or break their bones, or your inner brain TV broadcasting a re-run of a terrible, uncomfortable situation that caused you mental pain. Or even thinking of unpleasant things in general, like extremely sour things, needles under fingernails, or caltrops.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
