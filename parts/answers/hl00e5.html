		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So basically we only have a small idea on how exactly proper homing pigeons can return home, but it likely involves a biological compass and a good ability to recognize landmarks.</p>
<p>But they aren't typically trained, they just return to their nests. As such the messages are very one way. So if you have a place that needs to receive a message you would raise the birds there, and then you would carry some with you if you were out in the field for like a war. Messages could then be sent back to a central location quickly. Messages to mobile positions however could have to go the slow way. They can find their way back very reliably over several hundred miles, and cases of up to 1000 miles have been recorded. These long distance runs are more of a modern pigeon racing thing though because of the need to cart them around on foot. They were used pretty often even as recent as WWI and WWII</p>
<p>The pigeons were actually bred for this quite some time ago. Not sure on exact dates but there are reports of homing pigeons being used something like 3000 years ago. </p>
<p>Also for situations where communication between cities before the telephone was invented homing pigeons were pretty extensively used. Still usually just one way, with land carriers carting them around after they returned home. </p>
<p>Not that they can't be trained to do two way trips. About 100 years ago some mail systems figured out how to get the pigeons do fly two ways by moving their food source to a separate city. The birds would then fly to their food, then back to their nest.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have mentioned, the birds are not trained.   This is something that birds can innately do and we take advantage of it.   </p>
<p>They are quite accurate - homing pigeons will simply return home when you release them, hence their name.   </p>
<p>It is thought that they use a combination of the sun and low-frequency infrasound to navigate.  When they are first released, the pigeon will fly in a circle as if to orient itself before choosing a direction and setting off.   That direction is almost always straight towards its home.  It can do this any time of day or night, but modern technology seems to be able to interfere somewhat with the pigeon’s ability to navigate if it emits the right frequency of noise.</p>
<p>Pigeons were still being used by the government in WWI, and you will find hobbyists that use them to this day.   One famous carrier pigeon in WWI was called Cher Ami (“Dear Friend”), and she managed to carry her message home despite being shot three times on the journey.    She survived but was retired after that mission.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, you can't. They fly just back home, mostly where they hatched. Pigeons orientates at the Earth's magnetic field, the sun and the stars. When they come close to their former home they using their inner map, which was build up during their first flights around their loft. Therefore they can carry an 8 TB SSD the data transfer is faster than via the internet, but the lag is awful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can I just add that most pigeon fanciers also give the pigeon incentives to get home especially in racing so this could have been used by messenger pigeons. There are loads of methods for hens that have young ones to come home to for example. Cocks can also be sex starved for a week before a race by briefly allowing them to see their mate and then basketed to send to a race, this gives them the incentive to get back.
Most pigeons use the Earths magnetic pull and land features like hills and rivers to navigate and determine altitudes needed to complete a distance, it is called Magnatoreception</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
