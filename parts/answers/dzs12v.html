		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think you are too young to have a perspective on this timeframe -- that Bulgaria &amp; Romania very slowly emerged from the post-communist transition, with very little real political and economic development in the 1990s, while Serbia was an entirely different story, only emerging from dictatorship and war with the 2001 'bulldozer revolution.' (Disclosure: I was there as a consultant to the gov't.)</p>
<p>Beginning around 2001-2002 there was a lot of infrastructure investment from the EU, World Bank, and related institutions such as EBRD and Romania in particular began to get some traction in the private sector. I was very struck with how little changed between visits to Bulgaria in 1995 and 2002. But I believe it's mostly a matter of these public sector transfers from the EU that boosted the Balkans in the run-up to EU accession in 2007 -- partly driven by strategic concerns about security in the Balkans.</p>
<p>Bulgaria, Serbia, and Romania had very primitive economies in 2002. They didn't just start to grow on their own. All three stumbled through the process of privatization of large state-owned firms, and it didn't go well. All three were viewed at the time as having a lot of potential because of the well-educated labor force, but things never really took off like we hoped - largely because of the endemic corruption, and out-migration of some of the brightest minds abroad.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>After 2002 it become clear that Ro and Bg are on track to join the EU. Lots of EU businesses started to take the dip in these countries. On the other hand Russian investment accelerated in Bg (to lock in certain advantages before the join), while American interest in Poland and Ro increased significantly. That encouraged lots of investors. Outsourcing industry in these countries increased significantly, as the workforce was super cheap.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There were different reasons for different countries, and no single answer: </p>
<ul>
<li>FDI into Romania and Bulgaria massively increased in the latter part of this period as their joining the EU became inevitable;</li>
<li>Serbia really only started to open up once Milosevic was defeated - Serbia was at war in the late 90s into 2000, and coming out of this had big benefits;</li>
<li>The US saw essentially a 'bubble' as credit was fast and loose, and massive increase in construction as a result;</li>
<li>The introduction of the euro had significant benefits to Germany, moreso than any other country, as their large industrial base benefited from a currency valuation that was &quot;lower&quot; due to some of the weaker economies in the block; and</li>
<li>A massive expansion in PRC and corresponding increase in certain resource prices.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm sure there are more that others can think of, but this is just a small sample.  So it was a combination of things in many places.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's also the externality of the American housing market. The leading factor in one's net worth is the value of their house, and all these financial Wall Street companies pushing mortgage backed securities created this illusion that there was more money than what was actually there. All these companies stored billions of dollars in offshore bank accounts - many in Europe, which had a direct effect on the population there because of the EU. When the American housing market collapse, it set off a chain reaction collapsing the world economy in 2008.</p>
<p>If you haven't seen the movie <em>The Big Short</em> I highly recommend it. It's both very educational and entertaining.</p>
