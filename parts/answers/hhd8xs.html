<p>That “urge” that you’re referring to, which I assume you may experience when first waking up. It’s called “pandiculation” which is yawning and stretching at the same time. Your muscles stretch and contract during pandiculation, it feels boom. It’s an involuntary response which somewhat resets your central nervous system from sleeping/resting to being awake (off to on) and can be observed in other animal species. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the sense of sport, your muscles tighten as they sense that they are in danger of being injured. Small micro tears form in muscles when we exercise, and the tightness is a symptom of those micro tears. I think this is what you’d call that sensation of wanting to stretch.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Massage therapist here, vast majority of people (like 95% of you) put your muscles in shortened positions (through bad posture for example) to the point where the muscle actually shortens, which leads to further development of conditions like upper/lower cross syndrome, weakness in muscle, pulling on other areas/joints around the muscle belly, etc. </p>
<p>Basically if everybody stretched, I would be out of a job.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something to do with the low level of oxygen in the bloodstream I think. Since breathing is facilitated by muscle-driven diaphragm, by stretching a domino effect urges the diaphragm to move, therefore a breath helping the oxygen level reaches optimal level.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
