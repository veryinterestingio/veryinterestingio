<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I do plumbing service in industrial and commercial buildings. Let me tell you that there is no way to make sure that a blockage on the bottom floor doesn't make the building flood.</p>
<p>If, however unlikely, the bottom of a skyscraper drain stack got clogged you're looking at a shit tsunami through the lobby, with a pretty spectacular geyser coming out of a floor drain or mop sink. This does happen in condo or residential towers somewhat infrequently (mostly on bathroom sink stacks) if a stack get's clogged somewhere then whoever the lowest person above the clog will have everything draining into that stack from the units above them coming out of their plumbing fixture.</p>
<p>Instead the solution is to make sure the stack never clogs. This is done through preventative maintenance, and inspections of the pipes. Though even without maintenance it would take A LOT to clog one of those up.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I've only worked in buildings up to 55 floors, so engineers might design something different in taller ones, but typically it's just a straight drop from the roof to the lobby or basement for the drains.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There are mandated offsets in the main stack pipes that slow down the flow from the upper floors. If not for these offsets the velocity of the waste would blow out the bottom fittings every time. Same for the roof drains.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>How do they make sure it doesn't clog ? By hiring people like me and making sure it'll flood the parking before flooding the building.</p>
<p>Note to you all, please stop throwing your tampons, news paper, lingerie, entire roll of paper and whatnot down the drain, thank you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
