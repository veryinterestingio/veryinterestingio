		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Any answer saying the tongue is more sensitive is wrong. It's definitely not about sensitivity. The fingers are super sensitive and can pick up differences, textures, stretch, general form factor a fraction of a millimeter and even less. The tongue cannot. </p>
<p>It boils down to &quot;maps.&quot; Your brain has a map of everything around you which it references as you move or interact with the thing. Some things are better represented visually (e.g. the map of a room is more eyesight based whereas for an instrument the map might be more touch and sound based). </p>
<p>Your tongue has a better touch-based representation map of your mouth than your fingers do. The brain knows, based on the very same sensation of food, what muscles to contract to reach that food using a tongue, but not so much how to do so with fingers.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> The tongue might be slightly better at certain forms of touch but altogether the fingers are way, way, way, way, way better tuned for all sorts of touch.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are waaaay more nerves on the tongue. Even though the tongue feels big in your mouth, it's tip is much smaller than your finger. The tongue is far more sensitive and much more flexible. Because of those differences, not only can it can squeeze more deeply into the cracks between your teeth, it can interpret that sensation more accurately. </p>
<p>In other words, the tongue is better at finding food between the teeth because that's exactly what it was made to do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd guess it's because your tongue lives in your mouth, and your fingers live on your hand.</p>
<p>So naturally, being a resident of your mouth, the tongue is &quot;at home&quot; in your mouth and has somewhat of a home field advantage. That to me would be the reason why your tongue is more or less a seal team 6 when you deploy it in your mouth to find bits and pieces of food that are mia/kia in the whole war your mouth has declared on food it comes into contact with.</p>
<p>Albeit a weird analogy, it fits for this particular combat engagement and of course, has somewhat of a home field advantage. And that being said, no soldier gets left behind.. so the tongue is sent on the recovery mission to find any stragglers left on the battlefield and almost always completes the mission. Sometimes you gotta call in a support team from the 101st toothpick battalion.. and if they have a hard time then they call in their heavy support team of the 32nd which are currently using the mint &quot;flossers&quot; direct attack munition that is <del>laser</del> hand guided directly onto the few remaining insurgents dug in deep in the molar region of the battlefield.</p>
<p>But, the seal strike team, along with their advanced weaponry provided by those strike teams seem to always get the job done.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Point of reference. The only thing a certain part of your tongue usually touches is a certain part of your teeth. Whereas your hands need to touch anything and everything. If your hand spent all of it’s time since birth inside of a baseball mitt, what the inside of that glove feels like would basically be burned into your brain. If a pea fell into the glove it’s be the only feeling different to your glove your hand ever felt, you’d be super aware or where that pea was. It’s why your mouth feels so bizarre after getting a tooth removed or after getting a gap you’ve had for a long time bridged.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
