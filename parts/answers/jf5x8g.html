<p>They can also vary in altitude based on the type - proton based auroras are lower, for example. And interestingly, what you observe can totally depend on your own position and altitude!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They’re huge.</p>
<p>The exact altitudes and sizes depend on the particles creating them (different colors are made from different particles colliding) but they generally start at around 50 miles (80km) above the surface and stretch as high as 400 miles (640km)</p>
<p>From what I can tell, the most common variations of the lights happen between 80-120km (50 - 75 miles) so they’re on average 25 miles tall</p>
