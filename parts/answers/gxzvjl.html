<p>When in a solution of high amounts of salt, the water in the bacteria leaves the cell wall to create equal saltiness between the bacteria and the surrounding environment. This kills the bacteria as there is no water left inside of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rusty microbiologist here. Not getting into details with 5yr olds, but bacteria exchange nutrients with its surroundings through its cell wall. Too much salt damages the cell wall and enters the cell thereby sort of messing up the &quot;liquid&quot; inside the cells and we all know too much of a good thing isn't good at all. So bacteria go boom boom!</p>
<p>Those talking about leaving wounds open, some wounds are infected by anaerobic bacteria, ie, ones that DONT like air (oxygen in air). So oxygen being poisonous to them, leaving the wound open exposes them and hence help kill em faster.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Salt preserves food by preventing bacteria from growing. </p>
<p>There are two main ways salt is used to preserve foods: granule form or in brine, which is a salt-and-water solution. Granule form, or dry curing, is one of the most ancient ways of curing meats.</p>
<p>In both methods, salt prevents bacteria from growing, including foodborne pathogens such as salmonella, which can cause food poisoning, typhoid fever and other serious problems. It does this through salt's interaction with water.</p>
<p>Salt is a disrupter that causes chaos for microbes, confusing their enzymes and breaking their DNA. It mainly accomplishes this via dehydration, removing the water molecules that bacteria need to live and grow. </p>
<p>Salt dehydrates food through osmosis. The salt the salt around the outside of the food draws water molecules out and replaces them with salt molecules until the amount of salt is equal inside and out. </p>
<p>This prevents bacteria from growing, makes the food last longer. </p>
