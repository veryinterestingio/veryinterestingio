		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main point is time and space aren't separate things - they are one thing together - spacetime - and spacetime simply did not exist before the universe existed.  Not sure what the &quot;in the first milliseconds&quot; bit means, and that's a new one by me.  You may, however, be thinking of Einstein's use of the phrase &quot;For us believing physicists, the distinction between past, present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.&quot; What he means is that all of spacetime - from the moment of initial existence to however things &quot;end&quot; - exists fully and completely all at once. Things don't &quot;come into being&quot; in the future or recede into the past - that's just an illusion. All of it exists right now, has since the beginning of spacetime, and never goes away. We just &quot;travel&quot; through it, and it is only our experience that makes it seem as if there's a difference between past and future, and hence an experience of &quot;time.&quot;</p>
<p>Think of the entirety of spacetime as being a giant loaf of bread - at one crust slice is the start of spacetime, and the other crust slice is the end of spacetime. But the entire loaf exists all at once and came out of the oven fully baked - it's not changing at all. Imagine a tiny ant starting at the beginning crust and eating its way through in a straight line from one end to the other. It can't back up and it can't change its pace. It can only move steadily forward and with each bite it can only get sensory input from the part of the loaf its sensory organs are touching. To the ant, it seems that each moment is unique, and while it may remember the moments from behind it, it hasn't yet experienced the moments to come. It seems there's a difference in the past and future, but the loaf is already there on both ends. Now what makes it weirder is that the ant itself is baked into the loaf from start to finish so in a sense it's merely &quot;occupying&quot; a new version of itself from one moment to the next. This also isn't quite right, since it's more accurate to say that the ant is a collection of all the separate moments the ant experiences. It's not an individual creature making it's way from one end to the other - it's the entire &quot;history&quot; of the creature from start to finish.</p>
<p>Doesn't make a lot of intuitive sense to us mere humans, and the concepts have serious repercussions for the concept of free will, but that's a different discussion.</p>
<p>EDIT - holy hell, this got some attention.  Please understand that all I did was my best to (poorly) explain Einstein's view of time, and by extension determinism.  I have nothing more to offer by way of explanation or debate except to note a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the &quot;loaf&quot; analogy is accurate, we are all baked into the loaf as well.  The particular memories and experiences we have at any particular point are set from one end of the loaf to the other.  It just seems like we're forming memories and having experiences &quot;now&quot; - but it's all just in the loaf already.</li>
<li>Everything else in the universe is baked into the loaf in the same way - there's no &quot;hyper-advanced&quot; or &quot;hyper-intelligent&quot; way to break free of that (and in fact, the breaking free would itself be baked in).</li>
<li>I cannot address how this squares with quantum mechanics, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle or anything else for that matter.  It's way above my pay grade.  I think I'm correct in saying that Einstein would say that it's because QM, etc. are incomplete, but (and I can't stress this enough) I'm no Einstein.</li>
<li>Watch <a href="https://www.pbs.org/video/nova-the-fabric-of-the-cosmos-the-illusion-of-time/" target="_blank">this</a>.  You won't regret it, but it may lead you down a rabbit hole.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The human isn't really equipped to be able to understand this. Physics can describe the universe down to .000000000001 (1e-12) seconds after the big bang, which is pretty good. But if you start asking about t=0 or t&lt;0, it is a nonsensical question. The math simply does not work. From the physicists standpoint asking what happened during t=0 or t&lt;0 is no different that asking a civil engineer what is the estimated carrying capacity of a non-existent bridge or asking an aerospace engineer how many people a non-existent airplane can hold.</p>
<p>There was no space at t=0. There was no time at t=0. Time was created at the same moment as space was created. And that makes sense, since time and space are treated as one object in physics, space-time. Describing any natural system requires 3 spatial variables and 1 time variable (i.e. [x,y,z,t]). Many people have this idea that time is some fixed property, but that simply isn't the case. Time is affected by movement and energy just like space is. If you get on a plane your time is moving slower than people sitting on the ground. If you get on a plane that moves at light speed, your time completely stops relative to the people on the ground. In fact, for the person traveling at light speed, they would reach their destination instantaneously. People on Earth may have to wait 60 years for you to travel 60 light-years, but for the person traveling at lightspeed, the very instant they obtain light speed they will be at their destination. By the time their finger is off the lightspeed button, they will have reached the destination.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Time and space are intrinsically linked through something called the metric, which allows for measurements in arbitrary shaped spaces.</p>
<p>No space directly implies no time, and we only know what happened after the big bang. It's not that time didn't exist before then, just that we are causally disconnected from it (no actions before the big bang could affect the universe after the big bang).</p>
<p>The truth is we have no idea what happened before the big bang, the question makes about as much sense as asking what yellow tastes like.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TLDR: We don't know.</p>
<p>Our understanding of reality is based on the space-time we live in. Both of these things (space and time) are fundamentally connected.
For example, you will see time slow down <em>for someone else</em> the faster they travel. The faster you travel relative to them, the slower they are. (Thanks for the correction in the comments)</p>
<p>When we look at very extreme places, like the start of the universe or a black hole, the maths  describing what happens (inkluding time) stops making sense and results in infinities, divisions by '0' etc . Probably because we did not (yet) find a way to calculate the effects of big heavy stuff (gravity) and the very small stuff (atomic forces) at the same time.</p>
<p>Therefore we just have no idea what happens at such conditions and can just guess. Everything after that is fun speculation. If there is time or not, what happens when there is no time, is there no causality and therefore no logic..</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
