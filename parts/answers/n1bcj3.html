		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I got a splinter deep in the soft skin behind my knee when I was a kid. My Dad tried to get it out and got most of it but a small piece (grain of rice) got left in. I forgot about it for decades. After all its out of view behind the knee. Then as a middle aged adult one day I felt a sharp pain behind the knee like being stuck with a pin. I felt bakc there and i couod feel the end of the long lost splinter poking out. I got it with tweezers. It was now a bit bigger and a grey/white calcified thing. </p>
<p>I wish I could say I kept it but that would be just weird</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A typical splinter which isn't able to be removed will eventually work its way out as the skin sheds layer by layer. Alternatively your body may react to it, and it will become surrounded in puss and then pop like a pimple.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My older brother once shot me point blank (execution style) in the upper lip with a bb gun. We were too scared to tell our parents so I said I didn't know how I cut my face. I pretty much forgot about having a bb in my lip until 10 years later an army dentist was checking my gums and was like WTF is this?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
