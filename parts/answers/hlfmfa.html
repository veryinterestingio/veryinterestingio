		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a rule of thumb and does not need to be strictly followed, it just teaches absolute beginners to think about composition.</p>
<p>People that haven't learned about composition tend to put the most important thing in the dead centre of the frame. They are shooting a picture like they would shoot a gun, i.e. you aim at the target.</p>
<p>However, if you tell someone to put their subject at the intersection of a 1/3rd line, it forces them to make a decision on which intersecting point to choose. They start thinking about how their shot is composed and begin to learn what works and what doesn't.</p>
<p>It's just a very simple rule because talking about leading lines, perspective, balance, negative space etc is too complex to start off with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main thing is that our eyes tend to go to the center naturally.  But then if the aesthetic focus is also in the center, the eye doesn't have much incentive to explore the rest of the image.  It's like a reading story where the hero wins on the first page.</p>
<p>Put the focus somewhere else and you've now got room to develop relationships between the focus and other parts of the image.  The rule of thirds isn't the only way, but it conveniently sets up a series of symmetrical sub-axes between the central axes and the edges of the work.  So it's an efficient way of using space and appeals to our brain's need to simplify and compress information.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The intersection points are not the only points of alignment.  The shot can also be composed by positioning inside the rows and columns formed by the grid (missing the actual intersection points). The grid divides the frame in 3 rows and 3 columns hence &quot;the rule of thirds&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a threefold answer:</p>
<p>First: the &quot;rule of thirds,&quot; like all &quot;rules&quot; in any creative industry, are common guidelines that have been found to be useful (especially for beginners), but are not actually hard rules. You should try to understand why they're useful, but also when to ignore them.</p>
<p>More than anything else, they work for the same reason that most diet plans (even weird ones) work: putting <em>any</em> thought process into your composition is better than not paying attention to what you're doing at all, just like paying <em>any</em> attention to what you eat is better than blindly eating everything that sounds good.</p>
<p>Second, you're not wrong: a lot of clickbait articles and blowhards really like to slap a grid over something and invent relationships that aren't actually present in the artwork/photography, either to look smart or just to fill time. Those are typically the same people who love to slap the golden ratio over literally everything, even scaling/shearing it to fit, just so they can pretend to be insightful critics.</p>
<p>With that said, though, the rule IS a useful tool that does legitimately get used by a lot of talented artists, and the reason is actually fairly simple:</p>
<p>When you divide a canvas into thirds, you are creating several instances of 2:1 ratios. (For instance, a focal point placed at the top right intersection of a thirded canvas has twice as much space on its left as its right, and twice as much below it as above it.)</p>
<p>The human brain has evolved to love and recognize 2:1 ratios, because nature loves 2:1 ratios. They show up <em>everywhere</em> in biology, geology, fractals, and other natural mathematics. It's the root principle of many biological processes: a thing will grow to twice its size, then something special happens (usually a new iteration in a repeated pattern, or a split into two iterations).</p>
<p>Because we find beauty in patterns (even patterns as simple as &quot;this thing is exactly as big as two of that thing&quot;), and because 2:1 is so prevalent in natural beauty, it's very sensible and organic to try to mimic it in artwork.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is basically that pictures are more attractive to a human eye if the main points are on one or more of the lines or intersections. So if an object or feature is on a 3rd or at the intersections of the 3rds it looks better than if it is dead centre.</p>
<p>It might be as simple as having the horizon in a landscape at the bottom 3rd line rather than directly in the middle or a tree on the 3rd line rather than in the centre.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
