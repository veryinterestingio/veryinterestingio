		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many cheeses, such as blue cheese, deliberately use mold to give it distinctive texture and taste, and these molds are selected with human consumption in mind, meaning that these are types of molds that don't produce toxins harmful to humans.</p>
<p>But if you have cheese - any cheese - that grows some random airborne mold from sitting in the back of your fridge too long, you have no idea what kind of mold that is or what effect it would have on your body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not every mold is toxic, there are a lot of different kinds. Some molds are even medicine â€“ penicilline was the first antibiotic and it occurs naturally in one kind of mold. the basic idea of blue cheese or other mold cheeses like camembert was to let one nontoxic mold form on the cheese to prevent other molds from attacking it. the harmful molds can't comptet with the edible one. It was a strategy to preserve cheese for longer times that we used before we had fridges.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Same as mushrooms really. You don't go eating wild mushrooms without identifying them first. They know the mold is tasty and safe.</p>
<p>Also.. it's suppose to be blue. If it turns green it won't right. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not entirely a direct answer, but it can help you understand. Most food-grade molds are non-toxic to humans with normal immune systems.</p>
<p>There over 100,000 different species of mold and the vast majority are harmless. Some are even beneficial. Penicillin is a kind of mold and yes, it's the same Penicillin as the antibiotic which has saved tens (hundreds?) of millions of lives over the last century.</p>
<p>So it's no wonder that you can find a mold that has been selected specifically for its culinary uses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
