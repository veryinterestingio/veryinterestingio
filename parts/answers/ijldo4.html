		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s a lot of work that takes place before highway work - surveys, inspections, utility locations and so on. These require frequent visits to the site by various groups and the site needs to be safe during this time.</p>
<p>You could set up cones each time. But that’s expensive, setting out the cones/barriers/barrels/etc is fairly dangerous to the workers doing it and disruptive to traffic, and would need to be coordinated between multiple parties. And then you have a situation where the road lane extents change from day to day, which creates its own hazard as the drivers don’t get used to the lane arrangement.</p>
<p>After they have everything they need there might be design and engineering work done in the office for a few weeks, along with an approval process and some preliminary site preparation work that is done in sporadic bursts.</p>
<p>They could take the barriers down for this, but they’d be going back up soon enough anyway, so similar to the reasons above they leave them up.</p>
<p>Then during construction the work might not be during office/commuting hours, or it could be happening elsewhere along the same run of road, might not be readily visible from the road, or could be sporadic as trades take their turns, and some things require waiting periods between work, and there’s a lot of testing, inspection and site investigation - say you uncover a conduit where your not expecting it - gotta stop work and then find out what’s going on, then come up with a plan to move it. Depending on other work going on this might mean you can’t do anything until the issue is fixed. Same if you uncover unexpected ground water or other conditions. And similar to above it’s normally safer to keep the barriers up than move them on a day to day basis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of good answers here but a couple I haven’t seen mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Concrete can take up to 28 days to cure (varies widely depending on the type of concrete, but 28 days is “standard”). It will look done but the concrete hasn’t reached its specified strength yet.</p>
</li>
<li>The construction contract may specify that the entire project gets turned over to the DOT at a certain time, so the blocked off portion may still be the responsibility of the contractor while work is happening further along. The contractor doesn’t want anyone on it because they would have to fix any damage without additional payment from the DOT</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>i skimmed and didn't see it mentioned: </p>
<p>Often, roadwork is done at night when possible to reduce the impact on traffic and daily life - it takes a fair bit of space to do things safely.</p>
<p>Sometimes when building roads, they have to  build or install structures beneath them as well, so it can appear as if nothing is happening if you don't know what to look for. Add in that often, physically, things <em>aren't</em> happening because of bureaucracy and accounting? it really can take months.  </p>
<p>Not the be-all-end-all answer, but another factor or two to consider.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A couple things I haven’t seen mentioned yet:</p>
<p>1) taper and clear zone distance - the distance to taper 2 lanes into one is relatively long, and there is also a minimum clear zone required before the work zone starts (to hopefully slow drivers down that don’t merge over in time so they don’t run into the work zone). Additionally, it is highly preferable to do the taper on a tangent (straight) section, so the barrels may have been extended to avoid a curve for the taper. </p>
<p>2) work day - if you observe a work zone while driving, you are only seeing a snapshot of it. They likely aren’t going to move the barrels throughout the day (dangerous, and often a different contractor who may not be on site all day). So while they may only have been working on one small section when you drove by, they may be anticipating working on all of the closed off area during the day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
