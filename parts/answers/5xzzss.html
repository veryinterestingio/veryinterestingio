		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This question is extremely common, there are likely many good threads with further discussion if you wish to search for it.</p>
<p>Much of the observational evidence for the big bang comes from studying its 'echo', the cosmic microwave background (CMBR). There are many measurements you can do with a quality map of the CMBR and each one we do matches our predictions for an expanding universe.</p>
<p>Another good piece of evidence is the relative ratios of primordial elements. We know roughly how much of each stuff was in the universe, 75% H 24%He and some lithium. We know how long the universe was at a certain temperature and we know fusion rates and decay rates of unstable isotopes so we should be able to predict this ratio. Our predictions match our observations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are other methods of confirming the expansion of the universe, one example being the measurement of density of mass/energy at different points in the history of the universe. </p>
<p>A lot of the evidence deals with the laws of special relativity and its predictions. Since its predictions and observations both match, the expansion of the universe is therefore given immense evidence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no way light could lose momentum that would fit to the measurements. We also see that the galaxy structures change over time, and tracing that back leads to a phase of a very hot and compact universe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't - technically. </p>
<p>However, the theory this prediction is based on is general relativity. And general relativity works exceptionally well at predicting an incredibly wide range of phenomena. </p>
<p>A competing theory would have to explain all the phenomena predicted by General Relativity equally well before it could cast serious doubt on the validity of GR. As of yet, there is no such theory known to us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason we know it works is the lack of a way for light to lose momentum. It can't be affected by any electromagnetic force or nuclear force because it isn't an atom and doesn't have electrons or protons. Gravity is the only force that can effect it and the only objects that can slow down light in such a significant manner as to redshift them are black holes, which we could detect due to light curving around them. Dark energy wouldn't do anything to the particle/wave itself ,because space only expands within itself, but makes the gap between galaxy clusters grow larger over time. This gives the galaxy it came from a momentum in the opposite direction as the light which causes the light to redshift.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
