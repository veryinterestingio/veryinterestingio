		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not the continuous charging that damages modern cellphones. Modern smart phones have smart charging causing them to switch to a trickle charge that keeps the battery topped off without over charging. There is some truth that keeping a cellphones batter near 100% often will damage the cells, but it's not because of overcharging.</p>
<p>The reason cellphone batteries weaken overtime is just wear and tear at the atomic level. Overtime as the battery charges and discharges the materials inside get worn and degrade and just don't work as well so they drain faster. Things that accelerate this wearing of cells are things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Letting the lithium battery fully drain before charging</li>
<li>Constantly charging to 100%</li>
<li>Excess heat builup</li>
<li>Freezing cold temperatures.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above puts extra strain on the cells and makes them degrade faster. If you avoid these things the cells will still degrade from everyday charging, but not nearly as fast.</p>
<p>You also have to consider the phone is doing more work overtime as things update. As software/apps update they become more power/resource hungry. Your phone is going to drain the battery faster as it uses more processing power to handle the new software giving the illusion that your battery is going bad. Same idea as your computer is slowing down after a couple of years. It's the same speed, the games are just more demanding.</p>
<p>Comparing this to a portable house phone isn't really accurate. Your house phone most likely has the same problem with a worn out battery, You just don't use it for hours on end. If you have an old portable phone it may very well only last 10 minutes these days where when it was new it would last hours.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Edit: ELI5 version. The batteries are different types on the inside. The cell phone type gets hurt at 100% charge and the cordless house phone type lasts longer at 100%, plus the house phone type is much cheaper and easier to replace (so even if it doesn’t last super long, it’s not a big deal).</p>
<p>Edit2:
ELI20 now features more ELI20-like-explanations In parentheses.</p>
<p>I've worked in the battery biz for 10 years.</p>
<p>Most commercial li-ion batteries don't handle high state of charge (battery % shown on your device) very well as the oxidation rate (how fast the liquid inside is getting used up) of the electrolyte is high at this state, so you lose lithium ions rapidly (battery can’t store as much charge.)  This causes loss of capacity (runtime).  </p>
<p>The internal resistance (resistance is the phenomenon that reduces battery power) of the battery goes up at the same time, and it can't charge/discharge as quickly anymore, so the end effect is it can't perform well in the device (the device needs a certain amount of power, which the battery will eventually struggle to deliver) and this actually accelerates the capacity fade even more. (Battery loss of runtime will get worse each day)</p>
<p>Most household phones are Ni-MH chemistry which is much lower energy density (heavier and less sexy) but handles high state of charge much better.  </p>
<p>They used to put Ni-MH in cell phones in the mid-to-late 90s, they were big, bulky, and didn't have a lot of talk time.   Li-ion was better in every way for cell phones.  For household phones this isn't really a problem, and Ni-MH is much cheaper to implement, plus they are more easily customer replaceable (they don’t catch on fire, and are widely available)</p>
<p>You can get a much longer lifetime out of lithium-ion batteries by implementing lower maximum voltage, for example 4.1V max charging voltage instead of 4.2V.  This is called derating and is used in more high-end applications like Teslas (4.1V is normal charging mode, 4.2V is &quot;extended range&quot; mode which you shouldn't use if you don't have to).</p>
<p>&quot;Regular&quot; lithium-ion batteries are usually charged to 4.2V and the device makers don't give a shit about the long term longevity, they just want to advertise longer runtime on a single charge at beginning of life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the other answer about not constantly discharging it, the chances are that you rarely use the house phone for an extended period of time. </p>
<p>If the battery can last a few hours when the phone is new, even if it loses half its capacity over a couple of years, you'll never notice the decrease if you only use it for 10-20 minutes at a time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When a battery is fully charged the power doesn't go to the battery it just skips it and makes sure it just retains its full charge and only rarely uses its battery.</p>
<p>A cellphone/mobile phone constantly drains and recharges. This constant discharge and recharge is what damages batteries.</p>
<p>If you kept your cellphone on charge 24/7 it would be the same as the house phone.</p>
<p>Additional: while batteries do degrade over time when on charge continously, trickle charging reduces battery performance by a very negligible amount that you wouldn't notice it over a 12-18 month period at all upon taking it off charge plus if its always on charge its not like it matters.</p>
<p>There are external factors which will impact the performance more than trickle charging such as heat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
