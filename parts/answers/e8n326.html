		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Metals are almost always formed of many small crystals or grains. Within each crystal, the atoms are organized in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_structure" target="_blank">lattice structure</a>, of which several different types exist (for the record, gold is face-centered cubic, FCC).</p>
<p>When you deform metal, you're actually breaking up the structure of the lattice in what are called &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation" target="_blank">dislocations</a>&quot;. But crucially, this does NOT mean that they form new grains or crystals. Energy is needed to form and move these dislocations. As you deform the material more and more, these dislocations begin to pile up and cause a traffic jam, which means you now need more energy to form and move these dislocations. This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_hardening" target="_blank">work hardening</a> - as you deform metal, it becomes harder, which makes it more difficult to further deform and also makes it less ductile.</p>
<p>In order to further deform the metal, you usually have to heat up the metal (which allows the atoms inside to move around - less wholesale moving every which way and more shuffling a little bit into a more comfortable position with its neighbors). When you do this, what were formerly dislocations now start to form new (and very small) grains in a process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recrystallization_(metallurgy)" target="_blank">recrystallization</a>. This process to bring about recrystallization is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annealing_(metallurgy)" target="_blank">annealing</a> (wherein you heat up a metal to a certain temperature and hold it there for some time). So this means that there are two general ways to deform metals: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_working" target="_blank">cold work</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_working" target="_blank">hot work</a>. In cold work, you generally deform something and if it doesn't end up where you want it, you anneal to make it soft again and work it further. In hot work, you don't have to do this but there's other drawbacks.</p>
<p>Gold (high purity) is interesting in that at room temperature, it dynamically recrystallizes on its own. This means that when you cold work gold, it doesn't work harden, which means it stays ductile and can be worked further.</p>
<p>To clarify, so that /u/FalanxZealot doesn't get mad at me - when you deform gold, you add energy to the system. Gold is able to use that energy to recrystallize. It's this process that can occur at room temperature, whereas this is not the case for most other metals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is still quite long but it goes like this:</p>
<p>There are three main types of metallic elements. They are categorised by their crystal structure, which is basically the spatial arrangement of their atoms - and how many atoms are in what is called the unit cell, or the smallest repeating pattern of those atoms in 3D.</p>
<p>The three arrangements that almost all metals are, and often they change between as <em>allotropes</em> depending on temperature are as follows:</p>
<p>Body Centred Cubic</p>
<p>Face Centred Cubic</p>
<p>Hexagonal Close Packed</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ggspdt.com/uploads/8/1/0/4/81043910/8970374_orig.png" target="_blank">https://www.ggspdt.com/uploads/8/1/0/4/81043910/8970374_orig.png</a></p>
<p>Now, what surprises most people when they discover this is that the two closest structures there are not the two cubics. The closest two in terms of electrical, thermal and mechanical (like malleability) properties are the Face Centred cubic (FCC) and Hexagonal Close Packed (HCP) arrangements.</p>
<p>What differentiates them is how close together the atoms are. In both HCP and FCC they have much closer distances between atoms, and as a result the way in which bonding occurs in metals - which is neither ionic nor covalent but most readily described as 'the residual nuclei in a see of delocalised electrons' - means they are more perfectly 'metallic in their properties: dense, ductile, malleable, good electrical and thermal conductors.</p>
<p>Body Centred cubic metals have a degree of covalent character which makes them stronger, harder, poorer conductors and have higher melting points. It also means that special processes such as thermomechanical processing to refine the size of their crystals has much more effect on their mechanical properties (strength, toughness, ductility) than on FCC and HCP metals.</p>
<p>Now, regarding the ductility of gold. Gold is a FCC metal (so the most closely packed atoms, the most metallic in character - high conductivities, excellent ductility and malleability). Because of gold's position in the Periodic Table (nearly at the end of a long D block row) that sea of electrons that washes through the arrangement of atoms is only one electron per atom, which means there's poor electrostatic attraction by comparison to metals with two or more per atom, or with smaller nuclei-ionic radius differences, see this picture;</p>
<p><a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d9/4e/87/d94e877d1d04a26ba570df5bf8dec412.jpg" target="_blank">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d9/4e/87/d94e877d1d04a26ba570df5bf8dec412.jpg</a></p>
<p>Basically, that substantial similarity of atomic to ionic radius means that the energy required to move atoms about in that structure and through the electron sea is much lower than in other metals. Couple that with the low electrostatic attraction per atom, these both mean easy deformation <em>and</em> incredibly low work hardening rate. Work hardening is what causes metals to locally thin where large forces are used to deform them. that basically doesn't happen worth a damn in gold.</p>
<p>That was as simple as I could make it...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The number of electron shells has a lot to do with this. The 10 most ductile elements are as follows: Gold, lead, niobium, palladium, platinum, silver, vanadium, tin, aluminium, and copper.</p>
<p>If you look at the elements' number of shells, the elements also have more shells.</p>
<p>It's not a perfect representation, because niobium has one less shell than gold and lead, but it's an accurate guide.</p>
