		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a chef, let me tell.you we are not concerned about your health, we want you to have a delicious dining experience. We use a ridiculous amount of fat, salt, sugar, acid and alcohol in your food. Everybody knows about fat and salt, but especially the alcohol makes a massive difference. There are so many different alcoholic drinks that can enhance all kind of different foods, a good example would be Noilly Prat for fish dishes or a splash of sherry in your savoy cabbage. You'd never know it's in there, but it makes all the difference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What mugnhut said.  Restaurants literally get the better (prime) cuts of meats that never see a grocery store... then add more salt &amp; fats than we do at home...
Try adding twice the spices to your at home cooking - the difference is incredible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Why does your Barber cut your hair better than your aunt? Because they're trained. We really do need to start realizing this.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Hello, i noticed that the food i eat out tastes nearly every time better than food i make at home. What do they put in (except for msg)?  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you can't replicate the taste of a restaurant dish at home then be aware that the three secret ingredients are always (more) <strong>salt, sugar and butter</strong>.  </p>
<p>Edit: Oops, too late.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
