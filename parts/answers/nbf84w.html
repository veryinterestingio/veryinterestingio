		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The closer you get to the centre of a black hole, the stronger it pulls, and the faster you need to move to escape that pull.</p>
<p>At some point the speed you need to escape its pull becomes greater than the speed of light. Because speed of light is the fastest speed anything can move with, nothing can escape it. This point is what's called event horizon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Event horizons are definitionally a boundary beyond which events cannot affect the observer. Specifically, this is a concept that applies to black holes - in an ELI5 sense, imagine a marble in a deep pot with a curved bottom. By swirling the pot around, you can get the marble to climb the walls, but imagine that this pot had sides so steep and tall that no amount of swirling could get that marble out. If one were to imagine that marble is a photon, the highest point you could get the marble swirling would be the event horizon - if anything, marble, spaceship, rubber duck, were to get into the pot beyond that point, it doesn't matter how fast it's going, it's stuck in there. Since light itself can't escape the event horizon, you can't actually see or even detect what goes on beyond that point - and due to relativity (if someone figured out an ELI5 on relativity, that would be entertaining to read) the closer an object got to the event horizon, the slower it would appear to go, so someone watching something go over the edge would just see it slow down to a complete stop as it entered. Black holes are wild.</p>
<p>EDIT: Kurzgesagt came out with a really neat video on this topic a few weeks ago - <a href="https://youtu.be/QqsLTNkzvaY" target="_blank">check it out</a>!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Event horizons are the &quot;edge&quot; of a black hole's...blackness. It's the point where the black hole's gravity becomes so strong that light (and by extension everything else) can't overcome it and gets pulled in, leaving only black nothingness.</p>
<p>This leads to another important aspect about black holes: The actual black hole object (the singularity) is an infinitely-small chunk of mass at the very center, and the hole part that we see is just an illusion, created because all the light that would otherwise travel to our eyes is being sucked into the hole.</p>
<p>Another important thing: If you were to fall into the black hole (assuming you weren't ripped to shreds first), time would pass normally for you, and you would watch the universe shrink away behind you until you were surrounded by darkness and/or ceased to exist. Someone <em>watching</em> you fall in would see a different thing though. They would watch your descent slow down the closer you got to the event horizon, because the light &quot;image&quot; of you falling would become more and more distorted the closer you got. This would continue until you froze in-place completely, at which point you would just kinda fade away since the &quot;image&quot; of you falling in, also falls in with you.</p>
<p>And one last important thing: Most black holes have event horizons a few dozen miles wide at most. <a href="https://i.redd.it/lqtsqz7ahpq11.jpg" target="_blank">But some, at the core of very bright galaxies, are orders of magnitude larger than the largest stars, and could swallow solar systems whole.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its the place where information can only be pulled farther into a black hole. Time, space, and light, pretty much immediately lose any relevance of what they were before crossing this boundary. In our observations of what we think is a black hole, we are really only seeing the smear left over by the stars and gas and matter heating up as they approach the horizon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
