		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The amount of work a compressor blade can do goes as the square of the blade speed.  You can therefore get more work out of fewer blades if the blades move faster.  There is a limit to how fast the tips of your blades can travel before the losses from supersonic effects cause serious problems.  Tip speeds of above about Mach 1.2 are not a good idea.  For a high bypass ratio engine, about 90% of the fan air goes straight through the bypass duct, and about 10% through the engine core.  Because of the geometry, that core flow comes from the root section where blade speeds are low for a given shaft speed.</p>
<p>Most engine makers have a &quot;booster&quot; section of a few core flow stages on the fan stage and second high pressure compressor on a separate shaft that spins much faster.  Rolls Royce, however, go for a 3 shaft design (for their larger engines, the smaller ones are 2-shaft), with one shaft dedicated to the fan, and two separate core compressor shafts.  Aside from allowing higher blade loading on the intermediate shaft, there are also benefits to the off design performance when the shafts are spinning at lower speeds.  It comes down to surge margin, which is a huge topic that is a bit much for this post.</p>
<p>The other aspect of fan design is the turbine matching.  The low fan RPM makes the LP turbine that drives the fan a low loaded design because of the low blade speed.  It is typical to have one or two turbine stages to drive the HP compressor and 5 or more stages to drive the fan for this reason.  There has been a long desire to develop geared fans where the fan can spin at a lower speed than the LP shaft, allowing a much smaller turbine (3 stages, for example).  The PW1000G used on the A220 (formerly Bombardier C-Series) is the first in production with this, but designing a compact lightweight reliable gearbox for the power requirements is a huge challenge.  RR are reportedly looking to develop a 2 shaft geared fan design for their next generation large civil engine, but that's a big challenge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A single shaft would require all turbomachinery to spin at the same speed. This ultimately compromising your design as the much larger fan and much smaller HPC are efficient at very different operating speeds. If the fan spins too quickly, you'll stall the tips and tank its efficiency and if the HPC is too slow, you can't get as large pressure increase unless you add loads more stages, which adds a lot more weight. Keep in mind that at a high level, engine manufacturers are trying to balance NOx, fuel burn, noise, weight, thrust, complexity (maintenance), and cost. A single shaft saves weight and complexity but hurts you elsewhere. You could add gearboxes but that's a lot more weight and complexity.</p>
<p>Rolls Royce even used to have a third shaft for the intermediate pressure components. So the HPs had one, IPs had one, and the LPs and fan had the last.</p>
<p>Pratt also has two shafts but built a gearbox for the fan to see pretty significant improvements in performance. They were on the A320neo but I haven't followed how they have done.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Single shaft turbofans do exist. But as the other answer mentioned, multiple spools as they are known allow different turbines and compressors to spin at different rpm. This flexibility helps the engine design.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The plane in on (757 rolls royce engines) has 3 spools. N1, N2, and N3. They all turn at different speeds which is in the 5 digits rpm-wise for some of the spools. We don't (as pilots) measure the speed in rpm we use percent. It's easier to read and more intuitive. You should be able to pull up a cutaway diagram of the high bipass RB211 engines on the 757-200 and 757-300. It'll give you a good picture of what we're talking about. The front fan is basically acting as a propeller, giving you good low altitude performance, the other fans turn much faster and do most of the hot stuff on the inside.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
