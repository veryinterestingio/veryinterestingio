		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Expense and coverage. There is a huge amount of data being generated. And there are a lot of flights. And flights go to places where there may be limited satellite coverage. Some location data is continuously uplinked (the system is relatively new, so it has taken the airline industry a LONG time to update - the system requires global satellite coverage) but not ALL the data recorded in every flight recorder during a flight. </p>
<p>Many parts of the commercial airlines systems are VERY old. Upgrading it is a very expensive exercise since it requires both new satellites as well as equipment upgrades on all planes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most commercial aircraft transmit their GPS-based position twice per second. This is part of their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_dependent_surveillance_%E2%80%93_broadcast" target="_blank"><em>Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast</em> (ADS–B)</a>  broadcasts. The problem with providing world-wide receiver coverage for  this system is that the frequency it uses only travels line via line of  sight, so it won't travel past the horizon.</p>
<p>Providing coverage over large bodies of water would require a network of buoys, which would be quite expensive.</p>
<p>Another possibility is to put ADS-B receivers on satellites</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have explained why the massive amount of data from the whole plane isn't constantly uploaded but there is remote monitoring of some Rolls Royce engines. This is from an article on a different crash.</p>
<p>&quot;The data from the sensors are accumulated and transmitted at regular intervals to ground stations monitored by the engine manufacturers. Alert messages indicating anomalies are instantly transmitted. According to Rolls-Royce’s website, their aircraft engine data is transmitted via satellite feed.  Rolls- Royce would analyze the data submitted and make recommendations to the airline for engine maintenance, as appropriate.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A quick search suggests that a Dreamliner will generate around half a terabyte of flight recorder data per flight. Having to upload that in real time, across a constantly changing global network of satellites, multiplied by all the flights in the air simultaneously...MASSIVE bandwidth and cost.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The question is often asked here after a crash.</p>
<p>The main reasons are :</p>
<ul>
<li>it is a truly massive amount of data to upload, often in areas with limited coverage.</li>
<li>since the broadcast system can fail, you would still need a physical black box anyway </li>
<li>this data is useless 99.9% of the time, so we’re talking about a huge cost increase with no clear benefits vs. the current situation</li>
