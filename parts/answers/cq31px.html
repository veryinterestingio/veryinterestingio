		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These shudders and twitches are called &quot;hypnic jerks.&quot;</p>
<p>Science doesn't really know precisely why they happen, but a couple competing ideas exist.</p>
<ul>
<li>One holds that our brains misinterpret a drop in blood pressure and relaxation of the muscles as a sign that we're in trouble, that we're dying, so it makes our muscles jump and wakes us up so that we can correct whatever the problem might be.</li>
<li>The other popular idea relies on the same misinterpretation, but attributes it to a period in history when early humans slept in trees, saying that these signals meant we were about to fall out of our tree, and woke us up so we could catch ourselves.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ooh! I know the answer to this! I saw a sleep researcher give a talk and this was a question asked at the end of the event. His answer: When you are falling asleep, the part of your brain that does the thinking starts to log off. At the same time, the part of your brain that controls voluntary muscles switches to &quot;off.&quot; The reason your brain switches off your muscle control is so you don't act out when dreaming.</p>
<p>The &quot;jump&quot; you feel happens when the two parts of the brain aren't in sync with each other. The thinking part of the brain hasn't quite logged off yet, but the muscle control has been shut down. Because the thinking part can't register any sensations that tell it where the body is in space, it freaks out. The thinking part of the brain quickly &quot;wakes up&quot; the motor part by making a big movement in order to find something - anything - to give it some bearing. </p>
<p>As I understand it, sleepwalking is the condition of the thinking brain being turned off but the motor control is not paralyzed and so is fully functional. Sleep paralysis is the opposite - the thinking brain is wide awake but the muscles aren't operational yet. </p>
<p>Fun fact, when you sleep, the &quot;thinking&quot; part of your brain &quot;turns off&quot; your ability to think logically. That's why weird things can happen in dreams and you just go with it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
