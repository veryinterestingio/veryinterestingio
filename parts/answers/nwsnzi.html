<li>
<p>Neurology is a branch of medicine that deals with the nervous system. Psychiatry is a branch of medicine that deals with disorders of “the mind”. If that sounds vague, it’s because it is. Generally, personality, behavior, mood, psychoses, and things in this nature are historically managed by psychiatrists. Are there grey areas? Sure. As things become better known in etiology, we may find more organic causes for diseases. For example dementia is studied by neurologists and psychiatrists. In general, psychiatric disorders are more inclined to have multifactorial, social, behavioral, or unknown causes than neurological disorders.</p>

<p>Psychiatrists are, as mentioned, medical doctors. So if there is a medical or organic issue, psychiatrists are trained to deal with them and can provide medical treatment. This is as opposed to psychologists who are not medical doctors. Clinical psychologists study psychiatric disorders, and usually can help with non medical management of these disorders. For example, if someone needs therapy, a psychologist could help. If they need medication, usually a psychiatrist will help. So the fact that a psychiatrist manages a certain disease or not may not be as important as which specialty trains people for managing that disease. For example, back pain might be managed by orthopedics, neurosurgery, or rheumatology. But if in some country, one specialty is trained to manage back pain more than the others, that’s the one you should go to first. It doesn’t matter that much how we think it should be categorized. It matters who knows most about it. </p>
</li>
<li>ADHD may very well have a neurological basis. As one of the comments points out, many psychiatric disorders may very well have a neurological basis. But are we there yet? Probably not. ADHD may still have other components to it, so categorizing it with things that psychiatrists manage isn’t very out of place.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the US, when you get board-certified for psychiatry or neurology, you get certified for the other as well due to the huge overlaps in diseases and treatments. Some neurologists do treat adhd, but most focus on seizures, migraines, dementia, strokes, etc. Some psychiatrists will treat the same disorders but mostly focus on anxiety, depression, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ADHD might be caused by a difference neurodevelopment, but the symptoms you see the doctor for are behavioral (executive dysfunction, inattention, hyperactivity, troubles focusing, etc.) These symptoms are common across many psychological and mental disorders and there is no diagnostic test to measure if your brain is simply &quot;wired differently&quot; or if your inattention is because you're struggling with depression or insomnia. Diagnosing and treating ADHD takes somebody who is skilled in assessing someone's behavior and mental process for an underlying cause/reason (i.e. a psychiatrist.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simple answer is. Neurologist are treating ADHD patient but because of the complexity, there is no one method that works for everyone. While there is no cure for ADHD, there are treatment options available to successfully manage symptoms and improve your child or teenager’s functionality in his or her daily life.  And depending which path you choose you will look for different types of experts (Medical or Behavioral Therapy).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Personally I was treated by a neurologist for ADHD from when I was 9 until I was 18 (where I no longer was seen at the children’s hospital and instead had to see my family doctor for medication and a psychologist for extra help). I was surprised when I found many Americans are treated by psychologists even as children. I’m no expert on this but I’m now wondering if I was ever supposed to be treated by a neurologist? I’m confused now!!!!</p>
