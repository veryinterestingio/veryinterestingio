		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Plants, too, will stop photosynthesis after eight to twelve hours depending on species and latitude, and instead their metabolism switches to the same as animals have: Use O2, produce CO2.  </p>
<p>Bacteria can become periodically dormant; during that time they don't undergo cell division and their metabolism slows. However it is important to note that particularly for Bacteria that make spores, this is a direct survival strategy because in that state, they are more likely to survive any adverse conditions.  </p>
<p>I don't know anything particular about tardigrade sleep but Caenorhabditis elegans - a thread worm that is extremely popular in biological research - does sleep, too. It has slightly over <del>40</del> 300 neurons in total and we know what every single one does, but it also periodically reduces its overall activity and rests - sleep for all intents and purposes. Perchance to dream? Who knows.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Almost everything goes through a dormant period, but the kind of sleep that we do that is critical for brain function is rare in living things and limited to animals. Not even all mammals do it. Dolphins, for instance, only shut part of their brain down at a time, so they never fully sleep. Most things just go through a dormant period to reduce resource use and waste production when resources are scarce.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what you mean by sleep. If you’re just referring to a time where an organism has little to no activity then yes. </p>
<p>Pretty much every animal at some point stops being active. </p>
<p>If you mean sleep as in the organism goes into a form suspended awareness then no. For that I assume you’d have to have a brain. But I’m not an expert so grain of salt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think no because they need something that &quot;wake up'' they.
And in pollycellular organism never a cell rest, they reduce the activity but they never rest. We can think what sleeping is a emerging phenomenon of a multiple cells reducing their activity. I think that but I'm not biologist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
