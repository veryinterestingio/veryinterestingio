		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>lots of different ways of doing.</p>
<ol>
<li>So really long lenses is one reason - the photographers are not near the animals and can zoom in close. They can also utilise hides (Like camouflaged huts) or ghilli suits or whatever.</li>
<li>Camera traps are another method - just hide cameras everywhere and only have them activate when there’s movement, don’t need a camera man stakes out for days then.</li>
<li>Oddly enough, befriending the animals is also an option. Planet Earth II had the film crew integrate into a troop of monkeys.</li>
<li>Shooting animals in captivity is also an option - portions of Blue Planet were shot in a aquarium.</li>
<li>This is perhaps the most surprising one - it’s not real! All the different shots of animals at different angles telling a vivid story of fight and flight - is very very often the animal on different days edited in such a way to tell a good story (not even  always the same animal) and capture all of the behaviours that need to be showcased. So if there’s a lot of cuts in a wildlife sequence theres a pretty good chance it’s not all shot at the same time.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m not a photographer or film maker but I am a wildlife ecologist and have spent a lot of time in the wild with animals and some time with a film crew from Animal Planet when they were filming a documentary series.</p>
<p>1.) I worked on a long term research project studying behaviors of wild primates. The troops that we studied had been “followed” by researchers for nearly a decade, so they were habituated to the presence of small numbers of people with equipment. This was one of the primary reasons that the crew selected our population to film, they knew they could get good shots.</p>
<p>Also, most wildlife in popular safari destinations in Africa are semi-habituated just from tourism. I’ve seen lion kills and many other intense natural behaviors happen within 20 yards of multiple vehicles.</p>
<p>2.) The camera technology that they use is absolutely amazing. A shot that appears to be feet away may actually be 100+ yards out.</p>
<p>3.) Strategic placement of blinds. In arid environments a lot of interesting behavior happens in close proximity to water because that’s where the wildlife gather. Set up a blind in those areas and sit and wait and eventually you get good footage.</p>
<p>4.) A lot of what you see are actually montages over multiple days made to look like some dramatic sequence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The photographers use really long telephoto lenses.  If you ever see photos of the photographers they have lenses that are a foot long.  So they really aren't that close to the animals.  They get the angles by just quietly moving around or working in teams.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
