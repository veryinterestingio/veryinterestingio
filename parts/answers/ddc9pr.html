<p>your muscles (and your entire body) use ATP (adenosine triphosphate - there are 3 phosphates) for energy. when ATP is used, it loses a phosphate group and becomes ADP (adenosine diphosphate - 2 phosphates). creatine, which is phosphocreatine in your muscles, donates a phosphate group to ADP so it becomes ATP again. this is much faster than than the krebs cycle that would be used otherwise.</p>
<p>it does not help with muscle building directly. it allows for like a 5% performance boost at most so you can get that extra rep in, which over time can cause a slightly greater stimulus for growth than if you did not use creatine.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSPmsqYRL2Y" target="_blank">jeff nippard is great at explaining things</a></p>
<p>also, you need to be saturated with creatine for it to do anything. its not something like caffeine in which you take it and you feel the effects soon after.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Creatine is used to regenerate ATP, the source of energy which gets your muscles to do stuff. It is very efficient, so it is able to keep up the amount of ATP muscle cells have. It is also the first way your muscles regenerate ATP, the other ways being anaerobic glycolysis and cellular respiration. But these only take place after your stored creatine is used up. Creatine would essentially give you more &quot;energy&quot; to lift. Maybe not the right word, but it would probably help you lift for longer because you have more ATP to use before they are depleted. I doubt it would help you gain muscle mass though, it has no direct effect on the regeneration of muscle fibers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So your muscles obviously need energy to be able to contract the way they do, and the main molecule that supplies this energy is called adenosine triphosphate, or ATP. However, since ATP is so energetic, it's really unstable and takes a lot of energy to make, and even more energy to maintain. Thus, it doesn't make much sense for your body to keep ATP ready on demand-- rather, it makes ATP as needed for your muscles. This is done by adding a phosphate group to a molecule called adenosine diphosphate, or ADP. However, the process of converting ADP to ATP takes a few seconds. But if I want to throw a punch, my muscles don't take a few seconds before I'm ready-- it's pretty much instantaneous.</p>
<p>This is because your body keeps creatine on hand. In your body, creatine is usually bonded to a phosphate group to make a molecule called phosphocreatine (CP). CP has this property where it exchanges phosphate groups in equilibrium with ADP. Basically, this means that occasionally CP will donate its phosphate group to ADP, creating a small amount of ATP and converting CP to creatine. However, as soon as this ATP molecule forms, it usually immediately loses its phosphate group to another creatine molecule, forming ADP and CP. You can think of this as creatine and ADP playing catch with a phosphate group. When creatine has the &quot;ball,&quot; it's CP, and when ADP has the &quot;ball,&quot; it's ATP.</p>
<p>However, when you tell your muscles to contract, as soon as the ATP forms, it is immediately put to use to contract your muscle. A lower amount of ATP means that the remaining CP is converted even faster to creatine and ATP. So essentially, whenever CP passes phosphate to ADP, ADP turns to ATP and is immediately used up, so no more CP is created, since there isn't anything around to pass the &quot;ball&quot; back to creatine.</p>
<p>This goes on for a few seconds, at which point your CP reserves are depleted. But its OK, since by that time other more permanent pathways have started up to convert ADP to ATP. So basically, creatine serves as a source of immediate energy for your muscles (just a few seconds) while your actual machinery powers up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
