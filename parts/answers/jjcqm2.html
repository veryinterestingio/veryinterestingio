</blockquote>
<p>Well that is absolutely false and I imagine it is the source of your confusion. The sun is not on fire. It is incandescent. it is very hot and glows as hot things do. There is barely any oxygen to burn with (like less than 1%)! It's just H, He, and trace other elements. It doesn't get hot from combustion, but from fusion.</p>
<p>Fusion takes enormous heat and pressure, which is only attainable in the core of the star, which is typically like the inner 1/4 of the radius (so only 1/64 of the volume) So only a small portion of the star's mass is participating in fusion. The rest is providing CRUSHING POWER to make the core high enough pressure and temperature to do its stuff.</p>

<p>I'd just like to add my own astonishment that my whopping 2-paragraph reply is currently netting 8k+ upvotes and 20+ awards. Wow. I think the lesson to be learned here is that <em>brevity is appreciated</em>. Glad ya'll like stars as much as I do :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sun is not on fire. But anyway, the sun is absolutely enormous, and nuclear reactions are only happening with a significant rate in the core of the sun, not its entire volume. Thermonuclear reaction rates are generally extremely temperature-sensitive, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_structure#/media/File:Temperaturverteilung_sonne.svg" target="_blank">temperature profile of a star is not uniform</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the peak temperature of the sun is &quot;only&quot; around 15 million Kelvin, which is a few orders of magnitude lower than the Coulomb barrier energy (divided by Boltzmann's constant) for hydrogen-on-hyodrogen reactions.</p>
<p>Typical fusion cross sections go like </p>
<p>σ(E) = σ<em><em>0</em></em>(1 - V<em><em>c</em></em>/E), where V<em><em>c</em></em> is the Coulomb barrier energy (there's a calculator <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/NucEne/coubar.html" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
<p>You can plot this function and see what it looks like, but the important point is that it's very small for energies below the Coulomb barrier (E &lt; V<em><em>c</em></em>).</p>
<p>And it's even worse for our sun, which operates based on the pp-chain. The very first reaction in this chain is not really a proper &quot;fusion&quot; reaction. Instead, it's a reaction mediated by the weak force, which allows a proton to turn into a neutron. The reaction is:</p>
<p>p + p -&gt; d + e^(+) + v,</p>
<p>where e^(+) is a positron, v is an electron neutrino, and d is the deuteron (the nucleus of hydrogen-2).</p>
<p>Weak reactions generally have extremely low cross sections at nuclear energies; even much worse than the Coulomb barrier argument I gave about for proper fusion reactions.</p>
<p>This is reaction is so improbable that it's never actually been measured in the laboratory. But the sun can use it because of how enormous it is. Even if 0.0000000000001% of the hydrogen in the sun is undergoing this reaction in some interval of time, there is so much hydrogen available in the sun that that's still a lot of total energy released. But this reaction is still a major bottleneck for the entire pp-chain.</p>
<p>In any case, whether you're talking about the pp-chain or some other stellar nucleosynthetic processes not based on weak reactions, a <em>tiny</em> fraction of collisions between nuclei in the sun will result in nuclear reactions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to expand on how low the probability of fusion is, the Sun's power density of the core is less than a compost heap. At the center of the core the power density is only ~280w/m^3 compared to over 1,600w/m^3 for a human. The sun is just so large that this small amount of power adds up. This just shows how hard artificial fusion for power generation is, we don't need to just replicate what the sun is doing we need need close to a million times the power density.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since the main part of your question has already been answered, I'll add that there <em>are</em> ways that stars can burn up all at once, although it results in a supernova and the star unbinding and completely flying apart. One such example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_detonation" target="_blank">carbon detonation</a>, where a mass slightly greater than our sun fuses within the span of a few <em>seconds</em> and releases enough energy that the matter remaining in the star is ejected at up to 6% the speed of light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
