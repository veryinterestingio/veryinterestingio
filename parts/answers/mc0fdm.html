		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our noses warm and humidify — add moisture to — the air we breathe as it travels down into the lungs. So when you inhale cold, dry air, the moist tissue inside the nose automatically increases fluid production to do its job of protecting sensitive lung tissue. But when there's too much fluid, the excess tends to drip out, creating a runny nose.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm wondering if hm.. the size of a nose or the amount of air that you &quot;pump&quot; through it make any difference to how much one's nose runs.  </p>
<p>I feel like my nose runs in winter time much more than of my surroundings. That's the reason I don't enjoy spending much time outside in winter time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Adding to the answers above, your blood pressure skyrockets during exercise, and your nose is full of really thin capillaries. It’s possible, if your capillaries are thinner than usual, that this increase in blood pressure will overclock them, making your nose bleed. This is not a ‘normal’ condition tho.</p>
<p>Edit: I’m an idiot and confused a runny nose with a bleedy one lol</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
