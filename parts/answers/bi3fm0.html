		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure why everyone is explaining why the moon looks bigger near the horizon compared to up in the sky when the question is specifically about comparing it to a photo or video. </p>
<p>The answer is when you take a photo on your phone, your phone has a wide angle lens which tries to get a wide field of view. I.e it tries to capture the entire scenery in front of you. Distant objects look smaller the wider your lens is. </p>
<p>To get around this problem you need to use a telephoto lens. Telephoto (zoom) lenses make distant objects appear bigger because they have a narrower field of view. </p>
<p>To make the moon still appear bigger you could include a distant object in the picture like a building or an airplane. </p>
<p>The relative size of the distant object to the moon will make the moon look huge.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the other answers, in photography and film, you can use certain lenses and techniques to make the moon look gigantic, while the camera on phones and a lot of other things generally do the opposite. It might look smaller in the picture than it does irl because the camera being used creates the illusion that it is smaller than it really is</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is it's an optical illusion. This is mainly caused by having something to compare the moon's scale too (mountain, building, etc). </p>
<p>Many people belive its due to being lower to the horizon and the atmosphere &quot;magnifies&quot; it, however this is incorrect. </p>
<p>To test this optical illusion for yourself, hold up an object at arms length to the moon when it is low on the horizon and looks larger. Compare the scale of the moon to the object. Then, later when the moon is higher in the sky and looks normal size, hold the same object at arms length again. You will see its the same size.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>but small on a picture or a video?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The size the moon appears in a picture or video is dictated by the focal length of the lens you are using, wide angle lenses make the moon appear small in a photograph and telephoto lenses make it appear larger. It would be similar in comparison to looking at the moon through binoculars versus looking at the moon through  a telescope. </p>
<p>As an example phone cameras generally use the equivalent of 35mm or 50mm lenses (compared to 35mm SLR lenses), this is a relatively wide angle lenses so the moon appears very small in the picture. If you use a telephoto lens such as a 200mm, 500mm, or 800mm lens the moon will appear much larger in the photograph. The longer the focal length of the lens the more the moon will be magnified in the picture.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
