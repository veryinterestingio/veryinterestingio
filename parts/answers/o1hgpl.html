		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Are you talking about total sugar or added sugar? They're different.</p>
<p>Before fermentation, a drink can contain, say for example 13g of sugar per serving. After fermentation, yeast will have converted most of that sugar into alcohol and CO^2 . If the amount of remaining sugar is less than 0.5g per serving, the FDA considers it &quot;sugar-free&quot;. According to <a href="https://blog.packleaderusa.com/fda-compliance-considerations-for-your-kombucha-label" target="_blank">this website</a>, any sugar added <em>after</em> fermentation will need to be specifically labeled as &quot;added sugar&quot;.</p>
<p>TL;DR sugar in the drink before fermentation is gone from the final drink.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: The sugars have been eaten already. </p>
<p>Alcohol is produced by fermentation. Fermentation is a fancy word to describe the process of bacteria eating sugar and pooping out alcohols. You can ferment anything with sugar and get different results. </p>
<p>Ferment pure sugar cane and add extra carbonation to the resultant liquid, you've created a spiked seltzer. Ferment grapes, you get wine. Ferment fruit, you get fruit wine (blueberry wine, strawberry wine, peach wine, etc.). Ferment a grain like barely, wheat, or rice and you get beer. Ferment barley and hops together to get an IPA. Ferment honey and you get mead. </p>
<p>You can also further refine the fermented product through distillation to get hard alcohol. For example, if you ferment corn and distil the results you get whiskey. Ferment something high in sugar like potatoes and distil it to get vodka. You can even ferment and distil cacti to get tequila. If instead of adding carbonation you distilled your fermented sugar cane you'd have rum. </p>
<p>That said, the bacteria don't necessarily eat <em>all</em> the sugars. This is easily seen in wine: the difference between a dry wine and a sweet wine is how much fermentation took place. If the bacteria ate all the sugar in the grapes it will be a dry wine, but if they leave some behind it's a sweet wine. This gets into the &quot;no added sugar&quot; thing discussed in other comments, since the sugar in the drink is leftover from fermentation as opposed to added later on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ingredients are not the only thing that goes in. Process is also very important, because certain processes <em>change</em> the basic nature of the ingredients.</p>
<p>The most obvious such process is fermentation. Sugar is eaten by yeast, which produces alcohol.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
