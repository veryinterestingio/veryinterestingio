These girls are always. fucking. stomping. Even as I type this right now at 1 am, they're walking around stomping like god damn Kong with his mighty battle axe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, renter here. My last apartment complex had a replacement cycle where the carpet was expected to last at least 2 years and was changed after every tenancy. New carpet got put in when I moved in, new carpet got put in when I moved out 11 years later. That carpet saw some shit in 11 years. Try as you might to be a neat person, accidents happen. Some grease stains, some cat barf, some wine oopsies, etc. All of that was safely contained to a replaceable surface.</p>
<p>By way of comparison, my brother in law lived with a bad tenant and a whole bunch of cat piss soaked into the floorboards. That was a pretty costly replacement. </p>
<p>Long story short, tenants might prefer hardwood, but it isn't their place, ultimately. Landlords like carpet because it's pretty easily installed according to a more affordable replacement cycle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Carpet makes the apartments quieter, both from foot traffic and by being a decent sound dampener. In the colder areas, it acts as decent temperature insulation as well. Carpet is also easier to maintain than wood floors with our 4-legged animal companions, even with them tearing it up from time to time.</p>
<p>Also, from the perspective of &quot;repair and maintenance&quot; carpet is actually cheaper than wood flooring because if the carpet is really gross--you rip all of it out, give the substrate a spot clean where it is super bad, and then slap more carpet down. Hard wood floors (not tiles/laminate) would take scrubbing/etching/buffing and you can only do that so many times before you can't do that anymore.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it might have todo with costs of turning over a unit. Replacing the carpet is sort of well  known fixed cost. So its easy to bake into the rental costs. When it comes time to turn over the apartment the owners can replace the carpet paint the walls and have what looks like mostly a clean apartment.  Replacing tile, wood, or linoleum wouldn't be possible then you are left with finding someway to rehab the floor and will likely never look as 'clean' or 'new' as fresh carpet as compared to old is. You also have to take into account time more than cost. As time a unit is empty is lost income. So a cheaper flooring that takes longer might not be as cost effective overall.</p>
<p>Fun Fact. Most old linoleum has asbestos in it. Which is really expensive for people to remove, cause .. cancer. But its really only dangerous if you grind it up and inhale it. So don't do lines of coke off the bathroom floor of your cheap apartment and you are good to go.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
