		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you wake up, your body goes through several physiological changes, mostly due to hormone secretions. When you sleep, melatonin levels are high (between 12 and 8am in most people) and makes you sleepy. Melatonin is inhibited by exposure to light, which is why limiting my screen time before bed helps you fall asleep better. </p>
<p>Typically, shortly before you wake up, your anterior pituitary gland secretes a hormone called ACTH or adrenocorticotropic hormone. This travels to your adrenal glands near your kidneys, and makes them secrete hormones like cortisol that brings your body from a sleeping state to a more alert state by increasing your metabolism.</p>
<p>Another hormone change is aldosterone, which plays a role in how your body handles sodium and potassium, and by extension causes water retention. This is what allows you to normally not need to pee at night. If the levels of aldosterone are too low at night, you will produce more urine and your bladder will fill, making you wake up. The levels of aldosterone drop when you wake up to allow water to leave your blood stream again and be made into urine. </p>
<p>When you wake up at night to go to the bathroom, your body secretes hormones to help you be awake enough to function. Those hormones must now be eliminated from your bloodstream before you can sleep again. Luckily there is some leftover melatonin after you go to the bathroom which allows you to go back to sleep once the cortisol has gone.</p>
<p>Edit: you go to the bathroom, not the bloodstream</p>
<p>Second edit: pituitary not pineal</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bright light suppresses a chemical (hormone) called melatonin. Melatonin is the chemical expression of darkness and is produced by your body to signal that it’s night time and time to rest. Therefore, when you are exposed to bright light, your body thinks it’s daytime and you should no longer be resting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you stand up your heart suddenly has to work harder to get blood from your legs and trunk back to your heart and to do that your body releases more epinephrine and norepinephrine. I would guess that also gives your brain a little unwanted pick-me-up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
