		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They use a solid oxide electrolysis cell.<br />
The general principle is the same as if you have a current through water and split it up into oxygen and hydrogen. </p>
<p>It gets a bit more complicated with a gas  you can look at a video of the design <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W82ad0MElZU" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p>The process has been used and tested on earth so it is not a test of the general principle. The test on Perseverance is to show that it survives a trip to mars and then bee on its surface for a long time where it gets exposed for example Martian dust.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The martian oxygen ISRU (MOXIE) takes CO2 from the martian atmosphere (along with a bit of inert gases that are to much of a hassle to remove eg Argon) and produce CO and O2 using some genius porous electrode chemistry. An oxide ion is liberated from CO2 in the process, leaving CO behind with an oxide ion on the electrode surface. The oxide ion is then oxidized to O2 using DC electricity (now using nuclear power, and of course it will use solar power is more sustainable and more industrial operation in the future)</p>
<p>People in the comment section keep saying that the CO released from this reaction is why we cannot quite use this on Earth, but it is ok to release those wastes on Mars. Though this is true, those CO from the reaction will probably be separated for better use in a sustainable martian habitat. For Mar-Earth transport, it has been suggested that a CO/O2 engine could be used so that the fuel and oxidizer required can all be generated from Martian atmosphere by ISRU without using Martian ice. Though in the forseeable future, it is more likely to be used in a theorized altered Sabatier methanation reaction, to turn CO from the MOXIE and H2 from Martian ice electrolysis, into methane and water. The methane along with the O2 previously made from the MOXIE and be used in methalox engines, such as the full-flow combustion methalox Raptor engine that SpaceX is planned on using in the Starship series for Mars-Earth transport.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
