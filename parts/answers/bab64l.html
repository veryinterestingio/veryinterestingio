		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A jungle is a type of forest, though neither term describes a specific biome. </p>
<p>&quot;Jungle&quot; is often used to refer to tropical rainforests, while &quot;forest&quot; is usually used for temperate forests.</p>
<p>Seasonality is the main difference. Temperate forests have winter/spring/summer/fall (or something approximating those), while tropical forests just have wet and dry season. </p>
<p>Here's a page about different forest biomes if you're interested. There are different systems for breaking down biomes, but this is a decently straight-forward one. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Temperate forests occur in eastern North America, northeastern Asia, and western and central Europe. Well-defined seasons with a distinct winter characterize this forest biome. Moderate climate and a growing season of 140-200 days during 4-6 frost-free months distinguish temperate forests.</p>
<p>Tropical forests are characterized by the greatest diversity of species. They occur near the equator, within the area bounded by latitudes 23.5 degrees N and 23.5 degrees S. One of the major characteristics of tropical forests is their distinct seasonality: winter is absent, and only two seasons are present (rainy and dry). The length of daylight is 12 hours and varies little.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Forest/rain forest are technical terms while jungle isn't, but the big difference is that jungle is forest (usually but not always equatorial rainforest) that has been disturbed and is undergoing early succession.  Typically &quot;jungle&quot; is going to be dominated by vines and herbaceous plant species rather than tall woody species. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The easy one word answer is humidity.</p>
<p>Most of the other differences are cause by this. Jungles, or tropical rainforests are found in hotter regions because of evapotranspiration, which is when trees lose water to the air in the way the ocean would evaporate water on a hot sunny day. The water leaves the trees but then just rains back down on the rainforest. This increases the humidity significantly and then all the diverse life and big trees and stuff comes from that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
