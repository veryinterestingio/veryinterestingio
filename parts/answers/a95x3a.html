<ol>
<li>
<p>The question in your post is “is psychopathy categorical or a continuum?” The short answer is that it’s both. There is a trait of personality labeled as psychopathy and people throughout the population express different levels of it. Often times stating (or being observed) that they have some thoughts or behaviors that have been labeled as trait psychopathy, but not others. There is some work suggesting that this subclinical trait like behavior is actually quasicontinuous in nature source: <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jeremy_Coid/publication/5359470_The_distribution_of_psychopathy_among_a_household_population_Categorical_or_dimensional/links/0c9605332f8213769a000000/The-distribution-of-psychopathy-among-a-household-population-Categorical-or-dimensional.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jeremy_Coid/publication/5359470_The_distribution_of_psychopathy_among_a_household_population_Categorical_or_dimensional/links/0c9605332f8213769a000000/The-distribution-of-psychopathy-among-a-household-population-Categorical-or-dimensional.pdf</a> There is also a clinical diagnosis for antisocial personality disorder which is commonly called psychopathy in laymen’s terms, so in those cases it would be categorical.</p>

<p>Your post itself asks whether a person with certain symptoms but not others can still receive a diagnosis. For the vast majority of clinical diagnoses, the answer is yes. Most criteria for the diagnosis of disorders includes a few checklists (along with training and expertise to make sure they are used correctly). Many disorders have a few areas of behavior and symptoms within each area that clinicians are trained to assess. To my knowledge, the majority of disorders do not require all symptoms to be displayed in each area. Instead it might be something like 3 of 5 interpersonal behaviors and 2 of 3 intrapersonal ones along with the almost always required “causes dysfunction”. I couldn’t easily find a reputable source with the DSM-V criteria for Antisocial Personality Disorder, but here is a link to the DSM-IV criteria: <a href="https://psychnews.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/pn.39.1.0025a" target="_blank">https://psychnews.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/pn.39.1.0025a</a></p>
</li>
<li>As another poster pointed out, you’ve called it psychopathy and asked about diagnosis. This is a controversial statement. Many people are very eager to point out that psychopathy as a diagnosis is not included in the DSM and instead you mean Antisocial Personality Disorder. While this is technically true, it is worth noting that many scholars (and clinical researchers) believe that psychopathy deserves a greater focus and assessment as it is not one and the same as Antisocial Personality Disorder. Here is a link to a DSM task force and their recommendation to include a scale assessing the pathological side of psychopathy in the DSM-IV: <a href="https://philarchive.org/archive/HARPAT-27" target="_blank">https://philarchive.org/archive/HARPAT-27</a> Here is a more recent publication discussing the same (although it’s still over 10 years old, this stuff moves slowly): <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/j.1440-1614.2006.01834.x" target="_blank">https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/j.1440-1614.2006.01834.x</a></li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a pretty difficult question. Like most personality traits, you can have some parts and not other parts... By that definition it would exist on a spectrum. Psychopathy as a trait is a cluster of a lot of different component parts. Simply lacking emotional response isn't enough. You also need shallow affect, superficial charm, etc. You need to have enough of the parts to get the title.</p>
<p>This is actually how the psychopathy tests work. They measure you on the component factors and traits that psychopaths have. Once the assessment is complete, you're score is added up and if you're psychopathic enough, you're labelled a psychopath. The irony is that with the PCL-R for example, at 30/40 you're a psychopath but at 29/40 you're not. By the way our tools work you're either psychopathic or not... A binary diagnosis. </p>
<p>For me the answer is pretty clearly binary. Once you hit the magic number you get the label. However it's easy to see others who disagree and say that just because you didn't get the label, doesn't mean you're not psychopathic in many ways. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What you are describing is Antisocial Personality Disorder, not Psychopathy.  Antisocial Personality Disorder is developed through a traumatic childhood, dangerous surroundings, etc. and people with ASPD can have great empathy towards their in-group (such as other gang members) while also mercilessly killing people they don't value.  But they aren't true psychopaths.  Psychopaths are born, not bred, and are incapable of empathy, and just see others as tools to be utilized or thrown away.  One is a learned coping mechanism, one is biological.</p>
<p>There is a lot of confusion on this thread and in general about the difference between ASPD and psychopathy.  Psychopathy isn't in the DSM not so much because ASPD &quot;covers it&quot;, but because the full details of a diagnosis haven't been agreed upon and worked out yet to the satisfaction  of the developers of the DSM, and the DSM is mostly concerned with behaviors - so there is a lot of behavioral crossover in the prison population.  So &quot;Psychopathy is not a diagnosis&quot; is a meaningless answer.  It is studied, researched, and is a useful psychologically agreed upon term, it's just not in the DSM.  That's it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
