		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not a bad question at all, and the answer is fraught with unsolved problems. In short, the answer is: Because for some reason the universe started off at a state of very low entropy, and has been steadily evolving to a state of higher entropy ever since. We have planets and stars and people and the internet because we're living in a time when there is still plenty of free energy (not free as in beer) to be had. That will change, but slowly and over a scale of something like 10^100 years. </p>
<p>Eventually though, assuming current trends continue, and assuming that protons decay, the universe will be a relatively uniform field of photons of a relatively uniform energy/temperature. Nothing will be left, nothing will be left to do anything with, and barring some kind of random fluctuation, that will be that. </p>
<p>We're all just borrowing energy against that day, moving it from here to there, with less and less to show for it, and more and more heat. That is however, not a problem on the order of human lives, or even the likely lifetime of humanity as a species. </p>
<p>You might enjoy this comic based on a Isaac Asimov short story, which more or less asks this question and posits a somewhat fantastical answer:</p>

<p>Edit: HOWEVER... protons may not decay, in which case some atoms would be stable even on very long time scales. It's also possible that the universe will cease its accelerating expansion and being to contract, or that our vacuum will decay. Lots of possibilities for the future exist.</p>
<p>Edit 2: It's great to see so many old and new Asimov fans here. Cheers to all of you!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Why the universe was born with lots of this energy locked in is an ongoing mystery.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everything is tending towards the heat death of the universe. We’re essentially in a metastable configuration right now, where it’s locally stable but not universally stable. Now why that is, that’s more of a philosophical question, which is an argument often used as a logical explanation as to why a god must exist. Somehow, order must have been in the universe at some point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In truest ELI5 fashion &quot;Because we haven't had enough time to get rid of everything.&quot;.</p>
<p>In slightly more sensible reasoning, because on its way towards eventually having nothing in it, there's nothing that prevents localized order from arising because on a large enough viewpoint order decayed further.</p>
<p>One way to put it is a freezer. Inside you can lose/halt/etc entropy by dropping the temperature and freezing everything. However this was achieved by basically moving that entropy somewhere else, the heat that radiates out the back of your freezer. Furthermore, because a system can never be perfectly 100% efficient (or 'worse' a system can never be MORE than 100% efficient) the act of locally reducing entropy actually increases entropy overall. Terrible example: Your freezer might make a given volume cooler by 1 degree, but when it does that it makes a similar volume hotter by 1.1 degrees. </p>
<p>In reality it's a lot more complex then that, but overall the universe and it's gradual march towards entropy doesn't really care that any given location might be reversing its effects because the overall entropy level is always increasing and the act of reversing entropy in one location ALWAYS increases entropy in another, and effectively always increases the total entropy more than if nothing had happened at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
