		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Comas aren't just a form of deep sleep. In fact, sleep is a complex and specific pattern of brain activity that requires a healthy brain to perform it (and just happens to produce unconsciousness as a side effect). Your brain just temporarily switches off consciousness - and various stimuli can make your brain switch it back on. A sufficiently loud noise, a certain amount of physical touch or movement of the body in space, a shot of adrenaline as in your question, etc. will all send signals to that switch and flip it back to the &quot;on&quot; position.</p>
<p>A coma is a <em>lack</em> of activity. The consciousness switch (parts of the ascending reticular activating system) is broken, or the wires leading it to the machinery of consciousness (other parts of the ARAS) are not working, or the machinery itself (cerebral cortex) is hopelessly damaged. This damage can be due to lack of oxygen (suffocation, drowning, opioid overdose, stroke) or due to mechanical injury, but in all cases, the neurons are severely damaged or dead. In some cases a signal can't even get to the ARAS. Even if it can, the ARAS and/or the cortex can't respond like it should. That's the entire reason the coma is happening, and it's the reason that playing Justin Bieber at full blast or jostling the person won't wake them up either.</p>
<p>Tl;dr: a coma is what happens when your on/off switch is broken or disconnected. Trying to hit the on/off switch won't solve the problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Adrenaline, cortisol, and other stimulants are like an alarm. They're a chemical signal that can quickly travel around the body.</p>
<p>People fall into comas for many reasons, but generally increasing the 'wake up' signal won't do anything. It's like a ringing alarm clock for a deaf person.</p>
<p>Most comas are caused by drug overdose of one kind or another. This tends to cause coma through damage to a region of the brain stem called the Ascending Reticular Activating System (ARAS). In particular, synaptic function is impaired. Basically the neurons that form the 'wake up' button lose the ability to talk to each other. Pressing the button harder won't make a difference.</p>
<p>Other times, there's systemic damage to the brain. The 'wake up' button may work, but the stuff it's connected to can't sync up correctly. This is particularly true for damage to the outer layer of the brain - the cerebral cortex - which is where consciousness seems to happen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We use Adrenalin and other stimulants to control heart rate during a coma. A coma is a state in which the reticular activating system of the brain that controls higher level thoughts is not working. Cortisol, adrenaline and such control the vegetative functions of the body. </p>
<p>When someone overdosed on opiates we can give them naloxone which pushes the opiates off of the neurons causing an instantaneous withdrawal and wake up of the patient from the coma.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The thing about comas is that they are a symptom, not a disease. There is some underlying problem that is causing the coma, and artificially rousing the patient will not solve the underlying issue.</p>
<p>In some sorts of coma, you can bring the patient around with stimulants, but it is often dangerous to do so- things like adrenaline increase heart rate and blood pressure, for example. And if the coma is caused by a head injury, this comes with a decent risk of rupturing blood vessels in the brain. This is part of why patients who are comatose due to a head injury are often artificially sedated, to keep blood pressure down and reduce the risk of serious complications or doing further harm to themselves if they wake unexpectedly.</p>
<p>Other times, the brain or nervous system is just too damaged for the drugs to have any effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
