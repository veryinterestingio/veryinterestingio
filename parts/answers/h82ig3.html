		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of, this phenomenon only occurs for a certain kind of plastics. When you deform those by bending or stretching them to the point where they won't revert to their original shape, you induce permanent deformations that change the microstructural organisation of the molecules that the plastic is made of. This causes the formation of voids or very small bubbles in the plastic. Those voids grow in number and size and there comes a point where light starts interacting with thise gaps in a complicated way that make the plastic opaque and seemingly more white.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Complete speculation but on a physical level could it be similar to how water is opaque when it froths/foams? Like some sort of uniform structure being made much more chaotic, so the refractions/reflections are sort of randomized?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a filler that is used for non medical plastics for injection molding that makes the white show up when deformed or bent. This foam is super condensed. Helps in manufacturing when making large quantities to keep raw material cost down</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
