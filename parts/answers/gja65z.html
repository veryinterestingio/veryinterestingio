		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Diplomats are people who travel to other countries and act as representatives of those countries interests. This was very important before the days of telephone or the internet where communication over great distances took a very long time. Messages were slow to exchange and relationships hard to build. Instead of trying to do it from afar a special professional was chosen to build that relationship and look after foreign interests under the direction of their home country.</p>
<p>In order for that to happen there needs to be an agreement that the diplomat won't be legally hassled by the host country. Tossing the diplomat into prison or torturing them until they agree with whatever you want isn't acceptable to the country they represent. This means that minor transgressions are generally overlooked in the interest of diplomacy; if the diplomat parks in the wrong place and would otherwise get a ticket it is just ignored.</p>
<p>Basically the diplomat is &quot;immune&quot; to the normal course of legal process. If the diplomat does something the host country finds unacceptable then the host country will simply kick them out of the country, and potentially the relationship with the country they represent could be damaged. Or the immunity can be revoked with the agreement of the diplomat's home country and the diplomat prosecuted as normal. Broadly though it is a protection against trumped up charges being used as a tool of diplomatic leverage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Former Diplomat here a long time ago. The answers here already have covered the main definitions of immunity but there are a few things I can add.</p>
<p>What I was told was that although we had immunity in the country, it wasn't a get out of jail free card. Any crime we committed in-country was still prosecutable back home under our law. We were told that if we committed any serious crime then we would be immediately brought home and a report would be passed to the police. </p>
<p>Although in my short time with diplomatic immunity I never heard of anyone getting in trouble over this. </p>
<p>The Ambassador also had the legal right to waive immunity under some circumstances (dont remember what these are) so we could still find ourselves imprisoned locally.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Diplomats are official representatives of a country. They're sorta like ambassadors, except ambassadors are usually permanently placed in a single country to continue relations with that country exclusively (also yes ambassadors are diplomats). But a regular ol diplomat could go to pretty much any country on behalf of their sovereign nation.</p>
<p>Diplomatic immunity is a thing to ensure that diplomats can carry out their job safely, even during periods of armed conflict. So let's say the USA and Canada go to war and the USA decides to try offering a truce, they may send a diplomat to Canada to present their terms of truce.</p>
<p>While they have broad immunity to the law in the country they're visiting (within reason), they are likely subject to disciplinary action in their home country if they go flouting those laws, since they're representing the nation and making a fool of it.</p>
<p>This is all because their duties are considered extremely vital, and thus prosecution would hamper it. Imagine if that American envoy to Canada from earlier was detained for being an American, even though he was carrying a document saying that America wanted to try coming to a peaceful resolution to their war!</p>
<p>As for how it came about, its been here since ancient times for the same reasons, to be able to officially interact with other countries, though it could be argued that their role is somewhat diminished with the advent of modern communication systems. Back then was a bit more ad hoc though and not everyone played by the rules. Diplomatic immunity as we understand it today was codified at the Vienna Convention in 1961, with all but a handful of countries agreeing to it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Back in the day, being a diplomat, emissary, or messenger to another country was a pretty risky job - deliver bad news or a declination of war, and they'll cut your head off.  Since it's useful to have people to deliver messages and act as diplomats, a lot of ancient cultures eventually decided that it was better to respect the idea of immunity to these representatives, otherwise nobody would want to do the job.</p>
<p>That's been expanded in the modern age because diplomats, especially those staying long-term in a host country, can become pawns in a big issue.  Imagine that Country A hosts a Diplomat from Country B, and B commits some crime (any crime, doesn't matter) and gets arrested.  Now Country B might say &quot;We don't believe that he committed that crime, you're just lying and arresting him for political reasons.  Release him now, or we'll fight back!&quot;  And things get escalated.  That's a situation that everyone wants to avoid, because it can be abused by either side.  </p>
<p>So the idea is that if you're a diplomat, you're immune from laws, so that we really have no excuse whatsoever to arrest you, whether you committed a crime, or whether we're lying and just trying to hold you hostage.  That stuff just doesn't fly.  Now, if the diplomat <em>does</em> commit a crime, the host country can punish them - they can waive the immunity and let the host country punish them, or they can remove them from their position, etc.  And even if the diplomat's home country doesn't want to waive that immunity (and they often don't), the host country can just say &quot;They aren't welcome here any more, take them home and send a new one.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
