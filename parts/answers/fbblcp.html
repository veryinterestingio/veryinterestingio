		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_flu_pandemic" target="_blank">2009 H1N1 &quot;swine&quot; flu</a> is still here, or at least its descendants are. On the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm" target="_blank">CDC's weekly influenza report</a> you can see that a large fraction of the influenza viruses infecting people right now are of the H1N1pdm09 type. <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0021828" target="_blank">The 2009 H1N1 flu infected infected 10-20% of the world population</a>, causing 150,000â€“575,000 deaths (case fatality rate 0.01-0.08%). </p>
<p>In general, epidemics disappear when the pathogen can no longer find enough susceptible individuals to sustain a chain of transmission. This happens when each new infection goes on to generate, on average, less than one additional infection. Containment can help with this, but mostly it happens when enough people get infected and develop immunity. There's nowhere for the virus to go. Vaccines can help a lot by speeding up the process. Flu is more transmissible in the winter months for a variety of reasons, so the onset of warmer temperatures helps. </p>
<p>Diseases persist year-over-year when (1) there are enough new people (i.e. kids) to keep the number of susceptible individuals high enough, and/or (2) the pathogen evolves to evade existing immunity. Flu does both of these things, which is why we need a new flu vaccine every year.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
