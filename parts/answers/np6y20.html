		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They evolved to deal with conditions that are completely alien to us. As a result, they share very few traits that are recognisable to us.</p>
<p>The animals that we find the most appealing, are usually the ones most similar to what we find cute. Usually, other mammals that are warm, soft, have eyes and expressions that we can imagine we see emotions in.</p>
<p>Deep-sea fish are not that. For instance, there's extremely little light down there. Not enough to really see by as we do. Deep-sea fish tend to have enormous bulbous eyes. Those eyes don't really let them see things but those huge eyes might just be enough to see other fish or animals as they pass overhead and block what extremely little light filters down from the surface.</p>
<p>Noticing that might make the difference between going hungry and catching prey, or spotting a predator and avoiding becoming prey yourself.</p>
<p>The lack of light also means the colour works very differently down there. There's not much point in being colourful if nobody can see you. So many deep-sea fish just have that pallid corpselike absence of colour.</p>
<p>Others are transparent to avoid casting a shadow against the faint glow of light from above. Some fish are bright red as a form of camouflage. Low energy frequencies of light are filtered out first as you descend underwater. That's why things quickly start to look blue-greenish.</p>
<p>Red is the lowest energy frequency of light. So red part of the light spectrum is the most absent in the deep. Without red light to reflect, the colour red is basically invisible. Most deep-sea fish have completely lost the ability to see red.</p>
<p>Speaking of prey. Without sunlight, nothing grows down there. Small animals can survive on marine snow. Basically tiny flakes of organic detritus that constantly come down from above. Slightly larger animals can eat the filter feeders that survive on marine snow. But larger animals like deep-sea fish only have one food source available. Each other.</p>
<p>The deep-sea is essentially a freezing cold, pitch-black desert. Everything is scarce down there, including opportunities to eat. So most deep-sea fish have maws full of long needle-like teeth. Essentially they can't afford to let prey escape. So when they manage to grab prey, those maws full of needles make sure that prey can't slip their grasp.</p>
<p>Deep-sea fish have many other adaptations to deal with the scarcity of food down there. Many fish have enormous mouths so they don't have to pass up on larger prey. Some have incredibly stretchy mouths and stomachs to the point where they can swallow prey that is bigger than they are.</p>
<p>Others develop some truly alien adaptations like little bioluminescent lights to attract prey. Remember how red is essentially invisible down there because there's no red light? There's one predator that has its own bioluminescent red spotlight that allows it to easily find red fish in the dark. And the best part is that since most deep-sea fish can't see red, his spotlight is invisible to other fish.</p>
<p>The weirdness just keeps going. Energy preservation is very important down there so most deep-sea fish are ambush predators that don't swim around much. As such, they don't have the neat hydrodynamic torpedo shapes we usually associate with fish. Many are just sort of shapeless and blobby to help them deal with the pressure.</p>
<p>And they developed many other strange adaptations. When a male angler fish finds a female, he never lets her go. It's very hard to find a mate in the dark emptiness after all. Instead, he bites down on her body and slowly fuses with her to become part of her. The male is nourished by connecting to her bloodstream and slowly wastes away until the male is little more than a pair of gonads attached to the female to provide sperm for her eggs.</p>
<p>Simply put, the deep-sea is a completely alien environment that places very unusual demands on its denizens. They look frightening and alien to us because nothing about them makes sense to us in the context we're used to. Their proportions are bizarre, their eyes are disturbing, their teeth look like a nightmare.</p>
<p>But for them, those are just the tools they need to survive the world they live in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to what others have said: In some cases like the <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/in-defense-of-the-blobfish-why-the-worlds-ugliest-animal-isnt-as-ugly-as-you-think-it-is-6676336/" target="_blank">Blobfish</a>, they actually have a somewhat normal appearance in their extreme deep sea environment under 1800psi of water pressure. When they're brought to the surface at 15psi of atmospheric pressure they turn into a gross blob. You wouldn't look so hot exposed to the vacuum of space either, and that's 120x less of a change in pressure than poor ol' blobby.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part of it is a lack of need for aesthetics that match our own and part of it is that we hardly see them. </p>
<p>They don't have common traits we see on the surface so we see them as otherwordly, there is hardly a point in having good eyesight so their eyes look weird, food is scarce so their bodies look weird, their body doesn't need to adapt to reflect sunlight a certain way so their skin looks weird. These are all factors that make them look different to most animals that live closer to the surface and since they are so rare for a common person to see (meaning not popular in the media) then they catch the eye quickly. </p>
<p>If you think of any animal you can see how weird they can be, giraffes have really long necks and are super tall, elephants have long noses and funny looking ears, whales are super big and breather through their back with some species feeding out of millions of microorganisms a day, chameleons have independent eyes and can change colors, some octopuses can basically blend perfectly with their enviroment by changing their skin, birds can detect magnetic lines to navigate the planet and the wandering albatross can fly for years without ever touching dry land.</p>
<p>But since these are all common and they share some traits with us due to similar living conditions (mostly how we have a need to adapt to sunlight and a way bigger food supply for all) we don't see them as weird because they just look natural. But from an alien's point of view the whole planet is weird.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe its the otherway around. Artist (and now societal) depictions of demons and scary things has been heavily influenced by creatures. Just imagine being in ancient times and seeing a dead sea creature that has washed to shore- its the stuff of nightmares.</p>
<p>Sidenote- depictions of hellish creatures having goat-like features may come from christian painters giving demons the characteristics of the greek god Pan.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It really doesn't help that a lot of the pictures you see are after they've been rapidly decompressed. If you see one at the surface, it's organs have likely exploded and it's features distorted.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
