		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Are you using quantum computers for your quantum communications, or are you communicating between traditional computers using quantum states of particles? </p>
<p>If I understand correctly, it's physically impossible to intercept quantum communications without being detected? And are you using satellite or ground based communication? </p>
<p>Thanks for doing this AMA. I don't think many people are aware of the awesome things you can do with this sort of stuff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>As outsiders, we can't really know exactly what kind of issues you will be facing; what interesting problems in quantum communications do you hope to tackle as you are launching this project? Do you foresee as  many engineering challenges, or more?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
