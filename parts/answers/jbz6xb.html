<p>When the baby comes out, the sudden change of environment and temperature causes the body to begin its first inhalation. The lungs expand, blood flow to the lungs increases, and the fluid is absorbed. The first breathe is raspy because the fluid is still there; but the lungs were never full of it, so the expanding space is filled with fresh air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alright here’s a very simple explanation. The placenta is what brings oxygen from mom to baby through baby’s umbilical cord (that’s where their belly button is) instead of through the lungs. When baby is inside mom, blood that has oxygen in it goes to the heart where it gets pumped out to the rest of the body. In you and me, there’s a little door that has a tunnel between the right side of the heart and the lungs. Our blood that needs oxygen goes through that tunnel to the lungs and then comes back through another tunnel to the left side of the heart, where it gets pumped out to the rest of the body. </p>
<p>In an unborn baby, the little door between the right side of the heart and lungs is closed and the pressure behind the door is very high. It’s too hard for blood to get through it, so it goes around through another secret little door to the left side of the heart. When a baby is born, there is a big shift in pressure behind that little door. When a baby takes its first breath, the secret little door slams shut. It’s kind of like when a door slams shut because of wind. When that secret little door slams shut, the pressure behind the door to the lungs gets lower, and that door gets unlocked. Now, the blood in the right side of the heart can go through that little door to the lungs where it picks up oxygen, goes to the left side of the heart, and then gets pumped through the rest of the body.</p>
<p>When baby is inside mom, the lungs still get a little bit of blood to them, but they aren’t the primary place where gas exchange takes place (where oxygen and carbon dioxide move in and out). They’re working on growing and producing a slippery soap-like substance called surfactant. The surfactant helps keep tiny air sacs called alveoli open and from sticking shut. The alveoli are where gas exchange takes place, otherwise known as how oxygen and carbon dioxide move in and out of your body. When the baby is born, that pressure change and sudden blood volume to the lungs and alveoli causes gas exchange to happen, and that’s how baby now breathes and gets its oxygen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Elevated carbon dioxide in the blood is what gives you the urge to breathe, and as long as they're connected to the umbilical cord that shouldn't happen.  Once they're out they start to accumulate CO2 for the first time in their life, and that makes them try inhaling for the first time.  (During birth, a hormone - oxytocin, I think - makes them insensitive to the CO2 stimulus so it's very rare for them to start too early.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
