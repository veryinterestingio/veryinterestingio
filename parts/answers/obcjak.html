		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Earthbound on SNES first checked region, if the console was pal you got an error screen. </p>
<p>It then checked cartridge SRAM (space for save games) as copied cartridges often had more so they can accommodate any games that came with extra SRAM. If more than 8KB is detected you get a different error screen that yells at you for software piracy. </p>
<p>If you patch out the SRAM check there is another measure that checks to see the SRAM verification was completed. If it was not the game boots but the spawn rate for random enemies is cranked way up and the overworld is super annoying because you’re getting random encounters constantly </p>
<p>There’s then a few other checks but I don’t think anyone knows if they actually change anything in the game or whatever. However, if you patch these all out the game will run BUT on the final boss it will crash and delete all your saves</p>
<p>The problem with answering this question is that these methods are obviously obfuscated by design. The even bigger issue is that it’s constantly evolving so there are probably dozens of applicable answers. It’s also evolving in multiple ways; the natural evolution of technology and the cat and mouse game of figuring out how to break it, figure out how they broke it, repeat. </p>
<p>Modern copy protection like denuvo is infinitely more complex then the basic checks outlined above, probably. There’s some info on how it works out there but it’s very inconsistent and usually anything remotely specific is posted anonymously because obviously denuvo doesn’t want you to know how it works. Based on what I’ve read it involves a custom virtual machine that uses an obfuscated instruction set to make decompilation more difficult. This part is way beyond me so I can’t speak to whether it is accurate</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many different ways to do it. With most PC games, the checks are usually done through the platform that the game is published on. If the game can't contact the platform (e.g. Steam, Origin, and so on), then obviously something is up.</p>
<p>You can also have a sort of 'overseer'. If you have genuine checks in the game, if one doesn't fire, then the player has modified something to make it not work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There have been a few cases where the publisher/developer themselves released a &quot;cracked&quot; copy of their game to distract pirates.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it often ends up in a situation where the cracker thinks they have completely defeated the anti-piracy features of the game, but in reality they haven't.    If they are just able to boot it up and play for a few minutes, they might think they have been successful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think a good amount are released from the devs like the other user said.. Mirror's Edge had this. If your game was pirated, you would slow down drastically as you approached any ledge you needed to jump from (in a parkour-based game). Game Developer Tycoon (is the name I think?) did as well, where their pirated version contained an event that always occurred where, in-game, pirates would steal your software and tank your profits and company. When people wrote to complain, the devs received them with grins, knowing the pirates were outing themselves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
