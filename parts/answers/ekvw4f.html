		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Glasses refocus light to correctly hit misshapen eyes. Each person, sometimes each eye, will have different corrections that need to be made. If a &quot;normal&quot; sighted person wears someones prescription glasses everything will look distorted.</p>
<p>The lenses in a VR set also refocus light, but are designed to simulate distance rather than correct for eye shape. Wearing your glasses or contacts with the vr headset will add the corrections needed for your eyes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>VR headsets have unglasses (like glasses but the opposite) so that normal vision people feel like they're looking far away.</p>
<p>So then you have to wear glasses to get it closer again which is what your eyes think is far away.</p>
<p>You could maybe take out the unglasses (lenses) and be fine if you were really really nearsighted (like legally blind from it.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
