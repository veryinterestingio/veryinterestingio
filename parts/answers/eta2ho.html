		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you move fast (and by fast we talk about significant fractions of the speed of light -- 100mph isn't &quot;fast&quot; here), there are 2 things that happen:</p>
<p>- for you, you experience time moving at the same rate you always experience time.  The second hand on your watch would still tick once a second.</p>
<p>- for someone else who is standing still watching you, they see your time as going much slower than their time.  If they could see your watch, the second hand would be moving much slower.</p>
<p>The faster you go, the slower your time appears to an observer looking at you.</p>
<p>Interestingly, when you look at the person who is standing still, you will see their time as moving much slower too -- if you could see their watch, the second hand would also be going slow.  This is because, from your perspective, you are completely still and they are moving very fast.  (This is relativity)</p>
<p>Time, speed, and relativity are interesting, but very strange, phenomena.</p>
<p>One consequence of this is that anything that travels at the speed of light (a photon, for example) basically experiences no time passing.  So a photon that leaves a star 100 light years away would take 100 years to get here, as we would observe that photon.  From the photon's perspective, no time passed at all!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The speed of light is constant (in a constant medium).</p>
<p>If we were able to be an observer on an object traveling at half the speed of light and we were to turn on a flashlight in the direction we were going, it would appear that the light traveled away from us at the speed of light.  We might assume that to a stationary observer the light leaving the flashlight would appear to travel at 1.5 times the speed of light.  But this would be impossible because the speed of light is constant and can't be exceeded.  </p>
<p>The thing that has to alter to keep the speed of that light constant for all observers is time.  Our time would pass differently than the time of the stationary observer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the answers here are explaining why time is relative in an observation of events sense, which isn't what the OP is going for. I assume they want to know about the theory of relativity, so I'll give it a go:  </p>
<p>Imagine you're driving a car at 30mph, and another car overtakes you at 60mph. Common experience tells us that someone standing stationary at the side of the road will observe the overtaking car going at 60mph, whereas from your perspective it is going at 30mph.  </p>
<p>Now imagine that you are driving a car at 30mph (13.4m/s) and your shine a light. From your perspective the light is travelling at the speed of light ( 299 792 458 m/s). Common experience tells us that the person at the side of the road will see that light travelling at 30 mph + the speed of light (299 792 471 m/s). But that doesn't happen, both observers see the light travelling at the exact same speed (299 792 458 m/s). Einstein's theory says that the speed of light can never be broken no matter what frame of reference you measure it from. That means if someone is another car travelling at half the speed of light, the light shone is still travelling at 299792458 m/s relative to them.  </p>
<p>So how does this work? Well, speed is distance over time - so for speed to be fixed distance or time have to change within your frame of reference. Turns out both do depending on your reference frame. But for the car, time slows down relative to the guy who is stationary. The effect is very negligible until you reach speeds close to the speed of light.  </p>
<p>It's not just a theory, it's been verified using atomic clocks.  </p>
<p>As to how/why this works? I have no clue, I'm not sure anyone does.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, the speed of light is a constant. I’m not sure that ELI5-ing the reason for this is possible, beyond just saying that photons have a mass of zero. Anyway, say you build a clock that abuses this. It’s a tube with mirrors on the ends with a single photon inside of it, bouncing up and down. It measures an exact time based on the amount of bounces of the photon, since you know how long it is. This is all well and good.</p>
<p>Now, say you’ve got 2 people. One of them stands still, and the other puts the clock in his truck and speeds away. To the stationary observer, each time the light bounces, it has to move at a diagonal to reach where the other mirror will be as it moves. Diagonals are longer than straight lines, and the speed of light is constant, so the clock is now runny slow to the stationary observer. However, to the observer in the truck, the clock is relatively at rest, and the rest of the world is moving. For him, the light doesn’t have to take a diagonal, so his clock reads like it’s still correct, not slow. So, when the driving observer experiences as a second, the stationary observer will experience more than a second. In general, an observer that is moving and eventually stops will have experienced less time than someone who was still during this period.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You measure time by seeing it fly.</p>
<p>Suppose there is a light in your living room. It is off. You turn it on, and you suddenly travel away from it at the speed of light. Just after you leave, someone shuts the light off.</p>
<p>That someone will see the light was on only for a couple seconds.
For you, the light will always be on (the image of when the light was on is traveling at speed of light, so are you).</p>
<p>Time is relative!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
