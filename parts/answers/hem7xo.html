		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They could not. They had to rely on guards or other citizen to recognize them. For a small relm this was not a big problem as most people knew about each other. However there are plenty of criminals who just ended up changing their name and fled to another part of the country where they were not as recognized. Even returning home when people had forgotten about them and continued living out the new identity. But this in itself was a punishment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm assuming it was more based around a punishment that would be ascribed to somebody who was discovered. It's probable that many people were never discovered and re-entered their own societies, but just having to live knowing that there would be a punishment if you were ever discovered is a pretty big deterrent. it's like most justice, lots of people get away with committing the crime and the few who do not are punished as an example.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
