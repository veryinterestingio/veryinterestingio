		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: no one knows. </p>
<p>Longer answer:
First of all, REM is a bit of a misnomer. The eye movements during REM are actually slower than while you're awake - they're just much faster than in non-REM sleep.</p>
<p>There are two main ideas as to what's going on.
The things you see in dreams are obviously not based on images from your eyes. These images are built in the visual centres of your brain though. During normal vision, there's constant feedback to the eyes from the visual centres to help with following something you're interested in, focus, and so on. Even though the eyes aren't sending much information to the brain, the brain doesn't stop sending feedback to the eyes based on the images it's made up. </p>
<p>This might be the cause of REM. It makes sense, but it's not perfect. People who were born blind still move their eyes (if they physically can) during REM, in a way that doesn't match their eye movements when awake. Keep in mind that your eye nerves are directly plugged into the visual centres of your brain. Most of the rest of your body goes via the spinal chord and brain stem.</p>
<p>There's also the idea that the REM phase of sleep might be for actively processing memory. In this view, your brain is playing back memories kind of like a tape, and your eyes are playing back the movements that went with those memories. This could be a side-effect, or it could actually help in processing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The muscles controlling your eye movements are controlled by nerves that belong to the so-called cranial nerves, which emerge directly out of the brain instead of going through the spinal cord in some fashion or other like the rest of motoneurons.</p>
<p>As such the sleep paralysis that happens to all of us in deep REM that is supposed to prevent you from falling out of bed if you, for example, start running in your dream, doesn't affect the muscles controlling your eye movement. So if you look around in your dream your eyes are mimicking that motion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
