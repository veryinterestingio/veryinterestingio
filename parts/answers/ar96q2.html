		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They do drown the sharks. Unlike most fish, a good deal of species of sharks have rigid gills. This means that they can’t flap their gills to pass the water over them, so they need to maintain constant motion in order to breathe. This is called an “obligate ram ventilator”. As soon as no fresh water is able to pass over the gills, the oxygen in the water around the shark is depleted and they suffocate. There are some sharks who have spiracles, which are basically two little breathy holes right above their eyes. You can see these same holes on the backs or stomachs of rays, the shark’s close relatives. These can be used to pump air over the gills, so no constant motion must be maintained. Other sharks use the buccal method to respire, where they use their mouth as a pump. This is why you will see some sharks constantly opening and closing their mouths while stationary.
Anyway, the video you’re referring to happened at an aquarium. The shark was a spiny dogfish shark, which does have spiracles, but is a relatively small shark. The giant North Pacific octopus which attacked it is, well, giant. The people in the aquarium put up cameras to see what was happening, because multiple dogfish sharks were dying, which suggests this is a very successful hunting mechanism of the octopus. In the video, you can see that the octopus wraps their tentacles primarily around the head of the shark. Thus, the spiracles are covered, and the gills are stationary. Boom- suffocation. Don’t mess with a big boy octopus!

<p>EDIT: since there have been a ton of questions about this, I’ll tell you how sharks sleep while remaining in motion. The answer is that they, like dolphins and whales, sleep half of their brain at a time. One half sleeps, the other swims. Then switch. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to targeting vulnerable body parts (like the gills) as other posters have stated, octopi also have a powerful beak that can slice through flesh, cartilage and bone with ease. They're very much capable of just chewing the shark open too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
