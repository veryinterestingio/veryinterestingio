		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Couple things to address in this question...</p>
<p>As many have stated, raising the core body temperature is a hallmark of the body's immune response to an infection. The reason your body does this is because to an extent, it does help your immune cells fight off the virus or bacteria while also making it less hospitable for the germs as well.</p>
<p>Now, what does it mean to have a fever....Your brain normally has an internal thermostat set to 98.6 F (37 C to the rest of the world). If you get too warm, you sweat (the sweat evaporates and cools you off) and when you're too cold, you shiver (muscle contractions to general heat). When that thermostat is adjusted to a higher temp in the case of a fever, it essentially confuses the rest of your body. It's important to realize when it comes to core temp, your body is very fickle...even a single degree or two change can make you feel very unwell...shakes/chills/sweats/etc. </p>
<p>A fever is when your internal thermostat is adjusted to a higher temp, say 100F. That new set point can be rather confusing to the rest of your body. You may feel the urge to wrap up because your chilly and shivering but then a second later feel warm and sweaty...most likely a lot of back and forth.</p>
<p>As I and many others mentioned, an elevated temperature can help your immune system but it also hurts your body. For one, it makes you feel awful (see last paragraph) but it can cause actual cell damage and lead to complications such as seizure (very bad) if the fever gets too high. </p>
<p>Now I'd like to address the question of should we take medicine to curb the fever/will that make the infection worse. Over the counter drugs like tylenol (acetaminophen) or those in the class of NSAID (advil aka ibuprofen or aleve aka naproxen to name a few) can be used bring down a fever. It is generally accepted by the medical community that the risks a fever can impose outweighs the small benefit it make have in helping fight the infection. Your immune system is an incredibly sophisticated, complex network that will keep fighting with our without a fever. </p>
<p>Hope this helped clear some things up...I know this is ELI5 and probably got a little long-winded but I did my best to keep from getting too technical. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Virus no like being warm. Virus cannot live while being too warm. Body make warm. Warm kill virus</p>
<p>Oh wait this isnt explainlikeimacaveman</p>
<p>Virus cannot live in your body when you become overheated, neither can your body, but it can last longer than the invading virus can. So when your body detects there's no more virus or little remaining it doesnt have to overheat to kill it, so you feel better</p>
<p>Edit: before people start commenting, overheating isn't the only way your body fights off a virus, it's just a big one: make your environment unfavourable for the virus to live/propagate</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well since the top comment stereotypically missed the point of this sub:</p>
<p>Perspiration has nothing to do with making you feel better, though it does occur obviously.</p>
<p>Your body creates the fever in response to sickness in an attempt to cook out the virus/bacteria detected.</p>
<p>Wrapping up to make yourself even warmer helps your body do that better. </p>
<p>It’s also called “breaking a fever”. </p>
<p>Edit: since I don’t feel like replying 6 times:</p>
<p>Yes, this is called breaking a fever.  Your fever “breaks” in response to destroying whatever virus/bacteria that was affecting you, and you begin to feel better. </p>
<p>No, obviously, this isn’t exactly viable for someone who has a chronic condition which causes them to produce a fever constantly.  </p>
<p>No, OBVIOUSLY do NOT do this if you are deathly sick with a fever.  This works for common cold or flu, if you’re already sitting at 104 degrees, fucking obviously, OBVIOUSLY, do not add to it. </p>
<p>As for the rest of the questions I’ll pass on what I pass on to boots: </p>
<p>What do you think? That’s the answer. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I feel like you might be missing part of the question. The top answer about the body's thermostat is essentially correct. However a lot of times you may wake up with a fever, take aspirin/Tylenol/ibuprofen, then go back in bed, only to have your fever break and thermostat be adjusted back down, and now you're covered in sheets and your body sweats a lot to try to cool you down to your non-fever temperature. You also feel better because, well, you no longer have a fever. Is that what you're asking?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
