		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>SPF 15 is the lowest to be considered sunscreen. It blocks 93% of UV light. The skin is capable of naturally stopping a little UV light. So that is sufficient to get the job done, maybe give you a little tan.</p>
<p>SPF 30 stops 97%</p>
<p>SPF 50 stops 98%</p>
<p>SPF 100 stops 99%</p>
<p>Edit: Different strengths are developed because different skin tones require different levels of protection. The skin produces melanin that is basically our own natural sunscreen. The more melanin you produce the darker your skin. When UV light is detected it triggers melanin production which gives you a tan. If you want that then you use a lower strength sunscreen that let's in enough UV to trigger melanin production. If you dont want that then you use a stronger sunscreen. High SPF sunscreen is for those with very fair skin that dont produce much melanin leaving them highly susceptible to sun burns.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sunlights also has an important function. E.g. vitamin D production in the skin. So you just want a barrier that is strong enough so you don’t get burned, but not block it out completely.  Some doctors also say that the warnings from dermatologists are biased, as they see a lot of ppl with skin cancer (it’s their job), but healthy ppl never go there. Without sun you would develop other problems, which a dermatologist wouldn’t treat, so the side-effects of no sun are hidden.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As has been said, vitamin D is a factor. Mainly though, people like to have a tan, so they wear less protection. I think it's pretty dumb, but lots of people would rather risk burning and get a tan rather than wearing a high factor all the time.</p>
<p>Also, lower factors can be cheaper and nicer to apply. So people use a lower factor when they think they can get away with it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most American sunscreens also may mostly protect against UVB but not UVA rays, which penetrate deeper into the skin. Both types of rays are harmful. <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/sunscreens/best-sunscreens-of-the-year/" target="_blank">More on that here</a>. </p>
<p>Many Japanese and Korean sunscreens protect against both UVA and UVB. There's a ton of great international options out there you can get shipped in that offer full protection, aren't thick, and don't leave a chalky white layer behind when they dry. </p>
<p>My fav is the Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence Sunscreen SPF50+ PA++++.</p>
<p>Happy sunning!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To piggyback off OP’s question, what about people with more melanin in their skin, and why are the rates of skin cancer lower in those areas such as the Mediterranean than in the US?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
