		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Great Lakes Basin feeds Niagara Falls. It covers an area larger than the UK and holds 85% of North America's fresh surface water (18% of the world's). With that huge a bathtub, the flow out the drain will remain quite consistent through periods of extended dry or wet weather, especially if that weather is just affecting a portion of the region.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because so many bodies of water over such a vast distance lead to it. This means that it would have to not rain over a huge area for a really long time for the supply of water leading to the waterfall to dry out.</p>
<p>A waterfall that has less tributaries will dry out much more readily. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Its neat to go in the dead of winter.  Much quieter (people) and really cool to see everything frozen over.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
