<p>The sharpness in cheese is due to the aging process. As time goes on, enzymes that are added to the cheese (or found naturally in the milk) break down sugars into mild acids (short chain fatty acids) which have a more tangy taste. Over time, bacteria can convert these into even more interesting flavors. Basically, by aging cheese you go from sweet, to tangy, and as the aging goes on the flavors can mellow or become more pronounced depending on the type of cheese. (If anyone wants, i have dozens of scientific articles about bacterial and fungal compositions of cheeses. My family has been making cheese for a few hundred years, but I'm a nerdy med student, so i love the science behind it.) Also, if anyone wants a more in depth explanation, i can do that too. :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People seem to be not really answering the question.  The sharpness of cheese is really a measure of the peptides in the cheese.  Peptides are molecules that are formed when the cheese is aged.  These peptides have a particular sharp bitter umami flavor and the longer the cheese is aged the more of these peptides form.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the UK it ranges from mild (rubbery texture, little flavour) to extra mature (crumbly, crystalline texture, strong tangy flavour). If cheese crumbles when you cut it, then it's good cheese.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
