		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doctor here. </p>
<p>The short answer is that we don’t just focus on LDL. We instead focus on your age, ethnicity, gender, whether you have known heart disease, whether you are a smoker, whether you are diabetic, family history, other medical conditions, blood pressure, total cholesterol, HDL, and LDL. </p>
<p>In the US, the American Heart Association puts out new guidelines every few years based off all the evidence for heart disease. These guidelines advise doctors on what the best practice is for a given condition. With regards to heart disease, they recommend assessing the various things above and prescribing according to how the patient scores in each area. </p>
<p>As of the 2018 guidelines, the AHA recommends measuring coronary calcium calcium when it is unclear whether or not the patient is at increased risk of heart disease. This makes sense from a practice standpoint. After all, if we already know that you need a statin, you spend your time and money and get dosed with radiation is pointless if at the end we are just going to start you on a statin no matter what. And if we already know you don’t need a statin, having you do a test to confirm you don’t need it is also a waste. </p>
<p>In other words, when you have a cheap test that gives you 80% of the information you want to know and a more expensive/invasive test that gives you 90%, it makes more sense to do the cheap test first 100% of the time and then only do the more expensive test the 10% of the time where it will actually make a difference. The other 90% of the time, the test does not actually change your treatment, so it’s a waste.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>LDL cholesterol is measured with a cheap blood test.  Coronary Artery Calcium is measured by a CT scan, which is an expensive test, produced by a series of X-rays.  This also involves a significant amount of radiation exposure.  </p>
<p>I hope that a better system for funding for health care is on the horizon, but that will not involve giving every patient every expensive test.  Cheap screening tests are still essential.</p>
<p>Beyond all of that, the generally accepted theory is that LDL is <em>causing</em> atherosclerosis, and the calcium is the <em>result</em> of it.  We care about both, but in different ways.  If you're moderately overweight at age 20, you will almost certainly have a low calcium score, but high HDL would indicate that long term heart disease risk is elevated even beyond what weight suggests.  If you're 40, and you've improved your diet, the HDL will give an indication of whether that lifestyle change is effective.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Explained like you’re 5: If you’re trying to avoid something, you care about your direction (LDL) and how close you are to it (CCS). </p>
<p>Explained like you’re 20: Heart attacks are most frequently caused by lipid rich plaques. The lipid comes from LDL, builds up in your arteries, and calcifies. Once it’s calcified enough, it can easily be picked up on CT scan. At this point, you’re farther along in your progression toward getting heart disease. The prediction is better because of how much closer that relationship is. You still want to avoid getting that far along, because it’s practically impossible to un-fuck your arteries once they’re clogged. All you can do is avoid furthering the damage, and help your heart work more efficiently with cardiopulmonary conditioning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
