		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two types of touch screens. Resistive and Capacitive. Resistive types are the ones you see on DSs, old palm pilots and PDAs and credit card machines. They use a Grid of lines to detect when the two resistive mats have been pressed together, these are also the type that typically use hard styluses. These screens will react to any pressure placed on them.</p>
<p>The type most commonly found on phones and laptops is capacitive. It uses the capacitance (your finger interacts with the electric field beneath the glass and causes a signal) these screens require an electrically conductive “stylus” like your finger or those pens with the funny domed end. The reason it reacts to mainly your finger is because your finger is just “the right amount” of conductive to trigger the screen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just like to drop some extra knowledge. There are actually many different touchscreen technologies. It isn't <em>just</em> capacitive or resistive, though they account for the vast majority of touchscreens. </p>
<p>Occasionally, I have to deal with surface acoustic wave touchscreens. I believe they pickup changes in how sound waves resonate through the screen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>screens are capacitive, meaning they have an electrical current/field running through them, and when something &quot;meaty&quot; touches them, the change in voltages on that spot tells the computer what coordinates were touched (water would work too, but it's less precise).   When capacitive screens were new, I remember reading that South Koreans would use little stylus shaped sausages on cold days because they couldn't touch screens with their gloves (then they could eat the sausages).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
