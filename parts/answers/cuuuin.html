		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Back then, broadcasters were more stringent with their requirements for people whose voices they chose to put on the air. In the UK especially, any accent other than standard, plain English - Received Pronunciation, as it's known, the type of English the queen uses - was considered a sign of unintelligence. The reason everyone sounded the same is that they were hand-picked specifically for their voice type.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question,  but while people have been focusing on broadcasts I notice the accent or dialect change even in home videos and personal recordings from the past. Or shots of regular people.  Even if from the same location you can almost tell the decade by the way they sound, word choice aside.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had voice training back in the day. People were taught to enunciate very clearly because audio equipment wasn't that great or was simply unavailable. Think about how Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan Kenobi says, &quot;Never will you find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.&quot; Every letter of every syllable is distinctly audible, and the cadence helps make it easy to understand as well. This technique can allow a performer to be heard from the stage all the way to the back row without a microphone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The midatlantic/transatlantic accent has been discussed to death, but every day people also had a distinct way of talking that had nothing to do with the transatlantic accent.</p>
<p>Part of it was that pop culture from the 80s on created voices, with the “valley girl” probably being the most distinct, which was emulated and adopted by young impressionable kids and we’ve lived through different permutations of that.</p>
<p>This video of <a href="https://youtu.be/jP1Nkr1kc5o" target="_blank">Sandy Meisner teaching an acting class</a> is a pretty good example. I feel like everyone just talked softer. They go up at the end of their phrases a lot. It almost sounds flirtatious. I’ve always wondered about it too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They actually still teach this style of speaking in some colleges for oration and communication classes. It’s also taught in certain call centers for “non-regional” dialect so that people can curb poor English habits. They show videos of old programs from the 50’s, 60’s and 70’s as examples.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
