		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer, we don’t make as much money as they did.
Slightly longer answer: US household median income in 1970 was $9,780 which has a buying power of $64,700 in today’s money. The current median US wage is 61,800, about $3,000 less or effectively 5% less money available per year than they did.
Next, median home sale price in 1970 was $23,600 or $155k in today’s dollars. The median sale price in Jan 2018 was $330k; double what they were paying ‘back in the day.’
So, you have to spend on average 25-50% more money to get a home with 5-10% less money.
This is all due to wage stagnation relative to productivity and inflation. Or otherwise said, wages did not keep up with the cost of goods and your dollar just doesn’t go as far.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In California there are 2 specific things they have done, Prop 13 and refusing to allow houses to be built. </p>
<p>Prop 13 froze their property taxes (with incredibly small yearly increases), so their taxes are subsidized by charging new buyers many multiples more in taxes than what they pay. </p>
<p>They also don't allow new houses to be built. So while they sponge off young people and don't pay their fair share of property taxes, non-rich young people can't buy houses at all. Because they've limited supply, housing prices have skyrocketed. </p>
<p>They don't pay their fair share now, and will sell for great profits when they decide to leave. All the while, squeezing the life blood out of young people in both taxes, and rent, and preventing them from having a permanent stake in the community. </p>
<p>The greatest generation gave birth to the greediest generation. </p>
<p>Edit: Put wrong prop number, like an idiot. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a nutshell, they have used the housing market as a safe investment and turned it into a giant self sustaining bubble. There is no significant shortage of houses, but it does not matter how many you build if the wealthy buy up starter homes and develop them for maximum profit. It's outright exploitation of the young &amp; less wealthy, but it is socially acceptable exploitation.</p>
<p>The end result is that those joining the ladder for the first time are paying a massive premium for no other reason than they got on the ladder later, paid to those who have created the artificial scarcety. Renting used to be a way to save money, now the average rental cost in the UK exceeds the mortgage cost, so those not born to money are effectivly punished with higher living costs.</p>
<p>The worst part of all of this is even if we change borrowing rules to prevent property being as insanely attractive as it is right now, those hit the hardest by a bubble collapse will be the ones who just got on the ladder.</p>
<p>Many of the generation before them considered the practice abhorrent. The seller of my parents first property refused to allow them to pay what the house was worth then, because the idea of a young family having to work <em>a decade</em> to pay off a house repulsed him. I can only imagine that banding together and living on a shoestring during the world war was antithetical to the currently worshipped attitude of &quot;fuck everyone else, I'm getting mine&quot;. A number of the elderly in my town used to rent homes out at significantly below market value to young people (particulally young families), but over time most of these have been inherited and bumped up to full price.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blaming a generation is simplistic thinking. Blaming boomers for ruining housing is as silly as blaming millennials for killing Blockbuster Video. The world changes, people adapt no matter their age.</p>
<p>There are several factors that have made the cost of housing go up. The main one is the amount of land is fixed and the population is increasing. There is still lots of cheap rural housing, but nobody wants to live rural anymore. In 1950's America, 12% of the labour force worked on farms. Now it's under 2%. </p>
<p>20% of the population lives in 97% of the land. The other 80% of the population is trying to squeeze into 3% of the land. That's why prices are going crazy.</p>
<p>Other issues include the stock market hasn't been doing great, so people are investing into real estate. This includes foreign investors, 7% of American property buyers are now foreign. </p>
<p>In response to increasing property values, governments responded by changing laws to make it easier to get mortgages. This actually makes things worse by inflating prices even more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Millennials were sold a bill of goods that they could never succeed without a college degree. Now they are drowning in debt, but the out of touch politicians blame avocado toast!</p>
<p>I’m a near the end boomer (born early 60’s), but my husband and I put our three millennials through college. They have loans but not too much, but we ended up using a lot of home equity to get them through.  So I guess that make us worse off now, nearing retirement age, than our own greatest generation parents </p>
<p>PS why do we need labels?  It seems so adversarial</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
