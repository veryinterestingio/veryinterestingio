		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It seems to me you are asking two distinct questions</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do quantum computers perform calculations?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Calculations are achieved by the application of <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/quantum/qmoper.html" target="_blank">operators</a> on quantum states. These can be applied to the entire superposition at once without breaking it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How can you retrieve information without collapsing the superposition?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As has been correctly answered by /u/Gigazwiebel below, you cannot retrieve information without collapsing the superposition. This is why quantum algorithms are so clever and so hard to design, by the time of measurement your superposition should be in a state so that it gives the correct answer some high probability of the time when measured.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Even if somehow you managed to measure the whole superposition without breaking it (which of course is against the laws of quantum mechanics), you would be restricted by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holevo%27s_theorem" target="_blank">Holevo's bound</a>, which says you can only retrieve n classical bits of information from n qubits.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This video on Deutsch's Algorithm might be of use to you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xsyx-aNClM" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xsyx-aNClM" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xsyx-aNClM</a></a> . It will hopefully allow you to see the role of superposition in one of the first algorithms formulated that demonstrates the edge quantum scaling can have over classical computation. Superposition allows all possible states to be calculated on at once, but as others have said performing measurements will collapse the superposition. If you're really interested in quantum computation, head to IBM's quantum experience <a href="https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/qx/experience" target="_blank"><a href="https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/qx/experience" target="_blank">https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/qx/experience</a></a> . Not only does it give you a good overview of quantum computing, you can have a go at building your own circuits and running them on one of IBM quantum computers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The quantum computer will at least once, at the end of the computation, collapse the superposition. Some algorithms may also collapse parts of the computation as an intermediate step. The end state of the collapsed qbits depends on all possible computation paths from start to end, so that the outcome can be non-classical, similar to the case where a photon in the double slit experiment produces an interference pattern, because it went through both slits at once.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you want to <em>retrieve</em> information from you quantum computer then you <em>do</em> want to make a measurement and turn your quantum state into a classical description of that state that has the answer you're interested in in it.  </p>
<p>Generally, you start with a classical thing (the problem you want to solve), you encode your input in some way onto your quantum system, and then do some quantum operations on the system (entangling operations, some rotations, etc.), and then at the end measure a classical outcome.  Depending on the algorithm in question the measurement at the end might give a (up to errors) deterministic answer, or it might give one of several answers with some probability.  </p>
<p>The measurement in general will screw up the quantum system and it will need to be reinitialised.  In my own field, for instance, the measurement is to literally detect the photons, which then stop existing.  We then make another quantum state to do the next calculation....</p>
<p>Is that clear?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
