		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Popcorn pops because of steam pressure. The inside of the kernel contains starch and water, which are contained in a hard shell. When you heat it, the starch liquifies and the water turns to steam. When the steam pressure gets high enough, the shell explodes, the starch instantly solidifies, and the corn is popped. </p>
<p>If the shell is broken, steam won’t build up. Bad kernel</p>
<p>If it is too dried out, not enough pressure will build up. Bad kernal</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In my experience usually it's because they don't get hot fast enough and so the shell just cracks letting all the steam out and they never explode. The best way to get around this is to heat the pan with the oil in it to about 350° and then put all the kernels in. This way you have very few old maids left at the bottom.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All the kernels have different amounts of water inside. Water heating causes popping. Some kernels don't get as much heat as others, some have less water. Too cold, or too dry, no popping.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Popcorn kernels pop because they absorb heat energy until they reach a critical level and pop.  When there are lots of unpopped kernels, most of the heat energy gets absorbed by the kernels.  But when most of the kernels have popped, less energy gets taken in by kernels.  The heat levels haven't gone down though, so the excess heat energy goes into the already popped kernels more and more.  At a certain point the popped kernels start to burn.  Since you don't want burnt popcorn, you stop the cooking before that happens.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
