<p>Ideally for customers, 2 gas stations in, you would want to locate them where the furthest anyone on the west side of the city to gas station 1 is the same distance as the furthest customer on the east side of the city has to drive to gas station 2.  Each gas station has an equal share of customers, but if gas station 2 decides to move to the geographical center gas station 2 gets all the original customers plus part of gas station 1's customers.  It's the best for the customers if they are equally spread out, but not the best for the businesses if competition is strong.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is the end result of businesses trying to claim the biggest market share for themselves.</p>
<p>To simplify things, of you consider a long road with a restaurant at reach end - the two restaurants are distinct, and if customers generally stick to the closest restaurant, they share the available pool of people 50/50.</p>
<p>If one restaurant wants to increase their market share, they could move into the centre of the road, so when the customers head to the closest restaurant, they end up splitting 75/25. This means that the other restaurant would need to put themselves in the centre too so they can even out the split.</p>
<p>Alteratively, if you have a restaurant at reach end of the road and a third appears, the most sensible place on that road would be centrally, to claim as much market share from the others as possible.</p>
<p>After this you also get further effects such as the fact that once you have a few restaurants, you create an 'restaurant area', so people will head there first because they know there is a good range of choice over heading to a single restaurant that is out of the way (unless it is particularly special). So it benefits the restaurants to share a bigger pool of customers, rather than trying to go it alone.</p>
<p>There will also be a while host of further effects and reasoning too - you will find groups of restaurants and gas stations at rest stops for example because that is where potential customers will gather (not a mile down the road at an unmarked location), or city zoning laws will promote and ban certain business types from certain areas - they may not allow commercial premises in areas zoned as industry or residential, so you will find groups of restaurants at the borders of these areas to capitalise on trade from them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In economics, this is known as the Hotelling theorem.</p>
<p>Imagine there is a long beach with two ice cream vendors. Now, the ice cream is exactly the same, and people are lazy, so they will always go to the closest vendor. Therefore, if you occupy some place at a beach, all customers that are closer to you will go to you, and all customers closer to the other guy will go to them. Ideally, you would like to get as many customers as possible, so you try to move as close to the centre as possible (if the other vendor is at your side, you are getting more clients by moving away from them, but if they are on a different side, you can take some of their customers by moving closer to them).</p>
<p>As a result, both vendors end up in the centre of the beach with neither of them wanting to move (something game theory calls a Nash Equilibrium), because if anyone moves, they will lose the clients from the far end of the beach.</p>
<p>Hotelling's theorem is used in many, many sciences to explain why brands have similar logos (think McDonalds and Burger King - dominating red colour signals a fast food chain), why many competitors bunch up together at one spatial point, and even why political parties tend to gravitate towards moderate centrist posititions when political climate is stable.</p>
<p>Another explanation is, of course, the singalling. If you are starting a business far from your competitors, you would have less competition. But why didn't they think of that themselves? Maybe there is a small demand in this region, or rent is higher, etc. By setting up a business, your competitor &quot;signals&quot; to everyone that they consider this particular place to have adequate conditions for their business. So it is tempting to trust their judgement if your business is similar.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
