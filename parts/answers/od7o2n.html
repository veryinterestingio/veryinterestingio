		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Pemex leak wasn't oil, it was gas. For a gas leak- the difference between burning and not burning is what gas ends up in the atmosphere. If it's not on fire, then mainly methane is released. If it's on fire, the methane turns into CO2 and water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The heat while locally quite high is not going to make any noticable impact on the ocean or the atmosphere.</p>
<p>If that incident was crude and not gas the accident would likely not have looked like that and much of the oil likely would not have ignited as it tends to disperse faster than it can burn and break up into areas that can't be reached by the fire.</p>
<p>If it was all together and could be burned fairly evenly? I think it depends on your point of view.</p>
<p>If you look at it from the point of view that the oil was destined to be burned regardless I think there would be advantages to burning, it cooks off the volatile components first which in most crude slows the spread and speeds the rate at which it tarballs or stinks.  This is generally good for wildlife and water quality but maybe not as good for bottom dwellers in the immediate vicinity and is briefly very bad for air quality at the surface, but most creatures are going to avoid a localized big fire regardless.</p>
<p>Realistically, at sea the conditions are usually going to be against you though and you are better off with booms and dispersants.</p>
<p>I do not know if this is still the case, but fire used to be used deliberately in some land based situations like small spills that contaminated wetland plants if the water was still enough because in that situation you could get a reasonably thorough burn and burning the plant material prevents it from recontaminating the water every time the level changes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
