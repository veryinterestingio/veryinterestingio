		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nurse here. Part of our brain (known as the medulla oblongata) senses substances (or chemicals) that tell our bodies they are sick or under extreme stress. When these substances are detected it triggers a warning to stop whatever you’re doing eating, spinning around fast, etc. That warning is nausea. There is a second part in the same area of the brain that gets triggered and causes the muscles involved in puking to contract and cause you to vomit. Vomiting is the body’s way of expelling something potentially harmful from inside you. </p>
<p>Vomiting can have lots of triggers including illness, driving in a car, slow movement of food through your stomach/intestines, certain smells, hormones, exercise, anxiety, drugs, etc. </p>
<p>Some people’s systems are more sensitive than others simply just because we are all unique individuals. Also, since the brain is part of your nervous system having an overreactive nervous system or certain medical conditions can make you more prone to nausea/vomiting. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact! Serotonin is involved in the mechanism in your brain that says you are nauseated. More serotonin = more nausea. That's why SSRIs, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (commonly prescribed to treat anxiety/depression), have nausea as a common side effect. They block the brain from getting rid of serotonin so that you generally have more serotonin (a neurotransmitter that aids in a sense of calm) in your system. That's good news for anxiety/ depression but bad news for nausea. </p>
<p>Zofran, a prescribed anti-nausea medication, works by decreasing serotonin levels. It's quite amazing how quickly it provides relief to most folks. It's always crazy to me that a stomach response is so deeply controlled in the brain/state of mind. A brain can say &quot;um I hate this situation... If I vomit do we leave? Yes yes let's get that going.&quot; That's a lot of power for one organ to have. </p>
<p>Source: a doctor explained this to me. She also said that for some folks the nausea goes away after a while. Not sure how that works.. if someone knows more please explain!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I cannot give a full explanation, but I don't think it has much to do with surface area of the stomach.</p>
<p>Vomiting is the body's defense against anything eaten that may harm you... but your body would prefer it if you didn't need to vomit at all - it's wasteful and damaging. So your mind has a way to make you feel really bad whenever it thinks something is wrong. This can be anything though, you don't need to eat something. For example, if you spend time around extremely foul and rotten smelling things, you may feel nauseated because your mind is telling you &quot;get away from that, don't eat that, it's hazardous&quot;. Then if ignore that and you actually eat it, you will get more nauseated until you start retching or vomit. That's usually a good thing - you'll be less likely to eat the same thing again, or be more careful when preparing it.</p>
<p>But it has a lot of false positives. Many illnesses can cause nausea even if vomiting won't help (or may actually make you more likely to die). Motion sickness is sort of like a glitch in our nausea system - chemicals in your brain becoming imbalanced because our senses (like sense of balance) aren't evolved to handle our unnatural ways of moving. Spinning can make people nauseated too if their body reacts poorly to the stimulus.</p>
<p>Not sure what really <em>causes</em> nausea, since it's not as simple as &quot;I ate something that's damaging me&quot;. Hopefully laying it out like this helps a bit though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
