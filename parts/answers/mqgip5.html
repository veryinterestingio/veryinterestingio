		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plastic is a blanket term of polymers. For example, the single-use water bottles are PET (Polyethylene terephthalate), note the poly- prefix meaning that the bottle is built out of huge molecules that consist of lots of ethylene monomers chained together.</p>
<p>These materials are prone to degradation, which is essentially the breaking of these chains making shorter chains, catalyzed by heat or radiation like UV. This will change the properties of the plastic, becoming brittle, etc.</p>
<p>Glass and metal are much simpler, they're just crystalline (or amorphous) materials and need not be arranged a very specific way</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm an engineer in PET plant(Lithuania).</p>
<p>One of manufacturing cells was modified to output 40% recycled PET. Basically, shredded and cleaned PET bottle flakes are dissolved and fed into the start of polymerization process along with usual raw materials.</p>
<p>Therefore polymer chain degradation is not a problem.</p>
<p>Problem is contaminants even if we buy &quot;clean&quot; recycled PET - dissolved PET filters have to be replaced quite frequently(and replacement+cleaning is quite messy).</p>
<p>Non-plastic contaminants are even worse - pumps and measuring devices practically get a sandblasting treatment during the process, even anti-abrasive ceramic coating can hold for so long ...</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Glass molecules are (mostly) just SiO2 in an amorphous (unordered, non-crystalline) structure. As long as the recycled feedstock is kept free from contamination, there's nothing to degrade. </p>
<p>Plastic is made from long chain polymer molecules. The properties of the plastic are very dependent on the length of the chains, the amount of branching and cross-linking, and the crystallinity. Chains and links can be damaged in service by UV or high-temperature exposure, or when they're remelted to recycle them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what /u/maximuse_  and /u/axz055 told you, you can also note that there is a french company called <a href="https://www.carbios.com/en/" target="_blank">Carbios</a> who is trying to recycle polymers indefinitely. So far they have it working with one of the big ones, PET I think. Really interesting stuff !</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
