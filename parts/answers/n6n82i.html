		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Combustion engines are absolutely terrible at running really slow and even worse when you are stopped. The idea is that even with massive losses you end up still being better off just skipping the combustion engine if you are only going 5 mph or if you are sitting still or you have to start and stop and start and stop or do other things like that where combustion engines suck.  Like your gas engine is like 4x as efficient at constant highway speeds than it is creeping between stoplights in a traffic jam, you have a ton of room for improvement</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many commenters here talk about regenerative braking, and that ICE is better at a certain RPM. While these points do have their merits, they are not <em>totally</em> correct.</p>
<p>First of all, regenerative braking, while helping with efficiency somewhat, is not the largest contributor. Taking my example from another comment, the city drive during heavy traffic conditions (morning commute to work in Auckland - probably the best conditions for recovering the braking energy with slow-moving traffic and frequent stops), I have used 1.74 kWh of power over 14 km, and 0.182 kWh were recovered by regenerative braking. That's just over 10%, and would not explain a 50%+ efficiency difference with traditional ICE cars.</p>
<p>Second, while ICE <em>is</em> better at certain RPM, the engine load (requested torque as a percentage of the maximum possible at given RPM) is even more important. For example, take <a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=37588853&amp;sid=397a026fa423e35555b08aff2ce28768#p37588853" target="_blank">this</a> graph. It shows the engine's brake-specific fuel consumption (i.e. the amount of fuel required to produce 1 kWh of mechanical energy) depending on RPM and engine load for the Gen 3 Prius. You will see that the best BSFC of 215 g/kWh is achieved at about 2000 RPM and 80% load. Thus, if your current driving conditions require 2000 RPM and, say, 25% load, the engine is extremely inefficient and burns more than double the fuel to produce the same amount of energy. You can also see that BSFC at under 50% load does not change much with RPM, so reducing the speed of the engine won't help much, though shifting to higher gear will increase the load and alleviate the problem somewhat. Hybrid cars get around this by alternating between running at full electric (discharging battery) and running the engine at high (optimal) load and storing the excess in the battery.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that Toyota hybrids, in particular, can always use the best possible RPM/load for any required power (red line on the graph) because of the design of the power split device. True series hybrids (the ones where the engine is only used to spin the generator and wheels are 100% electric) can also achieve that, but the double conversion (mechanical-electric-mechanical) can be quite lossy at the lower power outputs, so you will mostly see this design in diesel-electric train locomotives where it's insanely effective.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
