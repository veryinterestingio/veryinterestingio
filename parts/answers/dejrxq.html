		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No one really knows for sure, but it's generally accepted that clicks are very complex consonants and not likely to arise without the right starting conditions. One theory is that clicks develop from doubly-articulated stops (i.e. stops that are made at more than one place in the mouth simultaneously, such as West Africa's /k͡p/ - you make a /k/ and a /p/ simultaneously and release them simultaneously). These are really very rare - West Africa is as far as I know the only place in the world that actually uses those as real parts of the language, rather than just as an odd edge effect that can happen when two stops come next to each other. So to get to clicks, you have to start with a language that already uses double-articulated consonants like /k͡p/, and then have it further alter those not by simplifying them but by turning them into clicks - basically, an unusual starting system has to be modified in an unusual way.</p>
<p>Now, once you have clicks, they can spread all over as part of normal language-to-language influence processes. That's why isiXhosa and isiZulu have clicks, despite being from the Bantu family, which has no history of clicks and long ago lost its double stops - they've undergone influence from the non-Bantu languages in the area, and have acquired them on those grounds. So there's a big-ish zone in Namibia and South Africa where clicks are normal, and not having them is more unusual.</p>
<p>Also, once you have clicks, you pretty quickly develop a pretty big inventory of them. There's a lot you can do with clicks - nasalisation, glottalisation, noisy release, and several other things - and so it seems that languages tend to take full advantage of that once that door is opened. IsiXhosa has 18 clicks (three places in the mouth done six ways each), and we know it hasn't had clicks for all that long in the grand scheme of things. Non-Bantu languages in the area often have quite a few more.</p>
<p>There are two languages in Africa but outside of the main click area (Hadza and Sandawe); these are assumed to be left over from a rather larger click area that got overrun by Bantu-speaking peoples over the last couple of thousand years. The one 'language' outside of Africa that has clicks is Damin, a ceremonial register of the Australian language Lardil; it has clicks specifically because it has the cultural role of 'nonlinguistic speech' - it is, ultimately, linguistic, but it's meant to function as a way for people to communicate with each other when cultural rules prevent them from actually speaking to each other. As a result, it uses clicks specifically because they <em>don't</em> sound like speech sounds to Lardil speakers, and they help make the avoidance register more distinct from 'real speech'.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I learned isiNdebele as an adult and one thing that struck me coming back home to the states is how often we use clicks in informal communication. Disappointment, resignation, annoyance, English speakers can communicate that with clicks. We also use them informally to hint at direction. A dental click   for something in front of you, a lateral click for something to the side.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the OP is referring mainly to Khoisan where clicks are the initial sound in 70% of their vocabulary. The Khoisan are from the Namibian/Botswana/Northern Cape region and have influenced the Bantu language (primarily Zulu and subsequently Xhosa) which adopted 3 of the 4 clicks used. So the Khoisan (whose language and culture I think is much older) is the primary click language and has been adopted in part by others who came into contact over about 1,500 years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
