But yes youâ€™re right that exposure to exhaust from leaded gasoline impairs cognitive function and there is a lot of research to back that up. <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2613157" target="_blank">This 4 decade long study</a> which followed hundreds of children who grew up after exposure to leaded gas showed they had lower cognitive function and lower socioeconomic status by the time they were middle aged. This is still far from definitive and its too small of a sample size to draw conclusions about entire generations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

They're probably numerous reasons for it, but it's possible some of the increase is due to unleaded gasoline.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>There's pretty good evidence that lead exposure from fuel is linked to an increase in crime:</p>
