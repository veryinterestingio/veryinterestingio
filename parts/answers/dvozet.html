		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's unlikely you'd find a planet with a spherical shell of stuff around it, unless it was artificially designed.</p>
<p>All of the rocks and chunks of ice and stuff would be orbiting around the planet, with roughly circular orbits. The centres of these circular-ish orbits is always the centre of the planet. So if you imagine some particle that's currently north of the equator, then on the other side of its orbit it's going to be south of the equator.</p>
<p>What this means is that these orbits intersect with each other. The shell isn't rotating like a single solid body. Instead, the particles will be crashing into each other. This isn't a stable system. The particles will be losing energy and transferring angular momentum through these collisions. This will keep on going until they reach a stable state where they aren't colliding very much anymore. This stable state is a flat ring or disc - here, you can have particles all in circular orbits without crashing into each other. So a shell of particles would settle down into a ring.</p>
<p>You <em>could</em> artificially design it to be stable, by setting up satellites with orbits at different angles and distances that are perfectly arranged to not collide. But you wouldn't expect this to happen naturally.</p>
<p>If you're imagining a <em>solid</em> spherical shell, then that would definitely have to be artificial. But even then, it's not really stable. It turns out that the gravity from a shell perfectly cancels out in all directions. This means that any slight drift between the planet and the shell is not corrected - they will drift towards each other until they collide. Any science-fiction solid Dyson sphere would need some sort of thrusters to keep it stable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I mean, technically yes. An atmoSPHERE. But if you're talking rocky and icy particles? Nope.</p>
<p>While what you're describing theoretically exists after large body collisions (think the collision that made our moon) it's an unstable system that will collide over time leading a substantial portion of the material to be ejected or to deorbit, and what will remain will either have enough gravity (and high enough concentration in one or more areas) to form a moon or moons, or if the remaining material is more uniform, you get rings. </p>
<p>Rings eventually go through the same degenerative process of collisions, ejections, and deorbiting, and eventually the remaining material consolidates into a moon or moons, which may themselves become unstable, break apart and then you have another ring.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a sense, yes. After a large collision, many planets are in a similar state. They have particles floating all around them in a roughly spherical shape. </p>
<p>The problem is that this is not a stable system. Most of the particles run into each other, which will send them crashing down or further into space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aside from all the other problems people are mentioning, the equatorial bulge of rotating planets torques the orbits of things not in equatorial or perfectly polar orbits.</p>
<p>Any initial shell, even if spaced to prevent collisions initially, will eventually collapse into a ring, and then the ring particles will mostly fall to the planet.</p>
<p>It could take a long time though.</p>
<p>Another long term source of instability is the the planet's tidal bulge due to solar attraction, which can raise or lower the orbit of satellites. Our own moon is gradually moving into a higher orbit, over billions of years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but it's a short lived (in astronomical terms) unstable state. Others in this thread have already explained how it could happen, and have generally answered your question better than I could.</p>
