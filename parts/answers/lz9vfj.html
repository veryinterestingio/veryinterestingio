		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can vary depending on how full your stomach is but a glass of water can take between 5-30 minutes to leave the stomach. The valve that stops food from prematurely leaving your stomach is not fully water tight so liquids start draining immediately. Having a lot of fatty foods in your stomach can slow down this process considerably because of the hydrophobic property of fat. Take this with a grain of salt as everyone is different :) hope this helped</p>
<p>EDIT: thanks for my first award haha! A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If the stomach is empty, liquids immediately start entering the small intestine. Within several minutes, most of the liquid will be in there. If there is food or fatty material or anything other than straight liquid, then it gets longer and longer the more food is in there. </p>
<p>This is the principle behind getting people who are drinking alcohol too quickly or who are already drunk to eat pretzels and whatnot. There is likely a bunch of alcohol in their stomachs about to get them even drunker, but eating even a little food will trigger the stomach to tighten the lower sphincter and work on breaking up the food, slowing the rate that alcohol enters the intestine (where it is quickly absorbed into the blood stream).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on whether it's just water, or if there's other stuff in your stomach too.<br />
If you drink water on an empty stomach (so it's only water in your stomach) it will move to the small intestine in just a few minutes.</p>
<p>The more fat or protein is in it, the longer it takes. Both protein and fat will increase the amount of time it takes.</p>
<p>Anything else dissolved in the water will also delay the process. sugars and starch don't tend to slow it down as much as fat, but it will slow gastric emptying somewhat. So will salt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21997675/" target="_blank">study in 2012</a> done with D2O (deuterium water) showed the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ingested water appeared in plasma and blood cells within 5 min and the half-life of absorption (~11-13 min) indicates a complete absorption within ~75-120 min. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which is not quite OPâ€™s question, though does show that water is nearly immediately being absorbed into blood plasma, almost half of the Imbibed amount by 11-13 minutes in this scenario. </p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29298479/" target="_blank">Here is a more recent study</a> on the timing of various liquids of gastric emptying measured in MRI. They note the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the gastric emptying of GFJ and the glucose solution was significantly slower than that of water. The fructose solution had only a slightly delayed gastric emptying. Small bowel water content was increased by administration of GFJ and fructose solution, whereas it was decreased by glucose compared to the administration of pure water. At 80 min the small bowel water content after GFJ was twice as high as the small bowel water content after administration of water.</p>
