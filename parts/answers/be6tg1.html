		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you're driving on the muddy shoulder of a road and trying to get back onto the pavement. Because your car will move faster on the pavement, as your (say) left wheels hit the pavement, they'll speed up, pushing your car around to the right. You just reflected off of the faster surface.</p>
<p>A denser cladding material would make the speed of light there slower, but a faster speed is what you need for total internal reflection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, total internal reflection happens only when the outside has a lower RI than the inside.</p>
<p>At lower angles of incidence, part of the light is refracted and part reflected. TIR happens when the refracted ray would be refracted at 90 degrees from the normal.</p>
<p>Snell's Law: n<em><em>a</em></em> sin a = n<em><em>b</em></em> sin b</p>
<p>If b is the external material, then TIR happens when (n<em><em>a</em></em>/n<em><em>b</em></em> ) sin a &gt;= 1.</p>
<p>As sin a has a maximum of 1,  (n<em><em>a</em></em>/n<em><em>b</em></em> ) must be greater than 1, so n<em><em>a</em></em> &gt; n<em><em>b</em></em> .</p>
<p>Another way to model it for very thin fibers, is to forget about reflection altogether. If the fiber diameter is on the order of the wavelength of light, part of each photon is outside the fiber core. The part that is outside either moves in front of the inside part or behind.</p>
<p>Clearly if the outside part falls behind the internal wavefront, the wavefront becomes divergent and the wave will escape the fiber. So the outside refractive index must be lower, so that any part of the wavefront outside the core advances and causes the resulting wavefront to be focused inwards.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mhh.. have you heard of the marching band analogy? When the rows of musicians walk diagonally from the slow grass onto the quick pavement. The musicians who arrive to the pavement first will accelerate and it deviates the band.</p>
<p>However, there is one important rule: they need to hold the line and stay in rows no matter what. (At the interface, the wave fronts need to correspond in both materials)</p>
<p>Now imagine the band is marching from muddy sludge onto perfect pavement. The first musician who reaches the pavement would suddenly go so fast that he would break the ranks and be separated from his buddies. But that is impossible, totally forbidden. You need to hold the line. So his buddies grab him and jerk him back into the mud. But with the speed the poor musician has gained, the whole band is deviated back into the mud.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember an image like the fish tank seen <a href="http://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~scidemos/LightOptics/FishTankTIR/FishTankTIR.html" target="_blank">here</a> helping me think about TIR. The refractive index of the water is larger than that of the air (1.33 vs 1). When the beam in the water hits the air interface, the sine of the angle of the transmitted ray (the part that would continue through the air) is given by (n_water/n_air) times the sine of the angle that the beam hits the top surface with <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snell's_law" target="_blank">see:Snell’s law</a> Note that both these angles would be measured from the vertical direction. However, if we consider the case where the incident light angle is large (let’s use 60 degrees) and you try to solve for the angle of the transmitted ray you get an angle greater than 90 degrees. Therefore, the transmitted ray is still within the water and no light “escapes” into the air. The larger the difference between the materials refractive indices the smaller the angle required for TIR. This is why faceted diamonds appear so sparkly, their refractive index is around 2.5 so it it very difficult for light inside the diamond to be transmitted back into the air, except for at the flat part on top. Also, especially with fiber optics, the reason for the difference in refractive index is not necessarily due to a change in density. Typically the core and cladding start out as the same type of glass, but molecules are doped into the core or cladding (basically, a few of the glass molecules is replaced by something like erbium) to change their refractive indices.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
