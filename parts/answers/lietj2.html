		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>He was the founder of psychoanalysis, which in itself is very controversial, but included having people talk about their problems. You'll notice the &quot;talk about it&quot; thing from pretty much every modern therapist etc., who may have you sit down and talk about things so they can understand you better and hopefully help you. Freud was instrumental in getting that sort of treatment off the ground, and for this he is recognized. But he also had a lot of strange theories, some hotly contested or proven false, such as an obsession with the Oedipus Complex.</p>
<p>It's like we can recognise prehistoric examples of trepanation and say they were founders of the idea of surgery for health, while also being against trepanning because there's much better ways to do things these days.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>His theory on Conscious and Unconscious mind was innovative. He also was a founding father of “Talk Therapy” (Freud and Breuer; Studies on Hysteria)
Don’t get me wrong, I disagree with 90 percent of what he says but I still think he paved a route.</p>
<p>Also more psychologists wanted to prove him wrong so a lot more theories were created to bash his studies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine that its caveman times and you're the first person to invent a wheel.  Except your wheel isn't round, its an octagon.  When you invent the octagon its a vast improvement over everything that had come before since no one else had ever thought of moving something along the ground by rotating it.  </p>
<p>Humanity spent 3,000 years pushing squares through the mud.  But your idea that  you can move by rotating something is so revolutionary that now, a mere 150 years later, people have refined your octagon to a fully functional circular wheel.  People with access to a circular wheel would look back and say &quot;wow, why the hell would we ever use octagons?&quot;  But that doesn't mean that the octagon didn't revolutionize the field of pushing stuff.</p>
<p>Freud is the octagon of psychology.  Prior to Freud no one believed that mental health disorders even existed - people believed that mental health problems were the result of demonic possession and that had remained unchanged for thousands of years.  </p>
<p>150 years later we now know that most of what Freud believed in terms of the cause of mental health disorders is completely wrong, including his ideas on how to treat them.  But the fact is that Freud's view that mental health disorders were actual diseases that could be treated by means other than exorcism was revolutionary.
His popularization of that outlook is what allowed modern psychology to evolve to the point that currently is.</p>
<p>So yes, Freud was wrong.  But without him the standard treatment for mental health disorders would continue to be shoving garlic cloves up the person's ass while sprinkling holy water on them and praying.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>He invented therapy. Good. Father of psychoanalysis. Duly deserved.</p>
<p>Why he gets so much flak is because he completely ignored the scientific method for much of his work. Carl Popper invented the term pseudoscience to describe the lack of scientific rigor in Freud's work.</p>
<p>Einstein (a contemporary) made predictions and then set out to take measurements. If the measurements did not match his predictions then he would know his work was flawed.</p>
<p>Freud would say a woman had penis envy and then twist any data to fit that conclusion. Abusive father? Well your penis envy is born of resentment. Loving father? Your penis envy is born of confusion and wanting to be your father.</p>
<p>Freud normalized some very important tools for mental health treatment but he was simply bad at his job as a researcher and scientist.</p>
<p>That's why he's treated differently than other scientific figures. Newton and Darwin and Curie did important work without having some key insights or modern methodology, but for the time and tools available they did great actual work.</p>
<p>Freud's work was just fatally flawed in many ways.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
