		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes yes, sometimes no. Usually the answer is somewhere in-between.</p>
<p>There’s 3 general ways to make a map. </p>
<p>The first is the most straightforward - direct design. In this method, the shape of the terrain, all buildings and rooms, and the items that populate the world are all intentionally designed and placed. This is used in games like Skyrim or Red Dead Redemption 2, which are set in fictional settings that don’t necessarily have real world analogues, and where the world-building requires attention to detail. </p>
<p>The second is procedural generation. In this method, the developers put in a set of rules for a program to follow in making a world. Things like how the terrain looks in certain situations, what items are around, when and where to put specifically designed buildings, etc. Procedural generation is typically used for very large  game worlds where direct design is neither feasible or necessary (like in Elite Dangerous or No Man’s Sky) or for games in which the exact look of the map changes each game (like in Minecraft or Civilization V). Procedural generation with a well thought out and programmed set of rules can create a very expansive and convincing world.</p>
<p>The last method is using real world data to create a map, then using the other methods to fill it in and craft it more closely. For example, Fallout New Vegas used real geographical data of southern Nevada and California to make the game map (including the locations of towns, points of interests, etc.), then added in their own areas and content for the game. </p>
<p>Direct design is used for a lot of critically acclaimed game worlds - they gain acclaim <em>because</em> every part of the map got that personal attention to detail from the developers. This is more feasible than it seems superficially because different developers focus on different things. Take Skyrim for example - one developer might have designed the overall game map and the towns that dot that landscape. Another might have designed the assets like trees, rocks, ruins, and buildings that then filled that environment. A few more designed all the interiors and dungeons. And then, separately, a team of artists created all of the textures used to color every aspect of the game world.</p>
<p>Edit: I should also point out (as others have), that a lot of games use a mix of these methods. It depends on the developers, their resources, their style, and the tools they’re using to make a world. But if something looks good and polished, you can be absolutely assured that a team of people spent plenty of hours making it that way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to other answers I'll add that there are many tools in software like Unreal Engine and Unity that alleviate a lot of the 'donkey work'. </p>
<p>For example say you want to place trees in your world. You can assign the tree model to a brush, add a randomiser and stroke it all over the landscape (are we still doing 'phrasing'?). It will randomly distribute your trees, even randomly adjusting size and type of tree model if you have set it up correctly. </p>
<p>Same can be done with any game object although it works best with natural things like trees and plants. A town made like this would look very odd.</p>
<p>Man made things do tend to have to be made and placed individually to look convincing. Natural things can be proc genned or 'painted' as I describe above.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nowadays it's usually a mix of generated and hand polished content.</p>
<p>As other comments in the thread say, some games start with the real world as a base - on Division 2, for example, the world is set on real life DC, and is at 1:1 scale - so the base version of the world was literally taken from real map data, essentially Google Maps. This gave the location and shape of each building, and even things like sidewalk width, but all of this needed a lot of work and refinement by developers to look good and work well with the gameplay.</p>
<p>In that case, typically the amount of attention given to it would depend on priority - main mission locations are most important, then side missions/open world activity locations, then all the connecting bits in between. But in the end, yes, every inch of the world has been touched by multiple humans to make it look great and work well.</p>
<p>Other games not based on real world locations will have hand made &quot;terrain&quot; maps which let the developers choose how it'll look from a macro scale, and then the first pass of micro details (eg trees, rocks, wildlife) can be auto generated as well - the developers mark out specific areas as a particular biome, which means &quot;this kind of tree grows in this area&quot;, and/or they can set up a set of rules controlling what grows where, eg &quot;North of this coordinate, or above this altitude, it is snowy,&quot; etc.</p>
<p>These first passes can then be manually edited to carve out spaces for specific intended gameplay, etc. As others have said, there are tools like paintbrushes for automatically &quot;painting&quot; a good spread of trees etc over specific areas, or editable building tools so that a variety of complex and unique buildings can be made without having to individually model each one. But there is also likely the ability to place specific trees/etc in specific spots. Again, the priority will be given to important gameplay locations, with less attention being paid to areas furthest from those.</p>
<p>It'll be rare nowadays for an entire open world to be manually hand crafted piece by piece without using some of these tools. </p>
<p>tldr typically a &quot;first pass&quot; is generated, from real world and/or hand made input data, and then the details of the world are refined and polished by human hands.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
