		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is midline vs not.</p>
<p>The heart tube starts out as an arterial dilations past the “head side” of your mouth hole, and turning during development bends it in a “U” shape, which then gets split in two by walls growing in from the “pipe walls” to improve separation of flow between oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.</p>
<p>The liver grows in the midline mesentery between the foregut (basically the stomach) and the abs. The stomach rotates to the right during development, pushing the liver to the right.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part of it is redundancy (if one kidney is damaged, you can still survive) others is efficiency (one large heart is difficult to operate, but two smaller hearts would be at least as difficult and catastrophic if one fails. Ie: you can survive with a minor arrhythmia, but two hearts beating out of sync doesn't work)</p>
<p>It's also worth looking at the order in which organs develop, this often (but not always) reflects the evolutionary timeline.</p>
<p>Heart and liver, both major solitary organs, grow well before paired organs like the kidneys.</p>
<p>We don't get lungs until after nearly every other organ is already in progress or nearly finished!</p>
<p>Some of this reflects a time in our evolution when our body shape and function was very different - circulation and detox existed well before breathing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
