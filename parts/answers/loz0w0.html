Imagine you're going 65MPH on the highway then suddenly there's a hill going up at 30ยบ</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Roads have a slope limit, called the road's grade.  If the road is too steep, it will be unsafe.  Mountains are natural features, and they are often more steep than this.  So, to go over a mountain, you have to make a very long road to maintain the grade limit.  You can do this on the mountain, with a series of switchbacks.  Unfortunately, switchbacks are also dangerous and significantly increase travel time.  This longer road is also much more expensive.</p>
<p>At some point, the economics of tunneling through the mountain are cheaper than the long road in terms of construction costs plus all the time/fuel used to traverse the road.  Engineers usually build the cheapest solution, even when it's a tunnel through a mountain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Weather and ice conditions will also play a role.  Even if the hill isn't too steep it can be an unnecessary slope in an area with terrible winter driving conditions.  The hill can be moved, an idiot cannot be taught how to drive on ice.  Ft. Worth taught us that recently</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is both an engineering and an economics question.  Good answers here on the engineering reasons.  The economic answer is that tunnels probably cost more to build, but reducing auto accidents and saving driving time have more economic value over the life of the tunnel.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
