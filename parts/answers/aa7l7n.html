		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even a relatively small transformer draws a massive amount of power.  The power supply is high voltage AC, which is arcing in the open air.  Basically, the open air is acting as a fluorescent bulb.  It's mostly light from nitrogen, which glows blue, like neon glows red.</p>
<p>It's not an unusual thing to have happen, but I've never seen it to quite this extent before.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The small transformer is connected to a bigger transformer at the nearest substation.  This much bigger transformer is feeding the short-circuit. </p>
<p>You don't get the same energy from a short circuit on your outlet, for example.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The color light is measured in something called color temperature. It's referenced in degrees Kelvin. The scale is based on what colored light tungsten outputs when heated to different temperatures. The lower the temperature the more orange or red the light, the higher the temperature the bluer it is.</p>
<p>Warm white light bulbs in your house are going to be somewhere in the 3000 range, the sun is more like 7200. Arc welding, which is basically what this was, is way high on that chart, therefore the light looks blue.</p>
