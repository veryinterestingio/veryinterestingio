		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We can only see things by bouncing light off them and then into our eyes. Lenses help us focus light so we can see smaller things, but evsntually, the things you're looking at are smaller than the wavelengths of light. Light itself has a size and you can't bounce it off things that are smaller than it and get a good picture. We can get around this a bit by using electrons instead of light, But even that has a limit as well. We'll never see things like quarks, they're just too small. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of good comments here already about how the wavelength of light is a limiting factor for conventional microscopy. It's worth mentioning that we can &quot;see&quot; things smaller than that, but through indirect means. One such way is by using the power of X-rays, which have a much shorter wavelength than visible light, such that the X-rays interact with the electrons of molecules. Growing crystals of something and then measuring how these X-rays are scattered is the basis of a method called X-ray crystallography, which is regularly used to &quot;visualize&quot; (or more accurately build models that are consistent with the data) to &quot;see&quot; what proteins and nucleic acids look like on an atomic level.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s even something else that comes into play before what the top comments are mentioning. If you zoom in with a microscope, you’ll notice that the image gets dimmer and dimmer the more you zoom. That’s because light from a smaller and smaller area is being spread out to your entire field of view. At some zooming point, there will be almost no photons to even produce that image, and this point is far before the wavelength of light.</p>
<p>EDIT: Hmm, I guess it’s not that far before the wavelength of light. And you can of course just pump more light in. But the image quality definitely degrades a lot due to the limited amount of light, and using too much of a high energy bulb could come with other effects as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way we see things is by light reflecting of of it into our eyes.</p>
<p>Lenses take reflected light and make the image appear bigger.</p>
<p>In order for the &quot;reflection&quot; to work the wavelength of the light has to be smaller than the object. This isn't a problem with anything we interact with in the normal world because everything is massive compared to wavelengths of visible light.</p>
<p>The problem is as you try to view something small, like cells, you need increasing smaller wavelengths of light. For most cells visible light is fine as they're still quite big.</p>
<p>The problem is on an atomic level the wavelength of light is too big compared to the object, it will just go around it. If you keep adding lenses there will be no visible light for the lens to make bigger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
