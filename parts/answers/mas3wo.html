		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is really a question about the limits of materials science. In some ways it's similar to the problem posed by a theoretical space elevator. How thin and light can you get the string without it breaking? How high can you get the surface area of the kite while keeping the weight down?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to weight, the longer the line is the more drag it has.<br />
So it will tend to have a lot more curve in it, with the line angle at the ground becoming flatter and flatter.<br />
There are diminishing returns to paying out more and more line.<br />
As a real world example, I was towing hang gliders using a payout winch with 6000 feet of polypropylene rope.  The difference in altitude between 4000 and 6000 feet of line paid out was typically zero.<br />
A thinner lighter line would have helped, but it will eventually run into the same problem, just at a longer length.<br />
A kite train would probably be the way to go for maximum altitude.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Per an article in the Guardian:</p>
<p>By 1899 the US Weather Bureau had 17 kite stations, each of which regularly lifted instruments to 8,000ft using a train of several kites joined together. The standard &quot;moderate wind&quot; kite was about 2 metres by 2 metres. Light wind kites were used when the breeze was less than 8mph, and heavy-duty ones when it was above 30mph.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First let's define our terms: A kite is a wind-powered aircraft that uses aerodynamic lift to counteract gravity.</p>
<p>The first hard limit that comes to mind for such a vehicle is the mesosphere. This is for the same reason as any lift-based air vehicle: The air pressure is so low you cannot generate enough lift to counteract gravity, no matter how fast you travel.</p>
<p>Also note the mesosphere can't be traversed by spacecraft either. There is too much air to travel at orbital velocity for any significant period of time. It's for these reasons that the mesosphere is still not well explored to this day; the best you can do is launch sounding rockets. That said, I have seen extreme designs for exotic airships (which use buoyancy) that can loiter in the mesosphere. It might be possible if you stretch your definition of &quot;kite&quot; to allow for a flying wing that is itself inflated with helium, using both lift and buoyancy, but the engineering will be difficult. Even weather balloons can't reach the mesosphere. Mars has a similar air pressure as the mesosphere, but also significantly less gravity to counteract, hence it is not only possible to fly on Mars, the <em>Perseverence</em> rover is carrying a helicopter, <em>Ingenuity.</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately there is an even lower limit for a kite than the mesosphere. Remember kites are wind powered. If we consult the chart that correlates wind speed with altitude, we find that wind does increase with altitude, as you said, but not forever. After the tropopause (9-12km altitude) wind speed drops with altitude. There are jet streams but only up to 15km. Winds are almost becalmed in the 20-25km range, after which wind speed does start rising again, but remember that atmospheric pressure reduces exponentially with altitude. For instance at 20km altitude, air pressure is only 5% sealevel. For a wind-powered aircraft, wind speed and air pressure are both important. That 20-25km hump will be difficult, if not impossible, for a kite to overcome.</p>
<p>At that point it's an issue of material science. You need to find material for the kite and it's string that is strong yet gossamer enough that after ascending out of the jet stream the lessening wind speed (and decreasing air pressure) will not halt your ascent.</p>
<p>Also, if you do host your extreme kite competition at the equator, perhaps Singapore, the bulge in the atmosphere caused by the Earth spinning at 460 meters per second means that you will be on the high side of these values (tropopause at 12km, instead of 9km at the poles, for instance). You will still max out (depending on your material science) somewhere between 15 and 25km.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming that a kite cannot &quot;fly&quot; in the vacuum of space, then between the surface of the Earth and space there must be an altitude at which a kite can rise no further.</p>
<p>If you had thousands of kilometers of weightless string to fly your nearly weightless kite, with the &quot;spool&quot; end attached to an immovable point on the planet, would the kite rise to the top of the atmosphere quickly, with a short length of string, or would it trail behind the spool drastically, as the rotation of the Earth drags the kite through the atmosphere?</p>
<p>Could a kite be constructed to buffet off the thermosphere somewhere in the exosphere is something else to consider.</p>
<p>Fun questions!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
