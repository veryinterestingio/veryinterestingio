The vast majority of US debt, for example, is owned by American citizens in the form of government bonds. It makes more sense if you recognize it's not the country, but the government that's in debt. Just like a company can borrow from banks or private investors, the government can borrow from people or other countries (in the form of government bonds).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When governments want money they can either tax their citizens or borrow from them. Much like how a business can sell products or borrow from investors.</p>
<p>How much to tax, how much to borrow and how much to spend is very complicated, and depends a lot on the personal preferences of the government and its citizens.</p>
<p>So, short answer is the government borrows from the people who live there and spend that money on the people who live there. Consequence can be great, or crap, depending on what the money is spent on, and how willing everyone is to repay the debts. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Governments typically take on debt by issuing <strong>bonds</strong>. Bonds last a specific amount of time and pay out a particular amount. For example, you might buy a 1-year government bond at a price of $100, for an interest rate of 3%. The government is essentially promising that after 1 year, they'll pay you $103. Bonds often last a lot longer than a year, there are 5-, 10-, even 50-year bonds. The longer the timescale, the higher rate of interest.</p>
<p>Sometimes a government directly takes on a loan from a major bank or some other financial institution. And that's a loan like any other, the lender gives you cash up front, you're expected to gradually pay it back, with interest.</p>
<p>In America, the vast majority of government debt is owned by American citizens. Usually individuals but also corporations and banks. There is a small amount that is owned by foreigners, either foreign individuals/corporations, or by foreign governments.</p>
<p>The consequences of government indebtedness can range from trivial to catastrophic, depending on the type of debt, the creditworthiness of the government, and the size of the debt. A lot of economists say government debt that is lower than 110% of annual GDP is healthy and manageable. Anything higher than that can become a problem.</p>
<p>One major consequence of course is that the government has to pay the debts back! And that can eat up a lot of a government's budget, which means less to spend on other things like the military, services, education, or the social safety net. The US government currently spends about 6% of its annual budget on paying back the debt. Some governments spend a lot more than that. One could argue that even at the relatively low level that the US is paying, it's still a bad thing because the government is paying all this interest to investors, which is essentially money going straight from the taxpayer to rich people and big banks. But many would say that the benefits of borrowing money to finance government spending are worth it.</p>
<p>Now, in more severe cases, government debt can be a much bigger problem. For example Greece. Greece is so heavily indebted, and its creditworthiness is so low, that the lenders willing to loan them money to bail them out demand stiff cuts to spending as well as the selling off of government assets to pay for debt service. This is very bad for Greece, and has caused a large-scale economic contraction there that has lowered living standards considerably. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One current issue in many small counties and third world countries is the &quot;Debt-trap Diplomacy&quot; or &quot;Debt Colonisation&quot; currently employed by China to take over areas of strategic interest.</p>
<p>What happens is that China through their various banks loan money on white elephant projects (ie roads to no where) and when these countries cant pay/default on massive loans, China moves in and takes over an island, a port, land etc.</p>
<p>This has already happened in Sri Lanka, but is happening Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Vanuatu, Pakistan, Maldives, Laos and others.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>National debt is not like household debt.  As a regular person, you have to borrow money from other people.  But governments can just print their own money, so things get a lot more complicated really quickly.</p>
<p>One of the main ways a government borrows money is from its own citizens.  It prints Treasury Bonds, and invites the public to buy them.  Basically they say &quot;Give me money right now, and I'll pay you back in 2, 5, or 10 years plus interest.&quot;  Treasury bonds are a bedrock of a lot of people's investment portfolios, so much of the national debt is actually &quot;owed&quot; to its own people.  Now conceivably, those very people could vote to simply forgive the debt and never get paid back.  But obviously they would very much prefer not to.</p>
<p>About 53% of the US national debt is owed to itself.  Some of that is also money &quot;owed&quot; to future investments, much like you borrowing money from your own retirement account.  Some countries, like Japan, have national debts that are 2-3x their entire gross domestic product, but in Japan's case almost all of it is owed to itself.  It's not like owing money to someone else, like a private citizen.  Nobody can ever really call to &quot;collect.&quot;</p>
<p>Foreign governments DO buy each other's Treasury Bonds.  About 47% of the US national debt is held by foreign governments.  China and Japan, the two largest, hold about 7-8% each.  But this is tricky because the value of those bonds fluctuates with the relative strength of each other's currency exchange rates.  Countries only want to buy another country's bonds if they're pretty sure that government is going to be stable and around in 10 years to pay up, and are confident the currency isn't going to change much.  I.e. the government isn't going to just print money to pay it off and make everyone's bonds worth less.</p>
<p>That means big, stable economies like the US can offer lower interest rates and still attract buyers than smaller and less stable ones, meaning it's cheaper for them to borrow money.  Even if they are unstable, as long as they are less unstable than everyone *else*, they'll still be able to borrow money through issuing bonds.  A country can conceivably issue bonds forever, until they can no longer find any buyers that believe they'll eventually pay up.</p>
<p>There is also a lot of reciprocal debt.  China may hold 8% of the US national debt, but the US in turn may hold say... 4% of Chinese national debt.  They could conceivably just decide to forgive each other, which happens quite often among allies.  But because that debt is often borrowed in stages at different interest rates and currency prices, it can be very difficult to truly say which side's bonds are worth what to the other.  So sometimes countries will just sit there owing each other money until it's time to pay up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
