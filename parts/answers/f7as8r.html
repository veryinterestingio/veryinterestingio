		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Physicist weighing in here.  This is a tricky question that’s answered by Einstein’s theory of general relativity.  </p>
<p>First, let’s clarify what we mean by parallel.  Remember that spacetime geometry is not purely Euclidean, so the usual definition of two parallel lines where we refer to two non-intersecting lines in the same plane doesn’t really apply.  Let’s describe parallel mathematically as being the condition where the proper length between the photon’s world lines is fixed in time; meaning that “distance” as measured in an inertial frame containing both photons is constant.</p>
<p>Secondly, I want to point out another tricky property of photons traveling through space: they only follow null geodesics.  Geodesics are “shortest possible paths,” and confusingly, they’re not always straight—“I’m going to gloss over the importance of the word “null” here because I don’t think it’s important.  For example, in a spherical geometry, such as the surface of the planet Earth, the shortest path between two points always follows a great circle (e.g. the equator, the prime meridian, and rotations thereof).  This is the reason why planes traveling over oceans always look like they’re following nonsensically curvy paths.  I bring this up because, if you imagine two photons constrained to travel on the surface of a sphere, and you imagine that they are parallel, your first intuition is likely to imagine that one is traveling say along the Tropic of Capricorn, and the other along the Tropic of Cancer.  However, neither of these paths are actually possible for a such a photon to travel along.  As it turns out, it’s impossible for two photons on the surface of a sphere to travel parallel in the sense that we’ve described.</p>
<p>Now, to address your question more directly.  Most GR researchers agree at this point that the universe is most likely flat on average (with very occasional huge singularities like black holes).  We also know that spacetime is expanding.  The simplest representation of this situation is to assume that there’s some arbitrary function of time a(t) multiplied by the line element that describes the distance between two neighboring points in spacetime.  In Euclidean space, that line element is ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2.  You might recognize this as a representation of the distance formula between two points.  In an expanding spacetime, we write ds^2 = a(t) (dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2).  I’m leaving out the time term for simplicity of this discussion.</p>
<p>If we guess the equation above and check to see what possible functions a(t) satisfy Einstein’s equation (a tensor equation that relates curvature in space to energy), we find that a(t) is a monotonically increasing function that we can plot.  One of the important things to notice about a(t) is that it doesn’t depend on the coordinates x,y or z.  It should make sense that it doesn’t, because after all, it shouldn’t matter where in space I’m located.  It would be odd if some random place in space expanded differently than everything else.</p>
<p>Bringing all this hoopla back around to photons, the functions describing the trajectories of the photons through spacetime don’t “know” about the expansion of space.  In fact, regardless of whether I knew that space was expanding, I would predict that at time t, the photons would be at location x , y , z.  That’s still true!  no matter how space expands.  Subtly however, if we were to measure the proper distance between these photons at different times, we would get different answers because the same small change in the photons‘ coordinates corresponds to a different distance between them as time passes on.  Weird!  In this sense, your idea that spacetime expansion causes us to perceive nearby, near parallel photons, as farther apart than they once were, is true.  Notice how our definition of parallel, again, despite our care, starts to break down... </p>
<p>However, the photons do not ever appear to change their direction of travel.  E.g. They don’t ever approach a state of traveling perpendicular to one another.  They are merely measured to be farther apart.  Albeit, nevertheless always at the same coordinate separation.  It turns out that a more useful definition of parallel might be this sense of coordinate separation on rectilinear coordinates.  It’s confusing though because the coordinates themselves that we use to describe spacetime are completely arbitrary and don’t necessarily have any physical meaning.  Only things like proper length have measurable meanings.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
