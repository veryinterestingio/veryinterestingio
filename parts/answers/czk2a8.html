		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doctor here, albeit a spine surgeon, but I know the answer to this. It doesn’t really have anything to do with bacteria. Bacteria are always going to be present on any surface of the body that faces the outside world. The saline used for this is hypertonic, which means it has a concentration of greater than 0.9%. When this comes in contact with mucous membranes, fluid moves from the area with less sodium (the body) to the fluid in an attempt to equalize the concentration of Ions. Removing this fluid reduces inflammation, causing you to feel better! Remember with a cold, almost all the symptoms are caused by your body’s inflammatory reaction to the virus, not the virus itself.</p>
<p>Edit:
Because this got really popular, this seems like a good time to ELI5 about how viruses work. So inside every cell is the instructions, for the cell to make all the proteins and other stuff that it needs to be a cell (DNA). Cells also contain all the machinery to 'read' the instructions in order to produce all the stuff that the cell needs to live its day to day life, and be part of the bigger living organism.  Viruses represent the simplest forms of life. They are essentially a set of instructions (DNA or RNA) wrapped in a shell (a protein).  When the virus finds a suitable cell, it inserts its set of instructions into the cell's 'machinery' to 'trick' the cell into turning out more copies of the virus. </p>
<p>Now the body doesn't like this. It doesn't want to be spending energy to replicate a virus. The body then initiates an attack on the virus-infected cells to eliminate the virus and all of its copies. This is the job of the immune system.  It wipes out these cells, or eliminate the virus from them. It does this by creating inflammation, which causes most of the symptoms of a cold because most of the viruses that cause the common cold love to replicate slightly lower temperatures (around 30 deg C) which happens to be about the temperature of your respiratory tract and sinuses. Hope this answers some of the more common questions</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Edit: It has been made clear to me that I was mistaken and I therefore retract my statement and apologize to anyone I may have offered by my error. </p>
<p>As I understand it a sore throat is most commonly caused by bacteria and by adding salt to water we make what is essentially a toxic environment and kills the bacteria and/or prevents more from forming. This also helps with the mouth sores, by keeping them clean it allows them to heal faster. As for the sinuses I'm guessing the salt helps to desolve all of the dried snot or whatever else clogs your sinuses. You could think about this kinda like how nail polish is absolutely unaffected but quickly desolves in acetone (not exactly the same but similar).</p>
<p>Keep in mind I am a chemist and approaching it from that side not the biological side</p>
<p>Edit: It was pointed out that I may have made an oversight and that the sinus wash reason might not be the best fit. A better explanation might be that saline doesn't irritate the sinus passages like regular water would.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can’t answer your question completely but salt water works well for a sore throat because it pulls out all the extra liquid that is making your throat swollen and thus hurt.  Basically it reduces the swelling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
