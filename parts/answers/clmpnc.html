		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Buddha and Fat Buddha are two different people, there is Gautama Buddha (the skinny one) and Budai (the fat one) Budai (also called laughing buddha) is a symbol of happiness and joy. Budai is thought to be a later incarnation of the original buddha (gautama). Budai is popular in chinese buddhism</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5: The term 'Buddha' is a title to indicate that a person has achieved enlightenment. Siddhartha was the most famous one so he gets portrayed as the default, in general as the skinny version. The fat version is another deity figure who also achieved 'Buddha'. Buddhism is non-theistic so there can be an infinite number of Buddhas and nobody cares which one you worship or whether you even worship one of them.</p>
<p>ELI5, TLDR: Buddha is a title not a person</p>
<p>EDIT: Siddhartha was a celebrity, not necessarily the first or the best.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
