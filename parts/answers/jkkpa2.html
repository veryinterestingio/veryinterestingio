		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As I understand it, your short term memory has limited capacity    and non learning breaks are necessary to give it time to be integrated into long term memory which seems limitless.</p>
<p>Practically that means taking breaks. In my case, science and tech, some texts are so information dense I made need a short break every 5 to 10 pages. By comparison I have occasionally read a short mystery book in a single sitting on a rainy day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's mostly already been answered but I want to make it clear that things like fatigue happen on a molecular level. Brains have limits bc everything in brains is finite. </p>
<p>1) the neurochemicals responsible for brain activity happening are finite, when they get depleted it takes time for them to replete (build back up), the body literally has to make more of them which takes time. This is why we think less clearly at the end of the day or when we have poor sleep, it's also why doing a lot of thinking (anything mentally stressful) is fatiguing.</p>
<p>2) brains run on glucose! Our bodies prefer to run on glucose (sugar) but our bodies can also burn fat when we need energy and dont have immediate access to glucose (low blood sugar), but the thing is that when we burn fat for energy fat stores are broken down into fatty acids not sugars. Our bodies can run on fatty acids but brains cannot, brains can only use glucose for energy. It's possible for our bodies to convert fatty acids into sugar but that's a long process so when our brains run out of glucose and our bodies are required to burn fat for energy the amount of time it take to convert the fatty acids into sugar contributes to mental fatigue as well (also this is part of why hangry happens).</p>
<p>3) brains generate heat! A lot of the water we drink actually goes to cooling down our brains bc brain signals happen 2 ways, with neurochemicals and with electrical signals. Each electrical signal generates a small amount of heat and when we're doing heavy thinking we create more heat than normal which means our bodies have to work even harder to cool things down and maintain homeostasis. Eventually it's possible for that homeostasis maintenance to become so difficult that your brain needs to slow down the thinking bc it can't speed up the cooling anymore than it already has and that also contributes to mental fatigue. </p>
<p>The official standard for a typical brain is a ten minute break for every 50min of mental activity but that varies from person to person and there are plenty of outliers who have different kinds of mental stamina baseline. Giving your brain glucose (like, literally eating a piece of candy), making sure you're hydrated, and making sure you're well rested so that your neurochemical stores are fresh can help increase mental stamina while  being hungry, dehydrated, or tired can decrease it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's mental fatigue. You need a break to rest your brain and to replenish the proteins you use up learning. I've heard that a peanut butter cup with an extra dollop of peanut butter on top is ideal for this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember when I was at commercial diving school we had to take dive physics. I was afraid of it. I'm terrible at math. The teacher just said &quot;Trust me. You will see and experience with your own eyes and bodies everything in this class once you get in the water.&quot;
Sure enough, the dude was right! It clicked for me. Everything in that physics class I saw and experienced in the water. From there on the tests were easy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
