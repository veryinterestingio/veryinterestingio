		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Immunologist here. Here is my general understanding on the topic:</p>
<p>1 Reduced funciton of marphages</p>
<ul>
<li>Macrophages are typically the first immune cells to encounter pathogens, so they are key in responding to infecitons. They also play a role in tissue repair and healing after the infeciton is cleared.</li>
<li>All of these functions are reduced during aging.</li>
</ul>
<p>2 Altered dendritic cell function</p>
<ul>
<li>Dendritic cells relay information on the pathogen and the infection to lymphocytes and enable their response.</li>
<li>Various aspects of this function are reduced or altered with aging.</li>
</ul>
<p>3 Reduced lymphocyte output from hematopoiesis</p>
<ul>
<li>The hematopoeitic stem cells (which gives rise to all blood cells, including immune cells) become less lymphoid-biased</li>
<li>Reduction/ complete loss of thymus means loss of capability to generate T cells- Reduced B cell progenitors in the bone marrow reduces reduced B cell output</li>
<li>This leads to a reduced pool of naive lymphocytes, which means a reduced ability to respond to novel pathogens</li>
</ul>
<p>4 Reduced lymphocyte function</p>
<ul>
<li>Accumulation of oligoclonal memory T cell pool (likely due to chronic infection) means that there is narrower range of pathogens that memory T cells can readily respond to. These T cells also often lack a key molecule that enables their response.</li>
<li>Reduced antibody produciton by B cells, and antibodies produced might be of lower quality (doesn't bind as well). The reason for this is not clear.</li>
</ul>
<p>5 Altered immune landscape</p>
<ul>
<li>Typically infections are warded off with what is known as a type 1 response. There is also something called a type 2 response, which is useful in fighting off parasites, but is also what causes allergies.</li>
<li>With age, the immune landscape becomes increasingly skewed towards type 2 response. This leads to an inappropriate response for most infections (especially viral), and causes a lot of unnecessary damage to the tissues during infection, increasing mortality.</li>
</ul>
<p>Edit. Reformatted for clarity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I took a class on immunology. One thing that might contribute to this is how the organ that produces T cells, one type of blood cell, stops working after puberty. You can still fend off most disease with T cells that are still chilling around, created by the thymus before it degrades, or with memory cells that you've created up until that point.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/115/8/1883#:~:text=In%20the%20thymus%2C%20lymphoid%20progenitors,that%20screen%20against%20self-reactivity.&text=Declining%20production%20of%20new%20naive,decline%20in%20immune%20system%20function" target="_blank">https://www.pnas.org/content/115/8/1883#:~:text=In%20the%20thymus%2C%20lymphoid%20progenitors,that%20screen%20against%20self-reactivity.&text=Declining%20production%20of%20new%20naive,decline%20in%20immune%20system%20function</a>.</p>
<p>This link mentions that declining T-cell production is related to immune system aging, which involves decrease in the effectiveness of the immune system.</p>
<p>Edit: I made my response too condense and neglected to say that the thymus begins to degrade much faster after puberty; it fully degrades in old age. You'll still have some new T cell production.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Tl:dr: long distance cycling for a sample of elderly people helped their immune systems to be as healthy as 20 year olds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
