		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The mRNA in the vaccine is much more fragile than the actual virus</li>
<li>We need to carefully control dosage in order to maximize effectiveness while minimizing side effects. Injection allows much more fine tuning</li>
<li>Hypodermic needles are cheap and universally available, which is a meaningful factor when trying to vaccinate billions of people quickly</li>
<li>Nasal-spray vaccines are contraindicated for large slices of the population, especially those with breathing problems like asthma or the elderlyâ€”i.e., some of the most important people to vaccinate against COVID-19</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Is it possible, there are just higher risks of side effects. For a number of years a &quot;live attenuated&quot; flu vaccine which gets sprayed up the nose was around, but has fallen out of favor because studies couldn't prove it was effective</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/jonas-salk-and-albert-bruce-sabin" target="_blank">Sabin's polio vaccine</a> was taken orally, was a live (weaker strain?) virus, which had a good sideeffect there that the vaccine could actually spread person-to-person, so each vaccine administered could help prevent it in numerous other people (good because polio was so common in the environment, so prevented much more harm than the risk that caused). But medicine has the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath" target="_blank">Hippocratic oath</a> which a big part of that is to ensure to not accidently cause widespread side effects randomly, which are more common with the live virus vaccines and the risks are seen as too great</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
