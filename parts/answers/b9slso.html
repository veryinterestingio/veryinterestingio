		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no generally agreed upon theory. But one of the more prevalent ones currently is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_world" target="_blank">RNA world hypothesis</a>. Today we have DNA with the main role of storing genetic information, and proteins as the main functional unit that performs the majority of biological processes and cellular functions. RNA can be both a molecule for storing genetic information as well as a functional molecule, although it doesn't do either of those as well as DNA or proteins. In the RNA world hypothesis, the origin of life happened with RNA, and then DNA and proteins came later to take over for most of what RNA did originally as more specialized and efficient molecules. </p>
<p>As for the first RNA, again we don't know but one hypothesis is similar to what you propose in your question. There was a nucleotide-rich soup with some source of energy that caused the nucleotides to spontaneously form chains. Some of these chains happened to have the property that they were self-replicating, and at that point evolution by natural selection kicks in. The sequences of nucleotides that are better at self-replicating become more prevalent than the ones that are worse at it, or can't do it at all. Any mutation that makes them better at replicating would replace the previous ones. Eventually mutations would occur that cause the RNA to use other molecules in the environment to form a protective barrier, creating the first cell. And so on until you have Kevin Hart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I wrote a paper about the two main schools of thought concerning the origins of life a few years ago, and I’ll attempt to summarize from memory to the best of my ability. Note that, by now, this is likely outdated but it was one of the few term paper I wrote that I found extremely interesting so maybe you will too. </p>
<p>The two theories were hotly debated for a while via scientific journals, which was hilarious to read through (any time a publication begins with “In response to”, there’s some serious scientific snack talk about to go down). I can’t remember their names but these scientists came up with replication first and metabolism first. </p>
<p>In replication first, it essentially looks to the Miller-Urey experiment and expands on it, allowing that complex organic molecules can come about naturally, but that doesn’t automatically mean life. The theory explores the possibility of nucleic acids being created and becoming concentrated enough in certain areas to allow them to form into a primitive RNA molecule that was able to self replicate using more nearby nucleic acids. As the replication continued and interacted with other organic molecules, it would eventually lead into the creation of proteins and phospholipid membranes, which from there led pretty easily into single cells organisms. </p>
<p>Metabolism first came about after the discovery of hydrothermal vents, at which they observed iron reacting with sulfate where the vents let out all of their molecule rich waters. The molecule made (I think it was iron (IV) sulfate, but not positive) had a tendency to form think membrane like films and isolate some of that vent water, which along with the heat supplied by the vents would allow the molecules to interact with each other and metabolize larger, more complex and even organic molecules rather than dissolving into the great big ocean. Eventually the metabolism led into creating some of the organic molecules necessary for life, and the membrane would eventually be replaced by the phospholipid membranes I mentioned earlier, creating the first life forms as we know (or imagine) them to be. </p>
<p>Again, all this stuff is probably not exactly correct and this was meant to be a quick overview of what a remember, but it’s been a fairly slow day at work so here’s a couple paragraphs about it. This is far from specialization I chose and I might be pulling half remembered snippets from outdated articles so I’m likely wrong on a few points, but that’s the basic gist as I remember it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First part, yes. The Miller-Urey experiment in the 1950s showed that amino acids could be created from stuff that’s deemed “inorganic.” After the amino acids were formed they were probably chained to form proteins and the proteins eventually made genetic material, which made it easier to reproduce since there was a blueprint. From there it was just a matter of evolving to sustain life, and you get all life that we have today.</p>
<p>EDIT: A lot of people seem pissed off by my explanation, but the subreddit is called “Explain Like I’m 5” not “Explain Like the 5 Year Old has a Background in Organic Chemistry.” </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing to keep in mind in this discussion is that the notion of &quot;life&quot; in this question is somewhat arbitrary. If you take the notion of life out of your question, it doesn't really harm the question in any meaningful way.</p>
<p>The insight here is that if you have a lot of different things bumping around in the primordial soup, there are lots (and lots, and LOTS) of different reactions that could happen and products that could result. The only thing limiting what will actually get produced is:</p>
<ul>
<li>are the reaction pathways available?</li>
<li>are the reactants available?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a large library of reactants to choose from and you put them in contact with each other, those reactants will take <em>all</em> available pathways and <em>all</em> products of those pathways will be produced. If you provide energy into the system, you will open up a set of pathways that weren't open before, and possibly close a set of pathways that were open previously. So if you have these reactants available in a wide variety of different contexts, with all these different pathways available from moment to moment, you can expect over time that all products that can result will result.</p>
<p>If you think about this teeming soup, you just have a lot of stuff constantly being created and destroyed. If there's no particular preference for any one state, then you'll have this equilibrium that pretty much stays constant and doesn't evolve over time. This is where self replication comes into the picture. If you imagine a state where all these different compounds would be in equilibrium, except one class of these compounds has a habit of replicating itself—and if there's some subset of these compounds that are stable in the current environment—then it's easy to see how this subset of self-replicating compounds is going to take over the soup.</p>
<p>So this setup can act as a forcing function that, over time, moves the entire population of compounds into this constant march away from equilibrium which we call evolution.</p>
<p>I say all this because most people tend to think of evolution as having something to do with life. Really, though, it doesn't. We can think of life as an emergent property of a complex of these compounds…but it is neither necessary nor sufficient for evolution to occur. It's completely independent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not my area of specialty, BUT: the RNA world hypothesis seems the most likely start to life IMO.  RNA can be formed from inorganic molecules, has enzymatic activity, can be translated into protein or reverse transcribed into DNA, and can self replicate. While these functions are somewhat advanced, they could be acquired over time, especially once the replication hurdle is passed. DNA or proteins alone cannot perform this myriad of functions. Also if RNA vs Protein is the choice argument, all known organisms require an RNAs to transport individual amino acids for protein synthesis - it seems more likely to me that RNA developed the ability to pick up amino acids to then match to the already existing RNA sequences, rather than have proteins somehow adopt RNA for multiple functions for replication all at once.</p>
<p>Edit: To clarify the &quot;not my specialty&quot; part, I'm a PhD candidate studying developmental genetics, but I don't focus on evolutionary biology at all. My knowledge of this stuff is strictly from undergrad.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
