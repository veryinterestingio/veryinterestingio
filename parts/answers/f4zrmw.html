Like all of our muscles that allow us to make facial expressions tears help convey emtoions, which is incredibly useful for our species which has evolved with social ability in mind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You will usually find after a good cry, you tend to feel better. That's because it's a reflex of self-soothing that releases endorphins that chemically makes your brain calmer, lessens pain and makes you feel better overall.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you become aroused, emotionally or physically, your sympathetic nervous system increases its activity. Your sympathetic nervous system is identical to many other animal's in that it increases in activation when you need to fight, run away, or freeze up until the danger passes. Your heart rate goes up, you breathe harder, and blood rushes from your guts to your extremities so that you are prepared to survive whatever life is throwing your way at the moment. </p>
<p>Crying is a by-product of the activation of the parasympathetic nervous system. The parasympathetic nervous system ramps up activity when your sympathetic nervous system is ramped up (usually when you're very happy, very sad, very angry, or very nervous). As activity increases in the parasympathetic system, it decreases activity of the sympathetic nervous system, so that you won't die from your heart and respiration rate going up beyond the danger zone for an extended period of time. </p>
<p>In sum, crying is regulatory: you cry to lower your heart and respiration rate, and it also allows for the re-activation of the parts of your brain that were shut off (most importantly, the logical problem-solving part of your brain) due to extreme activation of your flight/fight/freeze response to something that stressed you out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
