		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First they text extensively in animals. There are a specific set of tests for genotoxicity and teratogenic toxicity, basically testing if there are any effects of the drug on genes or the foetus.</p>
<p>Assuming all of these tests get 'passed' there's then testing in healthy volunteers to check drug safety, testing in people with the condition they're trying to treat to test if there's any kind of response to the drug and check for how much they can give. Finally, they test in large populations of people to see if the drug works as intended.</p>
<p>After all of that, if they want to use the drug in pregnant women, there are more tests to be carried out which would include pregnant women themselves. However, the evidence threshold to even get to that point is so high. It need to be pretty certain there won't be any adverse effects whatsoever before the regulatory agencies would allow it to happen.</p>
<p>This is part of the reason most drugs are not permissible for use in pregnant or breastfeeding women.</p>
<p>Drug companies also have to be very careful not to coerce people into taking part in trials by paying them too much. The incentive shouldn't be a financial one. It can be tricky to convince a pregnant person to take part in a potentially risky trial. So recruiting enough people is a further barrier to drug development.</p>
<p>TL;DR It's really hard to do so. Companies and regulators have to be pretty certain there won't be any negative impacts on the mother or baby before allowing it to happen</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in clinical trials for pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>Its a very difficult process to get that far. There are several stages that it takes to get there, but basically they're one of the last groups to get tested on. With any drug or vaccine, once you get to human trials, you start with the healthiest individuals you can find. Young, fit, great vitals with little to no preexisting conditions. You test it on them to figure out if there's any major issues in the human body, severe side effects, etc. Then from there you move on to increasingly less healthy people/people who need it. </p>
<p>Eventually, pregnant women and children come along. One of the first things we learn in training for clinical trials is ethics. More importantly, to always remember to be as unbiased and neutral as possible when advertising your study. No outrageous incentives that may cause people to take more risks than they would've otherwise, make it clear what this drug is and how it works, what side effects you're expecting, and explain it to them in a way they can understand. You can't throw big medical terms at someone if they don't understand them, so make it clear. There's more guidelines as well when it comes to what are called vulnerable populations. These are generally children, pregnant women, elders, and prisoners. You need to adapt to who you're dealing with. You can't offer a prisoner parole for participating or a child's parents ludicrous money so they force their kid to participate.</p>
<p>With pregnant women specifically, you need to make sure that the pregnant mother understands and considers fully the risk to herself and her child. These drugs may cause long term health issues we don't know about yet. Does the mother understand that and is she making a clear and conscious decision?</p>
<p>Once they're in the trial, they monitor both the mother and the baby's vitals, blood, etc. a closely as they can to ensure their health. At any moment, the mother is allowed to drop out and you are required to let her do so.</p>
<p>TL:DR, very difficult. There are lots of ethical hurdles to even get them into the study. Once they're in, you're monitoring the two of them as closely as possibly, ideally around trained medical staff 24/7.</p>
<p>Edit added in later: Also, for trials with healthy non-pregnant individuals, there are strict contraceptive rules that the subjects must follow if they're not staying in house. If they don't, they can be ejected from the study, excluded from further dosing, and then kept into strict monitoring for health issues. The bigger incentive tends to be the pay dock for getting pregnant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Isn’t it also that many people don’t know they are pregnant when they get the vaccine? The CDC has the vsafe program, where they invite pregnant people to register to track their outcomes, and on NPR they discussed how people who find out they are pregnant after getting the shot are many of the people in the program. That doesn’t give much info on later pregnancies of course.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Clinical research Sponsor here :) I do want to first note that clinical research guidelines and regulations are primarily REACTIVE, not PROACTIVE. So remember that this ban on pregnant women comes from unethical historical atrocities (see: Benedictin), and was designed and implemented to prevent the same thing from happening again. </p>
<p>Every study has to show equipoise (benefit&gt;risk) - where, if there is more than minimal risk (typically, an observational or blood draw only study), the study must show a reasonable potential benefit that outweighs the potential risk.</p>
<p>It's like if you're trying to figure out whether it's profitable to flip a house. Is the cost of the house + flip expenses more or less than market value? By how much? What's the risk if the renovation doesn't go as planned?</p>
<p>To do this, you need data. It is highly unlikely that pregnant women will be included in a 'first in human' study because you can't really quantify the risk/benefit ratio. Using the 'house flip' comparison, you'd look at sales histories and market values to see what kind of profit you would reasonably expect. Without human data, you can't do that, so you won't be able to justify testing on pregnant women yet.</p>
<p>But once you have more human data, then you can build that comparison to show that you have equipoise for the pregnant women study participants. So if the COVID vaccine was taken off label by, say, 1,000 women and those women had only mild side effects and normal births, then since we know that COVID is harmful in pregnant women, you could build your case to show benefit&gt;risk in study COVID vaccine during pregnancy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
