		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some answers cannot be given, they have to be rediscovered by each individual through their own experience.</p>
<p>But each one's capability to find those kind of answers depends on their inquisitiveness.</p>
<p>You choose how deep you want to explore, more depth involves more challenge but also higher satisfaction.</p>
<p>However the really good questions are those that do not agree with your view of the world and yourself. Those questions are the enemy of ego and therefore we tend to ignore them.</p>
<p>Growing is learning to ask the questions you need to face over those that agree with what you already think. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can probably remember about a tenth of the material I learned at university.</p>
<p>But that's not terribly important, because the material you cover isn't the medicine, it's the spoon. </p>
<p>Doing a degree teaches you how to study, how to analyse, how to critically evaluate, how to prioritise and schedule, how to cope with large projects and tight deadlines, how to bullshit, how to recognise bulshit, how to filter large amounts of irrelevant material to zero in on the information you need, how to carefully read requirements, how to know your limits and work within/around them, how to deal with bureaucracy, how to take on far too much work at once, how to push yourself until you bleed getting deliverables in on time, how to take notes and summarize, how to condense large amounts of knowledge into understanding, how to organize and outline a jumbled mass of details into a coherent, directed structure,how to quickly familiarise yourself with a set of texts bigger than your fucking genome, how to problem-solve and troubleshoot, how to ask useful questions, and a hundred other skills.</p>
<p>And it makes you practice them until your brains damn near fall out of your head, under truly excessive amounts of stress. </p>
<p><em>That</em> is the valuable part of doing a degree. </p>
<p>Along the way, you might even pick up some knowledge and experience in your field of expertise - but that's very much a bonus if so. </p>
<p>For most part, the actual material is just a means to an end. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
