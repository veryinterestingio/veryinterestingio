		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The MMR vaccine and DTaP vaccine each induce antibody production against three different agents. MMR for measles, mumps, and rubella. DTaP for diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis.</p>
<p>To be technically precise, the antibodies induced by the tetanus portion of DTaP works against the toxin, not the causative organism. The rest are effective against the organisms themselves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally, you end up with immunity to both. Most vaccines won't really interact with each other. Your body would see it as two different (fake) infections and respond  in much the same way that it would if you were simultaneously exposed to multiple infections ... which is actually a thing that happens frequently in your body.</p>
<p>However, that's not a thing you should assume is universal. A good counter-example is Influenza. The yearly Influenza vaccine is usually a mix of vaccines for four to six Influenza strains that were selected as the highest risk candidates. A common question is &quot;Why just pick four? Why not vaccinate against all of them?&quot; Well, we'd need an immunologist to explain all the details, but the short version is that your body wouldn't see a strong enough infection from any particular strain to develop a strong immunity to any of them. There are dozens or hundreds of Influenza strains (depending on how you classify). Scientists did try making a huge mix of vaccines. The protection is weak, or short-lived, or both. The issue here seems to be that the strains of Influenza are all different, but a little too similar to trigger a strong immunity. So, you'd want to limit the number of similar viruses you vaccinate for in a single dose.</p>
<p>For COVID, there aren't enough variants and not enough variation to really make this a concern at the moment (and if we can all act responsibly for a few more months, there will be even less potential for more variants). It seems possible to make a vaccine that provides sufficient immunity to all the current variants and even if we got to the point where we had to mix a few, that would still be possible. It's pretty unlikely that we're going to need do mix a vaccines for a dozen variants.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are vaccines that start antibody production for six different diseases. They are called Hexavalent vaccines. But you can't just &quot;mix&quot; them. A lot of testing and work goes into determining the interactions between drug substances in the vial and viruses in the body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The part of the immune system that gives us long lasting immunity and antibodies (the adaptive immune system) literally uses shapes of molecules to tell what it needs to attack. We call these shapes 'epitopes'. The body doesn't attack its own epitopes, it kills any immune cell that would before it can, but basically anything else is fair game. Most proteins are big enough that they have multiple recognisable shapes on their structure, so even with one vaccine the immune system produces multiple antibodies. With two, the body will see these various epitopes on both and probably produce several antibodies to both vaccines and both diseases.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
