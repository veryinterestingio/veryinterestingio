		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Muscle memory.  The specific brain-to-nerve-to-muscle connection required to press the B key is seared into your system from thousands of repetitions, but it doesn’t also link to the part of your brain that half-assedly remembers that keyboards start with QWERTY.</p>
<p>You’ll see this in most physical skills.  Try to describe in words how to run or how to swallow.  It’s something your muscles just do without invoking other parts of the brain, and those other parts will struggle to articulate how it works.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short : muscle memory</p>
<p>The long answer, as you type you start learning instinctively what key each letter is on, but at the same time you stop having to look at the keyboard as much, so you forget where each key is from memory, but you can still type them from subconscious memory</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
