		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mercury replaces calcium, sodium, and iodine in body chemistry, disrupting the workings of these dependent bodily functions. For example, your thyroid will absorb mercury instead of iodine, it will disrupt your immune system functions. Your body uses calcium and sodium to transfer oxygen through cell membranes, mercury disrupts this transport system; it raises cell PH. Mercury causes inflammation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mercury can pass through you skin and get into your body.  Like most thing that don't belong inside your body, it messes up stuff.  It gets in the way of all sorts of different processes.  There are lots of thing like this, but what makes mercury so dangerous is that none of your organs are any good at filtering out mercury.  So it stays inside your body for a long time.  You cannot easily pee it out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The biggest concern is inhaling mercury. The mercury in florescent light bulbs is in a vapor form and easily inhaled. This is especially dangerous to developing nervous systems like the ones found in babies and developing fetuses. This is also why there are warnings for pregnant women to watch their mercury laden fish consumption. Once the nervous system is developed mercury is much less of a concern. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a heavy metal like lead, so the pure metal isn't really dangerous to touch, but it's breathing the vapors or absorbing organic mercury compounds that's really, really dangerous</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
