		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some statistics for comparison:</p>
<p>Nevada: Land area 286,367 sqkm  population: 1 million circa 1970</p>
<p>Japan: Land area 377,915 sqkm  population: 71million est circa 1945</p>
<p>Takeaway. Nevada is huge and very (very) empty of people. And most of the tests were done underground \~90%</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There were huge numbers of fallout-related deaths in Hiroshima and Nagasaki due in large part to the simple fact that those bombs detonated in an area with a high population density.  By comparison, the Nevada desert is empty for miles and miles and miles.  You can't kill people if they aren't around.</p>
<p>There certainly was fallout resulting from the Nevada tests, and there certainly was environmental impact.  (By fallout what is meant here is transmutation of elements in the ground by the bomb's radiation - that radiation takes innocuous elements in the ground and turns them into radioactive isotopes that stick around for a long time.)  You can't really avoid either one - all you can do is try to minimize the detrimental effects.  Above-ground detonations place the fallout into the prevailing winds, where it's carried away and deposited where it settles out.  Underground detonations place the fallout underground, where groundwater contamination is the bigger concern.  Neither of these options is much fun.</p>
<p>Doing these tests in the desert is an effort to mitigate both of these... you have a vast and empty area, so most of the fallout from above-ground testing will settle in the empty desert, and you have a place where there's comparatively little groundwater moving around, which hopefully minimizes the transport of the underground fallout.</p>
<p>TL;DR - there was plenty of significant environmental impact in Nevada.  The impact (and the degree to which people give a shit about it... people tend not to care much about empty desert) is just different, due to the minimizing effects of the desert environment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There were repercussions. I was part of the St Louis baby tooth survey.
&quot;The results of a more comprehensive study of the elements found in the teeth collected showed that children born in 1963 had levels of strontium 90 in their baby teeth that were 50 times higher than those found in children born in 1950, before the advent of large-scale atomic testing. The findings helped convince U.S. President John F. Kennedy to sign the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty with the United Kingdom and Soviet Union, which ended the above-ground nuclear weapons testing that placed the greatest amounts of nuclear fallout into the atmosphere.&quot;
