		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is not the same.</p>
<p>Fossil fuel automobiles can convert about 25% (the very most efficient is just over 30%) of the energy to movement of the vehicle, the rest is waste heat - mostly out the tail pipe.</p>
<p>A fossil fueled power plant can convert over 60% of the fossil fuel energy into electricity*.</p>
<p>Electric motors can be about 90% efficient at converting the electricity to movement.</p>
<p>So if all electric power for all electric cars was generated by (modern) fossil fueled power plants the overall efficiency would be about 40%. A 60% improvement over fuel efficient automobiles - that is a huge difference. Or a 150% improvement over the average gasoline powered car on the road today which has about 16% thermal efficiency.</p>
<p>100% fossil fuel * 60% power plant efficiency * 93% power grid efficiency * 90% battery charging efficiency * 90% motor controller efficiency * 90% motor efficiency = 40% overall efficiency for an electric car powered by fossil fuel generated electricity.</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p>*Roughly 1/3 of electrical generation in the USA is from coal (which is \~33% efficient), 1/3 is from natural gas which is about 50% efficient if you average the different types of natural gas plants (which range from 40% to  more than 60% efficient depending upon how modern the equipment is). That makes for an average fossil fuel thermal efficiency of about 44% in the USA, generating 66% of all electrical power.</p>
<p>Renewable energy (including nuclear) in the USA makes up the other third which for this example we consider to be 100% efficient - since it is carbon neutral. Average these all together and the overall electrical energy generating efficiency in the USA is about 61%. With modernization that number will climb.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of places have greener sources of power like Hydro, Nuclear, and renewables.</p>
<p>But even if you generate power from coal or other fossil fuels, it's much more efficient to generate power that way than burning fuel in cars. So it's still an improvement.</p>
<p>As electric cars become more common place the power grid will follow suit and improve itself adding more renewables.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gasoline vehicles run on gasoline, which only comes from fossil fuels. </p>
<p>Diesel vehicles run on diesel fuel, but can also run on bio-diesel. Either way, though, the oil is still being burnt and causing emissions into the air. </p>
<p>Similar idea with natural gas vehicles. </p>
<p>Electric vehicles, on the other hand, can use electricity from any source, and produce no local emissions aside from some excess heat. So they can be powered from coal plants. Or nuclear. Wind. Solar. Trash burners. Anything that generates electricity can charge your car. </p>
<p>So yes, a significant portion of the electricity is <em>currently</em> produced from non-renewables, but electric cars will still work just the same once they’re not, and that’s a beautiful thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically it comes down to efficiency. Charging an electric car with electricity produced burning coal is still much more power efficient in relation to carbon produced than it is to combust gasoline in an ICE vehicle</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>So why is it better to use electric cars if the generated pollution and impact on the environment is the same?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because it's not the same.  Even if you account for the contribution of fossil fuels to the energy an EV uses, <a href="https://blog.ucsusa.org/dave-reichmuth/new-data-show-electric-vehicles-continue-to-get-cleaner" target="_blank">99% of the US' population</a> live in places where driving a Model 3 will yield lower per-mile emissions than even a Prius.  In Europe, EVs <a href="https://www.transportenvironment.org/sites/te/files/downloads/T%26E%E2%80%99s%20EV%20life%20cycle%20analysis%20LCA_0.pdf" target="_blank">also realize significantly lower lifecycle emissions than diesels</a>.  Overall, electric cars <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-020-0488-7" target="_blank">are a better choice in 95% of the world</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
