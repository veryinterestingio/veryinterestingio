		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're called Wilson clouds, and they're caused by the shockwave of the explosion.</p>
<p>The pressure front of an explosion causes a decrease in pressure to occur behind it. This is intuitive to anyone who has ever made a wave in their bathtub: in a closed system like the atmosphere, any increase in density somewhere has to correspond to a reduction somewhere else. With a gas, a decrease in density translates to a decreased temperature: this is another effect that you can witness for yourself by playing with compressed air: as the pressure inside the can is reduced by venting the compressed air, it rapidly cools. This is the same mechanic used by refrigeration systems across the planet.</p>
<p>On a large scale explosion like a nuclear detonation, the power of the shockwave can cause <em>substantial</em> cooling of the atmosphere, dropping it below dew point. When this happens, the humidity of the air condenses into water droplets, forming the ring clouds that we see around the explosion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are called condensation clouds and are speculated to form during large explosions in humid air due to the shock wave passing an area leaving a low pressure wake behind it in localized areas. The low pressure drops the region below its dew point and the humid air condenses and becomes visible. It's the same effect we see when fast moving planes pass through humid air and condensation forms in the air passing over the aircraft.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Essentially the same reason why aircraft flying at transsonic speeds often produce a sort of cloud around them.</p>
<p>The shockwave (whether it's caused by an explosion or a supersonic aircraft) has a high pressure front, and a trailing low pressure zone. The low pressure zone causes temperature to drop. If the temperature drops below dew point, moisture in the air condenses into water droplets. Sometimes this is a transient phenomenon (meaning it appears and disappears almost immediately), but sometimes the droplets can linger afterwards and form a cloud.</p>
<p>Also, if you consider a photograph (a snapshot) of a particular moment with the shockwave expanding outwards, you will see what appear to be static &quot;rings&quot; around the mushroom, because that's basically where the shockwave had just passed when the photograph was taken.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
