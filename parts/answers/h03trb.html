		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what I know, it is best to have a consistent sleep cycle. There are several different types of cycle. For example, in many Latin countries having a mid day nap is normal  (opposed to sleeping a larger chunk at night). Changing your sleep patterns greatly from day to day is generally not good because your body doesn't have consistent time to rest and repair.
TLDR: Pick a sleep schedule and stick to it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had this discussion with a PhD around &quot;sleep science&quot; as I'm a night owl type.</p>
<p>Ultimately the result of the discussion was that living by your natural sleep cycle is best for your health. Forcing people into bad cycles (such as rotating shift schedule) reduces lifespan due to negative impacts on health.</p>
<p>Being a night owl and fighting it your whole life to wake with the early birds may also likely have negative impacts to lifespan as well, though it's not clearly understood how significantly though.</p>
<p>At least this is what I recall from the conversation.</p>
<p>Your sleep preferences are a genetic thing at the end of the day, and you can't easily switch between, but you can adapt with only mild effects.</p>
<p>I say this as I'm struggling to sleep at 3am, being the night owl type.</p>
<p>Need to work tomorrow, at 8am!!!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes.</p>
<p>It would be healthier for people to live by their natural cycle - but society isn't really built in a way that supports it, and thus in order to collaborate with other people, to access shops, to go to work etc, most people aren't given that option - and it is more healthy to be able to eat than it is to starve while ignoring the world around you.</p>
<p>People can train their bodies to get used to the 9-5 cycle - but not everybody can.</p>
<p>A person living by their natural cycle (ie, a nightowl, a morning person, etc) people tend to be more awake and energetic. Conversely, by forcing it to fit into the standard 9-5 model, people who don't fit that model will be more lethargic, at least unless they get used to their required hours.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have no idea which is the best thing to do, but I have insomnia so bad that I once had a doctor tell me to sleep whenever I can; it’s better than no sleep at all. It does nothing to help create a routine, but at least I feel like I have “permission” to take a nap when I’m so exhausted I can’t think straight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you have a consistent sleeping scedule your body will adapt to it if it's a good one (3 hours of sleep a day is not a scedule) and it will consistently feel tired and wake up at roughly the same time.</p>
<p>I've been waking up at the same minute for months, without an alarm. Why did my body decide it's going to be 08:06 I have no idea...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
