		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sneezing is triggered when something that should not be there enters your nose. Specifically, the hairs and layer of mucus in your nose. When this happens, chemicals are released that cause the nerve cells in the nose to become irritated. Once this happens, signals are sent to the brain to trigger the pharyngeal and tracheal muscles to force air through the nose with the hope of removing whatever is causing the irritation. </p>
<p>I could not find supporting evidence of this, but knowing how a sneeze works, it is likely that when you &quot;catch&quot; a sneeze before it happens, you are likely catching one of the steps in between, probably the signals telling the pharynx and tracheal muscles to activate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You consciously resist the instinct to sneeze by ignoring the signals that instigated the reflex in the first place. Some people rub their noses to confuse the brain with more signals other than the original itch. Others will lift up their  noses and eyebrows to achieve the same effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
