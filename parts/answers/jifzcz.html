		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe you meat of his idea is that we know the universe was very uniform in its early state because we see matter spread fairly evenly throughout the universe we currently observe.  If we go forward in time to the heat death of the universe, where all of the stars have long since burned out and black holes have evaporated due to hawking radiation, the universe will become a sea of uniform radiation, much like we expect to see at the beginning of our universe.  Basically the death of the universe seems to produce similar conditions needed at the start of the universe.</p>
<p>What Penrose is suggesting is that unusually warm spots in the cosmic microwave background are indications of the last blackholes evaporating at the end of the universe before this one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not precisely &quot;proof,&quot; it's more a hypothesis that seeks to explain odd phenomena in the CMB, and which might point to the existence of a prior universe.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>how did the past universe die? or start?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have no idea.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>what doo black holes have to do with the universe's origin?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's more that black holes are <em>profoundly</em> long-lived objects, such that they'll still be emitting hawking radiation long after the universe they exist in has otherwise gone cold. The spots in the CMB that Penrose is looking at are, he claims, areas of large-scale hawking radiation, where large black holes would be undergoing their final evaporation and death.</p>
<p>Thus, if we were looking for evidence of a prior universe, the best evidence might be areas that show the aftereffects of black hole evaporation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
