		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello! I'm a developmental biologist. Specifically, I study how the cells that become the brain and nervous system know exactly what to become.</p>
<p>TL;DR: cells use a variety of methods to figure out 'when' in development they are, and where they are. Most commonly, they count how many different choices have been made to identify 'when'. To identify 'where', certain cells act as landmarks, and give off chemical signals. The stronger the signal, the closer a cell is to the landmark. DNA contains specific instructions on how to interpret this combination of 'when' and 'where'. </p>
<p>In detail:</p>
<p>Let's start with DNA. We often here DNA compared to a recipe book, with genes being recipes. I prefer to think of it as a choose-your-own-adventure. A zygote (which is what we call the cell made when an egg and sperm fuse) doesn't actually have access to the whole of its DNA. Most of it is packed tightly away. It does have access to 'chapter one', which mostly begins 'if no other chapters are open, start here'.</p>
<p>This cell will divide many times, and eventually change shape. In order for a cell to know what chapter to read, it needs to know two things: where in the zygote/embryo it is, and 'when' in development it is. Embryonic cells are extremely accurate at identifying this information. We don't know all the ways they do this yet. However, we know of some mechanisms.</p>
<p>First, there's the DNA-CYOA book itself. Every time a cell 'opens' a new chapter, with a new set of instructions, it packs away some of the old, no-longer-relevant chapters. It labels them extensively in the process, in case they're needed again. And when I say it packs the DNA away, I mean that literally. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kevin_Verstrepen/publication/51196608/figure/fig1/AS:276923784679429@1443035183356/Chromatin-structure-DNA-is-wrapped-around-a-histone-octamer-to-form-nucleosomes.png" target="_blank">This is a diagram</a> of DNA in various packed and unpacked forms. At the top is the famous double helix. In reality, DNA only exists in this fully unpacked form while it's being read. Next, is 'tidied' up DNA. This is accessible, but not actively being read. Then as you go further down, it gets more and more packed away and inaccessible.</p>
<p>That's what it looks like when a DNA sequence is 'turned off' - it's literally filed and packed away. You may have heard of epigenetics. This is the collective term for the molecular tags that label DNA, and the molecular duct tape that keeps DNA packed up safely.</p>
<p>When a cell divides, it copies its epigenetic pattern out - and so the daughter cells have the same bits of the book packed away and labelled. Going back to the CYOA book, this is like a bookmark. This is one of the ways that a cell can tell 'when' it is in development. If it's at chapter 13, it knows that chapters 1-12 have already been read. </p>
<p>As for 'where', let me introduce you to my favourite protein: Sonic Hedgehog, aka SHH (That's genuinely the name of the protein). SHH is what's known as a 'morphogen'. It's a signal that tells cells what to become. In SHH's case, it tells cells how far they are from a certain landmark.</p>
<p>It's used in a number of different contexts, but neural development is what I know best, so I'll use that as an example. Before your brain became a brain, it was a tube - called the neural tube. This runs along the whole back of the embryo, and eventually becomes the brain and spinal chord. In early development, it's the factory where the entire nervous system is made.</p>
<p>The cells on the very bottom of the neural tube make a ton of SHH. Other cells sense how much SHH there is around them by eating up the SHH that bumps into them at the right spots. This means that really near the bottom, there's a ton of SHH, while near the middle, there's very little. At the top, there's none at all. This is called a concentration gradient. Cells in the neural tube count how much SHH they eat, and then refer back to their DNA books. The instructions tell them to open certain chapters if they eat enough SHH, and close others. Cells also check with their neighbours, also through chemical signals, to see if they agree on decisions. The result is a very specific link between SHH concentration (and thus distance from the SHH producing cells) and cell identity. </p>

Found the same image <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/HarshaKumar2/dorsoventral-patterning-of-the-brain" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/dneu.22015" target="_blank">this</a> is the original citation</em>. Cells with different identities produce different proteins. In this picture, those proteins have been dyed different colours, showing the pattern of cell identities in a cross section of the neural tube.</p>
<p>The graph on the left shows different genetic chapters, basically. Each of those horizontal stripes represents a different type of cell - a motor neuron, or a type of sensory neuron, or maybe an <del>dendrite</del> astrocyte. You'll see that they're turned 'on' at a specific distance from the bottom, and turned off further away. The combination of genetic chapters that are 'open' determines cell identity.</p>
<p>Finally, we have chemotaxis. When a cell is 'finished' with its time in the neural tube - ie. The factory, it will migrate out and go to where it is needed. It does this in a very similar manner to SHH signalling. Landmark cells emit a signal. Each landmark emits a different kind of signal. Cells with different identities have machinery that allows them to sense only very specific signals. They then follow the concentration gradient towards the source.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To try and explain in layman terms, as the cell divides from the first cell, it undergoes commitment, it begins to become a certain cell. The way the cells do this, is by expelling signal molecules from themselves, so called cytokines. Lets explain them with colours and dye.</p>
<p>So imagine that a cell is sending out blue dye, the cell next to it has receptors, they asses the blue dye concentration, it knows it is right next to a cell expelling blue dye. Then the next cell, it also receives blue dye, but it is diluted, because the cell sending out blue dye is 2 cells away. A high concentration of blue dye, triggers a cell response, that lead to certain DNA being activated, while a lesser concentration received leads to another  DNA response. The dye doesn't travel very far, like a pulse in all directions. For the sake of example, we can say that it can be detected up to 5 cells away. That is, the cells detect, and understand if they are 3 cells away, or 5 cells away, based on the concentration of the dye it detects. Then on the other side of these cells, is another cell, sending out yellow dye. Now the colours get mixed up. According to their concentration, the cell then &quot;knows&quot;, it as pretty far away from a blue dye, close to a yellow, and that precisely triggers molecular reactions that then in turn leads it to read certain parts of it's DNA, making a specific protein in certain concentrations. It will make a lot of one protein from receiving strong blue, make a low amount of another protein from receiving weak yellow. While the presence of blue, yellow, and a red dye , makes it read completely different places on the DNA.</p>
<p>Now imagine all the cells spewing out all kinds of colours, the individual cell from this completely knowing where it is in relation to the other cells, and told what it is supposed to become from the palette it receives.</p>
<p>Now last I studied this, researchers couldn't really see much difference in the cells before there were 8 of them. From 1 to 2 to 4 to 8, they seemed the same. They are not of course, they are already becoming determined, but the researchers insight did not allow them to identify the details. Maybe that has changed by now. But determination is based on the cytokines the cell receives, and in what concentration.</p>
<p>Edit: As I am reading this debate, a guy writes that wolverine with his regeneration could be real. Yes, that is called stemcells. And that is stemcell research. If we imagine from the first cell, it being the top of a pyramid, then the cells divide and becomes determined as steps down unto a pyramid. As they divdide, they become more and more a specific cell doing a specific job, be it a white blood cell, or a liver cell. Untill the bottom layer of the pyramid, which resembles all the cells having become what they were designed to be.</p>
<p>But during this development down the pyramid, some cells step aside, they stop where they are, and no longer takes information from cytokine signalling. They just stay there, they are stemcells. Later in life, something might happen to you, a liver disease for example, you might be short of a certain type of cell. The stemcell, in the pyramid layers above, can become the cell you need. It starts dividing again, like the other cells did when you developed into a human. One of the cells that divide, stay inert as before, it is the stemcell. But the other new cell begins it's travel down the pyramid, as it divides again and again, becoming the cell that you are short of, a specific livercell for example.</p>
<p>A stemcell that is high up in the pyramid, can become all the cells that trail down from its vantagepoint, it is called a pluripotent stemcell, it can divide and become many different cell types. A very early stemcell, from shortly after conception, can become any cell in the body, it is called an omnipotent stemcell.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a bit complex, but in simple terms, the initial stage of specialization is called <strong>specification</strong>, where cells can be reversibly designated to a specific cell type. Then it is followed by  <strong>determination</strong>, which defines the said cell to having a particular function in the future. A cell can still become any cell type, even after specification. There are multiple pathways that determination may occur, such as the presence of specific mRNA and proteins, or it could be due to different secretions of molecules from nearby cells. These particular molecules are called <strong>morphogens</strong> and can cause nearby cells to enter certain developmental pathways.</p>
<p>After specification/determination, we have <strong>differentiation.</strong> After the fate of the cell has been determined, the cell undergoes changes to develop into the determined cell type (ie. structure, biochemistry, function, etc).  We call cells that give rise to other cells that have not yet differentiated as stem cells. There are different labels we can give these cells based on their differentiating ability; (totipotent, pluripotent, multipotent) which you might have heard of.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The egg cell from mom has a huge amount of cytoplasm. In this huge amount of cytoplasm are things called cytoplasmic determinants of which there are many different types. When the egg cell is fertilized by a sperm cell and begins to divide, the cytoplasmic determinants are evenly distributed amongst the new cells that form. Though they are evenly distributed, the types of determinants and the amount of each type that end up in each cell are different. These determinants act as chemical signals that will begin to tell the cell what type of cell it should be. In subsequent divisions, the same thing happens. Eventually, the cells will also start to create signals to tell surrounding cells “hey, I’m going to be this type of cell, so you become something else, ok?”. This happens until the whole human (or other sexually produced organism) is made! The cytoplasmic determinants decide what genes to turn on and off in each cell. </p>
<p>As a side note, this is why egg production in meiosis is quality over quantity. Each month, only one egg cell results. If you remember high school bio meiosis, you might remember the result of meiosis is 4 genetically different daughter cells. In the case of sperm production, that is true. In the case of egg production, you get 1 egg cell (with the huge amount of cytoplasm I mentioned) and 3 polar bodies. The polar bodies supplement the 1 egg cell. This is why <em>most</em> human births are singleton births. There should really only be 1 egg available for fertilization.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
