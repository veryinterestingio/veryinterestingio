		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily stress hormones... Adhd will cause it too. The brain shifts between thoughts or scenarios and can't settle down to &quot;power saving mode&quot;.
Sometimes redoing your &quot;bedtime&quot; routine will get the brain inline, sometimes just getting up and doing something...drinking water, trip to bathroom, sit on couch in the dark for 5 minutes will work.</p>
<p>Sometimes watching tv for 5 minutes, youtube video.... Basically something to distract your brain from it's &quot;cycle&quot; and get it to focus on a single thing, then it can follow the bedtime/sleep process.
If you find yourself worried about tasks or something you don't want to forget that can cause an adhd brain fits...keep a notebook and pen nearby... jot down the important thing(s) and your brain will likely stop stressing and sleep.</p>
<p>I have decades of experience with this ...sometimes months of insomnia until morning and catching up on sleep on weekends... If it happens alot talk to your dr about it. Several pharma options.
Start with melatonin and Benadryl (Diphenhydramine) for occasional otc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

And sugar is a depressant it makes you not hyper. “But why do kids get hyper when exposed to cakes and soda” because super high doses of sugar is usually accompanied by some exciting event like a birthday.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
