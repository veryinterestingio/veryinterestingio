		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Picture this: the space around you is a massive piece of fabric and that gravity are balls of different weights placed in random places of that fabric. By putting a heavy ball on the fabric, it creates a little “crater” and if you put another lighter ball in this crater, it basically rolls toward the heavier ball. This rolling of the lighter ball to the heavier ball is gravitational pull.</p>
<p>Then comes light. Imagine light to travel like a drop of water along the fabric at a constant speed that does not change. What you perceive as time is essentially the duration it takes for a drop of water (i.e. light) to reach your eyes from an object. Now, if you picture a large heavy ball in the middle of a big sheet of fabric versus a small light ball in placed in the the same position of this sheet of fabric - the distance of the balls to your eyes will seem the same. However, due to the weight of the heavier ball creating a larger “crater”, the actual amount of fabric between you an the heavier ball is actually larger. Going back to the water droplet that is light, light will take a longer time to travel from the larger heavier object to you because it needs to traverse a greater amount of fabric (and it’s speed remains constant). This longer time it takes is a simplified explanation how gravity warps time</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think about it like this: The speed of light is a universal constant. Nothing can travel faster, not even information, or reality. So in a very real sense, the speed of light is also the speed of time. The speed of reality. </p>
<p>Also, space and time are two facets of the same thing. They even call it space-time. </p>
<p>Gravity isn't a field or a force at all. It is the effect that matter in the universe has on space-time. It curves space, and since they are the same thing, gravity also curves time. So the closer you get to a massive object, the more compressed time becomes. When you were floating in space (or orbiting a mass) you are experiencing uncompressed time. </p>
<p>Now for acceleration: When you roll down a hill you accelerate, right? In relativity calculations, gravity and acceleration are the same thing with different names. Areas of space-time get compressed by massive objects. As you approach a massive object, the compressed time feels normal to you, but an outside observer is experiencing uncompressed time, so your and their measurements of your speed would be different. As you approach the mass you experience time the same, but an observer in orbit would see you falling more slowly because of the compression effect. The more massive the object, the more pronounced the difference. </p>
<p>If someone saw you fall into a black hole, they would see you zip into it at enormous speed, but from your perspective, it would take much longer. The event horizon non-physical area around the black hole where the gravity is so strong that the speed of light is not fast enough to overcome the space-time compression. And remember that acceleration and gravity are the same thing. The effect is so pronounced that if you were in a spaceship that accelerated to near the speed of light, a trip to the nearest star might seem like 4 years to an outside observer, but would only seem like 8 months to you. </p>
<p>If it's hard to grasp, don't worry, even though we know that the universe works in this way, it's very counterintuitive. We can prove it mathematically, and confirm it's true with observations, but any physicist will admit that is very hard to understand because the scale that we live at, Newtonian physics rules. Our brains are meant to understand cause an effect of small objects. During our evolution we were never challenged with universal constants that affect black holes. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gravity is what we call the math that explains how objects move. We can predict a lot stuff using that math. We can tell you exactly where Venus will be in the night sky eight years from now using that math, it's really good math.</p>
<p>Very clever people noticed that there were predictions that weren't so accurate using our gravity math, and they worked on the problem a long time until they discovered that they could make predictions more accurate by distorting time.</p>
<p>Since the new math is more accurate we can say with as much certainty as anything that space and time are both variables of our universe that can be measurably effected.</p>
<p>We evolved to pick ticks off one another and spot predators in long grass. Don't put so much pressure on that brain of yours to wrap itself around this. You're doing fine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very simple intuition:</p>
<p>Velocity = Distance / Time  </p>
<p>(you measure your car speed in miles per hour).</p>
<p>The speed of light, C, is constant in all reference frames (hint: this is part of what let us discover space &amp; time warp). </p>
<p>Since gravity curves space, it makes Distances longer (think windy road is longer than straight road between two points).</p>
<p>If C is fixed, and mass/gravity elongates space, the only other thing that can change to make it work is time changing.</p>
<p>C = ⬆️ Distance  / ⬆️ Time</p>
<p>i.e. time slows down for light (and actually all things) in high gravity/warped space</p>
<p>Einstein's brilliance was showing how a constant speed of light in ANY reference frame (moving rocket, in curved space time, etc...) implies that time and space themselves warp.</p>
<p>Note: the actual relationships involving mass are what general relativity specifies and are more complicated. This example only explains the intuition on how time and distance are fundamentally related.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cause space and time are related concepts. Say it takes you 10 seconds to walk from point A to B. Now imagine the space between point A and B is stretched like a rubber band, now it will take you longer than 10 seconds.<br />
Strength of gravity determines space distortion and hence time dilation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
