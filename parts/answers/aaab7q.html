		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our body axes of symmetry are determined by two things: The orientation of the egg (which has only one axis of asymmetry, i.e. it has a top and bottom but no features determining front from back)   and the sperm entry point, which makes &quot;front and back&quot;. Because of this, early development happens in bilateral symmetry because of these two axes.   Further development is asymmetrical, I believe starting with the heart.</p>
<p>Everybody else is right about the evolutionary advantages, I believe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some things like legs and eyes are significantly more functional in a pair. Really more a single complete set than a pair. One leg is sort of useful but really movement is based around both legs functioning together. One eye works, but your binocular vision is improved greatly with two. Ears need to be able to hear and in directions and pinpoint sound locations. With only one you cant really pinpoint locations because your brain needs a second reference point to compare and determine the location. Other things are probably due to redunency as well increasing survival rates. If a trait or adaption increases your ability to survive, then you are more likely to reproduce and pass that trait along. If you get sick and kidney is not working fully or your nostril gets stuffed up you have a backup.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>2 of everything is just fine to survive with. You get some redundancy AND have benefits from having 2 of something. 3 of something would be mostly redundant, and wouldn't really benefit the human</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
