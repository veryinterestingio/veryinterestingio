		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Accrue enough mutations and all kinds of “fun” things can happen. That’s why we have a diversity of living things (although viruses are not living, they are comprised of molecular components—DNA or RNA—that also determine the genomes of living things). The same process can occur with disease in general (of course, this is an oversimplification).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A disease is defined by its symptoms, or its impact on the health of the host (dis-ease). So, sure... if mutations substantially change the way a virus impacts a host’s health, that means a different diagnostic criteria and a new disease.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aren't all viral diseases technically coming from mutated viruses? Viruses have been mutating and hopping species for longer than humans existed. And every once in a while, a mutation hops to a human, or even gets mutated in a human, and causes a disease there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
