		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>mRNA vaccines have been around for decades; the first report on their use was in 1993 (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8325342/" target="_blank">Induction of virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in vivo by liposome-entrapped mRNA</a>). They haven’t been widely used because their advantages (rapid customizable development) were outweighed by their disadvantages (difficulty in manufacturing and distribution). Obviously, in the face of a fast-moving pandemic, their advantage in rapid development makes them very attractive and the manufacturing and distribution problems can be handled. </p>
<p>Where mRNA vaccines have been used is to treat cancers. That needs highly customizable, individualized, small-scale development, and needs to be safe for use in medically fragile people - ideally suited for the technique. Example from 2009:  <a href="https://journals.lww.com/immunotherapy-journal/Abstract/2009/06000/Direct_Injection_of_Protamine_protected_mRNA_.8.aspx" target="_blank">Direct Injection of Protamine-protected mRNA: Results of a Phase 1/2 Vaccination Trial in Metastatic Melanoma Patients</a>. </p>
<p>This sort of use means that there’s actually a reasonable amount of reasonably long-term studies in their use. Here’s a review from 2012:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>mRNA vaccines combine desirable immunological properties with an outstanding safety profile and the unmet flexibility of genetic vaccines. … Because any protein can be expressed from mRNA without the need to adjust the production process, mRNA vaccines also offer maximum flexibility with respect to development. Taken together, mRNA presents a promising vector that may well become the basis of a game-changing vaccine technology platform.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another review, from 2013, emphasizes their safety:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In recent years, mRNA vaccines have emerged as a safe and potent approach for the induction of cellular immune responses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>—<a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/molecular-medicine/fulltext/S1471-4914\(13\)00166-4" target="_blank">Challenges and advances towards the rational design of mRNA vaccines</a></p>
<p>As does a more recent review, from 2019:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During the last two decades, there has been broad interest in RNA-based technologies for the development of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines. Preclinical and clinical trials have shown that mRNA vaccines provide a safe and long-lasting immune response in animal models and humans. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>—<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6446947/" target="_blank">Advances in mRNA Vaccines for Infectious Diseases</a></p>
<p>So bottom line:</p>
<ul>
<li>these aren’t new</li>
<li>there’s lots of info showing they’re safe</li>
<li>the reason they weren’t widely used before had nothing to do with their safety</li>
<li>they are ideally suited as the first response to a fast-moving pandemic, and not as well suited as the routine approach to an accustomed long-term situation</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When the cells in your body need a new protein, they make a copy of the gene from that protein. The gene is in the DNA, and the copy is a molecule of mRNA. Molecular machines called ribosomes will then use the information in the mRNA molecule to assemble the new protein.</p>
<p>mRNA vaccines provides the cells with mRNA. The DNA of the cells is not altered in any way. Instead, the ribosomes will read the mRNA which is provided by the vaccine and use it to assemble the protein the mRNA carries the instructions for. In the case of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine, the mRNA in question is the mRNA for the so-called <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7583697/" target="_blank">spike protein</a> on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This protein is harmless by itself, but as the cells' ribosomes assemble it they will recognize it as a foreign protein, and will therefore mount an immune response against it.</p>
<p>Because the immune system of a vaccinated person has already encountered a part of the virus before, they have a huge advantage over unvaccinated persons if they were to be infected with the virus.</p>
<p>No mRNA-based vaccines are approved for public use yet, so we have less experience and studies on them than other types of vaccines. However, that does not mean that we are completely uncertain of how safe they are. I recommend you to take a look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine#Vaccine_candidates" target="_blank">wikipedia article of COVID vaccines</a> to see just how many people are involved in the clinical trials for each vaccine.</p>
<p>Research into mRNA vaccines did not begin with the COVID-19 pandemic. BioNTech themselves <a href="https://biontechse.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/biontech-signs-collaboration-agreement-pfizer-develop-mrna-based" target="_blank">started research</a> into mRNA vaccines for influenza in 2018. Just because no mRNA-based vaccines are approved for public use yet does not mean that they're a completely new technology. It's something vaccine researches have researched for years, and so we know more about their safety than you would think.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to the more technical explanation, you can think of an mRNA vaccine being akin to a temporary work order at a factory. Something new gets made for a while (the viral spike protein), then everything goes back to normal after the mRNA degrades.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can not tell you much about what we know about long term effects of mRNA based vaccines. But I can tell you that no DNA is influenced by them to generate proteins.</p>
<p>mRNA (messanger RNA) is naturally produced by your cells, it is a copy of a short DNA sequence that gets used as a blueprint to form a protein. To make a comparisson, you DNA is like a cooking book and mRNA is like a copy of a particular recipe from that book. mRNA vaccines are in this sense copied recipes that get introduced to your body, but they don't rewrite the cooking book.</p>
<p>I don't think we need to worry about them much, simply because the vaccines that are currently in developement have already been testet on several 10.000 people (If I recall correctly the Pfizer one has been tested on 38.000 people when they published their research). Plus it will likely take until spring of next year, until the vaccines can actually be distributed and should any problems occur with the participants until then, the distribution will certainly get put on hold.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
