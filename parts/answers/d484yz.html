		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure it has to do with a fascia between the muscles and the skin that requires movement to stay lubricated. That why for old people who don't move, it's gets tougher over time, in addition to muscle loss.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your muscles sleep with you. Stretching helps to not only wake up, but to also recalibrate your muscles. The movement activates a part of your brain responsible for rest, which gets your blood flowing. Stretching also tests your limits. You’re giving your muscles a test and (hopefully) they get an A+. If your muscle responds and prevents you from over-extending it, it’s awake! As for the reason it feels so good, it’s most likely your body’s response to returning to a normal state.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
