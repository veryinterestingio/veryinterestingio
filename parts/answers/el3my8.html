		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I was in college (1991), working in a insect lab, they were trying to mix in artificial sweeteners into fly bait so that if a fly consumed a non-lethal dose they would not get any energy/nutrition out of it.  We tested many sweeteners, I can't remember them all but we did have sucralose, aspartame, saccharin, plus some alpha and beta forms of sugars that were said to not have any nutritional benefit but weren't approved for food use.  We saw a definite correlation that the house fly (Musca domestica) could tell the difference between the sugars and spent most of the time feeding on sucrose or lactose, can't remember which.  I thought it was funny that this seemingly simple insect could do that.  Unfortunately, I left when we just had the preliminary results and don't know what else they tested or what the actual conclusion was.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
