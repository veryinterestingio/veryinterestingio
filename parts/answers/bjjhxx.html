		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Usually it just works itself out on it's own. The eye is pretty good at keeping itself free of debris, most of the time when you get something like an eyelash in it, it will get out on it's own eventually, it's just pretty uncomfortable to wait so you usually try getting it out on your own.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes when your eye gets irritated it can feel like something is in your eye when it is actually clear. So in your case, you can get an eyelash in your eye, get it all irritated, clear it out without realizing it, and then later the irritation will calm down and your eye will feel normal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
