		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Youre asking about the evolution of the perineum. Here is an <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-09359-y/figures/1" target="_blank">image</a> showing the evolution of the body walls of the perineum. 4 body walls allowed for septation (division) of the cloaca. </p>
<p>This septation and resulting specialised organs (erectile penis, urethra, etc) allowed for mammals to be more competitive on land by supporting a diversity of reproductive strategies and precise excretory control (i.e. urinate or defecate purposefully to reduce predation).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One more answer which hasn't yet been mentioned.</p>
<p>Pee and poo were separate from the beginning. It was only much later, when vertebrates started to move to live on dry land that the exit hole for these two were united. Even in birds the organ systems that create these two are still separate, only the last leg is shared (cloaca).</p>
<p>Poo was invented when regurgitating ingested food wastes was no longer found efficient way of disposal. Pee on the other hand is a solution to the problem of getting rid of excess salt and ammonia from within the body. If you look at different phyla of animals you'll find very different systems for the pee problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
