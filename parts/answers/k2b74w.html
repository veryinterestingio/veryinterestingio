		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not an astrogeologist but I think I can answer this for you. The air pressure on Mars is about 6 millibars compared to Earth's 1 bar at sea level. That's close to 200x less air pressure than Earth. </p>
<p>What that means is that winds are basically nothing. The strongest wind on Mars is little more than a light breeze in comparison to Earth. The dust storms are picking up and moving particles so fine that you'd hardly call it dust here. It's probably more like pollen.</p>
<p>So the reason that dust and wind hasn't eroded land features away over the millions or billions of years is because it can't. Those formations are too strong by comparison to the weak wind and the fine dust.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Atmosphere on Mars is very light, so the kind of super storm you see on movies (eg. the martian) will, in reality, actually feel like a mere little breeze, nothing that would substantially impact rocks on the surface of Mars.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not an Astrogeologist, but some of them have. Some rivers have wound up inverted due to erosion. The riverbed got compacted and so it eroded less than the area around it. Similar to when footprints left In snow melt more slowly than the fluffier snow around it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
