		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The time it takes for the moon to rotate around its own axis is exactly the same as the time it takes for the moon to orbit our planet. As a consequence, we always see the same side of the moon.</p>
<p>Now, you might say &quot;well, that's a bit too neat to be a coincidence&quot; and you would be right. Because the reason that the rotation and orbit of the moon are synced up is a phenomenon called &quot;tidal locking&quot;.</p>
<p>The gravity of the Earth causes the moon to be stretched out ever so slightly, along the line that runs from the Earth to the moon. This stretching is due to the tidal effect and the gravity of the moon does the same to the Earth and because the Earth isn't just solid rock, but also has liquid water, we're able to see the consequences of this in the form of the tides.</p>
<p>If the moon would rotate faster than it would orbit, the elongation would rotate ahead of the imaginary line between Earth and moon. And if this happens, the gravity of the Earth would exert a torque on the moon that would pull it back, both slowing down the rotation and speeding up the orbit.</p>
<p>When the rotation and orbit are the same, this torque vanishes and a stable equilibrium is reached. At this point, we say that the body (moon) is tidally locked to the other body (Earth).</p>
<p>Tidal locking happens in other systems as well. Pluto and its satellite Charon are tidally locked to each other, meaning that Charon is only visible from one side of Pluto and from there you always see the same side of Charon. Mercury is tidally locked to the Sun, but because the orbit of Mercury deviates far enough from a circle, this lock is not 1:1. Instead, a Mercury year (the orbital period) is exactly 1.5 times the length of a Mercury day (its rotational period).</p>
<p>The moon is also affecting the rotational period of the Earth. The length of a day is ever so slightly increasing and the Earth would becomes tidally locked to the moon in about 50 billion years, at which point a day on Earth, a lunar month (a full orbit of the moon) and a lunar day (the rotation of the moon around its axis) would all be the same length. However, the expansion of the Sun into a red giant in 4-5 billion years will prevent this from ever actually happening.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other commenter explained this better than I could have, but I'd like to comment about Gravity-Gradient stabilization.</p>
<p>Gravity as a force scales inversely based on the distance between objects. Normally this doesn't affect us on a normal basis because we stay about the same distance from the center of the earth on a daily basis. Celestial bodies are different. </p>
<p>The difference between the force of gravity on the moons surface due to the earth is actually significant when compared to the force of gravity on the center of the moon due to the earth. This is what is called a gravity gradient. Because of this, the earth pulls more on the end of the moon that is closer to the earth than the one that is further. <strong>This means that the center of gravity of an object (where the force of gravity appies)</strong> can be different than the center of mass (the center of the path the object orbits.) </p>
<p>Since there is some distance from where the force is applied to where the center of mass is, there is a torque. In this case, the moon will orient itself to limit this torque. To do this, the moon will rotate until the Center of Mass and Center of Gravity are in line with the Center of Mass of the earth.</p>
<p>If the moon was a perfect sphere, the orientation of the moon wouldn't matter since the distance between Center of Mass and Center of Gravity would be the same in each orientation. But since the moon is slightly stretched towards us (as another commenter said), the orientation DOES matter.</p>
<p>The moon will then orient itself to maximize the distance between the CM and CG as the restoring torque is proportional to this distance.</p>
<p>So why doesn't the moon affect the Earth's rotation? Well it does! The moon is applying a torque to the Earth in the same way. This affects the rotation of the planet. </p>

<p>Obligatory ELI13 Experiment: Take 2 paper/aluminum cutouts. Make one a T shape and another a circle. Have someone glue a string to the center of area (analogy for center of mass). Put both into a flowing stream to see how they orient themselves when you hold them back with the string. </p>
<p>The T shape will point its flat side towards the direction of the stream and the O will rotate freely. This is because the force on the top of the T is greater than the force at the bottom due to it having more &quot;weight&quot; there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Synchronous rotation. Actually there are many exoplanets, which rotate around their stars like that, however it makes them quite unhabitable. Unless you find that sort of an &quot;eco-zone&quot; (actually I have no idea how it is called, but the zone I mentioned is basically the area where both dark and light/illuminated sides of the planet meet. So it's somewhere between extreme cold and horrendously hot). Also don't take my comment seriously, my knowledge is mostly based on some books.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
