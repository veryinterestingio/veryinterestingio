		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Coronaviruses aren't new to us. This is just the latest one. It isn't even the deadliest compared to SARS and MERS, it just spreads easier.</p>
<p>But we commonly deal with 4 coronaviruses (HCoV) that cause common cold, these circulate constantly.</p>
<p>We know how these viruses work in general. It isn't really even the virus itself which seems to kill people, but the immune response which is so powerful that it can damage the body whole, and we really don't understand why yet. (Tho research and data about this changes so quickly that you probably can't keep up unless you are infectious disease specialist). E: I'm not downplaying the dangers of the virus, and the virus does play a part in the complicated equation that can be fatal</p>
<p>Maybe Covid-19 can cause deadly complications that come to light in 10 years, only time will tell. But what caused that damage probably wasn't the virus, but our immune system trying to deal with the virus.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons current treatment is supportive care and steroids. We try to control the immune system. Since it would appear there isn't a antiviral that works on it.</p>
<p>E: Edited in bit of a clarification.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>COVID-19 and HIV are very different viruses, the latter is a retrovirus - it inserts itself inside the hosts DNA, which is why it can stay so long and have outbreaks years later. Covid is structured in a completely different way, it hijacks the RNA to tell cells to make new viruses. They're imbedded in completely different levels, I wouldn't worry about this anxiety of yours :) .</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know a bit about RNA viruses since I work with parts of them (not live viruses thank God). HIV (the virus responsible for AIDS) is a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrovirus" target="_blank">retrovirus</a> meaning it not only inserts a copy of its RNA into the host cell, but it also alters the genome of the host cell. So it could be in your system for years before symptoms show. </p>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 (the virus responsible for COVID-19) is a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus" target="_blank">coronavirus</a> which is a different family of RNA viruses (and a different order, class, phylum, and kingdom) than retroviruses.</p>
<p>See the Wikipedia articles on <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV" target="_blank">HIV</a> and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2" target="_blank">SARS-CoV-2</a> and take a look at their taxonomy if youâ€™re interested.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
