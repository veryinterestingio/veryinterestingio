		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Milk contains proteins. And just like eggs and flour which also contain a lot of protein, milk coagulates into a solid if you heat it up too much. The problem with heating milk in a kettle is that a kettle gets very hot on the bottom. This is no problem for water as it can easily handle the heat and will just distribute it throughout the water. However if you have milk in the kettle the milk in the bottom will coagulate due to the heat and stick to the bottom.</p>
<p>If you want to heat up milk you have to make sure to heat it up evenly either by turning down the heat, use something to distribute the heat better then the milk or make sure you constantly stir the milk. A microwave is optimal for this because it uses the liquid itself as a heating element but it is possible to heat up milk using almost any heat source if you are careful enough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Kettles aren't well mixed vessels, so you have a single heating element at the bottom where you'll have a hot zone. This isn't a problem when the only thing you're heating is water molecules, but is a problem when you try to heat something which contains fats and proteins. You're going to end up burning anything near the heating element. Also, depending on the kettle in question and how it functions, it may put too much thermal energy in to heat milk to the desired temperature even if you did stir it. I deal with similar issues on a chemical plant, but we have control systems that aim for setpoints, so you wouldn't see the same issue. Likewise, we heat aqueous protein solutions in big tanks, but if you don't fill it up over the minimum stir volume, you won't mix the tank as it heats up and you'll end up with burnt product around the heating elements.</p>
<p>TLDR: heating liquids introduces a certain amount of mixing, but not enough to prevent hot zones around the element in the kettle where the fat and protein in the milk will burn.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you try to heat milk up too fast, the fats and proteins will clump up and burn on the hottest surface.  This layer doesn't conduct heat very well, and is really difficult to remove.  So, you end up with foul-tasting milk, a very slow temperature rise, and an annoying cleaning job.  Since kettles are usually designed to heat up as quickly as possible, they're basically the worst tool for the job.  The best way to heat up milk is in the microwave, but if you can't do that, use very low heat, and whisk constantly, making sure your whisk is scraping the bottom of the pan thoroughly.  This will break up the clumps of protein and fat as they form, so the sticky insulating layer can't build up.  Also, a double boiler can help, especially if you just want to warm the milk, without fully boiling and scalding it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
