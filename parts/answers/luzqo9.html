		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is one in the Southern Hemisphere. Emperor Penguins migrate further inland in early autumn (March) for breeding. After the females lay the eggs, the males stay there during the winter while the females go back to sea to feed. In spring, the females return to feed the chicks, while the males go to shore to feed themselves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Kind of. Caribou move north from the boreal forest to the Hudson Bay Lowlands to get away from mosquitos and black flies and feed there. Polar bears move north for the sea ice. Nomadic bird species like red crossbill, short eared owl and snowy donâ€™t care about the weather, only where cones or rodents are in high numbers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Happens idiosyncratically in some species like the <a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Heermanns_Gull/overview" target="_blank">Heermann's gull</a>, which spends summer on the Pacific Coast of Mexico, then disperses north all the way to British Columbia. Probably in response to food sources. The west coast of North America has mild winters, so weather is probably not a factor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Polar bears move south in the summer to the shoreline and wait for sea ice to form  then they go back out to hunt seals all winter. Summer is their lean times, they pack on the fat during the winter.
They need the sea ice which is why arctic warming is threatening the species.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
