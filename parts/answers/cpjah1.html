		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Any kind of stressor from frightening noises at night to emotional stress activates your body's natural stress response. Part of that response is to release the hormones adrenaline and cortisol into your blood stream.</p>
<p>Adrenaline activates the body's fight or flight response by redirecting blood from your organs to your muscles so you can take action. The sick feeling or pit in your stomach comes from the blood leaving the digestive system.</p>
<p>Cortisol aids in increasing the blood sugar levels, promotes more energy to the brain, and activates the body's repair mechanisms. It deactivates your appetite, reproductive system, and growth systems.</p>
<p>Both of these responses are great if you are running away from a physical stressor like a large predator but they don't help much when the stressor is abstract like relationship breakups, financial issues, or general life purpose questions. Chronic stress and anxiety causing constant releases of these hormones can have detrimental effects on the body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey OP, you've already got some really great info, but I'll encourage you to do some research on the vagus nerve. It's a direct link between the gut and the brain, and learning a bit about that relationship will further explain why we literally feel our feelings in our gut sometimes. Be well!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s something called “failure to thrive” which was observed in babies that were not held in hospitals and would literally die from lack of affection. Love and affection from parents is recognized as a basic survival need just like food and water for children. This is called “attachment theory.”</p>
<p>Some therapists believe that exactly the same needs exist in adult romantic relationships. So if your emotional connection to your partner is threatened your body views this the same as an actual threat to your life.</p>
<p>This theory is called “EFT”. Recommend a book called “Hold Me Tight” that applies these ideas to solving relationship problems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
