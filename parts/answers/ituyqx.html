I believe that many species of bat can live for most of their lives with rabies and the effects are not nearly as severe. From the perspective of the virus, occasionally infecting humans or dogs is more of a &quot;side effect&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rabies is not really a dog or human disease, nor is it a mass spreader type of virus. Rabies has many reservoir species in the wild, meaning that it can be present in many mammalian species from bats to racoons to dogs, some of which can function for longer periods of time than others while being infectious. It is very rare  for a human to transmit the disease to another human, or even for a dog to transmit it to another dog; but because there is always a population of wild animals carrying the virus, then as long as humans or dogs occasionally come into contact with those populations, there's a possibility of the virus jumping species to infect them again. </p>
<p>As someone below pointed out, we can eliminate some viruses like Smallpox because they do not have reservoir species outside of humans; once we prevented the virus from finding any new human hosts, the virus died out and  could not spontaneously reappear. But because Rabies lives out there in the wild in many species, we can't feasibly isolate ourselves from it or innoculate all types of animals against it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Death from rabies tends to occur relatively quickly after the onset of symptoms, but infection can occur a long time before the symptoms occur, and the animal is potentially contagious for part of that time.  </p>
<p>Rabies tend be harbored in animals which routinely bite and scratch one another, allowing the virus to pass from individual to individual.  Though horses can get rabies, the virus doesn't generally survive in horse populations because horses don't tend to bite each other or routinely draw blood.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s entirely irrelevant whether there are resistant animals or asymptomatic carriers. It doesn’t matter how fast something dies, it only matter how many new victims it transmits the virus to. If it averages more than one, the virus will persist.  If it’s less than one, it will not. </p>
<p>Some pathogens have evolved to spread very slowly, over a long period. Others, like, rabies, spread in a big burst, very widely over a very short period. Each can be a successful strategy. In the case of rabies, even in dogs (which it undoubtedly kills very quickly) this strategy still leads to an R0 greater than one, though not by much:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We found that the basic reproductive number for rabies, R0, is very low in our study area in rural Africa (∼1.2) and throughout its historic global range (&lt;2).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>—<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2653555/" target="_blank">Transmission Dynamics and Prospects for the Elimination of Canine Rabies</a></p>
<p>Time to death does influence this, as you’d expect (they found that where villagers killed rabid dogs, R0 was lower), as do lots of other factors (early in an epidemic the spread was faster, until population density was reduced). But the point is, the rabies transmission strategy works just fine even when it quickly kills its hosts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
