		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Science builds upon itself. The scientific method itself is fairly recent, once we had a framework for using empirical data to create theories which we then test against more data we were able to get a much better understanding of the world. There were also some major breakthroughs which really let technology take off, Maxwells equations and the theory of electromagnetism allowing us to generate and use electricity was a major innovation. After that the development of quantum mechanics lead to most of our most advanced technologies today by allowing us to create nanoscale transistors which are the technology behind computers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People didn't become more intelligent, they became better connected and simply greater in numbers.</p>
<p>In the old days before mass communication or anything, if somebody made a minor improvement to something in some art of the world, like a different way to make pottery or tools or domesticated crops, it would take generations for that improvement to filter though all the way to the other side of the world.</p>
<p>If then somebody on the far side of the connected world makes an improvement based on that improvement it will take a long time for that to filter all the way back to the origin.</p>
<p>When during the enlightenment people started sending letters back and forth and were able to build on each others ideas with only a few weeks of delay despite being in different parts of Europe that accelerated things quite a lot.</p>
<p>Today people can communicated in real time with email and phone and publishing things on the net.</p>
<p>Furthermore there are a lot more people around today.</p>
<p>so thanks to modern technology the number of people who work on anything and the speed at which they can improve on each other ideas is greatly improved. If one of the things they work on is faster and better collaboration technologies this means exponential growth for the overall speed of progress.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well prior to the industrial revolution, 95% of the population were farmers who barely grew enough food to eat, even by working 12 hours a day. More efficient methods of creating wealth allowed them the spare time to explore new thoughts and ideas which previously they wouldnâ€™t have had the time and energy to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>2 words: Exponential growth. </p>
<p>And the beauty of it is that it only requires one circumstance: the rate of change (=progress) depends on the amount of stuff already there.</p>
<p>The more you know, the better you can generate new knowledge. The more tech already exists, the easier it is to build better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Technology snowballs. There's that phrase &quot;standing on the shoulders of giants&quot;. When you get an education today, you're enjoying thousands of years of discovery, scientific inquiry, experimentation, and education. And when you're done with your education, you can start with all that knowledge in your back pocket.</p>
<p>On top of that, there are literally more brains in the world today than there used to be. There are about 6 billion human minds on Earth today. </p>
<p>A hundred years ago that was only about 1.5 billion human minds. Five hundred years ago, less than half a billion human minds.</p>
<p>If you go back 100.000 years, you're looking at a relatively tiny number of humans. Humans were preoccupied with surviving their environment, finding food, and getting through the seasons. They had limited means for invention and when inventions were made, they had limited means for passing that knowledge on.</p>
<p>It would take another 90.000 years or so before people progressed enough that they started to figure out how they could use agriculture to ensure greater food security.</p>
<p>Compare that to the tools, knowledge, security and other advantages today and it's no surprise progress is made more quickly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
