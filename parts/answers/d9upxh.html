		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>^([edited with some error corrections])</p>
<p><strong>First: why does rising hot air cool off?</strong> In other words, why doesn't warm rising air warm up higher altitudes?</p>
<p>Did you ever fire off one of those Carbon Dioxide fire extinguishers and see how it gets super cold at the gas-releasing end, or see one build up frost near its tip? Or how about one of those cans of compressed air that you use to clean electronics? Turn one of those upsidedown and spray it, and when the liquid comes out, it boils away and leaves the surface that it's on super-cold.</p>
<p>This is because as a certain amount of gas loses pressure, it expands, and that takes work... and the energy for that work has to come from somewhere. That energy gets removed from the gas itself; its own heat is absorbed by the expansion process and so it cools down.</p>
<p>So it's a hot morning and the sun warms a hillside, and the air that's just above the surface also warms up. Because warm air rises, it goes up into the part of the atmosphere that's thinner, and it begins to expand because the pressure is less up there. The higher it goes, the less pressure there is, and so the more that air expands and then cools down as its energy gets used up by its expansion.</p>
<p><strong>Second: why isn't the higher atmosphere hot anyway?</strong> In other words, why doesn't it warm up like lower and denser air?</p>
<p>That air is closer to the sun, right? How come it doesn't get warmer then? The answer is because the sun pretty much shines right through it because it's mostly invisible. It's the sun striking the earth's SURFACE that warms it up. And then the nearby air that's closest to that surface has the earth's heat transfer into it, and it gets warmer too.</p>
<p>At really high areas, the air that's way up in the atmosphere is losing its heat energy into space. Its heat radiates away, so it's a lot cooler than the more insulated blanket of air near the surface.</p>
<p><strong>Third: So explain why a mountaintop is cold then. Sun hits it, right?</strong></p>
<p>Yup. But that mountaintop is surrounded by thinner air, and there's not as much of a protective layer of air there to warm up and to insulate the mountain's received heat energy.</p>
<p>And the air being less dense as you climb means it just holds less heat energy overall and so feels colder. It's the same way a sink of hot <em>water</em> feels a lot hotter than a room full of the same-temperature hot <em>air</em> because it can hold more energy <del>...and why a really humid day feels hotter than a less humid one at the same temperature, because humid air is denser than air without a lot of water in it and so contains more energy for the same volume.\~\</del>~ <em>&lt;-- this part was incorrect.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is because the ground is the source of most of the heat. It gets colder further from the heat source.</p>
<p>But you will say,   it's the sun, not the ground, that's the heat source. The heat from the sun travels as radiation through space and the atmosphere. The atmosphere absorbs very little of it. It hits the ground/sea which absorbs most of it and that heats up. The warm ground emits heat to the atmosphere by conduction and by radiation at  different frequencies (infra-red, I think, forget the details) that are better absorbed by the air. The warmed air rises (convection), is cooled at higher altitudes and descends to ground level again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
