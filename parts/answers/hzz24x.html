Unless the alcohol reacts with the extract to form another compound before evaporating, then you will get the other compound. This is under ideal lab conditions. In reality getting a 100% pure product crystallisation is rare.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you are talking about ethanol, what is left behind is affected by how it was made. The 5% is mostly water and other alcohols, formaldehyde, acetone, methanol. They will evaporate, at different rates but eventually they will be gone. Distilled grain alcohol will have some amount of particulates, very little but those, along with the calcium from the water, is all that should be left.. The water makes a hell of a difference thou, extraction works better with anhydrous alcohols, like 100% isopropyl and acetone. Isopropyl is a polar solvent, so it is quite specific what it can dissolve. For ex, hypothetically, THC and other cannabidiols dissolve very easily to 100% isopropyl. Acetone, which is &quot;relative&quot; to isopropyl (it is its ketone) is non-polar solvent and it dissolves much more of the plant material. If we dilute those into water, we will then get also water soluble in the residue, lowering its quality (and if it is THC we are talking about.. taste...you do not want sugars in your hash/oil..).</p>
<p>This and the fact that anhydrous ethanol is not available, makes 100% isopropyl the best candidate. It is also that for many, many others like capsaicin extraction for making DIY caps. ointments (it is on my to-do list).   </p>
<p>Agitation and later in the process, sifting it to smaller particles (in case of oil, heating it and just letting it sit in open container) will increase evaporation, the problem is that when the extract starts to get quite thick, the solvent is trapped inside: it evaporates from the surface leaving a &quot;shell&quot; around it. Vacuum makes things faster.. so.. if you can do that, it'll evaporate quite completely in no time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The alcohol itself will (unless it forms some alcohol equivalent of a hydrate with any substance dissolved in it, though I do not know if there are any substances that even do that) evaporate completely, just like any water that was in it (assuming the air is dry enough), leaving behind whatever was dissolved in it as a solid residue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Unless you use vacuum on your extract, it will contain alcohol even if left for a very long time. Same goes for most other organic solvents.</p>
<p>This is evident if you try and burn the extract, if that's what you are after. For any use  other than combustion, the amount left is fairly insignificant and not likely to matter much. Heating for too long will remove aromatics before it eliminates the solvent, so that's why vacuum is your best bet if you want anything of quality as your product.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
