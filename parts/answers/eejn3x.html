<p>One important detail about Milankovitch cycles is that the slight changes in Earth’s orbit around the sun, the degree of its axial tilt, and the location of the equinoxes in its orbit (these are the ‘orbital cycles’ you hear about) have little effect on the OVERALL incoming solar radiation hitting Earth. Instead, they significantly affect when and where the most direct incoming radiation is hitting throughout the year. </p>
<p>This matters most in the Northern Hemisphere polar regions, where big ice sheets have formed and melted throughout the last 2.7 million years (the Pleistocene Epoch). When the orbital cycles are oriented so that these regions have mild and short summers, snow and ice can linger throughout the year and eventually lead to the formation of large ice sheets (see the Laurentide and Fennoscandinavian Ice Sheets during the Last Glacial Maximum). Now here is the key connection to Milankovitch cycles and CO2: when these big ice sheets form around the North Atlantic, they pull water out of this ocean region and make it saltier, which leads to more surface water sinking into the deep ocean. This pulls a tremendous amount of dissolved CO2 into the deep ocean, where it does not exchange with the atmosphere. This is one of the main reasons why CO2 lowers in lockstep with certain phases of Milankovitch cycles. This dynamic is also a feedback loop, because as atmospheric CO2 lowers, the global greenhouse effect is reduced, which leads to more cooling and further ice sheet buildup. </p>
<p>The reverse happens when the gradual changes in orbital arrangements start lengthening and warming Arctic summers, leading to ice sheet melt and reduced ocean downwelling in the North Atlantic. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Milankovitch cycles are based upon orbital eccentricity variations.. slightly closer to the sun during perihelion for a while and slightly farther away at aphelion at other times as well as the cumulative effects of obliquity So its a cycle that brings one of the strongest effects of our weather into effect... Solar radiation (radiation meaning wavelengths of light and energy not the radiation that most people think of).</p>
<p>So as you seem to already have gathered in the warm periods, yes CO2 would climb but not in an uncontrolled fashion.  Take into account that before man changes in weather and atmosphere gases would effect and have a feedback with life and most importantly plant life.  High CO2 and warm weather is perfect climate for trees.  What this meant was that the warming caused plant life to bloom and as the planet was proceeding back towards the opposite end of the cycle CO2 levels would start to drop and when we hit an ice age it would be heading to its lowest level.</p>
<p>Note that this leads to CO2 levels and temperature levels to not be perfect in line but in a decent correlation level.  Meaning that while cooling CO2 levels are dropping and while warming CO2 levels are increasing with a slight lag at the ends.</p>
<p>Now to see the best description of the milankovic cycles I recommend watching this video in its entirety.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> Ice-sheets and changes in atmospheric CO2 (likely driven by changes in ocean circulation) are key. </p>
<p>This is a good (and very important) question, but it's not one that is straightforward to answer because the answer is (1) complex and (2) poorly understood. There are a lot of partial answers here, so I'll try to summarise what I see as the consensus view. I'll preface this by pointing people towards <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24996644?seq=2#metadata_info_tab_contents" target="_blank">this 1990 article, <em>&quot;What Drives Glacial Cycles?&quot;</em></a> by the late Wally Broecker who does a very good job of synthesising the main arguments. </p>
<p>It is relatively well established that Milankovitch cycles set the frequency of glacial-integlacial cycles, although there is debate about what sets the relative importance of the constituent Milankovitch frequencies. For those who are not aware, Milankovitch cycles are periodic variations in the Earth's orbital eccentricity, axial tilt and axial precession, which do not affect the total about of solar radiation received by the Earth, but does affect the distribution and seasonality of solar radiation. I won't go into detail about these cycles here, but you can read more about them on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> or in many other questions that have been posed about them on this subreddit.</p>
<p>Milankovitch cycles involve relatively small changes in solar radiation so by themselves <em>cannot cause any significant changes in temperature</em>. Something has to amplify these changes, and this is where things start getting complex.</p>
<p>One important mechanism is likely to be ice-sheet feedbacks. In short, if orbital/axial conditions are conducive towards the accumulation of ice-sheets (principally milder summer), ice-sheets are able to grow. Because ice-sheets are generally more reflective than the continents they cover, this reflects more radiation back into space, reducing the amount of radiation absorbed by the climate system, resulting in even more ice-sheet accumulation, and so on. This mechanism, also known as albedo feedback, can hypothetically both contribute towards the initiation (ice-sheet growth) or termination (ice-sheet collapse) of a glacial. In reality it's of course more complex than this (ice-sheet physics are complex and depend on many parameters such as precipitation and the response of the solid earth to the mass of the ice-sheet) but this is one major process which is generally thought to be important for explaining glacial-interglacial temperature changes. </p>
<p>Now on to CO2, which is what you mention in your OP. CO2 is, of course, a major greenhouse gas and it also plays a dominant role in <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/styles/716px_width/public/glacial-interglacial.jpg?itok=19bwFcU9" target="_blank">controlling glacial-interglacial temperature changes</a>. The CO2 must be sequestered somewhere during glacials and must get released in the run-up to interglacials, but where this reservoir is and how this happens is not fully understood. There are probably four main options for this transient CO2 store: the terrestrial biosphere, permafrost, the solid earth, or the ocean. In short, the answer is probably the ocean. It's unlikely to be the terrestrial biosphere as there's no good evidence that this expanded significantly during glacial periods, and it's also unlikely to be the solid earth as this reservoir probablly cannot respond quickly enough (although I will acknowledge <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X16305015#br0120" target="_blank">this hypothesis</a> from Huybers, Langmuir and others although I want to stress that this is at present still a fringe hypothesis). Expanded permafrost during glacials does have the <em>potential</em> to sequester CO2, but it's unlikely to be enough. The ocean is generally regarded to be the only reservoir of carbon that is large enough to explain glacial-interglacial changes in atmospheric CO2, and responsive enough to explain the pace of change. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0589-x" target="_blank">There is evidence for increased carbon storage in the oceans during glacials</a> , but <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> the ocean increases its carbon storage so much during glacials is a somewhat open question. A leading theory (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature09149" target="_blank">Sigman <em>et al.</em> 2010</a>) is that changes in ocean circulation related to changes in upwelling around the southern ocean due to changes in winds, resulting in a large expansion of high-carbon, corrosive deep waters and reduced CO2 fluxes from the ocean into the atmosphere. However, whilst this conceptual model could well be a critical mechanism for explaining glacial-interglacial changes in CO2 and hence temperature, it has not been conclusively demonstrated to be correct because as is hopefully becoming apparent, the climate is incrediby complicated. </p>
<p>Changes in ocean circulation may also be important beyond modulating atmospheric CO2 (e.g. through interactions with ice-sheets and redistributing heat across the Earth) and is definitely a dominant process for shorter-term, milennial-scale climate variability.</p>
<p><strong>To conclude</strong>, changes in ice-sheets and atmospheric CO2 are probably the two major controls on glacial-interglacial temperature changes, and both involve mechanisms (albedo feedback and ocean circulation/carbon sequestration) that can explain the initiation and termination of glacials. The relative importance of these processes however, and the intricacies of how they work, are still fascinating and hugely important open questions though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's an Excellent Series of YouTube Videos by a BBC Journalist called PotHoler54 that goes over all the standard things on Climate Change causes/effect/weathering:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUk0tm47yr8" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUk0tm47yr8</a></p>
<p>He has many videos which are well researched with sources that explains the science around this.</p>
<p>If you're a fan of James Burke (Creator of the Connections (1,2,3) and Day the Universe Changed BBC Series), then you can watch this one:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa4aWFDCMqQ" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa4aWFDCMqQ</a></p>
<p>It's a bit campy, but it goes over a good description of what's going with earth's tilt and its relationship to climate. That James Burke thing was made in the mid 90's, and the second part of it is not really worth watching, but the first part most certainly is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
