		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans are social animals and social mammals evolved facial cues to communicate long before language. Looking sad or scared or happy can communicate critical information to people around you without speaking. When you're surprised, your eyes get wide and that lets people around you know something is up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's the flight/fright response, which comes from the sympathetic nervous system.  There are two muscles that open your upper eyelid - the levator palpebrae superioris and the superior tarsal muscle.  The first is under your conscious control and the second is activated by your sympathetic nervous system, meaning that it is involuntary and occurs with the flight/fright response.  Also, your pupil dilates, making you look even more wide-eyed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It might be a bit pedantic, but your eyes do not literally bulge out. Your eyebrows lift and this exposes more of the white of your eyes - making it seem larger and it appears to protrude out since the eyelid is pulled back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
