<p>Basically, the original idea was just to practice mindfulness and reduce anxiety, but it was misappropriated and twisted by people who don't know much about the brain. Dopamine is a chemical your brain releases when you do certain activities that make you feel good. Other parts of your brain detect that chemical and it trains your memory to enjoy doing that activity, like if your parents give you some money after you mow the lawn.</p>
<p>The (false) premise of a &quot;dopamine detox&quot; is that, if you do activities that produce a lot of dopamine, it will cause your brain to demand more and more dopamine to stay satisfied, and the claim is that you can deprive yourself of dopamine-producing activities for a short period of time to reduce your brain's demand for dopamine. The fad attempts to compare dopamine to drug addiction, which is false. Chemical addiction physically changes the brain such that normal function is impossible without the addicting substance.</p>
<p>But your brain produces dopamine whether you're being stimulated or not. Doing dopamine-producing activities <em>doesn't</em> increase your brain's demand for dopamine, it just makes your memory associate those dopamine-producing activities with being rewarding. Over time you can &quot;forget&quot; about those activities, but not by avoiding them for just a day or two. It's a bit like forgetting about a hobby. If you're playing a video game you really like, you'll want to keep playing it. If you quit playing it for one day, you're still going to want to play it the next day. If you quit playing it for two years, you'll probably forget about it.</p>
<p>In summary, a dopamine &quot;detox&quot; or &quot;fast&quot; does not work. Making long-term lifestyle changes does work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you refrain yourself from doing whatever you think is bad for you, you will naturally find new things to do because you will be bored. (Boredom might be frustrating enough to motivate you to do things you always wanted to do, but were previously afraid of.)</p>
<p>If you keep doing these new things and refrain from the old things, you will start to like the new things. If you keep doing this for long enough, you will likely change your behavior permanently. That's all it is. You are not detoxing from dopamine, you are just finding new ways to live your life. Dopamine will be produced either way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's NOT just abstaining from pleasurable activities. It IS getting the fuck off toxic cycles that play on your reward centers. Social media approval chasing (or social media for admiring other people's lives in comparison to yours in general), watching 16 hours of youtube/netflix a day, binging on shit food because it feels nice, too much porn/masturbation/sex, etc. All the stuff that's &quot;easy&quot; and gives you a kick.</p>
<p>Go for more wholesome stuff. Hobbies, self improvement and that. Read a book, write a book, clean your attic, paint something, lift some weights. When you commit to stuff that doesn't work with instant reward, you can resensitize your reaction to ACTUAL rewards and thereby increase your latent drive to pursue those things. When you feel shit, you're gonna wanna seek easy solutions to combat it. But you can get stuck with the easy stuff and get stuck never wanting to go for the harder (but far, far more rewarding) activities. </p>
<p>That's the essence. It's as much psychological/outlook on living daily life as it is brain chemistry. &quot;Detoxing&quot; by just not doing anything pleasurable at all is fucking dumb. Serotonin and dopamine do a lot more than just reward/pleasure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
