		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its all about the fuse.</p>
<p>Pretty much every explosive in use these days in impact resistant, that's why TNT replaced dynamite and nitroglycerin, they were just awful to work with as they would explode under moderate shocks(or extremely light for nitroglycerin).  This means that you can fill your bomb with explosives and it won't detonate until the detonator(tiny triggered explosion) goes off.</p>
<p>To get through you would want to encase your bomb in a strong material like steel and potentially give it a nice hard/dense tip like tungsten carbide to punch through the outer layers of armor.   You also want it to be really heavy but really narrow so it applies a lot of force over a small area creating a high pressure.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of triggers that can be used, sometimes you want it to be timed from first impact, sometimes you want it to punch through a fixed distance of material, sometimes you want it to hold off detonation until a short distance after it has stopped going through material so its in the hollow bunker.</p>
<p>You'd generally want to put your fuse on the back so it won't get squished by the initial impact.  You can see this on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_bomb#/media/File:Disney_Bomb_Diagram.png" target="_blank">WWII Disney Bomb</a> with its steel casing around its high explosive filler and a wire sticking out to the side to start the timer.  The Disney Bomb was also rocket boosted so it would hit the ground with higher speeds and penetrate further.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, specialized penetrator bomb bodies do not have a fuze in the front, instead they come to a solid point. They have a very fancy electronic fuze in the rear, which the pilot can actually 'talk' to, and tell exactly what to do, based on what the guys on the ground tell him.</p>
<p>In order to get the penetration, before they drop it, they tell the fuze to 'wait' (in milliseconds), after it senses that it just hit something using its impact sensor, before it sets off the bomb.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most bombs these days use the fuze fmu-139 as pictured here <a href="http://cjchivers.com/post/16494763207/know-your-weapons-left-the-fmu-139-bb" target="_blank">http://cjchivers.com/post/16494763207/know-your-weapons-left-the-fmu-139-bb</a> on the back you’ll notice various settings depending on the mission profile you are flying. High drag settings for low level bombing and low drag for high altitude strikes. Bombs are quite stable and can be dropped from very high altitude and if the pilot hasn’t armed it will hit the ground in a relatively safe state. </p>
<p>These fuses are usually fitted up the bum of the bomb. On the top middle of the bomb is a little wind turbine that deploys when the bomb is dropped and the fuze won’t arm unless the bomb is travelling a minimum speed. On the nose you usually have a proximity sensor or solid nose that can be fitted. </p>
<p>I used to build bombs for a living many years ago. I’m a little rusty but if you have any specific questions I’ll try and answer them.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ahhh, my kind of thread. To the OP, I was a 2w1 weapons loader in the airforce, and know all about bombs, missiles and munitions in general. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Also, the top post by r/kahBhume has already answered your question pretty sufficently. I could add more, but that is the gist.....Actually, I cant help myself. What happens is a few things. The bunker busters that we currently use in the USAF and most militaries in the world, use what are known as JDAMs (Joint Direct Attack Munitions). They are just dumb bombs that come with fancy equipment to make them super smart and capable, versus their standard configs.</p>
<p>What the top poster mentions, about the fuse and delayed ignition, is partially true. I mean, they did you a ELI5 explanation, but to give more, the fuze has a delay element itself known as an INITIATOR. This initiator arms the fuse (per se) when the bomb is falling from the sky. Once the fuze is armed, it starts a timer (set by the type of fuze and mission requirements) that does exactly what the top poster mentions...</p>
<p>Anywho, time for some fun stuff. While working in Kuwait, I had the opportunity to snap these pics of what Bunker Busters did to a &quot;fortified&quot; bunker, during Iraq War I.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/IpGiDgh" target="_blank"><a href="https://imgur.com/a/IpGiDgh" target="_blank">https://imgur.com/a/IpGiDgh</a></a>  </p>
<p>What is awesome about those pics, is that the inside of the structure was fairly unharmed. The bomb hit its intended target well within its parameters, and pretty much left everything else inside unharmed. Even the structure itself is fairly well off, all things considered. And that is what makes bunker busters, aka JDAMs so fucking cool. They are very strategic weapons, that can do far more than their &quot;dumb bomb&quot; variants. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
