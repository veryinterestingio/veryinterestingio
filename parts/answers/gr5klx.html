		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is becasue soap is formed from;</p>
<p>1)  a lye,  sodium hydroxide (bar soap) or potassium hydroxide (liquid soap) </p>
<p>and 2) fatty acids, vegetable oils usually but you can use animal fats.</p>
<p>Each fat has a known  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saponification_value" target="_blank">saponification value</a>, the amount of lye required to saponify 1 g of the fat. </p>
<p>You always have to have an excess of vegetable oil. An excess of lye would make caustic soap that saponified the oils in your skin. When you use a soap, you end up with some unsaponified vegetable oil on your skin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Soap can noticably strip the oils from your skin or not it just depends on the formulation of the soap</p>
<p>What you may be noticing is that soap, like bar soap, leave a slightly tacky waxy feeling film. Some of that film is produced when minerals in hard water react to the ingredients in soap.  Calcium and magnesium in the water react to the sodium stearate in the bar.
Liquid soap (unless it is liquefied Castile) is not actually soap in the transitional sense(made from water, fats, and lye). These liquid cleansers are made from surfactants (like sodium lauryl sulfate) that cut water tension and produce foam. These chemicals don't react to hard water the same way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
