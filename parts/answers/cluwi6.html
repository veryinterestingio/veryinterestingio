<p>Drinking water during or after a meal slightly aids digestion. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Drinking a large enough amount of water, to fill the ventricle (stomach) can trigger peristalsis (sequenced contractions of the bowel) and therefor make you poop. </p>
<p>Drinking lots of water immediately before or during a meal, will dilute the concentration of stomach acid and an enzyme called amylase. Stomach acid is the first step in the breakdown of fat and amylase is an enzyme that helps digest carbohydrates.
Theoretically, drinking lots of water before/during a meal can slow down the initial digestion, but for any healthy person, this will make no real life difference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’ve had stomach problems I’ve dealt with for the past year and water was the major saving grace. Having dry, chunky, undigested food in your stomach does takes longer to break down in your stomach. It also takes longer to break down because the stomach acid has less fluidity to mix with the food and break it down. The higher concentration of acid can also cause stomach irritation for some people. </p>
<p>Drinking water with food can help break down the food in your stomach (imagine food that’s been sitting in a jar of water for an hour. It breaks downs and softens). It also mixes with your stomach acid, helping it soak into the food better and relieving acid indigestion for some people. </p>
<p>Water is very heavy though and drinking too much can fill your stomach and make you feel bloated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I drink anywhere up to 3L a day and I still never feel refreshed. Water after or before a meal may aid in fullness because it causes whatever you're eating to expand in the stomach (ex. bread, rice, etc.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
