		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Breast milk antibodies protect infants in two ways. In newborns, for a short period, the antibodies are actively transferred from the gut into the bloodstream. In both newborns and older infants, antibodies from breast milk remain in the gut, providing protection against pathogens in the gut.</p>
<p>(In some but not all species, antibodies can also be transferred from the mother to the fetus through the placenta.)</p>
<p>Since adults are past the phase where their gut can absorb antibodies, you can’t get passive protection in the blood from oral delivery of antibodies. You can still get protection against gut pathogens this way (and several companies market antibody drinks for this purpose) but unlike vaccines this is a short term passive effect. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>... enhanced transfer of macromolecules across the immature intestinal epithelium takes place during the fetal and neonatal periods (1). The high intestinal permeability during these periods is due to the high endocytic capacity of the immature (fetal-type) enterocytes (2–4). ... transfer can be more selective due to epithelial expression of the neonatal Fc (fragment crystallizable) receptor (FcRn) that binds and mediates the transepithelial transfer of immunoglobulin G (IgG) (5–11).</p>
<p>This property of the intestinal epithelium is largely lost with the progress of development and maturation, during the fetal and neonatal periods, until macromolecular transepithelial transfer ceases at the time of the so-called “gut closure.”  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The neonate acquires Igs from two routes: IgG passed transplacentally before birth and IgM, IgA, and IgG delivered via the milk (1). ...In rodents, IgG is also passed from the milk into the serum via the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)3 present in the duodenum ... Milk IgA and IgM are not absorbed significantly in any species and act locally in the intestinal lumen </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's not how our immune system work, sadly. By getting an injection of antibodies, you would only have protection for as long as the antibodies circulated in the system, but your body would not learn to make their own antibodies for recognizing pathogens.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>For babies, their adaptive immune system is not developed, so they rely on antibodies passed from their mothers to protect them in the start, but this is not feasable long-term.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Important to note too that breast milk contains IgA, which is primarily mucosal immunity (think gut, sinuses, etc. Places where your body faces the outside world). Babies get a healthy supply of IgG, which is the antibody most people think of colloquially, from the placenta and mom’s blood while still in utero. But as others have mentioned just getting antibodies works for a few months. Which is great for babies because it covers them until their own immune system comes online.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The type of antibodies produced in breast milk are igA which are effective mostly in the digestive tract and immediate surrounding areas and only somewhat throughout the body. There are many other types of antibodies that are much more effective at fighting diseases which are not really found in breast milk. All based on knowledge from years ago so sorry it's just surface level stuff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This kind of immunity is called passive - it's effectively the same as antibody therapy where an infected person is injected with antibodies made by someone else. The problem is the antibodies don't last long - once the treatment/feeding stops, the antibodies dwindle.  </p>
<p>When you're vaccinated, or infected, your body produces B and T cells in response. The B cells produce the antibodies that fight the infection, while T cells do something similar. After infection, B and T cells become <em>memory</em> cells which can last for a lifetime. If you're subsequently infected by the same antigen, these memory cells spring into action and your body starts producing antibodies to fight the infection.  </p>
<p>In short it's the difference between being given something to fight the infection with, and having your own ability to manufacture a cure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
