		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well pretty much any plant can grow roots in water, it's just that plants that aren't woody grow them much easier and faster. Most woody cuttings need some rooting hormone to help them grow roots in water, but it's still possible. Willow contains lots of indolbutyric acid (which is an auxin) and salicylic acid which both help in growing roots. Some people use willow extract to help other cuttings root as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many good explanations on her but I feel its necessary to mention that plants have cells similar to stem cells (pun but also science) stored in certain parts of the plant. Where they grow branches off the main line.  These cells normally end up becoming shoot off from the little reverse armpits that form where branches grow.  If cut in the right spot, you can coax these cells to turn into roots given a root forming environment.  Any more questions please ask, plants are incredible creatures and deserve to be learned about about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can someone provide some good options for houseplants to do this with? I have two cool hanging glass vases in a sunroom. Someone gave them to me with plants already in them and they thrived for a couple years until finally dying off. I literally only had to keep water in the vases. I went to our local nursery and asked and I was told plants canâ€™t do that, no way your plants survived that long. I was like, they did though! They were no help. One of the plants was a dangly viney plant and the other had leafy shoots that grew straight up out of the vase.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The process you describe is called vegetative propagation, or sometimes referred to as cloning. While some plants do this naturally with little to no assistance, with the right plant hormones and technique you can get a vast amount of plants to propagate this way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Growing viable roots from any part of the plant, when detached, is a very complicated process (as with everything that involves growing new body parts or structures). Plants that need it to spread and survive had selection pressure to keep those mechanisms working. For any that didn't have that selection pressure (that didn't need this behavior), either some part of the complex process broke through random chance or it was actively selected out if it conflicted with some other trait that was better for survival.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
