		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fungi use a system of protein receptors which can identify foreign matter in a manner similar to plants and animals.</p>
<p>&quot;A class of cytosolic Nucleotide Oligomerization Domain (NOD)-like receptors, or NLRs, contribute to this recognition and discrimination process in plants and animals [2,3]. Less is known about how fungi monitor their interactions with their biotic environments. </p>
<p>Here, we summarize evidence indicating that fungi have similar NLR proteins and may use similar mechanisms to recognize and respond to heterospecific nonself; we outline similarities and differences with their plant and animal counterparts, and we propose future directions elucidating aspects of fungal immune systems.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They won't have anything like the vertebrate adaptive immune system, but they do have a variety of immune defenses.  They can use <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/104/31/12902.full.pdf" target="_blank">RNA silencing</a> to control viral infections, and of course fungi are famous for producing antimicrobial compounds to fight off bacteria...most notably penicillin.  Many of those may be fighting competitors more than pathogens though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
