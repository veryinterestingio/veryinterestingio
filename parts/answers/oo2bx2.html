		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's possible they're selling stock or other assets, their stock may pay dividends, they can be borrowing money against the value of their stock, or have income not tied to their primary asset (for example owning a less famous private business that generates cash).  </p>
<p>In the US, often we can know something because US corporate reporting requirements are pretty stringent.  Very large holders of a company must report sales (so we know that Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos are constantly selling shares of Microsoft and Amazon because they report the sales).  Elon Musk though doesn't sell Tesla stock, but in Telsa's financials include information about loans he has which are backed by pledged Tesla stock. </p>
<p>We know a lot less about the other business they own when those are private companies, because private companies don't have to report as much information publicly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can borrow against your stock without selling it.</p>
<p>Say you have $100 worth of stock in a taxable account.  If you sell it, you'd be subject to capital gains taxes of 20% (you're rich in this example).  </p>
<p>But you could take out a $50 loan with the stock as collateral and pay single digit interest on it which would be better than double digit taxes.  You might only pay 5% total interest on that loan instead of 20% in taxes.</p>
<p>The cash from the loans isn't taxable income, it's &quot;debt.&quot;  And because it's debt, you can actually use it to offset your taxes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A salary is just money paid directly to them from their company. It's most likely not their primary source of income. They still get money from returns and dividends on stocks and other investments.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They take an essentially unlimited line of credit that is backed by their ever growing equity based assets. The assets continue to grow making their line of credit  for all practical purposes unlimited. When they die, because of the step up basis, their equity is reset to its new value as the basis for future appreciation meaning that their heirs have to pay zero capital gains tax on the gains. If they do what Peter Thiel did, they stuff their founderâ€™s shares in a Roth IRA, so that they literally never have to pay taxes on any future gains forever.</p>
<p>It is also great because there are many easy policy fixes for this like putting limitations on the total untaxed amount of a Roth IRA, or putting a tax on lines of credit for individual citizens over X amount, and none of these are hard, and specifically target high net individuals, but congress is composed also of high net individuals who refuse to do literally anything to prevent the rich from never paying their fair share of taxes. /s</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other thing they've been doing lately is taking out loans secured against there stock. You then use the lona money for your day to day living costs and pay maybe 3% interest on it. Meanwhile your stock portfolio continues to grow at on average 10% per year. When the loan term comes up there rich enough to simply get another one against the stock to refinance it.</p>
<p>Eventually when you die the loan(s) would be paid off from your estate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
