		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The problem is something called genomic imprinting. There are genes that are only expressed when they come a sperm or an egg. So if you take genes from two eggs you will have two sets of genes active or inactive when you should have one active and one inactive. That's bad and generally results in a dead embryo. </p>
<p>It is possible to work around it, but it's not something that can be done in humans yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It's not trivial: although most of the organelles of a viable embryo are found in the egg, the sperm does deliver the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centriole" target="_blank">centriole</a>.  But I think we've done it with mice.</p>
<p>Some genes have a mechanism for detecting whether they were inherited from the female parent or the male parent and changing their behavior accordingly; these genes would malfunction if there were no male parent.  The child would have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prader%E2%80%93Willi_syndrome" target="_blank">Prader's Syndrome</a>, and probably some worse conditions as well, unless you successfully anticipated and found ways to prevent all of them.  So attempting it would be highly unethical.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
