		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because companies don't usually report rent payments to the credit scoring agencies (Transunion, Experian, Equifax). Same with most utility bills (phone, electricity, etc.). If your landlord <em>does</em> report your payment history to the credit companies then it can count in your favor but I don't think that's too common. </p>
<p>And of course if you're late on payments that can get reported to the credit agencies and negatively impact your score.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Things have to be reported to the credit bureaus for them to consider them. If you're paying rent but the landlord never reports it, it won't do anything. Most landlords/management companies still do not bother to report unless you miss a payment. All three major credit bureaus will take rental payments into consideration if they're reported.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At most places you pre-pay for the week, month, etc., so the landlord isn’t extending you any “credit.” Conversely, the utility and credit card companies (etc.) provide you with advance service/spending power and then you repay them after the fact.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
