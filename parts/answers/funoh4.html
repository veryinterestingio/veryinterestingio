		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have assisted at microsurgery for limb reattachment. Larger blood vessels and nerves are relatively easily brought together, but the nerve bundles within a nerve sheath can’t always be directed to the muscles they originally supplied. Many tiny blood vessels and nerves are sewn together with suture material so thin one can’t see it without a microscope. This kind of surgery can take 10-12 hours. Success depends on how ragged the injury was, the length of time the limb was separated, associated muscle damage and obviously the skill of the surgeon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Larger nerve endings and blood vessels will be lined up as best as possible, but it will never be perfect. I am not sure exactly what happens with the nerves, but certainly there were be some loss of motor and sensory function. Blood vessels would rapidly repair themselves or form new vessels through angiogenesis.</p>
<p>Basically the blood vessels are fairly easy, but nerves are very hard to fix, might require multiple surgeries and may never be the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
