		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok, I explain it to patients like this:  when I give you a shot into a muscle, that fluid is going to go into a finite space and it needs to shove everything aside to make room for itself to fit in there.  Where it fits is where you feel that knot.  The muscle fibers around the knot are shoved together in what was THEIR previous finite space and because of this, the nerves are under pressure, too, and feel sore.  (Edited to add: your muscle fibers can also tear there if they need to move really suddenly.  And that's the same soreness you get when you lift weights and aren't used to it, or up your total amount of weight. Same breaking down, building up soreness)</p>
<p>Getting the injection hurts more if your muscle is tight, that's why some people count to three and give the shot before 3 so you don't tense it up to prepare for that.  I like to do something like tap your shoulder immediately before I give the shot.  That makes the muscle flinch, or tense and then relax, and that knot is made inside looser muscle fibers.  So it is less sore. </p>
<p>The larger the shot, the more that knot is going to hurt.  Because the more muscle tissue will need to move to make room for that.  Some shots are 0.5ml or 1.0 ml.  Those are normal shots.  I think I went up to 3.0 ml per shot, but I think you CAN go up to 4 or 5.  But that's not nice.  It's gonna hurt like a mofo. </p>
<p>Now, the thickness of the fluid I'm injecting makes it hurt more.  As in thicker, needs to really push aside those fibers, thin fluid can kind of slip around them and push them aside more gently.  This is compounded by a shot being refrigerated, which will increase the viscosity.  So if I get a thick fluid out to give a shot and don't warm it up a little, well, what's worse than the &quot;peanut butter shot?&quot;  A cold &quot;peanut butter shot.&quot;</p>
<p>So now you've got a big knot in your arm.  Of medicine.  Your body is like wtf, and goes rushing to check that out.  This is your inflammatory response.  Lots of blood goes there, to decide which blood components need to get to work.  Do we need to react to a bacteria?  Or get this vaccine to working? Or is this just a punch in the arm?  All the blood going there right away makes the site red and hot at first.  And more swollen and painful.  When that settles down and your body stops being irritated about it and figures out what it has to do, that calms down and your blood gets to work.  </p>
<p>So your body starts swapping it's own fluid for the medicated fluid.  Because your body isn't into sudden change, it likes to ease into things, its going to leave a knot behind of its own kind.  So that gap in the muscle can ease back, it doesnt slam right back to where it was.  The medicated fluid gets taken off to do it's thing, and the inactive ingredients get flushed out of the body.  The lymph system basically does this work, or decides who's who rather, and therefore your lymph nodes may seem swollen.  They're busy. I find my lymph node swelling and pain correlates directly to that knot hurting.  But I'm me and you're you. </p>
<p>So now this knot made up of your own fluid just needs to disperse the rest of the way.  This is the interesting part, I think.  If I put this injection into a muscle you tend to use more, it will disperse faster.  All that flexing and extending works the fluid out.  OR you could put slight heat to it, that opens up the highways and gets more blood there faster to carry the other fluid out. But if you do that too soon, you'll rush TOO much blood there and it will hurt more and for a longer period of time. Because the blood sticks around for that initial stage of figuring out what it needs to do.  You don't need loiterers hanging out where there wasnt room for this shot in the first place, and the muscle got shoved around to make room for it.   So I just tell people to use that muscle more instead of applying heat.  Since most people cant ask their blood if it's figured out what to do yet or not. </p>
<p>Someone on reddit here recently said double mastectomy patients should get their vaccines in their thighs.  Well, yes, and no.  I prefer the glutes.  Yep.  As in assume the position.  Because, think about it:  it is harder to tense up your glute muscles than the front of your thighs. You've gotta think to tense your glutes. Your thighs, yeah, just bend your knees.  Thats pretty easy.  So it will hurt less to get the initial injection in your glutes.   Both muscles get used when you walk, so you'll work that knot out sooner.  AND the bigger the muscle, the more room there is to push muscle fibers aside.  And that knot doesn't hurt as much in the first place.</p>
<p>Edited to add:  jeez, kids, with the awards! What the actual hell?  I've never seen so much bling on any Reddit comment of mine in my life!  Lookit me, over here, with all these awards.  I'm so fancyyyy, you already know....</p>
<p>Edit #2:  ok, remember, people.  Everyone is different.  All these things that happen are natural biological processes that have some sort of function, or reason, behind them.  But the degrees to which they happen differ from person to person, vaccination to vaccination, injection to injection.  What may be true for you may not be true for anyone else you know, but true for half of the people over there.  Variations don't mean anything bad.  We're just different.  Different in itself means absolutely nothing.  We just experience the same things in different ways.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Any damage to the tissues will mean inflammatory proteins like cytokines and interleukins will be secreted. These recruit immune cells and other proteins to the area. At the same time, these also have other functions like vasodilation, which causes swelling. This causes swelling of the area where the inflammatory proteins can reach, but it wonâ€™t be the entire muscle. Swelling causes pain because it puts pressure on nerves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A couple reasons depending on the timing you're referring to.</p>
<p>If you're talking within 24 hours then it's likely because the fluid of the vaccine is actually supposed to dispense throughout the surrounding muscle, not just the exact area around the injection site. This is why you're supposed to use the muscle after an injection to allow the fluid to disperse and eventually soothe the pain. Additionally, around this time you're getting a localized immune response to the foreign material in your body. This causes (potentially) pain, swelling, redness, warmth.</p>
<p>If after 24 hours (or pain in other muscles) this is due to the systemic immune eystem creating an immune response to the &quot;infection&quot;. This is a good thing because it means your immune system is building antibodies and memory cells which will cause immunity in the future.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nurse here, i can't have sure about this specific vaccine but a lot of IM medications are oily, and when they are injected the oily substance spread between the muscular fibers until it finally is absorbed or in vaccines it is isolated and starts the immune response by the body</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
