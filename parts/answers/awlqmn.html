		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It originally was made acceptable by William Halsted, one of the founding doctors at Johns Hopkins. He became addicted to coke while testing it as an anesthetic and would work for days. He expected his students to work these long hours too and it became a sort of tradition. It's super dangerous and ridiculous that we still let people work those hours. Even if the adrenaline of surgery/ER keeps you going it is proven that after 16hrs there's a steep fall off in mental focus, motor skills, and decision making abilities no matter who you are. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>However, studies have found that handing patients off from one doctor to another is even MORE risky, since important information is not often passed on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi. I am resident in thoracic surgery. I have 24 hour shifts around 6-7 times a month. After regular 8 hours I continue with 16 hours in emegency surgical ambulant. Sometimes I continue as a thoracic surgeon consultant for the whole hospital. There are also days,  when  i have to continue next day on the thoracic department, especially if we are low on staff.</p>
<p>But why you ask? In our hospital it all depends on the number of doctors on the department.  Shifts have to be covered. For example there are only 4 thoracic surgeons in our hospital. And those 4 surgeons have to fill a whole month of shifts, plus regular work in daytime. And the only option to do that, is being there a whole bunch of hours.
Departments with fair number of doctors do not have those crazy hours. They work in 8 hours daytime or 16 hours afternoon/night shift with free day afterwards</p>
<p>I do not have problems with those terms, because adrenaline keeps me going. It only sucks when I get home, adrenaline gets depleted and all I can do is being vegetable on the couch. Thank god that my lady understands this.</p>
<p>ELI5 answer: Number of doctors on the department dictates how many hours will each one have to cover. Many doctors= less crazy hours. Few doctors= shitload of crazy hours. There is no way around it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The scarcity of docs is TOTALLY artificially imposed by the accrediting body for med schools.  It is a ploy to keep the salaries artificially high.  Compare it to lawyers for example.  Much more diversity in law salaries and many lawyers can't even get work in law.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
