		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Flight times are counting &quot;block time&quot;. This is the time from when the blocks are removed from the wheels of the plane at the gate and it can push back, to the time the plane enters the gate at the destination and has the blocks put back on its wheels to stay in place.</p>
<p>This means that taxiing time, waiting for take off clearance, etc., is all part of a flight time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mainly due to the routing. We are not really allowed to fly direct from say JFK to BOS. This is due to the amount of air traffic and airspace between the two. So generally you will get routed away from the incoming flow, and have to avoid military and outbound traffic from other airports. So even though the straight line distance may be 150 Miles, the actual route of flight could be 250 or 300. Same with altitudes, We can't just fly there at 5000 feet, and actually that would take longer as we are limited to 250Kts below 10000 feet, so generally we will fly around 17-21000 feet due to speed and traffic and airspace. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of good answers here, but basically the plane isn't going 500mph for the whole time it leaves the terminal until it arrives at the next terminal. </p>
<p>Think of it this way; You work 10 miles from home, the speed limit on the road to work is 60 miles an hour, so you should be at their door 10 minutes after you leave your door? No. Because there's time invloved in getting from your door to the car, getting to the highway, getting up to speed, getting off the highway, driving to the building, parking the car, leaving the car and getting to the door.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Becuase medium and large airliners dont take direct routres,</p>
<p>the idea is that all air traffic is done in corridors, which are flight paths calculated to be the lowest cost, insurance reasons and such, also like that all airports have take off and landing corridors, meaning that before going to its destination, a flight must leave an airport in a specific path until it reaches its designated altitude and then it can head out in the direction its supposed to go. </p>
<p>So basically, even if the distance is 190 miles which is around 20 minutes in the avarage cruise speed of a normal airliner (around 500-600 MPH), the landing and take off manuvers are around 25-30 minutes each, between the landing/take off window, the designated corridors, line up manuvers and such. </p>
<p>So on a 6-8 hour flight its not a big deal, but for a short city hop, it can be annoying.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
