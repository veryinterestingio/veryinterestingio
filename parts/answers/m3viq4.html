		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's the same effect as water droplets, just really really small because oils have a lower surface tension than water, so they will form smaller drops. This magnifies the pixels just enough that you only see one or two in a drop, and that creates the glitchy pattern.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>With light hitting it you see one effect, with phone screen light hitting it you see another from the other side, the two together make it look trippy and glitchy</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because of the coating on your phone and the surface tension of the different substances. High end phones typically have a coating that makes it hard for oil to stick but eventually that wears off and it just makes it hard for water to stick. If you put water on something without the coating like a tv you'll notice the same effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's something called light interference.
Oil makes a thin coat on your screen and light emitting from your phone bends and breaks up to its main components(the colors you see).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
