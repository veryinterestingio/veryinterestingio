		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Scientists want their discoveries to be widely published so the world can benefit from them. </p>
<p>In the old days, the best way to do this was to give the copyright away to a publisher, who would then print and distribute copies all over the world in their journals. If you wanted to read the journal, you had to pay to cover the distribution costs.</p>
<p>The scientist doesn't get anything in exchange, other than their work being distributed.</p>
<p>Over time people started endowing journals with prestige. If you wanted to be take seriously as a scientist, you needed to be published in prestigious journals. This let the journals charge ever increasing fees, since the more prestigious, the higher the value and fee.</p>
<p>Nowadays we have the internet so the distribution costs are tiny, but the journals still have control over the prestige, which is often linked to scientific funding. It is starting to change, however, with open source publishing models.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In this context, copyright has nothing to do with the author. When you publish a scientific article you give up your rights as an author in favour of the publisher. This is the reason many authors share pre-prints of the articles instead of the final version (own by the publisher).</p>
<p>But as mentioned in another comment, universities usually have agreements in order to facilitate access to papers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're asking philosophically, it's a bit indefensible.  If you're asking legally, it's because The Copyright Act of 1976 doesn't reference the authors life at all (what if the author died young), but runs to 95 years and 1932 + 95 = 2027.  It doesn't matter that it's a scientific paper, it doesn't matter that it was <em>almost</em> 95 years.  </p>
<p>Keep in mind though, the facts in the paper aren't copyrightable.  So, with a Chemistry paper, for instance, you could likely describe even the same instance of the experiment.  You can lift tables and information that simply describes facts, but not the &quot;creative&quot; portions.</p>
<p>This is not legal advice.  A lawsuit you win can still be expensive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PriwCi6SzLo" target="_blank">controversial subject</a> in science. Research is typically funded by the public, the papers are peer reviewed by volunteers, and the resulting papers are then sold by publishers for big profit margins. There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-Hub" target="_blank">initiatives</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preprint" target="_blank">to change this</a>, but if a scientist wants to appear in a prestigious <a href="https://www.thevespiary.org/library/Files_Uploaded_by_Users/Sedit/Journal%20of%20Chemical%20Education%20\(797Megs\)/web/Hive%20PDFs/000502281-ethanol-reactions.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a>, this typically includes handing over the copyright to a big publisher.</p>
<p>Copyright lasts as long as it does because big companies that gain their money with copyrighted works (e.g. Disney) have consistently and successfully <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Term_Extension_Act" target="_blank">lobbied for extending copyright</a>. So the long term of copyright is mainly for the benefit of companies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sci-hub. Not that I'm recommending pirating these papers or anything but some unscrupulous scoundrels do it at sci-hub. And they check Wikipedia for the latest domain that's up and working. And they've been using it for years and found it to be a great website with access to almost any paper.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
