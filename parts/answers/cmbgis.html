		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you started a country, Boilerville, and printed 100 Boilers Bucks. You do this because you stashed some a lump of gold somewhere, so each B.B. is worth 1/100 of the gold lump. People would start using that money for trade, investments, saving, etc. There might be times where people decide it’s a bad time to invest and your economy slows down as people hoard their money in savings. Why shouldn’t they? Each B.B. they have is 1/100 of the gold lump so there’s no harm in holding onto it, the value isn’t going anywhere. Eventually, the lack of investment starts to hurt your economy.</p>
<p>As the ruler of Boilerville, you are under pressure that the economy isn’t growing because people aren’t investing. So you decide to release 10 extra B.B. without increasing the amount of gold you’ve stored. Suddenly, each B.B. is 1/110 a lump of gold and hoarding your B.B. is a bad strategy. So the hoarders decide to invest their money so they can at least have as much value as they might have lost.</p>
<p>This is a gross oversimplification why most currencies are controlled to slowly devalue over time.</p>
<p>Edit: this is gaining a lot of attention so I should bring some things up:</p>
<p>“Devaluing” currency typically refers to international trade. Let’s expand my example and add another country Neighbortown with their currency Neighbor Nickels, which are also 1/100 a lump of gold.</p>
<p>Devaluing can be good for a few reason:</p>
<p>When we turn the value of a B.B. to 1/110, Neighbor Nickels haven’t changed value in terms of gold. Now one N.N. is worth more than a B.B. ...At first this seems like a bad idea for Boilerville, but it has other effects.</p>
<p>The citizens of neighbortown now use their valuable money to buy things at a cheaper price in Boilerville. This helps the people of Boilerville because they’re doing more business. In economic terms, it raises Boilerville’s exports and Neighbortown’s imports.</p>
<p>Let’s also say some businessmen of Boilerville borrowed money from their friends in neighbortown last week, before the devaluing. In their contract they said “give us 10 B.B. today so we can invest it and we’ll give you 11 B.B. next week with interest”. This seemed like a good idea to the neighbortown businessmen because they thought they’d make some money so they agreed. But, after the change, B.B.s went from 1/100 gold to 1/110 gold... and now the neighbortown businessmen got back the same amount of value they initially sent. By devaluing currency, debts shrink.</p>
<p>Imports, exports, and debts are all very important in international trade.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Remember holographic Charizard Pokemon cards? Kids go crazy when they find one in a booster pack because they are so rare to find. </p>
<p>Now imagine the company that makes Pokémon cards decide to print a bunch more or release a bunch of extra they had stocked in their warehouse -and may even immediately trade them for stuff because they know people find them valuable. </p>
<p>But soon after, kids begin to realize the company has made charizards so common that they don’t find them as interesting and as valuable as they used to be</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>China has a policy of maintaining a certain exchange rate between the Yuan and the US Dollar. In particular, it wants foreigners to see the Yuan as cheap. This will encourage them to invest and do business in China. </p>
<p>If you want something to be cheap, ensure there is a lot of it. China does this by printing Yuan and using them to buy US government debt. The Chinese government gets the debt (a stable, if not very exciting investment), and investors in the US get Yuan. All that Yuan floating around makes it cheap, and that keeps the exchange rate low. </p>
<p>China gets enormous benefits from this policy by encouraging foreign investment and rapid growth of its industrialized sectors. However, there are two important downsides. The first is the standard issue faced by a country with a weak currency - it is relatively expensive to import things. The second is a result of the Chinese government's willingness to print money to keep the exchange rate where it wants it. All that extra Yuan leads to inflation in Yuan-denominated prices. Inflation in China is often higher than it is elsewhere, and there's less of a guarantee that wages will keep pace. In the long term, this can put a strain on ordinary people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with the way international trade interacts with domestic economies. Basically, if you devalue your currency against other currencies, then people in other countries will buy more of your goods because they are more affordable. Therefore your businesses get to do more business, therefore your economy is stronger, even if your money has less international buying power.</p>
<p>The opposite trade off is also viable. Keep your currency valuable so that you can buy more off of foreign markets. There are international rules about how much a country is allowed to mess with their currency, but changes in value also happen naturally. </p>
<p>I believe China devalues their currency by buying large amounts of foreign currency with than on exchange markets, this putting more of it into international circulation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
