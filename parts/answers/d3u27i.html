		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For capillary action to occur, the liquid in question has to wet the surface of the capillary. So the gravitational potential energy is offset by the energy gained from the wetting of the liquid to the capillary surface. This leads to a quite nice and intuitive mathematical description for the height, h, the liquid moves up the capillary (called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurin%27s_law" target="_blank">Jurin's law</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>h = 2 γ cos(<em>θ</em>) /  <em>ρ</em>rg  </p>
<p>h = height  </p>
<p>γ = surface energy of liquid  </p>
<p><em>θ</em> = liquid-surface contact angle  </p>
<p><em>ρ =</em> liquid density  </p>
<p>r = radius of capillary  </p>
<p>g = gravitational constant</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This can be thought of as essentially a ratio of the interfacial energetics (top) and the gravitation energetics (bottom). The greater the affect of gravity, e.g. more dense the liquid or a stronger gravitational field, the lower the height. Counter to this, the greater the interfacial affects the higher the height.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what was already mentioned, you would need to put energy in the system to reverse the process. Right now, you probably have a lot of potential energy with respect so some deep pit somewhere, despite the fact you personally never put in the energy to climb out of the pit (since you never found yourself inside it). You could in theory exchange that potential energy for kinetic by jumping into it, but in the great scheme of things, conversion of energy is not violated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the molecules within different materials experience attractive and repulsive intermolecular forces between themselves and each other, there can be a potential energy associated with surfaces. In capillary action, it is energetically more favorable for the liquid molecules to be clinging near the surface of the tube than to just each other. This allows it to rise against gravity, lowering that surface potential energy and gaining gravitational potential energy by rising, until they balance out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While it is true what all the other posters have stated, one factor was omitted so far: Evaporation!</p>
<p>A tree is basically a special type of pump. In addition to the forces of capillary action that have been mentioned so far, the tree evaporates water steam from its leaves. This means that water &quot;goes missing&quot; on top of the tree. Since the entire system is &quot;closed&quot;, it creates a reduced pressure up there which sucks up water from below (we know that it is actually pushed up by the air pressure surrounding us).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Trees work with more complex systems than capillary forces alone. But one of the ways I've learnt capillary action works, and the easiest to understand imo, is by differences in pressure. Take a very thin tube and place it on the surface of water and it will draw water into that tube. This is because in the surrounding atmosphere there are a defined number of molecules hitting the surface of the water per second, and in the tubes atmosphere since it is smaller, there are less molecules able to enter the tube so less molecules are hitting inside the tube per second (causing a reduction in pressure). The water will rise in the tube until the water both outside and inside feel the same pressure (or molecules hitting per second).
From a free energy point of view:
This is a spontaneous occurrence at the right conditions (at 0 pressure this cant happen) and can be related to entropy. The outside atmosphere has a higher state of disorder, as there are more molecules in the total atmosphere. Inside the tube there is less disorder as there are less molecules per area, so it is driven towards equilibrium by the rise in water.
So yes, this is related to the free energy of a system (although not chemical free energy since no bonds are being broken or formed)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
