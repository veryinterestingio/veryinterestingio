		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: we don't actually know HOW we fall asleep.</p>
<p>Longer answer: Disengaging from being awake is a gradual process. Turning off the lights, closing your eyes, and cozying up allows you to relax and starts the process. As we all know &quot;sleep&quot; has many stages, but your brain isn't going to start the process unless it senses that your body is ready for it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our bodies need sleep, and our bodies like to sleep at the &quot;right&quot; time.  For most humans, the best time to sleep is nighttime. (We can't see very well at night, and so it's better for us to sleep when we can't do things as well.)</p>
<p>However, your body is designed not to fall asleep easily because falling asleep in the wrong time or place could be dangerous. Because of this, your body likes to fall asleep slowly, and it likes to wait until certain things have happened. Because it's best for us to sleep at night, your body prefers to wait until it is dark outside. Because sleep can make us vulnerable, your body prefers to only sleep when it really, really needs rest. Your body is smart, and it is always looking for clues that falling asleep is a safe thing to do! It pays attention to how light or dark it is outside, and how tired you are.</p>
<p>Pretending to sleep is another kind of clue. Being relaxed with your eyes closed helps your body understand that you are in a safe, warm place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Would you really want your body to just instantly fall asleep when it felt tired or you had a whim to be asleep?</p>
<p>Asleep is a really vulnerable position to be in.  It's also very much a state that your body has to do a little preparation to get you to get into.</p>
<p>I do not in anyway pretend to intricately understand everything required to go to sleep but generally it seems like the human body keeps direct control of vital life functions out of reach of the conscious mind.  Like you can't just stop your heart right now.  You can relax and slow your breathing in an attempt to calm your heart but direct light switch control is withheld.  I'm assuming so we don't just accidentally kill ourselves by accident all the time.</p>
<p>You &quot;pretending&quot; to go to sleep is probably just your way of letting your body know it's time to snooze.  At which point is starts the process of snoozing until you fall asleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It always bothers me to see how kids that need to to go to sleep will fight it and become more and more agitated, crying, tantrums etc when they are tired. It’s a major flaw in the human design.
I think as adults we need to relax (or ‘pretend’ before sleeping) to calm down and get rid of all/most the thoughts that swirl in our heads and maybe, as a legacy of evolution, wait a bit to make sure our sleeping environment is safe enough so no sabre tooth tiger will eat us when unconscious. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
