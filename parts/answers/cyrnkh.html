		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It means that your hands and fingers are tucked in and your arms aren't flailing around or trying to grab a hold of  things on your way down.</p>
<p>So basicly it's a way of preventing dislocated shoulders, broken arms or broken fingers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it's the position that creates the least additional drag, making you go faster. Arms loose will catch water in your armpits, slowing you down. Arms straight at your sides or straight up will rub against the slide, slowing you down. By crossing your arms over your chest, you keep them as narrow as possible, while not bringin them into contact with the slide or the water. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>For ideal slide speed, also cross your ankles and slightly arch your body so only one heel and your shoulder blades are in contact with the slide. The will provide the least resistance and thus the fastest speed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
