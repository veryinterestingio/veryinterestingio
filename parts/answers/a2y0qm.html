		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is a combination of three factors. First one is anatomical.  Unlike animals whose vocal folds are found at the larynx, the equivalent organ on the birds, called the syrinx, is found on the trachea fork and spreads to the both bronchus branches. This gives the birds the ability to produce multiple sounds at the same time( in a way they have stereo sound production compared to mono mammals). Due to this, parrots have the anatomical ability to mimic human voice/words without requiring a human like larynx or lips or tongue. </p>
<p>Second one is intelligence. Parrots are very intelligent birds. Intelligence allows an animal to be more “behaviorally plastic” and let them behave in ways that they dont necessary do in the wild. Plus, parrots can comprehend the meaning of words they speak. So it is not pure mimicking. They, to some extend, know what they are saying and can express them selves. This makes the difference between mimicking and talking. Alex the African grey parrot is the only non human animal to ask a question. He was trained on identifying the colors, numbers and shapes or certain objects. One day he asked his question what color he was and according to the story learned he was gray after it was <del>related 3 times</del> repeated 6 times.</p>
<p>The third and last piece is being social. In the wild parrots live in large flocks. It is important for a parrot to memorize and mimic the unique calls of its flock. This is how members of the flock can find each other and remain together. When we humans become their flock, they have an instinctive urge to memorize and mimic our unique calls, same way they do for their flock. Anyone who owned a parrot knows they love talking when you shout at them from another room, but they tend to be much quieter when you are in the same room. In nature the multiple flocks can share the same area, calls unique to each flock allow each individual to find its flock. When a parrot can’t see their owner, they make sure that the flock-mate can still hear the unique calls of your flock so two of you won’t lose each other.</p>
<p>As a side note, parrots are not the only birds that can talk. Many corvid species can also speak, although their words are not as clear as, or easy to understand compared that of parrots.</p>
<p><strong>Edit;Thanks for the upvotes and the gold guys. Its great to see people are interested to learn about these great birds.</strong></p>
<p>Few little corrections; as some comments pointed out, Alex is the first animal to ask an existential question. This basically means that he asked a question about its own existence. I am sure there are other animals that asked questions, mainly in the form of request, permission etc, but Alex is the only animal to ask a question concerning himself. It is often considered as an significant event because it indicates the existence of &quot;theory of mind&quot;. Simply, Alex not only Alex showed a high level of self consciousness, he also showed an understanding that other concision beings exist and they might now the answer of a question that he didn't know. I must point out that there is some criticism about how much the question Alex asked was sincere and how much was it him just repeating what he was trained for all his life (Alex was the subject of an experiment where he was trained to identify the shape, size, number and color of objects). Although Alex's ability to ask questions is documented many times.</p>
<p>Second point I want to make is about I might have went a bit overboard with the sentence &quot;Plus, parrots can comprehend the meaning of words they speak&quot;. A better way of saying this is they can use words with context. They at best have a very limited understating of grammar and even when tif they can form sentences, the grammar is often broken. But Alex did use some simple, grammatically correct, expressions. He would use the term &quot;wanna go&quot; and completed it with where he would like to go, like wanna go back, and he would say &quot;wanna banana&quot; when he wanted a banana. He could use personal pronouns and spoke differently when referring to himself or others. He also showed the ability to generate words of his own. He was not familiar with apples, when he was introduced to apples, he named the apple &quot;banerry&quot;. A mixture of banana and cherry that he was familiar with. </p>
<p>It is important to note that Alex was an exceptional smart parrot. He was probably a genius in gray parrot standards. Since his death 10 years ago, we couldn't find another gray parrot that had an equivalent level of abstract thinking. Wiki page for alex gives a good summery of his accomplishments, some of which are very impressive;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Parrots are vocal learners, meaning they grasp sounds by hearing and then imitating them. Although several other bird species can discern and repeat sounds, parrots are the pros.</p>
<p>Erich Jarvis, a Duke University neuroscientist and vocal learning expert, recently published a study in Plos One explaining why. Any bird that’s a vocal learner has a part of the brain devoted to this, called the ‘song system.’ But in parrots, the song system has two layers—an inner ‘core,’ common to all avian vocal learners, and an outer ‘shell,’ which is unique to parrots. Jarvis thinks that this recently discovered ‘shell’ is what allows parrots to be such expert mimickers (though he hasn’t figured out exactly how it works yet).</p>
<p>But why do they copy human speech? Peer pressure, it turns out. Parrots naturally try to fit in, be it among other parrots or other people.</p>
<p>In the wild, parrots use their vocal prowess to share important information and fit in with the flock, says Irene Pepperberg, a research associate and part-time lecturer at Harvard. Pepperberg is best known for her work probing the intelligence of an African Grey Parrot called Alex, who lived in Pepperberg’s lab for 30 years, until his death in 2007.  “A single bird in the wild is a dead bird; It can’t look for food and look for predators at the same time,” Pepperberg says—but in a flock they can trade off responsibilities.</p>
<p>Parrots are even capable of learning and using varying dialects. Yellow-naped Amazon Parrots in Costa Rica, for example, have regional dialects, and when they swap regions, the transplants often pick up the local twang, Tim Wright, who studies parrot vocalization at New Mexico State University, found in his research.</p>
<p>So plop a parrot into a human household, and it will “try to integrate itself into the situation as though the people were its flock members,” says Pepperberg.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're very smart animals and happen to have a vocal range close enough to that of people. They learn words by hearing them, and can even learn what they mean through context, just like you or I, or any other person. They're also driven to learn the sounds we make out of a need for friends and family; they understand that humans are a big &quot;flock&quot; and they want to fit in with us for food and safety.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
