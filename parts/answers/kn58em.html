		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Seán is an Irish name and is properly spelled with a fada, the diacritic over the 'a'. It's commonly left out when you're not writing in Irish though. Bean is an English surname and follows different orthographical conventions. </p>
<p>Oddly enough, the word <em>sean</em> (without fada) means 'old' and <em>bean</em> means 'woman.' A <em>sean bhean</em> or <em>sean ḃean</em> would be an old woman.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>phonetic consistency doesn't matter with proper nouns, and often doesnt even matter in many languages at all, like English.</p>
<p>Languages where every letter only can make one sound, like Spanish, is where you'll find phonetic consistency. But again, those rules dont apply to proper nouns, like names.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
