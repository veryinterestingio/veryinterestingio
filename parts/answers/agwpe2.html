		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They actually use a pretty simple URL. For example Brooklyn 99 is just <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/70281562" target="_blank">https://www.netflix.com/title/70281562</a>, and a specific episode for example is <a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80028076" target="_blank">https://www.netflix.com/watch/80028076</a>. Whatever appears after the '?' is just metadata that Netflix adds to the URL for their own use. </p>
<p>Why would they use a number and not a name? The name might not be unique (for example there are two TV shows named The Office - the UK and the US versions), so it's a lot easier to keep a numerical code. They also don't want users to try guessing the URLs - they much rather have users access the shows through the web interface.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also note that simple URLs are common where search engine optimization is important, like news articles or product listings. Sites like hulu or netflix don't nearly rely as much on external traffic so there is no need to use the simple keywords. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As u/Schnutzel says - Netflix will have a <em>ton</em> of content that shares similar or identical names. It's far easier to use a catalogue numbering system (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number" target="_blank">ISBN</a>) to keep track of individual titles. That way, Brooklyn 99 will always be [70281562], even if a completely different Brooklyn 99 is added to the catalogue at some point in the future.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Any time you're using a database you consider giving a unique identifier to any entry. It's mostly to allow easier management if something changes. It will allow a more standardised value (length and type etc)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They have no need for SEO. That's the only reason a name would be better than a number. So, they use the more precise and better URL. </p>
<p>Why would they use a name? Who would that benefit? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
