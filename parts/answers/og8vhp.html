		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Often, as is the case with F=ma, it's because it's an approximation. Parts that are only really relavent at very high speeds are missing. Other simple equations, like the gas laws or gravitational acceleration, are also approximations, or make a large number of simplifying assumptions that aren't always true.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some relationships are just more complicated than others. Usually when you're dealing with simple rates, and assuming a simple scenario, you get &quot;clean&quot;-looking equations. F = ma. V = IR. d = vt.</p>
<p>It's hard to answer any kind of &quot;why&quot; question in science. You could say that some of these things are basically just definitions - e.g. newtonian/euclidean velocity can be <em>defined</em> as distance over time, so v = d/t by definition, so d = vt is just one step away from that definition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>F=ma is deceptively complicated because we are hiding that it is a second order differential equation in the ‘a’ part.</p>
<p>To the more general question, simple systems often have simple relationships between the parts, this can be reflected in the maths.</p>
<p>We can also use maths notation to sweep complicated stuff under the rug. Vector and Tensor equations are clever ways to compress multidimensional rules into a single equation. Einstein’s field equation is actually 16 different equations when the notation is expanded</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, this video is about chemistry, not physics. But it's Nobel laureates talking about the beauty of chemistry, and at 01:45 they start talking about equations. I use this in my philosophy classes to discuss the intersection of epistemology (knowledge) and aesthetics (beauty). It's less than 8 minutes and completely worth it. </p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/BOm2VXmUv1s" target="_blank">Nobel Laureates Discuss Beauty in Chemistry</a></p>
<p>In case link fails, it is &quot;Chemistry Matters: Beauty&quot; from The Nobel Prize channel.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a simplification. </p>
<p>When I was in college, a concept called a &quot;stiff object&quot; (I swear it doesn't sound as bad in my language) was commonly used. It's an object of perfect physical properties - it's perfectly aerodynamical, it's infinitely stiff and doesn't deform, etc. In other words, it doesn't exist. All real world variables are excluded, only the basic principles are taken into account. </p>
<p>This, obviously, doesn't work in real world, not like that. F is still ma, but there are losses, friction, drag, deformation, etc. However, it's easier to understand if it's simple, and once you understand that, it's easier to build off it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
