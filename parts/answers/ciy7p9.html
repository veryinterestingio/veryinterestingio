		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the other people have missed the critical element here.</p>
<p>The critical element was the shift from disposable to reusable rockets. Now, to their great credit, NASA did make that move in the 70s with the space shuttle, but it was a bit too early, and the whole shuttle project was a bit of a logistical and political shitshow. </p>
<p>By the time SpaceX came along, technology had advanced considerably. Here's a great talk by Raffaello D’Andrea explaining it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4IJXAVXgIo" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4IJXAVXgIo" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4IJXAVXgIo</a></a></p>
<p>In short, between the Space Shuttle and the Falcon 9, feedback control got good enough, and cheap enough, that the idea of landing an otherwise traditional rocket vertically was very feasible. By this point, the Shuttle was seen as a failure - technologically impressive, but economically unviable, and increasingly outdated. So NASAs focus was off of reusability and onto cheap disposability. In that environment, dumping money into R&amp;D is a bit pointless if you have designs from the 60s that are reliable and well understood. They'll only fly once, and the cost of space flight is really in the minimization of failures. So, advances in engines and control systems largely stopped. </p>
<p>SpaceX saw things differently. Believing they could take what looked like a conventional rocket and land and refly it, meant they could change the economic model. Launches were rare because the cost of disposing a rocket each time was high, and because the cadence was low - there was no incentive to build out production lines that could spit out a rocket every two weeks. But if you could reuse the rocket, even just one more time, you'd need half as many of them. Refly it 4 times, and you need to build only 20% as many. So, SpaceX went for a commodity strategy - build one really really good motor to serve first and second stage, rely on modern control electronics to regulate 9 motors operating together in the first stage, and engineer for reusability, and get your reliability that way, and dramatically cut costs to fly the rocket and use that money to pay for the new R&amp;D. Digital feedback control wasn't the only thing that had dramatically advanced since the 70s, so had manufacturing techniques and materials engineering. So SpaceX could build simpler rockets that performed better than was possible in the 70s. </p>
<p>NASA didn't want these rockets, believing in their tried and true approach, but private companies did want them and with time SpaceX won them over. Bezos saw the same opportunities, as did others. Existing companies didn't see the opportunity because their value was in their tried and true methods, their decades of engineering experience at this, their detailed knowledge of how these old system worked, which made them reliable. </p>
<p>This is also a story of why established companies rarely pivot their business model to adapt to changes, and why startups and other new entrants are key to advancing industries. They can take these risks, they can invest in the new technology and not invest in the legacy technology. Had SpaceX failed, we wouldn't even be talking about them - so there's some survivors bias baked in here too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To build a new rocket, lots of design and testing is needed. Problems will be found, so how quickly these are found and fixed decides how quickly a new rocket can be completed.
Because of restrictions due to it being run by the state, Nasa can't adapt anywhere near as quick as spacex; for example, when spacex realised carbon fibre wasn't the way to go for the BFR, they fired all the workers working on carbon fibre designs. This was necessary, but would not be possible in Nasa.</p>
<p>The fact that they have to be acting in the best interests of the country means that designs from Nasa are dictated by created jobs, and less by the actual advantages of the design, leading to many issues that are delaying many programs.</p>
<p>They also have major direction changes with each election, meaning that they work towards one goal for 5 years, then a new leadership tells them they want a different project doing, so they cancel the first one, and end up getting nowhere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>1) They utilized all of the science that NASA learned thus they &quot;had&quot; the same experience level as NASA. </p>
<p>2) NASA has never had a massive budget. Even during the Space Race their budget was relatively small. Companies like Space X's budgets are comparable in size. </p>
<p>3) NASA stopped designing new Rockets for a time when they were operating the shuttle. When they retired the shuttle they started designing new Rockets again and will be constructing them for the upcoming missions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aside from using known published resources from NASA and likely the old Soviet era, technology has changed dramatically since the 60s. </p>
<p>They’re able to run many simulations in a short time period that would have been impossible for NASA back in the day. </p>
<p>There’s likely less politics involved too. </p>
<p>Computer technology I’d guess been the key difference that has allowed them to do things like reusable components. I’d assume material science has had a big change since the 60s too. </p>
<p>In all fairness, NASA built the shuttle which was a pretty damn impressive bit of tech. Not without it’s issues but it was cutting edge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>NASA is heavily regulated, risk avoiding, and making decisions by committee.</p>
<p>SpaceX has been able to build on all of NASA's experience, as well as take advantage of more modern underlying technology. The other big innovator in this field is Elektron, in my opinion.</p>
<p>I think the elephant in the room is nothing to do with NASA, but rather ULA. Why is SpaceX able to build such a better business model than ULA, who has the years of experience and the resources?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
