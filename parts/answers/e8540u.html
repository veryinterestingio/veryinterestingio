		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Goldilocks zone varies for each star system, and is an approximation for the conditions that are necessary to have liquid water on the surface of the planet. Which can be impacted considerably by the conditions on the planet itself. </p>
<p>For your second question, If I remember correctly, Mars is on the outer edge of our solar systems Goldilocks zone. There definitely can be multiple planets in the goldilocks zone and depending on their atmospheric make-up they could certainly have somewhat similar conditions on them</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We donâ€™t know.</p>
<p>We do know that moons have a different Goldilocks Zone than planets. We also know that planetary conditions could impact the Goldilocks zone (e.g. atmosphere thickness, planet mass/size, magnetosphere, etc.).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I did a little quick research to try and figure this out. So far it seems that the answer is quite complicated over longer time scales (tens of millions of years and up), so I couldn't come to a definite answer. We are dealing with a many body problem, so there is no easy analytic solution to predict the long term behavior of the system. It seems what you are asking about falls more into the realm of chaos theory. Astronomers may have better luck answering the question statistically by looking at many star systems, and extrapolating the figures from their data.  </p>
<p>I found something that might be of interest to you. Despite the large distance between Jupiter and Mercury, there is concern about their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stability_of_the_Solar_System" target="_blank">interaction</a>. Their orbit's perihelions precess at almost the same rate. Over long time scales (billions of years) this resonance could alter the orbit of Mercury significantly, or even throw it out of the system. From what I gather, it's not concrete that our own system is fully stable. In trying to answer the question of how many planets could orbit in the Goldilocks zone, I think it's important to consider this. We might come up with a system of planets that seems stable over the course of a few million years, but in the longer time scales it's almost impossible to say if the system would remain stable, unless we had some perfectly symmetric ideal orbits. If we are talking about stability in terms of the time scales necessary to support life, we should be thinking somewhere on the order of a billion years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've read a few answers, and there's one caveat I haven't seen yet: &quot;Goldilock&quot; zone for which universal solvent?</p>
<p>While it's safe to assume H2O, NH3 (Ammonia) is more thermally stable than water in liquid form; and shares many other properties with water that make water-based life so prevalent. As such, low-temperature ammonia-based life is possible - and is hypothesized on some Jovian moons, including Titan.</p>
<p>The Ammonia goldilocks zone is far colder than the water goldilocks zone, but it does exist. And all of the other considerations people have said apply equally.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it is wise to make wise sounding statements about the size of Goldilocks zones, until we have more detail about other star systems. At present, we don't know enough for certain about our own solar systems potential to carry life, and where in the system it may reside, to make firm statements about where in the rest of the galaxy we might find it. </p>
<p>Given the sheer number of different sized stars that are out there, with different levels of stability of output, different strengths of output, its basically impossible to say at this stage, what the maximum breadth a Goldilocks zone could become, especially when we consider just how many binary and trinary star systems there are out there. </p>
<p>We may find, when we get as used to locating life on other worlds, as we were to finding new species in the Amazon, that our understanding of life, how it can form, where it can form, just how powerful the force of life is in the universe, that our entire conceptualisation of where the Goldilocks is and isn't is utterly unfit for purpose. At present, there is no where near enough data to make a worthwhile statement on the matter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
