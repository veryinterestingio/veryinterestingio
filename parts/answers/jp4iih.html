		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some bugs have a hydraulic system in their legs, they push the legs out and they snap back shut, makes moving quicker, but as they get older they lose the effort to push the legs out, so they end up stuck and starving to death, it's why you see lots of dead spiders with their legs all tucked up under their body</p>
<p>A lot of bugs really don't live long, their bodies stop working real quickly, they are born, breed, then within a week their get up and go has got up and gone so they just sit somewhere and wait to starve</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lot of good answers here but a specific example is there are a few species of bugs, im thinking of a few species of mayflys specifically because they’re prevalent where I live, enter their adult stage without mouth parts. They eat what they can as larva and after they become adults they reproduce and die within a few days, sometimes a single day without eating because they literally can’t.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some bugs' lifestyles essentially breakdown into Eat -&gt; Grow -&gt; Mate. They eat until they grow into their larval form, then spend 90% of their energy transforming into their sexually mature form, and then spend their last 10% of energy mating, and laying eggs. After that, they're done. Some mature stages don't even have mouthparts to continue eating and living, so if they don't get eaten by something else, they just slowly die afterwards, and their genes get spread to the next generation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
