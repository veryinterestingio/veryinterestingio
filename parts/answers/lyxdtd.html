		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Renewal of perception. Your brain gets bored with repetitive sounds that happen close together (clicking, buzzing, etc.), and it doesn't connect sounds that happen too far apart (a slow drip). Music speeds/beats fall in a range where the sound happens JUST OFTEN ENOUGH that your brain hears it, knows that the sounds are related, and starts anticipating when they next sound will happen (that's how we know &quot;where&quot; the beat &quot;is&quot;). </p>
<p>Our brains our satisfied when expectations are fulfilled -- when the beats land where we expect them to, and when we expect them to -- and physically embodying when we expect that beat to arrive feels good, especially if we are right.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to visit regularly at a memory care residence, and there was a music therapist who held regular sessions with the residents. She brought special block hand bells -- easy to hold -- and she had the people shake the bells together in rhythm. Because the bells were tuned, it was glorious music. And although many of the residents were pretty far into dementia, they could stlll be in the hand bell choir.</p>
<p>I asked the music teacher about the class.  She said that rhythm -- keeping time, clapping in time -- is among the last mental attributes to decline. These are people with diminished sight, diminished hearing, loss of words, loss of personal history, declining ability to talk sense or comprehend things -- but they still had the beat. They could pat out rhythms together -- and they loved doing it.</p>
<p>I urge young parents to pour music all over their children's lives -- along with words, words, words -- and not in a competitive, &quot;piano lessons&quot; way. Just love music and dance with them. These gifts are innate, ready to be opened and simply enjoyed.</p>
<p>Edit: sorry, I don't know why, have no scientific explanation for the phenomenon. It's what the music therapist told me in casual conversation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s an interesting theory about our love for a good beat (and, consequently, music!).</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of years ago, we were running down our prey and our survival required us to be running machines. The most efficient way to cover long distances is to run at a consistent pace. If you could recognize a beat (or pace, rhythm, consistent tap tap tapping of your feet as you ran), you had a better chance of eating that night and your genes moving on to the next round.</p>
<p>Edit: Your brain evolved to reward you for keeping a beat!</p>
<p>(Note: I love reading about science and technology but I’m not an expert. I’ll try to edit if there’s better info. I got this theory from This Is Your Brain On Music by Daniel Levitin.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
