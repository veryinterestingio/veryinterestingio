		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you hear someone speak vowel sounds in particular, the timbre (resonant characteristics) is determined by the physical dimensions of a person's body, especially their throat, mouth and nose. Your brain learns to decode this to learn about the speaker, just as reverberations provide clues about the room you're in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Same with faces, and lots of other things. Your brain is amazingly capable of distinguishing the smallest differences in nearly everything, but obviously only does so in what it thinks is important to. Recognising voices is clearly quite important, so we do. Recognising the intonation and tone in a word is very important if you’re a primary mandarin speaker, and so they can, a natural English speaker would find it difficult to do the same, as they don’t need to, and can you tell the difference between the moo’s of two different cows? Well you better believe that Barry the cow can tell the difference between Maisy and Suzy’s moo’s!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our ears are very fancy, they are not like single microphone, but rather set of thousands of microphones called <a href="https://iiif.wellcomecollection.org/image/B0000114.jpg/full/880%2C/0/default.jpg" target="_blank">[&quot;hair cells&quot;]</a>, that allow us to distinguish not only a single sound, but also &quot;whole bouquet&quot; of all sound frequencies that fall into our ear.</p>
<p>Someone talking to us might have a major sound that is dominating in their voice, but it will always be a combination of many different sounds and reflections, that's also how even with our eyes closed we can recognize if a person is standing in front of us or behind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of characteristics to a voice.</p>
<ul>
<li>The tone/timbre of the voice</li>
<li>The rhythm/cadence at which someone speaks</li>
<li>Their prosody, ie. how their inflexion changes throughout a sentence (or even a word)</li>
<li>Their accent; particularly how they pronounce certain vowel sounds</li>
<li>and additionally their dialect. What kind of words they use</li>
</ul>
<p>That's a lot of different features for identifying a voice, it's not just a sound.</p>
<p>Example: Look how well Tom Hiddleston impersonates Graham Norton: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzqWPDnYEik" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzqWPDnYEik" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzqWPDnYEik</a></a> He's paying attention to each one of the points I mentioned above (except dialect, he used fairly standard language).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I've always felt like I could identify obesity by someone's voice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
