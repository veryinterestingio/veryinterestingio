		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sleep physiology is pretty complex. Sleep itself is divided into 2 types (NREM and REM) and 4 different stages. NREM, or non-REM is divided into stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3 (formerly 3 and 4). While REM, or rapid eye movement is its own stage with different physiology. When awake, a person has a characteristic brain wave pattern as recorded on EEG. This type of wave is called alpha wave activity. As we lie down to go to sleep we go into stage 1 of sleep, the brain wave activity changes to beta waves. Stage 2 of sleep is reached when the EEG recording detects k-complexes and/or sleep spindles. Stage 3 of sleep is the deepest sleep, characterized by delta waves. Normal physiologic secretion of growth hormone occurs during stage 3 sleep, which is why sleep is actually really important for growth (mom was right!). Following stage 3, a person can enter into a period of REM sleep. REM sleep is probably the strangest phase of sleep, and is the most studied. We know that dreaming occurs during REM, as well as near-complete paralysis of the body. Most sleep-related breathing disorders and behavior disorders occur during REM. Each REM-cycle, from stage 1/2 to 3 to REM, takes about 90 minutes to complete. The duration of REM increases with each REM cycle throughout the night. The best stage to be woken from is stage 1 or 2, while being woken from stage 3 or REM can leave you groggy for up to 30-45 minutes.</p>

<p>To answer your question a bit more precisely, when awake and alpha waves are present, the brain activity signals an active cortext, and the EEG is unsynchronized and rapid. Beta waves indicate a lowered level of alertness, and the waves are slower and synchronized. Theta waves indicate activity in the hippocampus, meaning likely memory formation or storage. Delta waves indicate that neurons are not engaged in processing information and across the brain are firing together, giving large, synchronized waves in the EEG tracing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am often aware of an actual, momentary transition that indicates I am definitely falling into sleep, though I am still conscious. Is that the transition into stage 1 sleep? My body seems to go into super-relaxation mode. 9 times out of 10, I pass out. Sometimes a worrysome thought pops me back into wakefulness and I have to start from the beginning again. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is called the hypnagogic state and as baloo mentioned, it is marked by a brainwave transition. The thing is, the brainwaves are a result of an underlying change in brain chemistry. it is not the causative factor. Sleep is an active process. Most people seem to think sleep is just something that happens when you are bored or tired. </p>
<p>Sleepiness is a result of sleep pressure caused by your circadian rhythms and the build up of adenosine in your brain. Sleep relieves this sleep pressure. </p>
<p>I approach sleep from the point of view of a lucid dreamer. One of the more interesting techniques in lucid dreaming is to try and keep your mind awake while the body falls asleep. You should try it, its very interesting. Focus your mind on watching your thoughts instead of fixating on them. Be a passive but present observer. You will notice your thoughts change from this kinda cohesive set of worries and random thoughts when you first lay down...then they change to colours, points of light sparking in the distance....then these points of lights or colours get more and more in focus and you realise they are images being played out in front of you. It starts of as if you are watching a tv show, then it progresses to you being in the tv show you were watching, then voila, you are in a dream. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Salvador Dali took frequent naps and had himself woken up shortly after &quot;falling asleep&quot; to use these hallucinations as inspiration.
