<p>Have you ever stared outside or at a single dot and just, stare there?</p>
<p>Thinking about nothing actually takes effort, because the brain is designed to think.</p>
<p>At any given point, your brain is constantly sending signals to keep you alive. Every sound and image is being processed by you. </p>

I've definitely realised at times, retrospectively, that I literally didn't have any thoughts for a short period of time.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is possible, itâ€™s just very difficult at first. Some meditation practices (for example, mindfulness meditation) are like this.</p>
