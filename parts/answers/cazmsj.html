		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two things can go wrong with a speaker.</p>
<p>The coil can push the cone too hard and it rips. This happens a lot with older paper speakers.</p>
<p>You can put too much electricity through the coil (a little transformer) and burn it out.</p>
<p>The volume produced is (sort of) the diameter of the cone times the travel in and out. That tells how much air it will move.</p>
<p>Also, some speakers are more efficient than others. If you use a lighter weight Mylar cone, it takes less electrical power to move the cone than a heavy paper one, and you can move more air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From an engineering standpoint, there is a set of inter-related parameters known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiele/Small_parameters" target="_blank">Thiele/Small Parameters</a> that determine the performance of a speaker at low frequencies in a given environment. Basically, it has to do with the size of the cone, how far the cone can travel, material properties of the cone and suspension, etc. That article will tell you more than you ever wanted to know about the subject.</p>
<p>The maximum output (I'm using this term since &quot;volume&quot; also refers to the amount of air the speaker can move) of the speaker is the point at which the voice coil reaches the end of its suspension travel or the cone starts to deform from its resting shape.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Volume is just an amplitude of the signal which is carried by a sound wave. You can imagine the amplitude as a &quot;size&quot; of the sound wave. The more the speaker moves, the more air it pushes, thus producing bigger sound waves that your ears interpret as louder sound.</p>
<p>Or in other words, the capability of the speaker to produce louder noises is defined by how much air it can push which is proportional to its membrane size and strength of the electromagnet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The size and msterials its made of. Speakers have a membrane that translates electrical signals into analog and makes the air move which is what creates the sound you hear. So basicly the more air it moves the louder it can get.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
