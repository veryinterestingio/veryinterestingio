		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are multiple ways in which a website like <a href="https://chess.com" target="_blank">chess.com</a> or <a href="https://lichess.org" target="_blank">lichess.org</a> would check for cheating. It might involve checking what kind of moves you are making and how long it takes you to find them. Finding the best move isn't suspicious. Finding it over and over again in 5 seconds when you're a 500 rated player is. Also, some moves just aren't natural for a human player to find, not even for the best of the best without thorough analysis. Finally, they might also check if you keep switching between browser tabs, or how your cursor moves while playing.</p>
<p>That said: this mostly involves non-professional players. For professional players playing in an online tournament, other techniques are used. This mostly involves the use of one or (usually) more cameras to check what the player is doing during the game. When a player keeps looking in a certain direction inbetween moves, that might indicate the use of a second screen where a chess engine is running. This famously happened earlier this year in a match between GM Wesley So and GM Tigran L. Petrosian. The latter was disqualified for violations of fair play regulation. Needless to say, for a high level chess player, such a controversy is not good for your reputation and can get you banned from professional play for life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They have big datasets of games from a bunch of big chess engines. They break them down into common situations and check your moves against them then assume you matching up with a chess engine sometimes is fine, but if you are matching up nearly 100% of the time you probably are cheating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One interesting point I read was about 'natural' moves rather than optimal moves. For example, if you're a rook and a bishop up against a knight it would be natural to swap off bishop/knight to get to an end game you know you will win. Going through a complex combination which wins more quickly, but relies on no mistakes in calculation, is an indicator of possible misbehaviour!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the moment, the biggest tell tale sign is that the player is taking a relatively constant time between moves, regardless of the board state. Computers have no sense of any moves being more obvious than another so will take just as long analyzing a position whose next move is obvious to a human as one that requires more thinking by a human.</p>
<p>The end result is humans will vary how long they take to think about a move depending on the specific circumstances of the game at the moment, whereas a computer will take just about the same amount of time regardless.</p>
<p>As far as mirror matching, if you have a database of all games played, it's a simple matter to see how closely your moves so far match the moves in your database of games.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
