		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a historical question, as Nowhere_Man_Forever points out. Generally, map makers oriented their maps towards what they thought was important. For example, some early maps were oriented east-west to aid navigation against the rising and setting sun. Later, North American explorers would make east-west oriented maps because those are the primary directions they traveled. </p>
<p>But, people since antiquity have thought that the Earth rotated and knew that pole stars (i.e. the North Star for us today) would maintain an apparent fixed position in the night sky. This imparted special navigational importance to the north-south axis.</p>
<p>Then, when the magnetic compass was invented that solidified the north-south axis as the primary axis for navigation. Since it makes a lot of technical sense to have all your maps use the same orientation, the north-south axis was the only orientation that made sense. </p>
<p>There's not a clear technical reason to use north=top instead of south=top. One theory is that at the time of the explorers there was no comparable pole star in the southern hemisphere like there is Polaris (which is exceptionally bright) in the northern hemisphere. However, that's a pretty weak theory.</p>
<p>It's probably just the case that the Europeans wanted to put Europe at the top of their maps, and their maps would end up having the largest sway over the future events to come. The other great powers in the world at the time didn't do as much exploration and weren't as imperial as the Europeans were, so their maps are the ones that stuck.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Globes have north at the top from that same convention that operates for maps; the convention is arbitrary (many early maps had east at the top, from which I believe is where the notion of 'orienting' a map stems). The choice of north at the top of the page or uppermost on a globe is not necessary in any sense - globes could be upside down or sideways (i.e. the axis horizontal), maps could have any direction to the top.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people are trying to answer why, but <em>how</em> has I think a simpler answer. Talking solely about European maps, the north-up convention seems to have originated with nautical charts in the 13th century, produced by cartographers in Majorca and Italy. These were maps for sailors and featured precise <em>rhumb lines</em>, lines of constant bearing, that a sailor could follow guided by a compass or the pole star. They showed coastlines, but did not map inland topography. The oldest surviving example is the <em>Carta Pisana</em>.</p>
<p>Earlier European maps, known generally as <em>mappa mundi</em>, typically had east at the top. Some were quite detailed like the Hereford Mappa Mundi (probably of a similar age the Carte Pisana), others were more rudimentary.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carta_Pisana" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carta_Pisana</a></p>
<p>Two facts to note that may be related. European use of the magnetic compass started around the 12th century. And due to precession of the equinoxes, our current north star has moved closer to the north celestial pole over the past millennia, and started being used for navigation around the 10th century. These developments made it possible to find north reasonably precisely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Couldn't South have just as easily been chosen to be &quot;up&quot;, and all maps and globes have the South pole on top?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Look at where globes were first made, Germany. Then ask yourself, if you are making a representation of your world, are you going to put yourself on the bottom where you have to basically turn the whole thing upside down to see your country or top where you are clearly visible?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
