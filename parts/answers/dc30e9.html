		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, transistors are the building blocks of logic gates, which are the building blocks of computers.  But they don't really 'calculate' their output: they're too simple for that.</p>
<p>At its most basic, a transistor is a switch that lets electricity flow through it when it receives electricity from a &quot;control&quot; input.  So for example:</p>
<p><code>power</code></p>
<p><code>|</code></p>
<p><code>T ----A</code></p>
<p><code>|</code></p>
<p><code>output</code></p>
<p>The transistor is labeled &quot;T&quot;.  If electricity is put in on input &quot;A&quot;, electricity will flow from the power supply to the output.  If &quot;A&quot; is off, nothing will flow to the output.  So if we hook two transistors up in a chain:</p>
<p><code>power</code></p>
<p><code>|</code></p>
<p><code>T----A</code></p>
<p><code>|</code></p>
<p><code>T----B</code></p>
<p><code>|</code></p>
<p><code>output</code></p>
<p>electricity will only flow all the way to the output if there's electricity coming in on both input A <strong>and</strong> input B.  This is an &quot;AND&quot; gate.</p>
<p>But if we create two parallel paths like two lanes of a highway, and have A and B each control one &quot;lane&quot;, then electricity will flow through if either A <strong>OR</strong> B is on.  This is an OR gate.</p>
<p>(Unfortunately I can't draw this with ascii art on Reddit.)</p>
<p>... and that's the starting point for all of computers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're interested, I highly recommend trying this online game:  <a href="http://nandgame.com/" target="_blank">http://nandgame.com/</a></p>
<p>You start with a nand gate, and combine them for form new gates, and eventually create a basic working CPU (in a digital sandbox).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would highly recommend checking out Ben Eater’s channel on YouTube. He has great videos that explain how computer hardware works, and he does so by building them out on a breadboard, accompanied by diagrams, etc.</p>
<p>For your particular question, his 13 minute video ‘Making Logic Gates From Transistors’ (<a href="https://youtu.be/sTu3LwpF6XI" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/sTu3LwpF6XI</a>) takes you through each logic gate in a simple to follow format, and he builds them out with transistors.</p>
<p>Other videos of his include building a basic 8-bit computer, RAM modules, and even a video card from scratch with explanations. He’s also now selling kits so you can follow along with his builds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's define a transistor as a 3 pin device that uses a signal at one pin to control the current flowing between the other two pins. In digital electronics that control signal would either be 1 or 0. With multiple transistors we can connect the transistors in such a way that only certain combinations of inputs at the control pins will allow current to flow through the load. I recommend looking up CMOS gate circuits to get a better picture of how this works.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
