		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The International Code of Zoological Nomenclature does carefully regulate how to turn a person's name into a valid taxonomic name through latinization; see <a href="https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological-nomenclature/the-code-online/" target="_blank">Chapter 7, Article 31, Section 1</a>.  However, there is technically no official regulation on pronunciation <em>per se</em>.  In my general experience, there does seem to be a tendency to stick to a pronunciation that is approximately consistent with Latin, but this isn't absolute either; I've never heard anyone refer to the fox genus <em>Vulpes</em> as <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/La-cls-vulpes.ogg" target="_blank">[ˈwʊɫ̪.peːs]</a>, for example.  And in general, I don't think anyone cares if you just use a pronunciation that makes the most sense to you based on your native language.  I assume that the respective codes for plants, fungi, bacteria, etc. use similar rules, but am not as familiar with these.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a taxonomist, I was taught to just say it confidently, it’s just convention not a rule. Also taught to pronounce both -i and -ae as “ee”. </p>
<p>Some older names were apparently purposefully constructed to favor correct pronunciation. One example is agassii instead of agassizi, the silent Z being dropped. (Correctly formed according to ICZN, since the name is considered to have been latinized from Agassiz to Agassius before creation of the patronym.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In botanical Latin, commemorative species epithets can be pronounced  with accents as in the Latin accent rules, as in the language of the name of the commemorated, or the language of the speaker. </p>

<p>Dr. Gravey's advice is sound: whichever you do, do it with confidence. </p>

<p>I learned a lot of species names from a confident Texan, so I have some unusual pronunciations engrained in my memory.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
