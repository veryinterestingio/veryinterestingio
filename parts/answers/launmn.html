		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had my Lenovo laptop plugged in all the time for almost 9 years, used many hours each day. I did maybe 30 or 40 drain cycles according to the battery manager, which means that I did less than 100h on battery over all these years. The manager always kept it charged to 80% max capacity. After about 7 years I did a battery reset and the battery manager showed that it still had 95% capacity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of confusing replies here, mostly because there really is seemingly conflicting info that some people are only presenting one side of.</p>
<p>Yes, keeping it at 100% all the time is worse for battery life than keeping it at 30-70% all the time.  HOWEVER, keeping it at 100% all the time is <em>significantly</em> better than constantly cycling it between 30-70%.  In other words, cycling it is much worse than floating at 100%, which is in-turn worse than floating at 70%.  Basically in order of best to worst the order is:</p>
<p>1) charge it up to 70% and then shut it off and put it in the closet so it can stay there forever.</p>
<p>#1 isnâ€™t realistic unless you never use your laptop, so that brings us to:</p>
<p>2) keep it plugged in and limited to 70% all the time through a BIOS setting.</p>
<p>3) keep it plugged in at 100% all the time.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>87) plug/unplug it 10 times a day to keep the charge between 30-70% as you use it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To maximize your laptop battery lifespan, avoid topping it off and fully draining it. Between 40% and 80% is optimal; this is true for all lithium batteries. Check your laptop BIOS settings for an option to limit maximum charge level (I set my Zbook to 80% and just keep it plugged in).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
