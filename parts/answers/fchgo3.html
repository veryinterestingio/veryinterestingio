		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Does increasing the demand on a generator increase the force needed to rotate it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. The alternator converts rotational mechanical energy into electrical energy. Increase the electrical load and you, mostly linearly, increase the mechanical load the alternator has on the the motor.</p>
<p>Essentially you have a spinning magnet inside a bunch of coils. If there is no current flowing in the coils, i.e. no load, surrounding the spinning magnet, then there is no magnetic field produced by the coils. This allows the rotor magnet to spin freely and offers very little mechanical load to the engine.</p>
<p>When there is current flowing through the coils around the rotor, i.e. a load is connected, then the load current creates a magnetic field that opposes the motion of the spinning magnet. This makes it harder to spin the magnet. This is seen as a mechanical load on the engine. </p>
<p>That's the basic concept. Some details that missing are that the rotor is usually not a permanent magnet, the field winding is usually three phase, the rotor induces the load current that opposes its motion, the rotor and field windings create the rotor and field current...etc.</p>
<p>In diesel locomotives the alternator is often capable of stalling the engine, ~4 <em>thousand</em> HP.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rear-window defrosters are based on thin foil resistance elements glued to the inside of the window.  Yes, they will use a substantial amount of electrical energy to run them.  This electrical energy is produced by the alternator, which is driven by the gasoline engine.  One horsepower is about 730 watts, as I recall.  If the current is 20 amps (wild-ass-guess), then the power needed is 13.8 volts times 20 amps, or 276 watts:  About 1/3 of a horsepower.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We had a science museum years ago that demonstrated this very well. It was a machine with a handcrank, and when you spun the handcrank, you were actually turning an alternator, and it was quite easy to turn.</p>
<p>On the top of the device were a series of lightbulbs and light switches. As you rotated the crank, switching on each lightbulb one at a time made the crank exponentially harder to turn.</p>
<p>It was a great illustration on how electricity usage requires greater and greater energy sources.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others already explained, the more electricity you use, the more force you need to rotate the alternator.
Engine RPM drops because of sudden increased load and engine controller needs some short time to react by increasing fuel flow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know your question has been answered, but here's a real world example. I was about 10 feet up on a ladder working on a small wind turbine generator, and the wind whipped up before I could get either of the bracket bolts in. As I was calculating if I could throw this death chopper far enough for me to escape decapitation, I thought to ground the leads. The blades stopped dead. I always do this now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
