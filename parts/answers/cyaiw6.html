		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You get energy when moving heat from a hotter place to a colder place. Power plants use fire or nuclear reactions for the hot place and water and sometimes cooling towers for the cold place. To get energy cooling a hot room you would need a colder place where you could move that heat. The only possibilities I can think of in summer is underground or some cold water.</p>
<p>Also, it is much easier to get energy when there is a large temperature difference. The difference between a fire and water in a river is large, and a power plant can use that. Compared to that the difference between a hot room and some cold water is tiny, and it would be hard to get energy from that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There has to be a temperature differential to collect usable energy. Since naturally the heat wants to be spread equally you can collect energy in facilitating that spread. If it's already spread equally then it takes energy to make the difference greater.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>2nd Law of Thermodynamics</p>
<p>Extracting energy from heat differences (through a heat engine) is never 100% efficient. See any explanation of the carnot efficiency.</p>
<p>Energy itself is not useful, the entropy of the environment determines how useful it is. There is a teemendous of low level heat energy in the ocean, but we cannot use any of it because it is just too spread out and trying to collect it would use more energy than what is available.</p>
<p>The same applies to what you've said.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone else’s responses are accurate regarding why you can’t generate electricity from it, but there are actually Energy Recovery Devices in some Commercial HVAC applications. For example, a heat wheel, a heat pipe, or a plate to plate to heat exchanger. These devices function by taking energy from the Return/Exhaust air stream and transferring it to the outside air. </p>
<p>Source: I work for a company that builds commercial HVAC Air Handlers that install all 3 of these devices. </p>
