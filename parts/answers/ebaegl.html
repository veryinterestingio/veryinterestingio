		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Science and reporting have an interesting relationship with lawbreaking and the law. Generally, scientists and filmmakers have to promise to keep secret the information of criminals that they record. In return, the criminals allow them to study and observe their practice. Meanwhile, law enforcement recognizes the fact that if they crack down on these criminals now, then they will refuse to cooperate with scientists and journalists in the future, which means police have less information to go off of. There was a high-profile case where this trust was violated and scientists were forced to surrender data on terrorists who had participated in a research study to the U.S. government. It is theorized that this event has seriously hindered our research of terrorism ever since.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Because the prosecutors allow it.&quot;</p>
<p>ELI35:</p>
<p>Here's a great example: </p>
<p>David Gregory, an NBC host, was having a segment on his show after the Sandy Hook shooting. During the show, on national TV, broadcast from Washington D.C., he <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/thefold/david-gregorys-high-capacity-magazine/2012/12/26/5b590a72-4faf-11e2-8b49-64675006147f_video.html" target="_blank">held up a 30-round magazine</a> that a staffer had bought earlier that day. </p>
<p>Now, that's specifically illegal, as referenced by the Attorney General of DC's office:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is unlawful under D.C. Code Section 7-2506.01(b) for any person while in the District of Columbia to “possess, sell, or transfer any large capacity ammunition feeding device regardless of whether the device is attached to a firearm” or loaded.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, when it came time to actually charge him with possession of a highly illegal and regulated device:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>OAG has determined to exercise its prosecutorial discretion to decline to bring criminal charges against Mr. Gregory, who has no criminal record, or any other NBC employee based on the events associated with the December 23, 2012 broadcast. OAG has made this determination, despite the clarity of the violation of this important law, because under all of the circumstances here a prosecution would not promote public safety in the District of Columbia nor serve the best interests of the people of the District to whom this office owes its trust.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that's what it is. Even though he's committed a clearly illegal fact, on tape, with zero defense, he's not charged with a crime due to prosecutorial discretion. </p>
<p>Which, honestly, is usually a good thing. There are plenty of reasons <em>not</em> to charge someone with a crime. Law is black and white, but lots of crimes are more of a gray area. </p>
<p>And, in this example, it's probably a <em>good</em> thing that a reporter didn't get sent to jail or prison for this incident. It does nobody any good.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Admitting something to a reporter is rarely, by itself, suitable grounds for prosecution.  All your lawyer has to say is &quot;he was lying because he wanted to be on TV&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
