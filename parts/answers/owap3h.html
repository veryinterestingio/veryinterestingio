		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, though the linkage between rainfall and river temperature is less clear (<strong>EDIT:</strong> Though as added below, there may be some validity to this for small mountain streams specifically). At a general level, there is lots of work suggesting that at a simple level, river water temperature is directly and strongly correlated to air temperature in the vicinity of the river. Here is an example of this from <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hyp.1280" target="_blank">Webb et al., 2013</a> looking at some streams the UK. What they find (relatively similar to prior work) is that air temperature and river water temperature are linearly correlated on a weekly and monthly basis (though this does start to break down if you average over too long a basis, e.g., annual, e.g. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/%28SICI%291099-1085%28199702%2911:2&lt;137::AID-HYP405 target="_blank">3.0.CO;2-2">Webb &amp; Nobilis, 1999</a>) and that on finer (i.e., hourly) timescales the temperature correlation is a little more complicated and noisy but still quasi-linear. </p>
<p>Because predicting temperature in river waters is important from an ecological standpoint, there is a lot of interest in this from the community, so there are larger studies attempting to examine the controls on and develop methods of predicting river water temperature. An example of this would be <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169414003990" target="_blank">DeWeber &amp; Wagner, 2014</a> who train a neural network to try to predict water temperature from areas without direct measurements. Studies like these are interesting in that seeing which training datasets were useful in developing more accurate predictions can also give us a sense of which variables are important. In this case, air temperature again is paramount, but with some complication, i.e., both current and past average air temperature were important highlighting that there is a lag in river temperature reflecting air temperature (which also explains why the hourly average temperature comparisons from the UK study were substantially more noisy). The DeWeber &amp; Wagner result also highlight that there are other controls, like the type of landcover, but these are usually secondary.</p>
<p>Now, with specific reference to the role of precipitation and rainfall influencing river water temperature, I couldn't find as much. There are studies suggesting that in urban environments, precipitation that falls on impermeable surfaces (which often are at a different temperature than the air) can become &quot;thermally polluted&quot; and influence river temperature when this runoff reaches a river (e.g., <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hyp.13317" target="_blank">Croghan et al., 2018</a>), but such an effect would not be present in a natural environment. As discussed in many of the references above, discharge (i.e., the volume of water flowing through a point in the river at a given time) is a pretty weak control on temperature, so while you would certainly expect discharge to potentially change during and after rainfall, <del>but likely would not play a major role (at least based on the references I'm finding, maybe someone will have some additional sources that provide a more clear link between rain events and river temperature).</del> <strong>EDIT:</strong> There is some data to suggest that during storm events, rainfall and discharge can modify the temperature of mountain streams, specifically cooling them temporarilly (e.g., <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/hydr/8/4/jhm597_1.xml" target="_blank">Brown &amp; Hannah, 2007</a>). This may be because of the nature of small, mountain streams (i.e., fast hydrologic response to storm events because of small catchment areas and steep topography). I have also edited my summary statement below.</p>
<p>Finally, and of particular relevance for mountain streams (depending on the exact details) is that the degree of sensitivity and relationship between air temperature and river water temperature is modulated by the relative importance of snowmelt in the hydrology of the system (e.g., <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2015GL064083" target="_blank">Lisi et al., 2015</a>). Basically, if the stream in question is fed by a lot of (very cold) water from snowmelt, it may be less sensitive to short term changes in air temperature. As discussed in Lisi et al., this is the most pronounced when snowmelt is at its peak, so typically early summer but the timing of this is dependent on the system in question.</p>
<p><strong>In short,</strong> river temperature is sensitive and usually closely related to ambient air temperature, so nominally the expectation that a stream would be warmer on warmer days and cooler on cooler days is reasonable (though important to clarify that this does not imply a 1:1 to relationship, just a linear one). <del>The extent to which this is related to whether there has been rain recently is less clear in natural environments.</del> <strong>EDIT:</strong> Specific to mountain streams (or urban streams) precipitation events do seem to be able to modify river water temperature and in mountain streams, storm events may reduce the temperature of the river water because of the fast hydrologic response of these streams to water inputs. While the air - river water temperature correlation is pretty robust across a range of environments, there are details that can change this like the types of vegetation, topography, and probably most importantly the amount of snowmelt driving discharge in the stream and the time of year in question. These can control both the degree/nature of the relationship (i.e., is there a strong relationship? is this relationship linear? etc) and/or the details of the relationship (i.e., the slope and intercept of the linear relationship).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of it depends on the size of the body of water. We do annual aquatic ecology learning labs for my course and we track water and atmospheric temperature over time. In short, water changes temperature very slowly while the ground changes temperature very quickly. Small bodies of water will tend to match the temperature of the ground while large bodies of water really don't change temperature quickly.</p>
<p>The temperature of smaller streams (or streams with many small inlets and relatively high flow rates) correlate really with air temperature, which tends to correlate with sunlight, though canopy cover also plays a big a role here and I think most of our probes do receive direct sunlight.</p>
<p>However, for bigger bodies of water like lakes and rivers, their temperature responds more to seasonal changes. They need constant, seasonal input (or loss) of heat to see changes in temperature. That's why diving tends to be warmest in the fall/early winter (after the summer heat wears off) and coldest in the spring/early summer (when the heat is only just picking up).</p>
<p>As for your friend's anecdote, I caution that &quot;it feels colder to dive in a stream on a sunny day after the rain&quot; may have less to do with the actual water temperature and more to do with the combination of sunlight and post-precipitation low humidity. Sunlight will heat the water on your skin, causing it to evaporate which will cool your skin (this is also how sweating works) and a low humidity will facilitate that process (since the air can only hold so much moisture). Both of these factors probably work together to make it feel colder than it really is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey!  Avid trout fisherman, and I can give you some insight.  Trout don't like water above 70F.  River temperature can be pretty easily predicted by the daytime high, and the nighttime low averaged together.  It will generally get as &quot;high&quot; as the average.</p>
<p>Here's a river <a href="https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/uv?01396500" target="_blank">gauge</a> from NJ.  Notice the river temp on the right?  On Aug 1st it got as high as 65F.  Local data near the area shows the high of 79 and low of 57 for an average of... 68 <a href="https://www.njweather.org/data/daily/3532" target="_blank">(Hacketstown</a> is a little away, but the closest I could find was this one)</p>
<p>Now look at 7/28 and you'll see the high water temp was 73 or 74, and if you average the high and low for that day you get... 73.5</p>
<p>So you have a good predictive measure of what the water temp will be just by using the predicted high and low.  It's how we trout fisherman decide whether to give the fish a break or not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A bit late to this, but I used to breed a few varieties of tropical fish that primarily lived in and around mountainous regions. You could induce spawning behavior by rapidly decreasing the water temperature upwards of 15 degrees F, and doing a few other things to adjust the water quality. This emulated the changes in their natural habitat due to seasonal rains and snowmelt and the subsequent flooding that occurred.</p>
<p>So yes, weather can have a large impact on the water conditions in a stream. The impact is lessened the further you get from the source though. Water has a high specific heat capacity, but it will approach the average of whatever the ambient conditions are around a river given sufficient time. Flow rates also factor into that.</p>
<p>For the example above with the fish, the temperature of their streams actually dropped for a brief period of time as the summer got warmer due to snow melts rapidly flushing everything downstream. As the last of the ice melted off, the flow would decrease and the temperatures would rebound back up to around ambient. I simulated that by doing large water changes with cold water and shutting the heater off for a few days.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
