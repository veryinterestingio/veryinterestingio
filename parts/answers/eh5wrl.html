		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Germanium is opaque to visible light but transparent in the mid-IR range. It's often used in IR optics.</p>
<p>See for example this commercial supplier of germanium lenses: <a href="http://www.tydexoptics.com/materials1/for_transmission_optics/germanium/" target="_blank">http://www.tydexoptics.com/materials1/for_transmission_optics/germanium/</a></p>
<p>In general, in order to absorb light there has to be an electronic (or vibrational, for IR) excitation with an energy corresponding to the energy of the frequency absorbed. Elemental germanium has a band gap of 0.67 eV, meaning photons with less than this energy cannot be absorbed by electronic excitations. This corresponds to a wavelength of longer than 1.8 Âµm, which is in the mid IR. Shorter wavelength photons are absorbed, making germanium opaque to visible light. Germanium crystals also don't have vibrational modes that strongly absorb IR.</p>
<p>Some other semiconductors (for example, cadmium telluride or silicon) also block visible light but not IR. The principle is the same as what I explained above for germanium.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes! Germanium is commonly used for lenses on infrared cameras and is opaque to the visible spectrum but transparent in infrared.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the wavelengths. As others mentioned, Germanium is used for IR optics frequently. </p>
<p>For Near IR, even plastics can be used with colourants. Any time you see the black windows on the end of a remote control that is what they are using.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Coca cola.</p>
<p>It's almost black because it absorbs most visible light, but infra red gets through easily.</p>
<p>Your phone camera can probably see infra red, so try shining your TV remote through a glass of Coke, and watch on the other side with your phone camera.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure a simple bin bag does a pretty good job of this. A week or two ago our physics teacher got a new IR camera and showed us that it went straight through a bin bag, but is blocked by glass. Unsurprisingly, this is how many criminals are caught as many police helicopters will have IR cameras on board.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
