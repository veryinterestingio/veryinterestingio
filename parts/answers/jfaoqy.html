		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can you constrast your work to the commercial proprietary work done by Changing World Technologies? (In 2000ish timeframe they set up a thermal depolymerization of turkey offal, producing Diesel oil and mineral waste)</p>
<p>The business was not very successful, especially in the face of dropping demand and lowered production cost of fossil fuel. They suffered from smell complaints related to the source material and the externalities of the TDP process.</p>
<p>I am interested to know how your strategy differs, and why it would be more successful. Thanks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
