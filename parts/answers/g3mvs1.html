Five minutes doing something unpleasant feels a lot longer than five minutes doing something you love, because you are keenly aware of the time passing when you're waiting for it to reach a certain point. </p>
<p>When you're asleep you aren't counting the time, and therefore it doesn't have the slow down effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Howdy, Cognitive Psychologist here.  </p>
<p>Your question is deeper than you realize, as even scientists DO NOT KNOW. A few of the top answers here are correct, inside your brain there is a mechanism that tracks time. However if we are no actively paying attention to it, we do not notice it. Similar to how you can have a cut or something and not pay attention to it and the pain fades.   </p>
<p>There are two types of time that are important to distinguish.   </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Reckoning of Time. This is human made concept, we use clocks or any other repeated cycle to track intervals that pass between events. Our body has a biological mechanism for this, which is essentially a pool of chemicals in your brain. This pool is shifting between different states, and each state change takes about an hour. Our brain references this region to tell how  much time has passed.   </p>
</li>
<li>Time Itself. Time itself exists outside of human experience, its definition is vague but can be simply stated as &quot;the rate of change&quot;. This exists at a cosmic level, created during the big bang along with space and matter (thats why its called space-time!)</li>
</ol>
<p>When we sleep, the mechanism we use to manually track time second to second (actually its accurate to about the millisecond) is not enaged, and therefor time goes by VERY FAST or VERY SLOW (depending on the dream)  </p>
<p>This brings us to another factor: REM Sleep. This is when your body actually does some crazy stuff, like dream. Dreaming essentially works by activating the sensory parts of your brain and replicating a stimulus it may receive in real life. When you are dreaming, this internal time reckoning mechanism is engaged but its reference point is  something totally illogical, so time in dreams is often askew.   </p>
<p>TLDR: Clocks made by humans, SpaceTime made by big bang, Human brain too tiny to comprehend the space time continuum</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's like how the time since the beginning of the universe was nothing to you. You weren't there to realize it was happening. Similar thing with sleeping. You're alive but not entirely there to realize the time is passing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
