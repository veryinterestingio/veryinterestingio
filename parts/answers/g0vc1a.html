		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What you are asking about sounds like a case of Hyperhidrosis, which is excessive sweating, usually in the hands and feet.  Whether you are hot or cold, Hyperhidrosis will cause you to sweat.  It can also make you sweat excessively in other areas of the body including those places that you normally sweat from.
The feet will sweat no matter what, cold or hot if you have hyperhidrosis.  You may be noticing it more when they are cold because the sweat will make them colder.  </p>
<p>If you experience anxiety; this can cause the feet to sweat if they are cold. </p>
<p>If the feet are hot, they will sweat which could make your feet cold. That is what sweat is supposed to do.  </p>
<p>Here is an article on Hyperhidrosis, which is where your body sweats more than normal, including the hands and feet.
I have this and it’s annoying. I believe the problem you are experiencing is from hyperhidrosis.</p>

<p>Drysol and anti anxiety medicine do help.  I’ve used both at different times.  If you have insurance, talk to your primary doctor, if they don’t feel comfortable prescribing then next best thing is to go to a dermatologist.  They will be able to come up with a treatment plan that can work for you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
