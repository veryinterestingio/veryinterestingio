		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because when the air pressure drops, the partial pressure of oxygen in the air drops lower than the partial pressure of oxygen in your blood - and as your lungs aren't strong enough to hold pressure in, the pressure in your lungs drops to be about the same as the outside.</p>
<p>So the oxygen diffuses out of your blood and into the air. At the same time, the carbon dioxide does, too - which means that the acidity sensors that tell you that you need to breath don't trigger, so you don't realise that you need to breathe.</p>
<p>By breathing air enriched in oxygen, the partial pressure increases, allowing oxygen to diffuse into your blood as it should.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you held your breath immediately after the depressurization finished, as others here have answered, no, it wouldn't help.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If you managed to take a deep breath and hold it BEFORE the plane depressurized, or as it started to, you risk air embolism and/or lung overexpansion injury.  Something generally only scuba divers need to worry about, but the same could happen if you tried to hold in a breath as a plane depressurized.  You really don't want any significant differential between the inside of your lungs and the outside air pressure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR: Yes, you will still pass out quickly during rapid depressurization without oxygen and holding your breath does not help.</p>
<p>There are a couple of things that you have to understand in order to answer this question. First, there is not less O2 at hight altitudes as long as you are still in the troposphere/tropopause (layer of atmosphere closest to earth, and where all passenger planes fly, up to about 65,000 feet).</p>
<p>Link for source info: <a href="https://scied.ucar.edu/shortcontent/troposphere-overview" target="_blank"><a href="https://scied.ucar.edu/shortcontent/troposphere-overview" target="_blank">https://scied.ucar.edu/shortcontent/troposphere-overview</a></a></p>
<p>There is however less air pressure at high altitudes which affects how well your body can use the O2. Air has weight and when your body is close to the earth, say within 10,000 feet of sea level or so (depends on the person), the weight of all the air above you allows the permeable membranes in your lungs to absorb the O2 as long as there is O2 in air in your lungs. This means that at high altitudes, that lack of air pressure will not push the air you breath into the permeable membranes in your lungs and thus your lungs will not be able to harvest the O2 through the normal gas exchange process. The higher you go, the greater impact this has. To help you understand how this looks, see the link that shows time of useful consciousness based on altitude. As a side note, air pressure generally decreases by 1 inch of Hg per 1000 feet of altitude gained.</p>
<p>Time of useful conscious: <a href="https://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/Time_of_Useful_Consciousness" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/Time\_of\_Useful\_Consciousness" target="_blank">https://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/Time\_of\_Useful\_Consciousness</a></a></p>
<p>Link for how lungs work: <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/human-respiratory-system/The-respiratory-pump-and-its-performance" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/human-respiratory-system/The-respiratory-pump-and-its-performance" target="_blank">https://www.britannica.com/science/human-respiratory-system/The-respiratory-pump-and-its-performance</a></a></p>
<p>Putting on an oxygen mask can help with this because, having more O2 in the air you breath, even with a limited pressure, allows more O2 particles to pass over the harvesting cells in your lungs. Concentrating the oxygen through the use of a mask means that even-though the amount of molecules penetrating your lung membranes are fewer (not air volume but molecule density), more of those molecules are oxygen which keeps you conscious until the plane can descent to a low enough altitude for normal breathing to happen. This method works well until 20-30k feet above sea level, then the lack of pressure is so great, that even having more O2 will not keep you conscious. Pilots will descend very quickly if they know the plane has depressurized for this exact reason. It is also worth nothing that there are certain types of O2 masks that artificially create air pressure for the user which can be effective at much higher altitudes and pilots have these masks in the flight deck on passenger jets.</p>
<p>So, no holding your breath does not help or matter because the air you breath in or hold in will not be under enough pressure at high altitudes to deliver adequate oxygen to your lungs to keep you conscious for long.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You lose consciousness when there isn't enough oxygen getting to your brain. Oxygen is carried by your blood. I won't pretend to know much about how oxygen dissolves in blood or what's going on biologically. Hell I don't even know how it's stored in blood - if it's just dissolved, or if it's in a biological complex. But no matter what it can be modeled using mass transfer of gas into liquid because at some point that gas has to make its way into the liquid.</p>
<p>Gasses dissolve into liquids based on only a few factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The solubility of that particular gas into that particular liquid (this is affected by temperature)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The partial pressure of the gas (More pressure, and it forces more gas into the liquid)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The vapour pressure of the gas from the liquid (i.e. how much the gas that's in the liquid wants to be out of the liquid, higher vapour pressure and more gas will vaporize into the gas phase.)</p>
</li>
<li>The surface area of the liquid-gas interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>Essentially, if the pressure of the gas is higher than the vapour pressure of the gas-water solution, then more gas dissolves into the liquid until those pressures are equal and we're at a state of equilibrium. </p>
<p>Optional Analogy:</p>
<p>We can picture this with CO2 dissolved in soda. CO2 has a solubility in water. Higher temperatures reduce the solubility and cold temperatures increase it. That's why when you have a warm glass of soda, it gets &quot;flat&quot; very quickly compared to a cold glass that lasts longer.</p>
<p>This is also why carbonated drinks are under pressure. Quickly after bottling soda/beer, the cap is sealed and the gas tries to vaporize out of the liquid. This happens a little, but since there's nowhere for it to go it just fills the top of the bottle until the partial pressure of CO2 in the top is equal to the vapour pressure of the dissolved CO2 in the soda. </p>
<p>Once you crack open the top to drink it, you're releasing that pressure and now the vapour pressure is higher than the partial pressure, so the gas starts to vaporize.</p>
<p>Surface area comes into effect because this transition between gas to liquid is easier if there's surface area to start with. If you shake up a soda can before opening it it, the are in the top of the can is spread throughout the liquid and some get stuck as bubbles that cling to the wall. These bubbles have surface area, and the more you start with the faster the CO2 can vaporize. It's also why when a bottle of soda starts to foam up it takes a second for it to get going. As more bubbles are created, you get more surface area.</p>
<p>Hopefully that helps visualize how gasses dissolve in liquids.</p>
<p>Your lungs and heart work together to continuously get oxygen into your blood. Your lungs pull in fresh air with lots of oxygen and want to dissolve oxygen into the blood. Your heart is continuous pumping more blood, so your lungs want to get their job done quickly and efficiently. To do this, your lungs have a <em>massive</em> surface area - roughly the size of one side of a tennis court. Lungs can't do much to change the pressure of the air to force more oxygen to dissolve, and they have to work with whatever the vapor pressure of oxygen is when it's dissolved in blood.</p>
<p>Oxygen comes into your lungs at about 20%, and that's enough pressure to overcome the vapour pressure and get oxygen into the blood.
Since your lungs can't &quot;squeeze&quot; the air much for you, it's easiest for them to just get more air when the oxygen content gets low. We typically exhale about 15% oxygen. That means our lungs are ready to move on when the partial pressure has only dropped by 1/4. </p>
<p>If that's what we've adapted to, then I'd guess that there's some wiggly room in the oxygen content required to get dissolution. I'd bet that if you held your breathe, the oxygen content might drop to 10% before you really want to breathe again. That would be a partial pressure of 0.1 atmO2 </p>
<p>Another worthwhile mention is that it's a gradual change. Your body is surprisingly good at adapting to gradual changes. While we're not aquatic, holding our breath underwater is an evolutionary benefit. Your body can slow non-essential functions to conserve oxygen, and it can do it in stages. This change happened over a minute or two. 5 seconds after your breath, the concentration might still be 17%, and not low enough to cause you to pass out.</p>
<p>Free divers practice and train to hold their breathe for very long periods of time. Part of this training is understanding the stages of oxygen deprivation and how to react and cooperate with them. They're definitely not kicking and flailing as they swim for example (waste of oxygen). By not panicking either, they're conserving even more oxygen. Clearly it's capable for our bodies to adapt to slow changes.</p>
<p>So what happens when a plane rapidly depressurizes? Well when a plane depressurizes, all of the air that's in the plane rushes out of the plane within seconds. You've got maybe 1 more breath of reasonable pressure air before you now have to deal with extremely low pressure air, and it's not easy to take that breath while air is being ripped out of your lungs.</p>
<p>At a typical cruising altitude, the pressure is about 0.2 atm. With only 20% oxygen, that means the partial pressure of oxygen is only 0.04 atm. Remember how at 10% you were feeling panicky underwater? You're at less than half of that now and it happened in a span of about 3-4 seconds.</p>
<p>With that little amount of oxygen, the rate of mass transfer of oxygen from the air to your blood is very low. Heck, the partial pressure might be so low that oxygen is evaporating <em>out</em> of your blood, but that's speculation on my part.</p>
<p>Your body just went from having a steady source to none at all, and your body is delicate to abrupt change
Your brain suddenly has no source of oxygen, and it hasn't gone through any of the stages towards conservation yet so it runs out quickly and just shuts down.</p>
<p>That's why it's so important to put your mask on first and help others second. Temporary unconsciousness is not a death sentence. If you get your mask on, you're then <em>capable</em> of helping others get their's on soon enough to prevent lasting damage. If you try to get your kid's mask first and you fumble in the panic, miss their face, then get woozy and pass out you just put both of your lives at risk. Your kid is probably buckled in and maybe can't reach the mask, or maybe you fell on them or ripped it out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you breathe out, your lungs don't fully empty, otherwise they wouldn't easily open again, and this residual amount acts like a buffer for your oxygen supply, it's actually Brownian movement that ensures your lungs get O2 evenly distributed.  </p>
<p>You inspire air through a pressure mechanism, your diaphragm lowers the pressure in your chest cavity and this causes the surrounding atmosphere to push air into your lungs.  </p>
<p>If the surrounding air pressure suddenly drops, the air in your lungs is going to try to push to leave your lungs, and will start to hurt your throat, ears, eyes and plural cavity, but because of how fast the depressurisation happens, holding your breath could result in your lung tissue becoming ruptured.<br />
Once you open your mouth to equalise the pressure in your lungs, you are losing your buffer supply of air and in two heartbeats so does your heart, because it has an immediate supply of oxygen from the lungs, it also becomes hypoxic.  </p>
<p>Your heart rapidly weakens and you fall unconscious in a matter of seconds if you don't get compensatory oxygen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
