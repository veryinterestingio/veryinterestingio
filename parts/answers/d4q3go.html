		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In non-relativistic scattering theory, you just consider an incident plane wave, and an outgoing spherical wave, which has been modified by the interaction potential.</p>
<p>If you assume the incoming particle is moving in the z-direction, you can write the total wavefunction as:</p>
<p>ψ(<strong>r</strong>) = e^(ikz) + ψ<em><em>s</em></em>(<strong>r</strong>),</p>
<p>where e^(ikz) is the incoming particle, and ψ<em><em>s</em></em> is the scattered wave.</p>
<p>The scattered wave can then be written as:</p>
<p>ψ<em><em>s</em></em>(<strong>r</strong>) = f(θ,φ)e^(ikr)/r.</p>
<p>This has the form of an outgoing spherical wave which has been modulated by an angle-dependent factor f. f is called the scattering amplitude, and |f|^(2) ends up being the differential cross section.</p>
<p>To find what this function actually looks like, you just solve the time-independent Schrodinger equation for whatever potential is mediating the scattering.</p>
<p>To treat something like Compton scattering, you don't really want to use non-relativistic QM, but rather QFT. In QFT, you don't generally work with wavefunctions anymore, but you can still calculate S-matrix elements and cross sections. A common way to do this is using time-dependent perturbation theory, and Feynman diagrams.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is a bit difficult to talk about wave-functions in the setting of an incident photon scattering at a free electron, I'd also recommend a QFT approach. For a quantum field theoretical take on Compton (and Thomson) scattering I highly suggest you read the  corresponding section in Peskin and Schroeder (around page 160 if memory serves). This way you will better understand what is going on.</p>
<p>To get a bit into specifics, you usually want to calculate the differential cross section because that's something you can actually measure:</p>
<ol>
<li>You calculate the kinematics of the scattering process, *usually* you assume an electron at rest, an unpolarized light source and find the energy w_2 of the scattered photon through energy and momentum conservation.</li>
<li>You then solve the phase space integral dPi and calculate the matrix element |M|\^2</li>
<li>You throw everything together and get the differential cross section d sigma = 1/ [4sqrt( (p*k)\^2 - (m_1 m_2)\^2 )] |M|\^2 dPi</li>
</ol>
<p>It works like this for all particle proccesses. After integration and dividing by the total cross section, you now essentially have an equation which tells you the probability of a photon to scatter into a solid angle (which is defined by your integration limits). This is a measurable quantity and thus experimentally accessible.</p>
<p>This derivation of the so called Klein-Nishina cross section is done in detail in virtually any modern text book on QFT. To calculate the Klein-Nishina cross section you have to assume that the electron is initially at rest. However, this comes without loss of generality as you can always use Lorentz transformations to enter a suitable laboratory system. Things start to become a bit crazy for inverse Compton Scattering where the energy transfer is from electron to photon instead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The book to are looking for is Angular Momentum by Richard Zare. It handles exactly this. </p>
<p>Essentially, you conserve angular momentum to get the out going wave. So you take your incoming plane wave and express it as a super position of states with definite angular momentum. (Use sphereical harmonics). The phases and coefficients get modified by the interaction, you will then get a set of sphereical harmonics going out. That set is your out going wave. </p>
<p>Side note: If there is no change in angular momentum internally, only the phases can shift relative to each other. The coefficients are fixed. </p>
<p>Side note 2: in a really cold collisions, states with large angular momentum often never get closer enough to the item you are scattering off of too feel it's effects. So you can make an approximation by neglecting them. You can then use a finite small number of low angular momentum wave functions as the incoming wave. For example just l = 0 , 1 and 2. It's also not uncommon for your potential to exclude all odd functions or something like that. This turns some problems into something simply enough to be done by hand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
