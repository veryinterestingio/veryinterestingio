		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are quite a few sources of data. Crowd sourced information is very fast and high precision, but can be messy (is the traffic bad, or is this person just driving slow?). This kind of data comes from anonymized reporting while your phone is using its GPS. For example, while you’re using the turn by turn directions, you’re also reporting your own location data (anonymously) which gets combined with other people’s data and turned into one component of the traffic prediction.</p>
<p>Another source of data is simply highway patrol. Different states (and countries) have different methods for determining and reporting traffic on major routes, but they almost always have something. This data is very curated and accurate, but sometimes lags behind a bit and only covers major roads. Despite the lag, it can still be a valuable tool for training the predictive model to better understand the more variable patterns produced by the GPS data.</p>
<p>And finally of course you have accidents and construction, which are usually reported very quickly, again to highway patrol, and these usually have a comparatively predictable effect on traffic. They can’t be used to give high precision predictions on their own, but taken together with the rest of the data, they’re very valuable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If you study this route it is diverting my 2-3min off route to check on previous congestion, first left on screen wasn’t required, could have continued straight through.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few tricks that could be used here: </p>
<ul>
<li>keep track of how long it takes for an average google maps user to go down a road and use that to figure out how long it typically takes at any given time of day.</li>
<li>Use machine learning to guess how long a given road should take based off of the data it has (highways will probably have much more traffic than small roads).</li>
<li>Look at police reports of accidents that ocurred that might have been filed digitally.</li>
<li>Get reports from google maps users of accidents that might have happened (I know for a fact that there are people contributing data to google maps).</li>
<li>Look at how long it took the google street view car to get down that road.</li>
