		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fireflies create light by mixing chemicals. They produce different chemicals in their bodies, and when they want light, they mix them together.</p>
<p>The light is the way fireflies attract mates. Female flies look for lights flashing in the right pattern, so the males have to flash a light, as brightly as possible, to be found.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know those glowsticks kids like playing with?  They work the same basic way--by mixing two chemicals together which produce a glow when they react.  In fact, glowsticks were invented by studying fireflies and trying to artificially reproduce what they did.  At what point, it was a major goal of scientists.  I even remember reading an old Hardy Boys book growing up, where the whole plot is recovering either the formula for a glowstick like invention, or the scientists working on it, as that was considered highly futuristic technology when that book was written.  </p>
<p>Someone already mentioned that the chemical responsible is called luciferin.  The chemical is interesting because most chemicals produce heat when they react with other chemicals, but luciferin produces light instead.  It's pretty weird, but also useful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
