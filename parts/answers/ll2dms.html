		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi everyone, we're really excited to start answering your questions soon! A couple of items to kick things off and  to facilitate the discussion:</p>
<ol>
<li>We made a video to describe our methods and results. I should have put this in the top post but forgot to, so I'm sharing it here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Da2EMPuGu00&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Da2EMPuGu00&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Da2EMPuGu00&feature=youtu.be</a></a> This should be much more accessible than the paper.</li>
<li>Two of our other team members from the European Southern Observatory (ESO), Dr. Markus Kasper (/u/erdmann72) and Dr. Ulli KÃ¤ufl (/u/ulli_kaeufl) , will be joining us as well. Markus is the lead scientist of our team, and Ulli is perhaps the world expert on mid-infrared astronomy. I'm very happy that they'll be able to join us and look forward to their perspectives!</li>
</ol>
<p>Edit at 6:30 ET: Thanks so much everyone for your wonderful questions and discussions! Markus and Ulli will likely sign off soon if they haven't already as it's quite late for them in Europe. I'm going to take a break for a couple of hours but will be back this evening. I'm based on the West coast of the US, so I can stay up a while later to continue the fun discussions!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
