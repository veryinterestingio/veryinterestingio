		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Abandoned houses deteriorate faster because they aren't used.</p>
<p>The temperature of the homes isn't adjusted to human living standards which leads to the materials being subjected to harsh temperatures. </p>
<p>The faucets aren't used regularly enough to wash away the mold spores that accumulate from the air. No one is there to kill the mosquitoes or flies that grow from the stagnant water.</p>
<p>No one is there to throw away any moldy or rotting food.</p>
<p>No one is there to shut the windows when it's cold or to turn on a dehumidifier when it's humid causing more wear on the materials.</p>
<p>Of course, this only applies to modern buildings, which are generally wooden structures. Stone structures are generally more resistant to change and may look the same 50 years after abandonment if there is nothing rotting inside.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no scientific answer to this. However, even a “neglected” and occupied house is not as neglected as a truly abandoned house. </p>
<p>Just the act of keeping the AC running keeps the air dried out which does a lot to prevent mold and mildew in the inside. </p>
<p>Moisture is the biggest enemy and anything you do to keep moisture out of the house goes a long way, regardless of anything else you do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to add with the other comments about dust: When you use your home and touch your furniture, you naturally sweep off the dust from them as you move. This is why you never see dust on your desks or kitchen counters you use all the time, but always see dust on shelves you rarely touch. When a house is abandonned, there is no creature naturally sweeping off the dust from items. Every surface, every corners of each furniture, the kitchenware, the clothings in the closets .. everything accumulates dust. Then after the dust comes the <del>crass</del> filth, the cobwebs, the rust, the mold, the guano and mucus. Everything.</p>
<p>In a neglected house, you only see the <del>crass</del> filth and mold in the unused nooks and cranies of the house, not everywhere like in an abandonned house.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The interiors of houses aren't meant to have their temperature and humidity cycled hot and cold or dry and wet. It makes the finish materials swell and shrink, which causes cracks. If you don't ventilate the interior in a wet climate, the carpets and walls will grow mold.</p>
<p>With nobody home to notice, rainwater often starts getting past the roof and siding via leaks. Water will rot and allow mold to destroy the walls and roof of your house in just a few years. If this happens in winter, you also have the effects of freezing and melting eroding your home.</p>
<p>Having people around scares off critters, who would love to live there and chew their way in, making way for water. Also homeless/drug addicts will break into abandoned properties which lets water and bugs in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention copper thieves are always on the lookup for that empty house.  They come in and rip of the pipes and furnace, and any other appliances they can pull out of there.  Once that is done it is a lot more work to bring the house back into a salable condition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
