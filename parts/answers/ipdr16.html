When does it become safe to occupy the space that someone else has previously occupied, both indoors and outdoors? For example, when advancing through a socially-distanced line, you could enter someone else's cloud of droplets once they move forward if not enough time has passed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If my friend was 10 feet away from me, but sneezed into a fan pointed at me - 6 feet wouldn't help much. So what's with all the advice to go outside? If the breeze is 20 mph, isn't it possible that viruses are coming towards me at 20 mph?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
