		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Embryologist here! Once the eggs are fertilized they go back into an incubator for 5 days to grow. The incubator is kept at levels that mimic the temperature and gas concentrations of the body.  We try and leave them alone as any gas, temperature, or even light changes could effect them! The fertilized egg (called an embryo now) grows by dividing cells until it’s well over 100 cells and reaches what we call the blastocyst stage. At this point it it either loaded into a really thin tube that (looks like spaghetti) and transferred back to the uterus or frozen for a transfer later! You can also do genetic testing to check for the correct number of chromosomes or screen out genetic diseases like Huntington’s like someone else mentioned. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My soon to be ex wife and I did what is marketed as Effortless IVF.   Instead of being maintained in the lab, they are placed in a small tube and inserted in the mom for five days.  Uses the body's pH levels, requires less blood tests, and is overall appreciably cheaper.  Feels better for the mother, too, since it's using their body instead of the lab process described above. Feels more &quot;natural.&quot;</p>
<p>Worked on our first try, and I now have a badass one year old boy.</p>
<p>And a wrecked family. But that's another story for after the finalization of divorce, I suppose.  And it's not at all related to the IVF process, which went really well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Embryologist here, the temp is 37 degrees Celsius. Basically everything is done near body temp, from the ooctye collection (your retrieval) to the ICSI (fertilization) to where your little guys are held in the incubator until they’re frozen, transferred or discarded. There’s a lot of lab parts that go into it. We find the eggs, we find the sperm, we put them together, we watch them to see if they fertilize, watch them develop and deem them viable and only sometimes are the embryos biopsied (PGD), which I guarantee you more than one cell is removed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For what it’s worth, this is  the single most common misconception. You don’t implant embryos, you transfer them. If we could really implant them, success rates would
be close to 100% for achieving pregnancy. The body has to do its job, encouraging implantation.</p>
<p>(3  IVFs, 2 different protocols, 1 3D transfer and 1 5d transfer, 13 total eggs retrieved, 13 total embryos, 6 embryos total transferred, 0 embryos survived to day6 freeze, 1 pregnancy, 1 live birth) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
