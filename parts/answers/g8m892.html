		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a misconception.  You don't get vitamin D from the sun. You make vitamin D from cholesterol in its inactive form. Inside your cells, this inactive form gets subjected to UV light which is provided by the sun and then gets activated. That's where the whole &quot;vitamin D from the sun&quot; idea comes from. Other vitamins might require activation chemically through enzymes. So we either get them from food or we synthesize them from other molecules in our body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>By definition &quot;essential nutrient&quot; means a nutrient that our bodies cannot synthesize. They are essential because we can grow deficient without digestive intake. Some other non-essential nutrients that can be synthesized within our bodies (like vitamin D) are biotin, cholesterol, and vitamin K. Biotin and vitamin K are synthesized in the intestines, cholesterol is synthesized in the liver. There are also 11 non-essential amino acids that our bodies can synthesize from carbon skeletons: alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamic acid, glutamine, glycine, proline, serine, and tyrosine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>well theres parenteral nutrition, which is nutrients by vein for those whose gi tract is messed up. your skin can absorb some nutrients and there are some lotions/cremes out there that claim to provide nutrients via skin, not sure how well those work though. maybe the same concept can be used rectally or through other orifices. this is a good question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To take this further. Most of the vitamin D we have comes from our diet. As it stands generally in todayâ€™s society people do not stay outside long enough to sustain themselves in the Vit D produced from it. Also, the darker pigment of your skin the longer you must stay outside for its effects. Another thing people generally do not think about is parathyroid hormone. This hormone acts on the enzyme 1 alpha hydroxylase in the kidney which turns vit D into its activated form that helps with bone growth etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bacteria in the gut can synthesize vitamin B12. I always heard that that only happened in the colon, and so it didn't get absorbed. But it turns out that it might actually be a significant source of B12, at least for some people:</p>
