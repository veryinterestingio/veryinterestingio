		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've actually developed loading bars for applications before.</p>
<p>99 times out of 100 a loading bar is set by dividing the number of tasks to accomplish by the number of tasks already accomplished. Rarely is there any consideration to the length of time it takes to do a task. If there is, it's a best guess. Not many people want to pay for time studies to get it to be a realistic loading bar. They just want a notification of progress so they don't think the application is frozen.</p>
<p>Just for kicks and giggles. I have done a time study on an application loading and normalized the loading bar to be fairly accurate as a countdown. On the computer I was developing with. I transferred the application to a user's computer and it was way off. (Maybe my HD was fast or slower than the user's, or their network connection was flaky. Who knows. There's a million reasons).</p>
<p>Not saying you can't figure it out, but no one is going to pay a developer to do it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You shouldn't really listen to anyone here. The answer is that it's implementation dependent. Maybe the engineer wrote it so that there are four steps of 25% each. Copying files is maybe step 1 and is super fast. Step 2 is a big database operation and is slow... etc.
Maybe the steps are totally fake. Maybe there is a simple timer that moves the progress up 10% every second until 99% where the last percent is actually dependent on something. </p>
<p>Its completely unique to the person who programmed it or a commonly used installation software.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, the computer has no idea how long it's going to take. It knows there is X number of steps and how far a long It is for each individual step and its going to try and predict how long it's going to take based on the information it been given by the dev inatally. </p>
<p>There might also be a psychological explanation as well but I'm not sure</p>
