		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not very long - cells require oxygen to function, so moments after your brain and heart stop, your cells may begin dying in a upwards, collective motion that can span days, weeks, or even months. Usually, starts with the liver and the brain, since they are enzyme rich.</p>
<p>When cells die, they leak digestive enzymes that participate in putrefaction, and causes collapses of capillaries for red blood cells.</p>
<p>As for the gut bacteria, they also help in the process of decay by digesting your organs - until they can freely leave the body either by spilling out of your decaying body, or being carried by maggots, botflies, or other organisms.</p>
<p>Edit: Removed &quot;signaling other cell death.&quot; Depending on the kind of cell death, surrounding white blood cells become receptive to dead cells. Cells in apoptosis (cell suicide) for example typically will distance themselves.
With most somatic cells dropping like flies with the lack of oxygen, cellsâ€™ contents can leak out and damage neighbouring cells.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
