		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chinese is the only major language (or, more accurately, group of languages) that's written purely logographically, i.e. with symbols representing entire words/particles/phrases. Usually they will combine other words to make a new one, such as <em>diànnǎo</em> &quot;computer&quot; = &quot;electric&quot; + &quot;brain&quot;. Korean is written completely phonetically, so there wouldn't be any issues there. Japanese has three writing systems, two phonetic and one logographic. One of the two phonetic systems, katakana, is used for loanwords for other languages, so that's what they would use.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are some cool older Japanese words that combine symbols in this way. For example, 電車 (densha) combines “electric” and “vehicle” to make the word “train.”  汽車 (kisha) combines “steam” and “vehicle” to distinguish a steam-powered train.
電話 (denwa), or “electric talk” is “telephone.”</p>
<p>But mostly these days a new invention is just denoted phonetically. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Japanese will use katakana, which is phonetic, and write it: ル(ru)ン(n/m)パ(pa) = ルンパ</p>
<p>Koreans use hangul for everything, which is also phonetic. They'd write something like: 른파</p>
<p>ㄹ - r/l<br />
ㅡ - u<br />
ㄴ - n/m<br />
ㅍ - p<br />

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every logographic language eventually develops a phonetic &quot;read as&quot; part to it. The most logographic of living scripts, Chinese, actually has enough of a phonetic component to it that you can invent new symbols using a roughly phonetic method. The best example is actually the periodical table of elements. </p>
<p>Helium=氦 This symbol is composed of two component: 气 and 亥。气 is pronounced &quot;chee” (but with a flat tongue) and means air or gas. 亥 is pronounced as &quot;hai&quot; and has a bunch of meanings depending how it's used. So the new symbol is also pronounced &quot;hai&quot; and the non-phonetic component refers to its meaning of a gaseous of element. The sound is actually a transliteration of &quot;he&quot; rather than helium.</p>
<p>Even more obvious with sodium. Sodium=钠，pronounced &quot;na&quot;, yes like with the symbol Na. The  钅part is the symbol to indicate a metal, and the 内 component is for sound. (It's pronounced nei on its own, but as a phonetic component, ie most characters with this part for sound is pronounced &quot;na&quot;.)</p>
<p>The periodic table of elements is probably the most serious and dedicated effort to create new symbols in recent history. Even in English, chemistry is one of the rare instances where you actually have to come up with brand new words. Most of our modern objects have names that are coined from old words. Computer, calculator, rocket, even internet aren't exactly sprouting gibberish sound and writing it down; the same logic works for these easy-to-describe objects in logographic languages too. A &quot;computer&quot; is a &quot;computing machine&quot; in Chinese. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Japanese has multiple alphabets, one is for specific words depending on context and the other/s are for sounds. If a new word came about they would just use the letters that would allow them to make a close approximation of the word. Latin languages have some sounds that japanese doesnt have which can make this a little tricky.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
