		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you're a master blacksmith. You have to heat up your iron to the right temperature to work with it. Too hot and it turns to pure liquid. Too cold and it won't bend when you hammer it. Once you've been doing it long enough, you can probably tell the temperature pretty accurately based on exactly the color of the red-hot glow, right?</p>
<p>Well, all objects are glowing just like hot metal does. It's just that most objects aren't hot enough that the glow is in the visible spectrum. You glow in infrared, which is slightly lower energy than red. This is also how thermal cameras work.</p>
<p>The thermometer can measure how much you're glowing in infrared, and just like the blacksmith, can tell your temperature.</p>
<p>The laser is just a thing for you to use to know where it's measuring, to aim. It's just like a laser-mounted gun sight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The laser is just used for aiming and is not used as part of the measurement process.</p>
<p>The sensor itself is typically a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermopile" target="_blank">thermopile</a> that is composed of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermocouple" target="_blank">thermocouples</a> (edit or something similar) to measure the heat and uses a lens that can pass longer wave IR like a germanium based lens. The lens might give like a 12 to 1 distance to spot ratio, or something close for example, so that at a distance of 12 inches a one inch spot is being measured.</p>

<p>One tricky thing is that objects with a low <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emissivity" target="_blank">emissivity</a> like shiny aluminum could give a false reading in certain instances.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A contact thermometer will warm itself up through conduction. With an infra red thermometer, the surface you're measuring the temperature of is radiating heat. The sensor in the thermometer picks this up. It effectively measures temperature the same way a digital camera could be used to measure brightness.</p>
<p>The laser dot just helps with aiming.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to to the other answers here: the general name for this type of instrument is &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrometer" target="_blank">pyrometer</a>&quot; and there are actually a few different subcategories that offer better accuracy. They all use the same basic principle of measuring the blackbody radiation coming off of an object, described by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law" target="_blank">Planck's law</a>. The cheap ones measure total power coming from an object over a narrow frequency range, but are affected by anything that would change how much power is received (field of view, obstructions, emissivity). The next level measures the ratio of power received over two frequency ranges, which should not change even if the total power intercepted does, so it fixes obstructions/field of view but still has issues with temperature and wavelength-dependent emissivity, as well as any materials like gas or glass that have some absorption spectrum and modify what reaches the pyrometer. The last level is basically a full spectrometer, measuring a bunch of frequencies and fitting the curve to Planck's law, which can account for pretty much anything with the right calibration.</p>
<p>Historically, pyrometers have been used for measuring high temperature things because (a) it's difficult to measure with other techniques and (b) they release a lot more power (visibly glowing!). However, the same principle applies to lower temperature objects, it's just harder to get a good signal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All objects at finite temperature emit electromagnetic radiation. Very hot objects like stars, oven heating elements, and old school light bulbs emit some radiation that is visible (light). Closer to room temperature, objects radiate mostly infrared light which we can't see. Materials like silicon or InGaAs will produce a small electrical current if illuminated by infrared light. By measuring this current, knowing the materials electrical response to radiation, and by knowing how temperature and wavelength or radiated power are related (see <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wien%27s_displacement_law" target="_blank">Wien's displacement law</a> or  <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_law" target="_blank">Stefanâ€“Boltzmann law</a>), you can calculate a temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
