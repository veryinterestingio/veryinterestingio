		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We used to think we did, it was based on the distribution of mass through the solar system and fit a nice curve. It was assumed that due to the amount of mass in a disc available in the planet forming period that we would find smaller planets closer in due to a lack of material (small volume), followed by giant planets where there is a lot of material (large volume and large amount) and finally further out it would tail off to smaller objects (less amount despite large volume). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These days.... No we dont. Exoplanet observations have thrown a lot of our knowlage out the window (everything from stability of systems, migration of planets and even formation mechanisms have all required a &quot;back to the drawing board&quot; approach). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We know now that planetary systems are very dynamical. Small perturbations of orbits can result in wild migrations in short (astronomical) timescales. For example if you plopped down a distant Sun-like binary in our own system it is possible for Neptune and Uranus to be ejected from the system in a timescale of the order of 100Myr, this is quite rapid!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if we consider the problem of migration of planets we dont really know the initial conditions. We have observed Hot Jupiter planets in young and even T-Tauri type stars. This means they must have formed in-situ, something that was not thought to be possible. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What we theorists need is a lot (LOT) more populations statistics so we can improve models of planetary system formation and evolution.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're in the UK, there is literally one of the best documentaries I've ever watched on the solar system on BBC iPlayer. It might be available in the US somewhere. It's called 'planets' and is narrated by Professor Brian Cox.</p>
<p>It has a section about how one of the reasons our solar system is the way it is, despite other solar systems we can see following a different rule, is because of Jupiter. Most rocky planets or 'suoer earth's' that we see are much bigger and further away from the sun.</p>
<p>When Jupiter was forming it started moving towards the sun, and in doing so, took a lot of the mass in our solar system by absorbing it. This removed a lot of the rocky material needed. And as a result our inner planets are smaller that the types of planets we are in other systems.</p>
<p>Why didn't Jupiter just keep eating planetary material and eventually be eaten by the sun? Saturn. Basically when Saturn was formed it made this kind of void in the region of space where both planets were made, and caused some words gravity magic to happen. Basically both planets fall into the sun, but once Saturn got close enough, more gravity magic happens and they end up moving way.</p>
<p>I have absolutely butchered this explanation. Please go find the documentary and watch it! This info is on the episode on Jupiter, which is episode 4 I think.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Astro teacher here. Metals and rocks condense earlier as the protoplanetary disk cools. Bodies with those materials form first. So the inner planets and cores of the outer planets were first.</p>
<p>The solar wind pushed the lighter elements outward, like hydrogen and helium. They collected first on Jupiter, then saturn, etc.</p>
<p>Others have touched on planetary migration (Jupiter coming in and then reversed by Saturn). That probably played a role in clearing smaller bodies or those with more elliptical orbits.</p>
<p>Really rough summary, but should answer your question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s a simple answer for <em>our</em> solar system.  The <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frost_line_(astrophysics\)" target="_blank">Frost Line</a>.  It’s an imperfect answer but the bullet is:</p>
<p>During our solar system’s evolution as a proto-nebula beyond the frost line at ~2.7 AU ice and other volatiles could exist in direct sunlight.  Any closer and the ice would sublimate into gas.  These ice crystals aggregated and accelerated the formation of the outer planets.  These planets were composed of gas because there was a lot of gas <em>present</em> at that time.</p>
<p>The inner planets were born later and there was little gas present.  Well, less.</p>
<p>The frost line today of course is much farther out.  The sun’s hotter, the partial pressure is lower, and the system is no longer opaque.  I think ~5 AU at this point.</p>
<p>Two other things to keep in mind: Asteroid belts tend to form around the frost line.  Ours is bisected by it.  The inner asteroids have subsurface water, the outer ones not so much.  They tend to provide archeological evidence of the frost line because the gas giants form just outside the line and perturb the orbits preventing planetary formation.</p>
<p>Also different substances have different frost lines.  In our solar system at the very least, water’s a very important one much more so that methane or ammonia for example.  Water’s probably more abundant than the others; it requires no nitrogen or carbon, which are less abundant than oxygen.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can only see one comment so far, and it doesn't include the Nebular Theory so I'll add that one. You can see a nice overview on this website: <a href="http://atropos.as.arizona.edu/aiz/teaching/nats102/mario/solar_system.html" target="_blank">http://atropos.as.arizona.edu/aiz/teaching/nats102/mario/solar_system.html</a>  and you can scroll to part II to see more about how the different planets formed.</p>
<p>Mainly it depended on the temperature, since closer to the sun was/is hotter, elements with higher boiling points were able to condense more easily (metals and things that eventually lead to rocks). Those elements are also more dense so the solar wind wasn't moving them away from the sun as quickly, I think. (My wife is taking an online astronomy class right now and I kind of remember this detail but I don't remember seeing it on the link I posted.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
