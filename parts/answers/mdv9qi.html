		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sound probably the resonant frequency of your teeth. Resonance is created when sound waves in a solid line up in both directions, causing them to vibrate more. Kind of like how if you shake a flimsy ruler. If you go too fast, the ruler won't flex too much, but if you get the right timing, the ruler will look like a standing wave. Every material has a resonant frequency. The sounds that make your teeth hurt are ones that create resonance.
I hope that makes sense</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
