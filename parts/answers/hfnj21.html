		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’ll chime in - Almost-PHD in forest ecology with a specialty in tree mortality under climate change. I wasn’t super satisfied with the other answer that suggests that “nothing dies of old age” - I don’t think that’s a fair technicality, although I wouldn’t say the comment is “wrong”, really, and maybe I’m just nitpicking. Nonetheless...</p>
<p>The short answer is no, trees do not die of old age.</p>
<p>The long answer is that “Old age”, as most people think of it, is cellular senescence and apoptosis that is the ultimate fate of deterministic embryogenesis. Many organisms, including humans, are fated to completely break down. Not all animals are like this - jellyfish are a textbook example because of how they switch between polyp/Medusa stages.</p>
<p>With a few exceptions, trees do not have fated cell development in the same way that most animals do. Their cells constantly differentiate from meristematic (think “stem cells”) tissue during growth and development. These meristematic tissues can grow and divide essentially forever.</p>
<p>Tree species do have average lifespans, but these lifespans are determined by interactions between their environment and physiology, both of which also interact with a trees biotic environment. Almost any tree species will live forever if you give it the right growing environment.</p>
<p>Life span for any tree species is really just a probability density function that describes the chance of mortality given some external conditions. If you change the conditions, you change the life span.</p>
<p>The bristle-cone pines (Pinus longaeva) are a good example of this. When people talk about the oldest bristle comes, most people are talking about <em>a specific relictual population in California</em>. Most bristle cones only live a few hundred years - the reason the Ancient Bristlecones live so long is because they grow in a very particular set of ravines, with a very particular set of environmental conditions. Not only are these ravines wetter and less windy than many other locations the tree can grow, which reduces dessication and wind throw mortality, but the long dormant season at 10k+ feet  makes it so the trees grow very, very slowly. Slow growth means they accumulate biomass very slow, which reduces their risk of growing into wind throw or lightning strike range or accumulating too much fire fuel.</p>
<p>I think thats an alright explanation? I can clarify or provide more examples as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These answers feel woefully incomplete to me. It's true that technically speaking, <em>nothing</em> dies of old age. There are many diseases that are <em>associated with aging</em> and those diseases are what tends to kill a tree, similar to humans and dying during old age from pneumonia, cancer or heart failure. </p>
<p>However, we can look at tree species and relatively reliably estimate the average lifespan of the trees within that species, and this lifespan tends to vary quite a lot from species to species, just like we see in animals. There are trees like <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Bristlecone_pine" target="_blank">bristlecone pines</a> that commonly live for thousands of years, and there are trees like the <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cornus_florida" target="_blank">dogwood</a> that will rarely even live to 100. So there's some genetic component that influences the average lifespan of a tree outside of just environmental conditions and the size of the tree--some species of tree are clearly more robust and long-lived than others. There are also cultural modifications you can make with trees to influence their lifespan; for example, training trees as bonsai seems to be able to extend their lifetimes, as there are many examples of bonsai trees that have been in training for 100+ years when the tree species itself rarely lives that long in the wild. Unfortunately, I don't know enough about the science behind this to really continue the discussion any further, but I'd love to hear from someone who can.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, most of a tree that you see is already dead. The center of every tree is dead cells used to keep the living part on the outside standing.  Old age in humans is caused by  telomere shortening and is part of our life cycle. Trees if given correct environment will continue growing until they collapse under their own weight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Arborist here, trees do die of &quot;old age&quot;. Each species has a specific range at which they will naturally die. This range can be 60yrs or 6,000yrs and anywhere in-between. Keep in mind that they don't just one day suddenly die, gradually over years they die back until their foliage can no longer support their energy needs.  Typically the vascular statement becomes clogged with minerals or other nutrients while there cambium layer does less and less cell division (reducing new tissue growth, both vascular and structural) causing the already stressed vascular system to eventually stop functioning. This is a simplistic explanation for a very complex and highly variable process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
