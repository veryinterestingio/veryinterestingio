		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of mining like solving a sudoku puzzle. They are really hard to solve but very easy to verify if correct. Every miner agrees to try to solve a really difficult sudoku puzzle and the first one to solve it gets to claim their answer as the &quot;definitive&quot; answer. Because this takes a lot of time and effort, they are rewarded with some bitcoin. Once an answer is discovered, they alert everyone that they found the answer, and the process starts over again. The difficulty of the sudoku puzzle is adjusted such that an answer is found every 10 minutes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok then, here we go,</p>
<p>the list of all the transactions that have ever happened in Bitcoin history is stored in the form of a chain of blocks (these blocks have the details of transactions). This is called blockchain and this blockchain is in the computer of every participant (also called &quot;node&quot;) of this Bitcoin ecosystem.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now, let's say you wanna give 2 bitcoins to your friend, now Bitcoin's chain has to verify that you indeed have 2 bitcoins to give to your friend, so what it does is to verify from the chains in other nodes/computers of this chain.</p>
<p>A race starts, in which every computer solves tough maths/cryptographic problems in order to verify that you indeed have these 2 bitcoins, <strong>this process is called mining</strong>. The maths/cryptographic problems are very tough and require very much processing power.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The person who wins this race gets bitcoins as a prize.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the OP, I'd like to clear up one more thing. The purpose of mining isn't to verify transactions. Every node on the network is responsible for verifying that a transaction was properly signed by the sending address private key. The purpose of mining is to prevent the &quot;double spend problem&quot;, in which a malicious actor signs away the same bitcoin twice. It is possible to &quot;double spend&quot; only if the blockchain splits, and even then it's only likely to happen for a block or two. Guidance is for any large transaction, wait six blocks before truly accepting the transaction as finished. The reason for which is that the miners have done <em>so much work</em> in six blocks that it's near impossible for that same bitcoin to be spent anywhere else.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
