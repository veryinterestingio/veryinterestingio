		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The evolutionary advantage is endothermy. Keeping muscles and other tissue warm allows them to survive in colder habitats, and have better efficiency in muscle function, so they can move quickly over a longer distance. Endothermy is energetically costly to do over the whole body, so it requires a lot of oxygen, and there just isn’t that much dissolved oxygen in the ocean. There are fish and sharks that have regional endothermy, where they keep their main swimming muscles warm, but only while they’re actively swimming and never their whole body. There are fish and sharks that can survive very cold temperatures, but they either don’t move very fast and/or can’t tolerate warmer water. There are dolphins and whales that can survive both in tropical and polar waters and migrate seasonally through both habitats. When you look at icy habitats in the Arctic and Antarctic, the only animals utilizing ice, land and ocean are marine mammals and birds. Being an air-breathing marine animal allows for a greater tolerance of different habitats.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily, but you must consider the MASSIVE jump required to completely restructure their method of oxygenation and how that would work.</p>
<p>A point covered in many evolutionary classes is the issue of selection. Whether you’re raising dairy cows for milk production/quality or questioning how an aquatic mammal could end up with gills, these organisms are limited to the genes already present in individuals and the population as a whole.</p>
<p>There are clearly benefits to gills for an aquatic animal, but going from lungs -&gt; gills doesn’t have a lot of steady transitional checkpoints where a selectable improvement improvement is possible. And if genes for gills don’t really exist any longer in those populations of aquatic mammals, they simply lack the building blocks to get there over anything but the massive timeframes necessary for a hugely transitional mutation to occur and then further develop.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is very little dissolved O2 in water compared to the atmosphere. Mammals need more O2 to keep their systems warm regardless of the outside temp.  So trying to drive the metabolism using O2 in water wouldnt work.</p>
<p>Whales etc came from ancestors that kinda resemble hippos.  So LOONG ago fish, then mammals, then BACK into the ocean and whales.  But once you're down the mammal tech tree, you cant power your system with the pittence of O2 in the water. </p>
<p>Also, evolution makes gradual changes, so remodeling the whole lung/gill thing isnt going to happen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s no evolutionary advantage because that’s not something evolution will have selected for in the history of either mammal.</p>
<p>There has never been a point where a dolphin or whale or precursor to either had a branching point where they could have got gills or lungs. Their ancestor species had lungs for far longer than they’ve been aquatic. </p>
<p>The amount of changes required to go from lungs to gills is enormous and would far outweigh any potential benefit - assuming the species could even remain viable in the transition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
