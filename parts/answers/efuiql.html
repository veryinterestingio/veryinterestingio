		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On the contrary, they are very very good conductors.</p>
<p>Neutron stars are in 'beta equilibrium.' This means that there are a small number of protons and electrons. If you have too many neutrons, it is energetically favorable for some of them to beta decay and become protons and electrons. It's somewhere between a 10 to 1 or 20 to 1 ratio of neutrons to protons. </p>
<p>The protons in the core are under such enormous pressure that they form Cooper pairs. This basically means that protons pair by spin, like electrons filling atomic orbitals. This produces a 'superconductor,' a conducting medium which supports enormous electric currents and magnetic fields.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Adding to the other answers: electrons aren't strictly necessary for electrical conduction. Any charged particle that can move through a medium will work. We pretty much exclusively use electrons and ions (which mostly contain electrons), because of ease. Protons would work just as well. In fact, there's a few prototype proton battery concepts floating around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neutrons do outnumber protons and electrons by orders of magnitude in neutron stars, but they electrical conductivity is actually very high because the electrons and protons can travel unimpeded.</p>
<p>If you're interested, I wrote a blog post about how to estimate the proton to neutron ratio in neutron stars</p>
