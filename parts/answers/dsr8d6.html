<p>The situation he calls &quot;If the Higgs field were zero&quot; is how things were before the Higgs field turned on (aka. above the electroweak unification energy) and the article explains how the Higgs field interactions hide the symmetry of the underlying fields and give us what we see now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<ol>
<li>The weak and em forces are modeled by quantum field theories (QFT's). One of the main ideas is that  matter particles carry some sort of &quot;charge&quot;: em - electric charge, weak - weak isospin. These particles interact with one another by exchanging a force carrying boson: em - massless photon, weak - massive W+,W-,Z bosons (The first two are electrically charged, the Z is neutral). </li>
<li>Above a certain energy, the two forces are unified in the sense that both are modeled by a single QFT. Here we have two types of charge: weak isospin and hypercharge. We also have 4 massless force carrying bosons that facilitate the interaction: W1,W2,W3,B. It is at low energy that the systems lose the symmetry of this QFT, interact with the Higgs field and reduce to the forces above. In particular, particular linear combinations of the bosons above become the photon, W+,W-,Z with the latter three gaining mass.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This statement is often given to refer to the discovery of the Higgs mechanism, which explains the relationship between the electromagnetic and weak forces. This mechanism is very successful in explaining the origin of mass, but it does not, in fact, unify anything in a Grand Unified Theory sense.</p>
<p>It is closer to the truth to say that there are two forces at high energy, the weak force and the hypercharge force, that mix and become a different force at lower energies, the electromagnetic force.</p>
<p>Essentially, the weak force exists because of a local SU(2) symmetry in nature: up-type particles and down-type particles carry an up-type charge and a down-type charge respectively, and rotating these two charges to a different basis locally does not modify the physics. The hypercharge force exists because of a local U(1) symmetry in nature: particles carry a numerical charge, and giving all of them a phase locally does not modify the physics either.</p>
<p>Along comes the Higgs field, a field with both a non-zero hypercharge and up- and down-type constituents. One of its constituents gets a “vacuum expectation value”, meaning that the amount of field at every point in space becomes non-zero as a default. This kind of makes no sense in a particle formulation (a particle is a small excitation in the field and so having some sort of “carpet” of those makes no sense), so we have to redefine what the zero is for that field, but that means having a vacuum that is charged under both the weak and hypercharge forces. These symmetries no longer make sense and are said to be broken.</p>
<p>However, we can redefine a new symmetry with a charge built from the old ones, as long as the vacuum is neutral under this new charge. This new charge, a weighted sum of the old ones, is called the electromagnetic charge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We have known of the four fundamental forces for a long time. Newton managed to explain gravity in a classical sense in the 1600s, and Maxwell explained electromagnetism in the 1800s with his four Maxwell equations. Both the weak and strong forces were first theorised in the early 1900s. However, throughout the 1900s, quantum mechanics started to take off as a scientific theory, and we wanted ways to relate these four fundamental forces to the quantum world.</p>
<p>We managed to develop a theory called Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) throughout the mid 1900s which explained electromagnetism in a quantum sense, and then the theory of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) was developed in the late 1900s to explain the strong force. We have so far struggled to find the theory of quantum gravity to explain gravity in the quantum mechanical world, and this remains one of the biggest challenges in physics today.</p>
<p>When we tried to develop a quantum theory for the weak force, it was found that QED was needed to fully explain it, suggesting electromagnetism and the weak force are just different manifestations of the same force. This resulted in what is known as the Electroweak Theory (EWT). However, this seems odd considering how different the two forces are.</p>
<p>The key difference is the force carrier. For EM, this is a photon, which is massless. For the weak force, the force carrier is a W or Z boson, which both have relatively large masses of 80GeV and 91GeV respectively. Here, masses are given in terms of energy using Einstein’s E=mc^(2). It’s important to remember that energy can be converted into mass. In a particle collision, the energy of the colliding particles goes into creating a force carrier, which then goes onto produce your new particles (this isn’t exactly true but is close enough for this explanation).</p>
<p>At low energy, say a collision with only 10GeV of energy flying about, there is not enough energy to produce one of these bosons, as the bosons have a mass of 80 or 91Gev and you only have 10GeV of energy to play with. However, since a photon is massless, you don’t need much energy to create it. Therefore, the EM force can happen easily, as this photon can be produced and do whatever it needs to do. However, the weak force struggles as there’s not enough energy to produce its force carrier. You can still produce a W or Z boson however by “borrowing energy from the vacuum”. This is a weird quantum mechanical effect due to Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle of ∆E∆t \~ hbar, where E is energy and t is time. This means you can borrow ∆E amount of energy from the vacuum for a very short time ∆t to make your force carrier. At low energies, we need to borrow around 100GeV of energy to create one of our bosons. Putting this value of ∆E into our equation, we find ∆t = 6.6 x 10^(-27) seconds. Therefore, our force carrier can only exist for this short amount of time before it disappears again and its energy is returned to the vacuum of space. If we assume the boson travels at (more or less) the speed of light, the distance it can travel in this time is around 10^(-18) metres, which is the range of the weak force (which you may have read in physics textbooks).</p>
<p>As we have seen, at low energies, the EM force can happen freely, but we must borrow energy from the vacuum of space for a very short amount of time for the weak force to happen. This process suppresses the weak force and makes it around a million times weaker than the EM force. However, when we go to higher energies, say 100GeV, we now have enough energy to produce one of these force carriers without having to borrow any energy from the vacuum. This means the weak force is no longer significantly weaker than the EM force, because both force carriers can be easily produced in the particle collision. The weak and EM force are now unified into the electroweak force at these energies.</p>
<p>So at low energies, they're very different, and the weak force is significantly weaker than EM. However, at high energies, their differences fade away and they become one unified force, the electroweak force.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It means that above some energy level, what you would observe are not the usual particles of electromagnetism and weak force, but actually a recombination of those. To be more precise, the math that describe the electroweak symmetry breaking goes the other way around. You postulate that at high energies, some particles exist, and that by some mechanism, they recombine in a specific way at low energies forming the usual massless photon and the W and Z bosons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
