		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alcohol is a sedative which can help you fall asleep, but once it wears off there is an opposite rebound effect, which is like a stimulant that wakes you up.</p>
<p>BTW While alcohol can help you fall asleep, it tends to make sleep quality worse, so you don't get as rested from the same amount of sleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what /u/is_reddit_useful said, alcohol also interfers with your body's ability to regulate the different stages of sleep. One of these stages is where dreaming happens, and this stage is also widely thought to be one of the most important stages. So when the dreaming stage gets messed with in a bad way, it negatively affects the quality of sleep that night.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alcohol is a sleep disturber. Alcohol also suppresses vasopressin or ADH(anti-diuretic hormone). This hormone is responsible for telling your body to hold onto liquid so we don’t pee every 20 minutes. “Breaking the seal” as it were really refers to the effect alcohol has, making you pee more often. At nights end, you aren’t paying attention to how dehydrated you are from drinking and it gets worse as you sleep as your body oxidizes the alcohol out. A lot of passive work happens while you “sleep off” your alcohol. So much so that it uses a lot of “auxiliary power” (water mostly) and will actually force you to awaken earlier feeling parched. Although it’s not entirely proven, some studies believe we wake up with hangovers because we dehydrate ourselves so much that the membranes holding our brains in place shrink and put strain on surrounding areas, causing that headache we can’t kick. Hydrating is an often overlooked habit that 1st world countries still have problems with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>Diuresis.  Metabolisation of alcohol stimulates the production of urine, making bladders fuller, faster, which is often a big factor in waking humans.  As many drunks will tell you, though, if you're drunk enough, alcohol's sedative effect is stronger, and you'll just wake up wet...</li>
<li>Formaldehyde poisoning.  Formaldehyde is one of the metabolic byproducts of Ethanol in humans and many other mammals.  It's toxic, and is largely responsible for many of the unpleasant side-effects of hangovers that aren't directly caused by dehydration (which comes from the diuresis, above).</li>
<li>Dehydration.  As a side-effect of more of your body's moisture being excreted into the bladder, you're often dehydrated (more from what you wizzed away while drinking than what you made overnight, but still).  This has a number of unpleasant symptoms including headaches and general body ache, dry mouth, sore throat, and others.  Many of these are uncomfortable enough to wake you at some point.</li>
