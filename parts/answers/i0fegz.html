<p>If you had eaten the fruit you would have eaten the fruit fly eggs.  This is perfectly normal, there are bug eggs in many things.  If bug eggs made us sick we would have never made it as a species.  Washing the fruit helps wash the eggs off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Their eggs are in the fruit.</p>
<p>This question led to one of the biggest breakthroughs in science.   It was thought that the flies spontaneously sprouted out of decaying fruit because of god or whatever.   </p>
<p>In 1668, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_Redi" target="_blank">Francesco Redi</a>, ran an experiment where he covered fruit to prevent flies from touching it........No new flies.    Scientific Method led to the answer of this age-old question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fruit fly scientist here. Most likely the fruit flies come in from outside, because they are attracted to the smell of rotting fruit. Fruit flies have a life cycle (egg to adult) of 10+ days, and some of the developmental stages are quite large (late stage larvae and pupae are up to 1 cm long). So for eggs to develop to adult flies like some of the other comments sugest, you would have to wait 10+ days, and you would have to overlook large white larvae crawling around in your fruit. It can happen of cause, but my bet is you would have thrown the fruit out by then</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
