		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You process information in combination. Sometimes the audio by itself wasn't sufficient, for instance if you couldn't hear every word or the comment was of an unexpected context. Generally when you ask, &quot;sorry, what?&quot; you look up at the speaker, which gives you body language clues that can fill in the meaning of the incomplete audio. At other times, you replay the audio in your head and understand it after a second reflection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
