		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On STARS, </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How is the 70% efficiency noted in the article defined, and what's the overall energy balance?  If we think of the solar input as &quot;free&quot; and the methane as the input energy, what is the efficiency in producing hydrogen, and how does that change if we also consider the chemical energy stored in the chemical products produced?</p>
</li>
<li>Also, an alternative would be to run the  methane through a combined cycle gas turbine to produce electricity, run a carbon capture and sequestration process on the exhaust, and use PV over the same collection area.  Then that electricity could be used in EVs.  How does the efficiency compare between those two, from methane input to electric output from the batteries or fuel cell.  I'd say well to wheels, but the well-to-methane-delivery part should be the same and the electric propulsion system should be the same so we can compare pretty well without going all the way to well to wheels.</li>
</ol>
<p>Given that STARS can produce useful chemical feedstocks, and given that fuel cells are good for some niche applications even without a highly efficient way to produce hydrogen, STARS  sounds like a great process even if the answers to my questions are not favorable, but I would like to understand how broadly it could make sense to use it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On the carbon fiber process,</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>CO2 emissions are said to be virtually eliminated.  I'm excited to have them significantly reduced at all, so virtually eliminated sounds great, but it is also vague.  I appreciate that there's likely some uncertainty, and so I don't expect you can give me an exact number, but can you say what order of magnitude the emissions reduction is?  Is it safe to assume that the climate emissions would be dominated by methane leaks in the drilling, pipeline, and distribution systems?</p>
</li>
<li>What's the scale of the hydrogen production from this is all the carbon fiber production is the US or in the world was switched over to this process?  That's only a baseline scoping question, as carbon fiber production is presumably increasing fairly rapidly, but will give and idea of the scale of the contribution this could make.</li>
