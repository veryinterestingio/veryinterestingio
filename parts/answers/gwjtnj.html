		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Jet streams. The earth isn't a static thing, hot air is blown via jest streams across the globe, cooled and recycled, like an AC.</p>
<p>Greenland wasnt getting an equatorial stream north, the air that hit europe ice cooled the air, and warmed the ice, causing it to melt over a few thousand years.</p>
<p>That loss of cooling changed the earths temp, and slowly started warming, which caused a shifting jet stream over 5,000 years, and giving us a more current wind model today</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can't equate latitude directly with temperature, due to jet streams and ocean currents. The <a href="https://www.offshoreengineering.com/education/oceanography/114-education/ocean-environment/284-map-of-large-scale-surface-currents" target="_blank">Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Drift</a> bring warm water (and accompanying air masses) to Europe and along much of the coast of North America. Note in the image that Greenland is bordered almost completely by a cold current from the pole instead.</p>
<p>These ocean currents can have a huge impact on nearby land climate. London England is 51deg north and the coldest month's average low is 5C (41F). That's farther north than Winnipeg Canada at 50 deg north, where the coldest month average low is -21C (-6.5F).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We are still in the &quot;Ice Age&quot; also average temperature isnt completely related to altitude. Latitude (and altitude) only determines how much sunlight you get. Which is only 1 factor in determining the temperature. Other things also determine if icesheets will melt, like ocean current, wind, cloud cover, chemicals in the air (Ozone) and proximity to humans that pump out heat and chemicals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
