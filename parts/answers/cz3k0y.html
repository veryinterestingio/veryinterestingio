		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Turns is number of times the wire used to make up the winding is wrapped around each armature. The armature is the part of the motor that produces the power; this can either be a winding that the rotor spins around (External rotor motor) or the armature itself can be <del>the part that spins wrapped</del> around the rotor (Internal rotor motor).</p>
<p>Edit: here is a site with a couple of good diagrams:  <a href="https://www.motioncontroltips.com/external-rotor-motor-basics-design-applications/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.motioncontroltips.com/external-rotor-motor-basics-design-applications/" target="_blank">https://www.motioncontroltips.com/external-rotor-motor-basics-design-applications/</a></a></p>
<p>Edit 2: Number of turns per armature can affect motor performance in a number of ways. The more turns there are generally the smaller the wire gauge to accommodate this; smaller wire gauge = higher resistance (Impedance if AC motor) of wire meaning the motor spins slower <del>and produces less torque</del>. On the other hand, thicker wire gauge means lower resistance so higher power motor.</p>
<p>It's not quite as clear cut as that though as you have to take into account is number of poles on the motor and type of magnets used for the rotor.</p>
<p>If anyone else wants to correct me or add further info go ahead please, motor theory hasn't been something i have looked at for a long while.</p>
<p>Edit 3: because brain fart, lower turns is less torque, higher turns is more torque, not what i initially put, also changed IRM and ERM description at top as fluffed that aswell, need coffee.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a certain amount of airspace around each stator &quot;tooth&quot;. You need to fill that airspace with as many copper wire wraps as will fit. You can use many turns of thin wire, or fewer turns of thicker wire, or...any variation between the two extremes.</p>
<p>The more turns you use (*high turn-count, low Kv), the lower the shaft RPMs you get per volts that you apply. Few turns of fat wire is a high-Kv. This is a &quot;fast&quot; winding, and you get higher RPMs per volt.</p>
<p>Many motors wind &quot;in hand&quot;, meaning it is easier to wrap thin wire, but to get a fast winding, you bundle several small diameter wires, so they act like one fat wire. Therefore, you cannot tell the Kv by simply counting the strands around each tooth, you must determine if it is one continuous thin wire that is very long, or several thin wires with attached ends, with each being shorter than the wire in the low Kv.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/series_hybrid has the right answer.  The rest of the answers are circling the truth but don't get it quite right.</p>
<p>Turns per armature doesn't really mean anything.  Usually it's &quot;turns per armature coil&quot; or sometimes &quot;total armature conductors.&quot;  Usually there are multiple coils in an armature and &quot;turns per armature coil&quot; would be the number of turns in one of those coils.  &quot;Total armature conductors&quot; would be the number of turns per coil times the number of coils.  </p>
<p>For a given motor, if you were to change the number of turns in the armature, this is usually done to change the speed of the motor relative to the back emf voltage.  Practically speaking this can be done to 1) make the motor slower or faster for a given applied voltage or 2) change the applied voltage of the motor but keep the speed the same.  </p>
<p>Increasing the number of turns increases the voltage per RPM ratio.  Decreasing the number of turns decreases the voltage per RPM ratio.  </p>
<p>So if you have a 24 V motor with 10 turns per coil and you want to re-wind it to be twice as fast at 24 V, then you'd re-wind it with 5 turns per coil.  If you had wanted to rewind it to be the same speed at 48 V, you'd re-wind it with 20 turns per coil.  </p>
<p>Changing the number of turns also changed the torque per current ratio of the motor.  Increasing the number of turns increases the torque per current ratio.  Decreasing the number of turns decreases the torque per current ratio. </p>
<p>This works out nicely because it means you can keep the same torque at different voltage motors.  For example if you half the number of turns, your RPM/Voltage decreases by half and your torque/current decreases by half.  But you can also put twice as thick of wire in your armature slots. This allows for twice the current to flow through the wires without overheating.  So your torque/current gets cut in half but your current can double so your torque stays the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
