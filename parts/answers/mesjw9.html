		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because video games are under a lot more scrutiny. Surprisingly, they still carry a lot of stigma, and need to be a lot more conscious than something like a movie, which, relatively speaking, can do whatever it wants. A similar example is the way parents frequently freak out about M rated games existing, but not so much about R rated movies. It is absolutely an example of a double standard, and the culture still adapting to a newer medium. Back when movies first introduced sound, the same sorta stuff happened.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
