		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Orcas have a fascinating social 'matrilineal' society where families are sorted along female lineage with offspring of both sexes staying with their mother's family unit for their whole lives. Like humans, female orcas go through menopause midway through their lives, but continue to be the matriarchs of their family groups for their full lives, and research has suggested that the presence of grandmother orcas increase the survival rate of young orcas in their pod.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember seeing (in a documetary) an older female elephant helping her daughter's son climbing out of a pit.</p>
<p>It was pretty funny, because the mother was trying to do it, but she couldn't manage. The grandmother basically shoved her off and got her grandson out of the pit. Like &quot;Get out of my way and take a good look on how you do this&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a strange way, cats will, if they're kept in the same place. Though that's less because cats are caring for the next generation, and more because cats will, pretty much at any age beyond kitten stage, adopt other cats, dogs, people, and basically anything else alive, as a child-thing. So long as the stress level is kept low(Calm home, relative stability and routine, and a full belly), cats will basically decide Anything is Baby.</p>
<p>Which is fun, because cats will also resort to adopting their children out. More and more, cats in urban spaces(and even more rural ones) have been observed &quot;dropping off&quot; a kitten with a human, especially if that human has taken care of them in the past(or is in a home where someone else has). Whether this is personification or not is a side point, but the idea that cats are like &quot;I can't raise All of these guys, I know you care for cats, so I will leave one of them with you to raise and give the best chances of survival rather than having to devote my own energy and food supply to them&quot; is an interesting and amusing thing.  </p>
<p>As an addendum by the way, to the &quot;Anything alive&quot; thing... sometimes not even that. Sometimes to relieve stress, cats have been observed &quot;mothering&quot; toys, household objects, and other things. Mine, for instance, relieves his stress when he's feeling &quot;motherly&quot; by giving a rabbit fur I bought him a bath.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
