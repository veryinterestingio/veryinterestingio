		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The problem with trash is that <strong>nobody wants to spend any money on it</strong>.  There are fine, safe, approaches to recycling and storing it.  However, none of those things makes money - except aluminum can recycling.  So, somebody would have to pay.  Local governments don't have money, and raising taxes to process trash more isn't popular because taxes isn't popular.  Do you want to sort and dispose of trash for no paycheck?  Neither does anybody else, nor are there companies that want to truck it to a mine or store it in the mine for no money.  Most of the plastic in the ocean doesn't come from the countries that use the most plastic bags and straws, it comes from countries that throw trash in their rivers.  Trash isn't a trash problem, it's a money problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The issue with trash isn't a place to put it, it's the cost to transport it to that place.</p>
<p>Digging a huge hole in the middle of the desert to mine minerals makes money.    Hauling trash out to that same hole costs money.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Until the start of the Industrial Revolution, nearly all the trash decayed. No-one discarded metal, it was too valuable. Plastics didn't exist. Clothing was natural fibres (wool, cotton, linen, silk,etc.,) and they decayed. Archaeologists dig up crockery, a few lost metal artefacts, broken tiles, shards of glass, bricks, some grave goods, remnants of stone structures, bones; nearly everything else has long gone. The rare archaeological treasures are the few things that didn't decay. </p>
<p>The Industrial Revolution was discovering ways to make stuff cheaper and faster, stuff that was resistant to decay. Plastics, concrete, glass, metal, painted stuff, toxic chemicals. We made a lot of stuff. The resilient garbage is mixed up with the bio-degradable stuff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The problem is not where to put it but how to stor it so toxic stuff in it do not leak out to the environment.  There is for example heavy metals that was bound up in rock in the ground is a stable way before we took it out and refined it. There is also chemical we produce that is stable that do not exist in nature.</p>
<p>Transport is a problem because you like to do it in a cheap way so most trash is produce in citys but there is a limited amount of space there.</p>
<p>Look at  <a href="https://www.spacelaunchreport.com/logyear.html" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.spacelaunchreport.com/logyear.html" target="_blank">https://www.spacelaunchreport.com/logyear.html</a></a>  and you finds total of 5751 launched to orbit including failures  The total mass of the largest rocket  Saturn V was 2970 tonnes  if we use that you have 2970*5751= 17 080 470  tonnes  that is 17 million tonnes</p>
<p>About  2.01 billion metric tons of municipal solid waste is produced per year  or 5.5 million tonnes per day.</p>
<p>So the amount of trash produced in 4 days is more then the mass of all launches in a rocket from the ground if every rocket was the largest ever. But most of the rocket is used early in the flight and will never reach space.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Saturn V was primary fuel that was RP/1( diesel) , liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. The empty rocket had a mass of 187 tonnes without the payload so lets say 200 tonnes. So that is 200*5751=1.1 million tonnes. So the solid stuff if all rocket was the larges would be equivalent to municipal solid waste  produced in 5 hours.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It get even worse because most of the rockets fall back down on earth it could only launch 48 tonnes to a orbit  to the moon   and lower orbits will fall back down. So the stuff we could have launched away from earth if all rocket was the largest is the same as municipal solid waste produced in a 1 hour and 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Because most rocket are a lot smaller you likely talk about less then 15 minutes of municipal solid waste produces.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So the amount we have launched to space is insignificant compared to trash on earth</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
