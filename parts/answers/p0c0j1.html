		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don't. What sports drinks are supposed to do is replace minerals/salts/electrolytes (different words for the same stuff) that you may have lost during intense physical exercise. They also have sugar to replace the calories you burn during the same activity. Unless you are an elite athlete in the middle of an actual competition, you do not need a sports drink (even then, the evidence is pretty sparse that they help). A normal diet has more than enough minerals for even the most work-out obsessed individual. Even if you exclusively drink distilled water, there will be more than enough salt in your diet to keep you going.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't hydrate you. Sports drinks are for people who've depleted their salt. Salt helps your body absorb water. Without salt, the body has a tough time taking water and you just piss it out. That's why you're supposed to drink one bottle of Gatorade and two bottles of water. I work construction in the heat and humidity. People who say only athletes need to drink a Gatorade should do some big jobs doing asphalt or concrete in 95° weather with 90% humidity, not get a break for an entire day, then say you shouldn't drink it. It's necessary for many people as it might be their best bet to getting a little extra salt and sugar.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The marketing around them is intentionally misleading. They do not hydrate you more, they hydrate you better, per their definition of better. Sports drinks may contain a more strict set of minerals, more sugar sugar and performance enhancers like caffeine then regular mineral water. And that may arguably be better then regular mineral water as you get in the faucet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know how you retain more water if you eat very salty food for a day or two?  Water follows salt.  Let me explain:</p>
<p>Suppose you’ve been running a marathon in hot weather and lost a lot of sweat (water &amp; salt).  When you drink a sports drink (water &amp; salt), and it gets to your kidneys, the kidneys try to retain that salt you just lost— and water follows the salt.  They’ll try to retain plain water too, but the effect is greater if salt is present, because there’s the water transport plus the salt-and-water-follows transport.</p>
<p>(*using salt as shorthand for electrolytes sodium, potassium, chloride.  Don’t @ me about botching renal physiology, I too am 5.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
