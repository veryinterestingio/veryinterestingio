		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You’ve done the math wrong.  300 meters depth is 30 bar; 1.6 bar partial pressure would be 5%, not 0.5%.</p>
<p>As others have pointed out survival depends more on partial pressure than concentration, so this 5% is survivable, but the math error is crucial.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The percentage of oxygen does not matter, only the partial pressure. One way to think about this is that the walls of the lungs only cares about the oxygen molecules that actually hits it. So even if there is a lot of extra nitrogen or helium in the mixture that will hit the walls all the time it does not matter as long as the oxygen hits it at a steady rate so it can get absorbed. All the extra innert gas is just there as stuffing to make up the pressure. So yes, you can survive on 0.1% oxygen at 300m because the partial pressure of oxygen would be around the same as in an airplane.</p>
<p>The big issue with deep dives like this is that air under pressure behaves differently. It is much more massive which means it takes quite a lot of effort to move it around. And it creates a lot more friction as it passes over surfaces. Even though it is still a gas it takes on a lot of the properties of a liquid due to its increased mass. And human lungs are not designed to breathe liquid. Similarly equipment such as pumps, valves and hoses works differently with this high pressure air then normal air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As you dive deeper, you are able to use mixes with little oxygen as the pressure is so high that it is enough to survive. </p>
<p>Look up “saturation diving”. Really cool but really dangerous way of deep diving and basically staying down there for days.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
