		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your heart is a muscle. Once you starting working out, or performing any physical activity really, itll go stronger. With a stronger heart you'll see positive changes in your breathing, doing daily tasks (such as chores) will become easier, your digestion, your outlook on life. Healthy heart equals healthy life. But remember it means very little if your diet isnt on par with exercising. </p>
<p>This doesnt even touch the psychological benefits from physical exercise. I cant touch on this because it mess it way up. Someone more equipped could probably touch on this better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You’ll notice things after a few week. But 60 days. I know it’s a long time... but after 60 days the changes are apparent. </p>
<p>Then once youre in a stride and feeling good about your progress, it goes faster. I want to say exponentially faster but im sure it hust feels that way. </p>
<p>Whatever you do, dont stop.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It really depends on what lifestyle changes youre referring to.
Smoking? Quitting smoking at any age drastically improves lung function within days-months. The risk of cancer from the time smoking remains, however.
Heavy drinking? The liver can recuperate. The risk of oral/throat cancer remains.
Exercise? Your heart will thank you. However, for some people with severe heart issues, exercise can actually kill them. Someone in their 30s typically would be fine starting an exercise regimen. To my knowledge, exercise will not reverse the damage done to the heart’s blood supply (coronary arteries), although it will prevent plaque buildup and improve the heart’s supply of oxygen overall.
Eating better? Losing weight will prevent so many diseases including diabetes, high blood pressure, etc.
Mental health? Always a good thing to address to prevent further damage, but years of a stressful life will have certainly taken its toll on the body.
In summary, it is never too late to make changes. Some things cannot be undone, so the earlier you make changes the better!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It would almost be easier to list the negative things that no longer occur because thats a much shorter list.</p>
<p>However 'eating better' is quite ambiguous a phrase that needs proper definition. For most of the problems in the western world, that would simply be 'eating less'.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
