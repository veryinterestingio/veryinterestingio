		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are sound designers who’s job is to comb through archives to find stuff that fits the movie. Not only for songs but things like sound effects too. </p>
<p>It’s a full time job for these people so I’m sure they have techniques to help narrow down the search, but at the end of the day it could just simply be spending hours and hours a week finding music that fits what you’re looking for.</p>
<p>And this doesn’t even mention that some movies will hire artists to make music specifically for that film. Ranging from small time bands to full orchestra composers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The job you’re describing is a Music Supervisor. It’s their responsibility to help bring creative ideas to the table, license them and do it all within a budget. </p>
<p>The producers have the final day of what songs get used, sometimes they already know what they want to use and the music supervisor just has to budget out their desires. </p>
<p>The music supervisor on Breaking Bad was Thomas Golubic and he brought most if not all of the songs to that project. </p>
<p>Music Supervisors get sent music from record labels, publishers, indie artists as well as searching around the web themselves. </p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had been hired in the late 2000's to do this for the intermission for our local city theater.  I spent hours trying to find music that went with the play they were doing, browsing the iTunes catalog.  Bought all the tracks myself and burned a CD (as you did in those days).  Felt like an imposter.  Never asked back, probably because they might have had higher expectations of me than I was prepared to deliver--i should not have been the only sound guy for that place, I was fresh out of one of those audio recording schools.  But hey, I did that thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
