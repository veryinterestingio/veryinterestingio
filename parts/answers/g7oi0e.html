<p>Radio stations use clever techniques to transmit this digital data along with the analog signal. For your car radio it's just two signals. If your radio understands digital encoding, it will know the text is there and display it. If it doesn't then it won't even notice the text.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes you are watching something on TV, like a press conference (topical, right?) and there is a person standing to the side or in a box on the screen doing sign language. You can think of the music you're hearing as the person talking to the cameras and the text about the song as the signer. If you can sign AND hear, you can listen to that person and watch the signer at the same time (this is silly in my example but the point is they can both be doing their thing without taking anything away from the other). If you don't know sign but can still hear you can just ignore the signer (this would be like a radio that can't display the text).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can see the this information in the signal using a spectrum analyser, I believe it’s the closest harmonics either side of the carrier wave.</p>
<p>Could someone let me know if I’m correct?</p>
<p>Also I could take a picture of the signal on a spec-an if anyone would like to see it. We calibrate RF equipment in work but I don’t understand it fully.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>FM works on a concept called deviation. Unlike AM, (which modulates the signal's amplitude thus changing the power levels) FM works by broadening the width of the transmission (overall transmitted power stays the same). In the land mobile radio industry (commercial two-way radio) the maximum modulated frequency is typically around 3,000 Hz meaning that the information (audio or data) of a FM signal can be +/- 3 kHz from the center frequency. With broadcast radio, maximum deviation is 75,000 Hz so information can be encoded +/- 75 kHz. </p>
<p>If you generate a 1,000 Hz tone into a FM transmitter, you can analyze the signal (in the frequency domain) and see the bandwidth +/- 1,000 Hz in the spectrum. The big thing that makes this all work, humans can hear approximately 3,00-24,000 Hz. Anything generated above or below that we can't typically hear. Old LMR systems used to send slow speed data ~(600 bps or less) below the audible range of human hearing (sub-audible data). RDS works the other way, by sending it above the range of human hearing (47 kHz). You should be able to identify these blips on a spectrum analyzer. On a spectrum analyzer, flat signals on the outermost limits of the broadcast channel will also typically suggest the radio station is running HD digital as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
