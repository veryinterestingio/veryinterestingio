		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The starch released into the cooking water stabilizes the froth that you get if you boil it too vigorously. Putting the lid on keeps more heat in so effectively it's like turning up the electricity or gas too high.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Changing boiling-temp water into steam takes a ton of energy, at least as much as heating liquid water up to boiling temp. The phase change itself needs huge energy input.</p>
<p>If the steam is free to escape, it carries all that energy away with it.</p>
<p>If the steam is trapped by a lid, then when it condenses back into liquid it dumps all that  energy right back into the pot. It's like doubling your element's heat setting!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The lid traps heat and steam <del>, building a little pressure, which can lower the boiling point</del> . It may not be a lot, but can be enough.</p>
<p>This then causes the pot to boil more, as it would if just cooked over a higher temperature.</p>
<p>The frothy bubbles come from the starches in the water, giving a little extra strength to the surface tension. This doesnâ€™t have anything to do with the lid, though.</p>
<p>Edit: pressure increases increase boiling point, but pressure on stove top pot not likely to amount to much</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With the lid on the vapor pressure of water in the limited atmosphere reaches its saturation point.  Evaporation is now in approximate equilibrium with condensation.  Without efficient evaporation there is no easy way for the system to shed heat from the burner.  Water skyrockets toward maximum heat capacitance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
