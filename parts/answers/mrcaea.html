<p>Is this something that you look into ?  I know that a lot of histology lab would be interested</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I glanced at the SDS on Sigma. Disposal and seems similar to other organic solvents. Is there an advantage to this solvent over say isopropanol or toluene, when using ~500 mL at a time for analytical work? </p>
<p>I usually pick liquids for surface tension or polarity. My favorite is water, followed by surfactant solutions. But sometimes you canâ€™t avoid an organic solvent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for doing this AMA! As a recent Ph.D. graduate in inorganic chemistry, any discussion of new technology towards sustainability is very  valuable. I have 3 questions.
1) Solvent removal is an important part of using solvent during synthesis &amp; purification. How do you normally isolate the product using Cyrene?
2) What is the applicability of Cyrene in reactions with acids/bases, or reducing/oxidizing agents?
3) Where do you see the biggest breakthrough in biorenewable solvents in the next decade or so?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
