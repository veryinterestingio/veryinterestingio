They found that children attained gender identity earlier in Israel than in the US and Finland. That result implies that it is at least plausible that the native language spoken by individuals could impact gender identity in adults as well.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Seems unlikely to me, given that the presence of gender markers in language isn't correlated with gender equality.  The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis (that language shapes thought) is appealing, but it's pretty much disproved except for some very subtle effects right at the edge of detectability.  Read 'The Language Hoax' by John McWhorter for more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
