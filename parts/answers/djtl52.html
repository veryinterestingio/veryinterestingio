		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both versions are one of many iterations of the letter &quot;Aleph&quot;, which has been around for nearly 4000 years! In its earliest recognizable form it was what we would consider an upside down A, ∀. And if you squint enough, you can see it looks like a bulls head.</p>
<p>In all that time, the letter has gotten stretched and rotated in different ways by different cultures, but mostly keeps the same form of a circle/triangle with 1 or 2 horns sticking out.</p>
<p>The greeks used different fonts for different reasons, and had two common versions, &quot;A&quot; and &quot;a&quot; that you see on your screen. Those versions stuck around the best in western language.</p>
<p>The &quot;a&quot; you actually write out is a latin version. It caught on because cursive highly prioritized letters that wrote from left to right in a single stroke.  Cursive didn't really work well for printing presses and early typewriters, so the greek version stuck in print.</p>
<p>So, like most things, the reason you write the latin version, and type the greek version, is because it's just easier that way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are called the double-storey a and single-storey ɑ. The same applies to lowercase g or 𝑔 variations. </p>
<p>The curve at the top likely comes from how you write the letter in cursive, dragging the pen up to the top of the letter and then back around again.</p>
<p>seen here: 𝓰𝓪</p>
<p>You are right that the single story is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it, especially fonts intended to be read by children, and is also found in italic type.</p>
<p>It's simply a design choice, mostly because the &quot;single storey&quot; is easier and more natural to write, and the &quot;double storey&quot; helps differentiate &quot;a&quot; from lowercase &quot;o&quot; in tiny typesetting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Partly it's fashion. Writing and typography both have fads and fashions just like everything else. There's also how we learn to handwrite and the tools we use. We use pencils and smooth flowing modern pens on smooth paper. Ye olde anciente pens like fountain pens, dip pens, and quills would often spatter if you turned them in a circle or run out of ink if you tried to make a longer mark; they were better at smaller curves and straighter lines. Chalk on slate was also rougher to write on than modern pens and paper. Fingers on tablets will also produce changes in letter shapes as we get more children learning to write like that. And so it goes</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
