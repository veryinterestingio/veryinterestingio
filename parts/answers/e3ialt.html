<p>An attorney at law is someone for whom the law is his profession. This isn't true of all attorneys: &quot;attorney&quot; means something like &quot;representative&quot;; the phrase &quot;attorney at law&quot; is opposed to &quot;attorney in fact&quot;, someone who represents your interests but not in court, like when you give a relative &quot;power of attorney&quot; in case you are incapacitated. Today we usually say &quot;agent&quot; to avoid a potentially misleading use of the word &quot;attorney.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
