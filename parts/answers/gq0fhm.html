		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just in case you're interested in rough numbers on the telescope:</p>
<ul>
<li>wavelength of light: 5&times;10^(&minus;7)&#8239;m</li>
<li>66 million light years: 6&times;10^(23)&#8239;m</li>
<li>size of object to see: 1&#8239;m</li>
</ul>
<p>multiplying and dividing we get the diameter of the telescope needed:</p>
<ul>
<li>3&times;10^(17)&#8239;m</li>
</ul>
<p>Which is 30 light years.  Imagine trying to construct a mirror or lens 30 light years across!  And that's just for 1 metre resolution, which will make a very blurry picture of a dinosaur.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>And because answers have to be longer... the same is true when we look out at things. Much of our night sky is probably long dead and gone, but because of how vast the distances, we wouldn't see the deaths of celestial bodies for eons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but the telescope would have to be enormous.  Like the size of a large planet, maybe larger.</p>
<p>At that distance, with a normal telescope you might see one photon hitting your telescope every so often.  So with just one occasional dot of light, you can't make out dinosaurs or anything else.</p>
<p>To get enough dots of light to make out any detail would require a telescope so large that its gravity would crush the inside of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
