		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it's more accurate to say that what you experience is turned into a pattern of excitation of neurons, so the pattern of firing neurons encodes the patterns of the experience.  The &quot;chemicals&quot;, or neurotransmitters, are just the carriers of excitation between neurons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another way to look at it:</p>
<p>With computers, all information is encoded into series of binary units.</p>
<p>Brains just use another method of encoding, patterns of neuron connections. </p>
<p>As I understand it, the exact rules of that encoding scheme are not well understood. But on a systemic level, it works on a system of comparing and contrasting various patterns. If you're trying to think of a specific make of car, a bunch of patterns concerning cars which you've built up get referenced and compared until the attributes of the specific make of car are found, which then is already heavily associated with the pattern that encodes your memory of the name of that make. Gull wing doors and unpainted steel associates with an image of the car from back to the future -&gt; delorean.</p>
<p>So in that way the brain can be considered a comparator engine or if that's too technical, an association machine. Every particular thing is defined by all the other things its associated with, and the pattern of those associations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This isn't a question that science really knows. It's called the hard problem of consciousness. It can be seen how certain activities excite what neurons and interpolate what chemical reactions are made, but nobody really knows at what point they become the experience we have. Regarding memory and recall being nothing more than a chemical process - that's something that can be explained. But the experience of that memory when we're thinking does not currently have an explanation.</p>
<p>There's something of a disconnect between what happens in the brain and how it turns into a tangible experience like sound or visuals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
