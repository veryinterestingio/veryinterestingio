<p>The &quot;throwing&quot; is just the brains of the people watching assuming that the thing that looks like it's talking is doing the talking.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Voice throwing is changing your voice in such a way as to make it sound like someone speaking from a distance.  Just about anyone can change their voice to speak in a low tone or a high squeaky tone.  Voice throwers do something similar and just change the tone to make it sound far off.  I don’t think it has to involve echoing, since the only time I’ve heard someone do was outdoors in a completely open area.  </p>
<p>It was pretty funny actually.  This guy had my dad completely fooled as he kept making it sound like someone far off was yelling “hey Jack!”   My sister and I figured it out after a couple times that he did it but my dad was clueless.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Throwing&quot; their voice is a term used to describe what a ventriloquist does. Nothing is actually &quot;thrown&quot;, it just means that the ventriloquist is attempting to make it appear as though the sound is coming from the dummy by speaking without moving their lips. Because the dummy is sitting off to the side, the image is one of the voice being &quot;thrown&quot; across the gap between them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
