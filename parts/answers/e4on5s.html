A 9V battery still doesn't overcome the skin resistance, but place it on your tongue (wet, and mucous membrane NOT skin) and you'll feel it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's just not enough voltage to feel a shock. Even a 12v car battery won't actually shock you if you touch both terminals unless your hands are wet, but you might feel a slight tingle. That trope in movies where someone gets tortured with a car battery is fake.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>relatively low voltage.<br />
AA batteries will try to deliver 1.5 volts. if you connected six of them together you could probably get a shock/buzz similar to a 9V battery. Although that also depends on other factors like conductivity, think of the difference between using your fingers or using your tongue to connect the ends of a 9V battery... it clearly feels different, and that's down the conductivity of the points used to connect the terminals of the battery.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
