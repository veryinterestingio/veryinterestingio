		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Inside of your computer is a &quot;smaller computer&quot; (usually called an &quot;embedded controller&quot;) that is always on, even when the rest of the computer is completely off. It does things like keeping track of time (note that the clock on your computer doesn't reset even when you unplug it), handles the power button, often also power/hard drive/battery LEDs, fans, etc. It also manages power delivery to various components and can talk to the rest of your computer. When you tell the computer to reboot, the EC switches everything off, but knows to switch everything on again later.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your computer has more processors than just your CPU. The motherboard is covered in little processors that each do different jobs. The motherboard also draws power from the Power Supply Unit even when the main CPU is powered down.</p>
<p>When you press your 'ON' button, an electric shock hits an ACPI module on your motherboard that initiates the bootup process. ACPI is a sort of design agreement for how to manipulate the power in the motherboard.</p>
<p>When you tell your computer to reboot, your Operating System shuts down as usual, and then instead of sending a 'turn me off' signal to the ACPI module, it sends a 'reboot' signal. ACPI cuts power to the CPU, RAM, and rest of the computer as usual, and then it begins a new bootup process.</p>
<p>You can also set up most computer to Wake-On-LAN, which is when a computer is connected by an Ethernet cable to a network, and a specific set of signals sent across that wire will be relayed from the Ethernet port to the ACPI module, which then starts booting up the PC.</p>
<p>There are also settings for ACPI on how to handle power failures. Let's say there is a power outage and you've got a battery backup that is connected to your computer, so when the battery gets low it sends a shutdown signal to the OS. The OS closes all of the processes, and then asks the ACPI module on the motherboard to shut down power. When power is restored, the UPS doesn't send any information to the computer, because the computer has been shut down. But the motherboard is receiving power again. If the ACPI module has the setting toggled, it can send an 'ON' signal to the rest of the computer just as if the 'ON' button had been pushed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>EDIT: when I posted this there were only a few not so accurate comments in the thread, lots of good info here now :D</p>
<p><del>So much bad information in this thread... It does restart all the way (not halfway like some people seem to suggest).</del> This is why you see the bios etc on reboot.</p>
<p>Anyways a TLDR copied from <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/294681/how-does-a-computer-restart-itself" target="_blank">here:</a></p>
<p><code>power states in your computer are controlled by an implementation of ACPI (advanced configuration and power interface). At the end of a shutdown process, your operating system sets an ACPI command indicating that the computer should reboot. In response, the motherboard resets all components using their respective reset commands or lines, and then follows the bootstrap process. The motherboard never actually turns off, it only resets various components and then behaves as if the power button has just been pressed.</code></p>
<p>The only difference between shutdown and reboot is at the end of the OS's shutdown process, which ACPI command is called. (turn off power vs reset) Note sleep/hibernating are a different beast altogether.</p>
<p>If you're interested in further reading, &quot;ACPI&quot; is what to google.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The top answer right now seems a bit over technical and not ELI5 to me. Essentially your computer never turns 100% off. There is a constant flow of a tiny amount of power from your bios battery. When your motherboard gets the command to shut off it shuts down all the main components but still keeps the tiny bit of power needed to start the bios. Restart just does that but then immediately turns all the main components back on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know how when you go to sleep, you can’t move or see or smell things? But then you wake up and can do all those things again. Your brain turns off all the things you do when you’re awake, but your brain also remembers to wake you up. </p>
<p>When you press the restart button on a computer, everything turns off, but there’s a small piece of the computer always powered by a little battery that remembers to turn everything back on again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
