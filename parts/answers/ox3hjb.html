		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The issue is that the prefix &quot;in-&quot; has two different meanings. It is most commonly known as meaning &quot;not&quot;  as &quot;inaudible&quot; (in- audi -ble, &quot;not able to be heard&quot;). But it also means &quot;in, into&quot; in such words as &quot;inquiry&quot; (in- query, &quot;ask into&quot;).</p>
<p>So here, &quot;inflammable&quot; isn't meant to be parsed as in-(flammable) as in &quot;not able to set on fire&quot; but rather (inflamm)-able as in, &quot;able to be inflamed.&quot; After all, you might have heard the word &quot;inflame&quot; and understand it to meant to set something on fire or to make a fire bigger. (Where inflame comes from in- flame with &quot;in-&quot; taking on the second meaning, e.g. &quot;to put into flames&quot;).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As it's been mentioned the prefix in has two different meanings. To understand you need to understand the etymology of these words. I'll try to keep it eli5:</p>
<p>First of all, let's set forth the English definitions. </p>
<p>Flammable = easily set on fire.</p>
<p>Nonflammable = not easily set on fire.</p>
<p>Inflammable = flammable. Now, some dictionaries or people/professions may say it means nonflammable but that's a modern re-defining of it so I will ignore that for this.</p>
<p>There are two Latin words at the heart of this all. In Latin, flammāre (flammō among other conjugated forms) means to set on fire (from flamma for flame). Inflammāre is a synonym in Latin, maybe with a more &quot;doing&quot; connotation because of the in- prefix. So, both of these mean to set on fire in Latin.</p>
<p>The English word inflammable is from the Latin inflammāre simply using the English -able suffix which makes something an adjective that can be done. So, is set on fire-able.</p>
<p>Flammable is a back-formation of inflammable to prevent confusion. Why? Because in Latin, the in- prefix has 2 meanings. One, in the &quot;doing at&quot; connotation as in inflammāre. Two, a &quot;not&quot; connotation as in for example infīnītus (where we get infinite), aka not fīnītus (finite).</p>
<p>Finally, nonflammable is simply an English compound from flammable, using the prefix non which means not. So, not flammable (or not inflammable, whatever floats your boat).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
