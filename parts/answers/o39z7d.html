<p>This study briefly describes an observed difference in functional impairment due to misophonia between American students and Chinese students.</p>
<p>&quot;Average annoyance ratings of misophonic sound categories (e.g., eating, throat, nasal, repetitive sounds) and misophonia prevalence were similar between both studies. However, correlations between misophonia symptoms and functional impairment were lower in the Chinese students than in the American students.&quot;</p>
<p>It's the only source that I could find that even mentioned cultural differences, and it wasn't the main focus of the study. It was more of a &quot;this thing we noticed probably deserves more investigation.&quot;</p>
<p>So right now, it looks like we just haven't done enough research to know.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
