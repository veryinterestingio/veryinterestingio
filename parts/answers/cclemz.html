		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Human reproductive system is complicated, especially the part women play in it. Women's whole bodies are basically dedicated to sustaining the complex system required for the development of the fetus.  This is controlled by hormones, after puberty, these hormones will change everything everything in their bodies. Immune system, metabolism, circulatory system, and neurology.  Ovulation puts all these systems in to overdrive, then having period brings them out from overdrive, for some women this contrast is really extreme and can cause them other issues, due to hormones.  </p>
<p>Hormonal birth control, depending on the kind and amounts being used, disturbs the hormonal cycle, and normalizes the hormone levels to closer to a base level. Now this doesn't work universally for every woman, but generally it does. Some women do get side-effects, even really severe ones.  </p>
<p>Generally people don't understand how powerful hormones actually are.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically the female reproductive cycle involves big transitions between modes. Ovulating and getting ready to invest energy into a particular egg is a whole different project than sloughing off tissues and ejecting that same egg and preparing for the next one to come out. Pregnancy has a whole different game plan than non-pregnant life. </p>
<p>To make an analogy, during WW2 a bunch of factories got re-tooled to produce tanks instead of refrigerators and so on and so forth. This process took years and is part of what historians call “mobilization”. It’s a huge shift in goals and investment channels, and takes a big expenditure of energy.  </p>
<p>The monthly female reproductive cycle involves big shifts in hormones that trigger big changes in gene expression and cellular activity, as the body shifts gears and heads toward different goals. Attracting a mate is a whole different ball game than gestating a child, and the reproductive system switches between these two as part of the cycle.  </p>
<p>Hormonal birth control works by mostly suppressing theses changes. It’s like instead of the US economy going into a war footing it just stays in one mode.  </p>
<p>Because there’s substantially less transformation going on, there is much less that can go wrong.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
