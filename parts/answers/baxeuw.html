		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To answer this question, you need to consider the third ingredient of frosting, sugar. Sugar has a desiccating effect. This hyper dry state greatly reduced the potential for growth of germs, fungus, etc... This is why a lot of sugary syrups don't require refrigeration.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You should actually be refrigerating cream cheese frosting, but other frostings have enough sugar to water ratio to prevent spoiling (as explained by others in this thread). Cream cheese frosting in particular spoils pretty fast so you shouldn't be leaving it out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
