		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You read a book and, when you've read it, associate it with the concept of &quot;having read&quot; it. Even if you forget you've read it, your knowledge of details of it will allow you to assume that you have read it.</p>
<p>This doesn't work the other way around, since concept association is generally more strong one way than the other (see: active v.s. passive vocabulary) and there aren't mental tricks you can use to easily generate lists. You'll find yourself thinking of random books and checking whether you've read them, unless you regularly enumerate which books you've read enough to build up an association in that direction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s just a matter of recall vs recognition. It’s the same reason we prefer multiple choice exams because we think we will be able to recognize the appropriate answer rather than having to remember it off the top of our head. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Roughly speaking, our memory works by reacting to a stimulus. There is no circuit in our brain storing each book you have ever read, but rather when you hear the book's name, it evokes memories of seeing/buying/reading/interacting with that book. Barsalou wrote about this in a much better way than I could ever explain (<a href="http://matt.colorado.edu/teaching/highcog/readings/b8.pdf" target="_blank"><a href="http://matt.colorado.edu/teaching/highcog/readings/b8.pdf" target="_blank">http://matt.colorado.edu/teaching/highcog/readings/b8.pdf</a></a>), but this is quite a tough read I am afraid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a very contrived explanation:</p>
<p>The brain works as a very high-dimensional network. Information is not actually _stored_ anywhere. It's implicitly represented by neural path activations. Imagine &quot;car&quot; means a specific web of neural pathways is activated in a very specific way. You change one or two of those paths, and you get something you have associated as being close/related to car, but not a car itself. So, if you activate the web for &quot;all the books&quot; you can only get the ones which have a reasonable similarity to those activations because it takes your brain time and effort to switch &quot;webs&quot;. So it's not as simple as retrieving recorded information as we do with computers. You have to actually activate the correct webs. If you've made a stronger association between a particular book with some other web pattern than you have the one that you're currently activating, the chance of recall goes down drastically.</p>
<p>Now, there's *tons* to nitpick about this explanation. But, at a pretty simple level, this gives you the basic idea of how memory, and indeed many other things, works in the brain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way memory is stored, if you are given a cue as to what it is you are trying to remember, you will have an easier time accessing that memory. It is similar to someone asking you to remember something from your childhood and you can only remember after a  sibling gives you a hint, like what you were wearing or what kind of cake you ate, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
