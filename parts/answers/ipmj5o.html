		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Excellent question!! The main answer is emulsifiers. The answers about homogenization are great but the main reason fat is able to stay in water at all is because of proteins and other emulsifiers in the milk. Proteins can have water attracting and water repelling regions. The fat sticks to the water repelling side and uses the protein as a &quot;raft&quot; of sorts. There are tons of vitamins and minerals that need to emulsified to be water soluble. Worth thinking about the fact that 99.99% of chemical processes in the body happen in solution.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s a Pickering emulsion, with the interfacial tension between the two phases stabilized by protein in the milk. The protein on one side likes the fat, and the other likes the water. It’s like a tiny fat bubble with a protein shell. They are really small, and a lot of them.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Milk employs structures called micelles*^(edit below), which are the same basic design as blood lipoproteins aka &quot;cholesterol&quot;. The outer membrane is composed of phospholipids, cholesterol, and proteins, forming a hydrophilic outer boundary which allows the structure to suspend in water, while the inner boundary is lipophilic and carries tightly packed lipids, mostly triglycerides.</p>
<p>Homogenization breaks and reassembles these into smaller, more stable micelles, which can suspend colloidally without floating to the top. Churning cream breaks these micelles without reassembling them, causing the lipids to form a solid, largely hydrophobic mass, butter.</p>
<p>*based on replies I've learned milkfat actually employs lipid trilayers rather than monolayers, effectively a micelle wrapped in a cell membrane (lipid bilayer). The function is the same but the structure is more complex.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
