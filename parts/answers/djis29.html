<p>If the ACA didn't mandate it, it wouldn't be paid 100%. Trump added a religious exception, but <a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/womens-guidelines/index.html#2" target="_blank">normally all FDA approved contraceptive methods must be covered. Including voluntary sterilization.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The rationale is fairly straightforward.  If a women gets pregnant, that is a health issue for the woman - the insured person is the person's whose health is protected.  When you get a vasectomy as the insured person, your health is not protected.  It's 100% risk (procedure) and no prevention (for the insured party).  </p>
<p>The insurance company incurs no obligation for health costs of the person <em>you make</em> pregnant, just of the insured themselves.</p>
<p>Edit:  Yes, I typo'd women instead of woman. SORRY! And...no, you haven't educated me on what is proper. Holy crap people love to pounce.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ACA requires that tubal ligations be 100% covered, as it is preventative care in the form of permanent birth control. I don't believe that vasectomies need to be covered under the ACA. Your insurance is likely doing the bare minimum requirements in order to meet ACA standards.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also, your plan is skewed on this one. My husband's vasectomy was far cheaper than my IUD insertion was, his costing next to nothing and mine costing hundreds. </p>
<p>American healthcare is essentially a shitty gameshow and we're all the losers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's quite simple really.</p>
<p>You can't get pregnant.</p>
<p>Just because you get clipped doesn't mean that she can't.</p>
<p>If the insurance company's goal is to reduce claims by reducing the number of pregnancies, they'll do a much better job of that by paying for women to get their tubes tied than they will by paying for men to get clipped.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
