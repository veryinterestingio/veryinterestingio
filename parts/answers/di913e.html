		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The effect DMT (and other psychedelics) has on the brain is not very well understood at all. As a result, those who haven't ever tried DMT will typically give a skeptical and minimalist explanation based on the very little research available, whereas those who have tried DMT will typically say some shit they couldn't possibly know.</p>
<p>The answer to your question is basically, we currently do not know.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine getting into a car crash, fighting for your life and overcome this situation.</p>
<p>You are now aware of how short your life is, how close and permanent death is.</p>
<p>You start to think in a totally new perpective about your life, influences and appreciate the moment while questioning what your life is actually about.</p>
<p>This one situation changed your life forever.</p>
<p>And psychadelics can have the same impact on you, they take your mind to a diffrent place, you expierince something about yourself, while your perspective, impressions, yourself, are all changed and the whole thing you expierienced will stay as a memory for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>tl:dr you learn something about yourself, the information from that can change your life</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5: psychedelics reset your thought process and your consciousness to be like new again. It’s like restarting a computer.</p>
<p>ELI20: Michael Pollan does a good job summarizing one theory on this in his book “How to Change Your Mind.”</p>
<p>Psychedelics break down your Default Mode Network (DMN) which is your brain’s typical process for interpreting the information your senses are receiving.</p>
<p>Your DMN is your typical sober state of consciousness. It gets very well-worn to the point where you develop your instinctive interpretations of information, which is good and bad. The good is that it helps for survival. The bad is that your get susceptible to falling into negative thought loops (ruminating thought loops about the past (depression) or worrying thought loops about the future (anxiety)).</p>
<p>Psychedelics dissolve the DMN so that your brain functions like new again. The sensation is like being reborn and seeing things for the first time. Many people find that they appreciate things like a child does, including mundane things that the DMN would ignore as not important for survival. Suddenly, you’re mentally rejuvenated.</p>
<p>It’s kind of like when you go on vacation in a foreign place. Suddenly, very simple tasks (go to the store, use transportation, order food) become fascinating in a new language and new culture. Hence why taking psychedelics is likened to “taking a trip.”</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the biggest life changing effect is ego death. Some people become more introverted as a result or can feel introverted and ghost-like for a while until you live your life normal and build your ego up again. Some people might have felt this way already and ego death reset their ego and made it easier to establish confidence in an opposite way. Ego death isnt limited to dmt or psychedelics. Traumatic life events like a bad car crash can make you feel the same ego reset</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
