		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the problem is you are thinking of &quot;infinite&quot; to be &quot;a very big number&quot;.  It is not a very big number, it's a different kind of thing.  A similar problem exists with zero, in that it's not just &quot;a really small number&quot;, it's actually zero.  For example if I take a really small number like 0.0000001 and double it, I get 0.0000002.  If I take 0 and double it, I still get zero.  2x0 is not bigger than 1x0.  If I have an infinite number of numbers between 0 and 1, then they are separated by 0.  If I double all of those numbers, then they are separated by 2x0, so they are still separated by 0.</p>
<p>Edit: thanks for the kind words and shiny tokens of appreciation.  This is now my second highest voted post after a well timed Hot Fuzz quote, I guess that's what reddit is like.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's a way to see that there are the same &quot;size&quot;. We're going to show that for each number between 0 and 1, there exists a number between 0 and 2, and vice versa.</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick any number between 0 and 1.</li>
<li>Multiply it by 2.</li>
<li>You now have a number between 0 and 2.</li>
<li>Vice versa, pick any number between 0 and 2</li>
<li>Divide it by 2.</li>
<li>You now ave a number between 0 and 1.</li>
</ol>
<p>This works both for the case of rational and real numbers. We just constructed a so-called bijection between the intervals [0,1] and [0,2].</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The thing which helped me wrap my head around it (as much as I have) was when it was explained to me that infinity is not a number. Being infinite is a property of a set. </p>
<p>So if you consider it as a different property - like “blue”, or “hot” - it makes more sense. You can’t count to blue, and whether one set is bigger than another doesn’t affect whether it is blue or not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your intuition for size comes from the structure of intervals, rather than the amount of elements they have. The intervals [0, 1] and [0, 2] have the same quantity of points, because you can pair them up. However, the interval [0, 2] is twice as long as the interval [0, 1]. The particular elements within [0, 2] and their relation to each other is what gives it that length, not the amount of elements.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The concept of size that’s used for infinite sets is basically this: Two sets are the same size if you can pair the members from one up with the members of the other with no leftovers. You can do that with the two sets OP asked about, so they’re actually the same size. But you can’t do that with the set of all integers and the set of all numbers between 0 and 1.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
