		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The standard driveline setup for a common transfer case has the rear axle (back to wheels) as the main output because it's already inline. The front axle is usually engaged via a chain in somewhat of the same process as a gear on a bicycle. Once that happens engine power is delivered to the front and back until the chain is walked off.</p>
<p>Again this is standard practice and I'm sure there are unique designs out there that operate differently</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's for traction. With 1000 lbs of rocks in your truck bed, the rear wheels have a lot more weight on them than the front wheels, same if you're towing anything. More weight = less slipping = driving up steeper hills. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To really simplify this for you, the engine and transmission point towards the rear of the vehicle, so because it is logical, and also in an effort to reduce power loss through additional components, it drives the rear axle first and foremost. There is a transfercase that it attached to the end of the transmission, and when engaged, it will allow power to be transferred to the front axle as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the 2wd versions are standard rwd layout. The transfer case just goes between the joint from the transmission to the driveshaft and splits some power out for the front axle. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
