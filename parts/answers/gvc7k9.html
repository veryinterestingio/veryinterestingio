<blockquote>
<p>The rate of fatal police shootings per million was 10.13 for Native Americans, 6.6 for black people, 3.23 for Hispanics; 2.9 for white people and 1.17 for Asians.</p>

<p>When accounting for poverty / wealth, racial bias practically disappears. </p>

<p>If these are accurate, then it brings up a couple of questions to me. Why is there still a large discrepancy in poverty levels in the different races and ethnicities in the US? Why does poverty lead to crime in such a large degree? If reducing poverty reduces crime rates and police homicides, can we decrease the poverty level without dragging the rest of the nation down?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Iâ€™m curious what the numbers would look like if you factored in socioeconomic status. For example, Blacks vs Whites who make less than 25,000 a year, or something to that effect. It would be hard to argue against racial bias at that point if the numbers still looked similar to those in this graph.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
