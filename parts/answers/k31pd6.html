		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Calling cancer &quot;cancer &quot; is kinda like saying you broke a computer. You didn't describe in anywhere near enough detail. how you did it. What broke? How severe? Is the damage widespread? Did we figure it was broken before it became catastrophic? </p>
<p>I had stage 4 leukemia, which isn't anywhere close to describing what happened to me. The actual disease i had was described to me as &quot;burkitts cell leukemia, cns positive&quot; while the leukemia portion was labeled &quot;acute lymphoblastic&quot; every single word in those phrases alone is serious and combined together is practically a death sentence with the exception of one word: burkitts. My version of leukemia, while severe and very insanely deadly if left untreated, had a 90 percent survival rate if treated. I was a healthy man, cancer free, less than a year after diagnosis. The diseases all describe the generic issue of defective cells' DNA causing them to replicate out of control, but <em>how</em> they do that is a completely different matter all together.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They really are different. Cells can grow out of control (this is what causes cancer) due to many possible defects, which could cause their growth to be different. And they’re different types of cells in the first place which has a very big effect too.</p>
<p>Cancers spread and need to be treated differently and this isn’t just because of where they’re located. We will never have “a cure for cancer” because of this— it’s not one disease likely to have one cure. At the same time, we have good or excellent treatments for certain types of cancer, so there are “cures” out there and more being developed all the time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other people have already fairly well explained the different cancers. Here’s how I conceptualize them:</p>
<p>They are about as unique as people. What I mean by that, is that the outline is the same, and the devils lie in the details. All humans are born the same way, as are cancers (sexual reproduction is to humans as damaged, unchecked replicating DNA is to cancer). The type of cancer a specific cancer is, is like a personality is to a person. You remove the personality/type of cancer, and you have mostly identical things. Humans: a walking, talking, bipedal hominid with 5 fingers/toes on each hand and foot. Cancer is a broken gene sequence that cannot stop self-replicating and eventually sucks away all the bodies vitamins and other nutrients.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cars can break down in different ways.  On the surface they are still not okay to drive.  But the specific type of broken can vary.   It may be the starter.  It may be the brakes.   It may be the fuel pump.  All are unique but the result is the same.   Sort of like that.  </p>
<p>Cells in different parts or systems of the body go haywire.  Which systems and the means by which they break determines severity and treatability.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
