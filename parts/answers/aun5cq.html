		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most regular types of glue just harden as water or solvent in them evaporates. If you want to glue something really well, you have to stick it really tight together with a clamp and let it cure for a bit.</p>
<p>Superglue however doesn't need to dry out. Instead, it &quot;polymerizes&quot; - that means the individual liquid molecules start attaching to each other until they become a solid. This reaction is triggered by moisture in the air, and happens so quickly that you don't need to hold it clamped for hours.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
