		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Look at 2 dots. How many straight lines can be drawn between them? Only one.</p>
<p>Now add another dot to give you 3. How many straight lines can you draw between all the dots? Three</p>
<p>Four dots? Six.</p>
<p>Five dots? Ten</p>
<p>Six dots? Fifteen.</p>
<p>See the pattern? 1, 3, 6, 10, 15. . . You have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number" target="_blank">Triangular number</a>. If you have 23 dots, there are 253 straight lines that can be drawn between all the dots, since 253 is the 23^rd number in the triangular sequence.</p>
<p>Now how does this relate to the birthday paradox?</p>
<p>Take two people. You're simply seeing if A has the same birthday as B. There's one relationship you need to look at.</p>
<p>Now with three people, you need to see if A has the same b-day as B, if A has the same b-day as C and if B has the same b-day as C. You're now looking at three relationships to see if there's a match.</p>
<p>With four people you look at AB, AC, AD, BC, BD &amp; CD or six relationships for a possible match.</p>
<p>Every person you add increases the number of relationships (by the triangular number sequence) you need to examine to see if the people involved have the same birthday.</p>
<p>To figure out the combined probability of multiple people having the same birthday, it's easier to look at the odds of <strong>NOT</strong> having the same birthday and subtract that by 100%. So with two people the odds of them not sharing a birthday are 364/365 = 0.9973 or a 99.73% chance. Subtract this from 100% and there is a 0.0027 or 0.27% chance they do share a birthday.</p>
<p>For three people, the odds that AB don't share a birthday is still 364/365, he odds for AC is also 364/365, and the odds for AC is also 364/365. To figure out the odds of NONE OF THEM SHARING THE SAME BIRTHDAY, simply multiply them together to give you (364 x 364 x 364)/(365 x 365 x 365),  which is the same as (364/365)^3 = 0.9918. So the odds of NOT having the same birthday is 99.18%. That means the odds of having the same birthday is 100 - 99.18 = 0.82%</p>
<p>Add another person and the odds of NOT having the same birthday is (364/365)^6 = 0.9837. Making the odds of anyone sharing a birthday 1.63%</p>
<p>Five people? (364/365)^10 = 0.9729 or 97.29%, which means the chances of anyone sharing a birthday is 2.71%</p>
<p>Six people? (364/365)^15 = 95.97%, which means probability of anyone sharing a birthday is 4.03%.</p>
<p>By the time you have 23 people and are examining 253 relationships to see if any of them match, you have (364/365)^253 = 49.95% of nobody sharing the same birthday. That means that there is a 50.05% chance at least two people in that group have the same birthday.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You feel like there's a 1 in 365 chance that another person has the same birthday as you. And you'd be (roughly) correct.</p>
<p>If there were two other people, you'd feel like there's a 2 in 365 chance that one of the has the same birthday as you. And you'd be (roughly) correct.</p>
<p>Following that pattern in your head you'd feel like in a group of 30 people, there'd be roughly a 1 in 12 chance that someone has the same birthday as you. And you'd be roughly correct.</p>
<p>However, the paradox isn't that in a group of people, someone has the same birthday as you. It's that any two people might have the same birthday. That's where our intuition completely breaks down.</p>
<p>You might start to think... If there's a 1 in 12 chance that someone had the same birthday as me, there's also a 1 in 12 chance that someone has the same birthday as Greg, and a 1 in 12 chance that someone has the same birthday as Lucy, and so on for all 30 people. Then you might try to add them all together, and find that there is a 300% chance of people having the same birthday. Which is clearly wrong.</p>
<p>So how should we think about this? Instead of trying to figure out the chance of two people having the same birthday, we should think about the chance that nobody has the same birthday.</p>
<p>With two people there's a 364 in 365 chance that they don't have the same birthday. Assuming two people don't share a birthday, if we add a third person there's a 363 in 365 chance (because 2 days are already taken) that they don't share a birthday with either of them. So we calculate 364/365 (probability the first two don't share a birthday) times 363/365 (probability that the third person also doesn't share a birthday), or around 99%. Therefore, there's a 1% chance that they share a birthday. And for the 4th person, the additional chance is 362/365  that they don't share a birthday, the 5th is 361/365, and so on. At the 7th person, we have a 95% chance that nobody has the same birthday (and therefore a 5% chance two people do). And by the time we get to 23, the math works out that the probability of two people having the same birthday is greater that 50%.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The birthday paradox is about the probability that one pair of people has the same birthday in a group of people. I personally don't consider it a paradox as once someone has explained it, it is really simple to understand. </p>
<p>The mistake is that when thinking of sharing birthdays, people incorrectly tend to compare everyone else's birthday to only theirs. So if there are 20 other people in the room, you think there are 20 birthday pairs, which is a pretty low probability of a birthday match.</p>
<p>However, in this case you are forgetting all of the possible pairs between two people who aren't you. Including these, so there are 210 birthday pairs (21 * 20 / 2), which is a pretty high probability that at least one of those is a birthday match.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If a 20-sided die were rolled to get a number, how many additional rolls would have to be made before that number was rolled again... it would be about 10 additional rolls on average.</p>
<p>But if the 20-side die were rolled multiple times, and each time the number was written down, how many rolls would have to be made before a number was written down twice... it would be fewer than 10 on average.</p>
<p>The birthday paradox is the same. It feels like 183 people are needed for two to have a 50% chance of having the same birthday, but it only needs 23 because it's not two specific people matching, it's <em>any</em> two out of the 23.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m so late but I felt like writing up how I think about this, hope it helps someone!</p>
<p>First, the reason this feels weird is because it’s not about just you and your birthday matching with someone, it’s about <em>any</em> two people matching. With 23 people in the room that might still seem like low odds, that’s still only 23 birthdays, right? A year is 365 days, not even 10% of birthdays are covered! But again, it’s not just about your birthday. We have to look at matching and how that actually works (and why the numbers get so big so fast). </p>
<p>Put all 23 people in a line holding a sign with their birthday on it, you’re at the front. Walk down the line and look for a match. That’s 22 times checking. Not great odds, probably no match, but still a small chance. No? Oh well, you go sit down. </p>
<p>But the game isn’t over!! It’s not about you, it’s about <em>any</em> match in the room!</p>
<p>The next person now walks the line and looks at every sign. That’s 21 times. Now we’ve asked 43 times total. No match? Next. </p>
<p>20 times asking. 63 times total. That’s over two months of comparisons. </p>
<p>Keep doing this and by the time you’re done it’s 253 times you’ve asked if a birthday matches. Maybe five or ten or fifteen people are sitting down after missing on 100+ birthday comparisons, but if person 16 and 19 in line match, that’s all that matters. We just needed the one match!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
