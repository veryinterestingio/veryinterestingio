Chameleons change colour by changing the space between the guanine crystals, which changes the wavelength of light reflected off the crystals which changes the colour of the skin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just a little side-note to get a better understanding of the other answers: the extent to which chameleons can change colors is much exaggerated by media and pop culture and TV ads. It's still stupid amazing but maybe not as much as you think it is based on where you first saw it.</p>
<p>Two prominent examples <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMT1FLzEn9I" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMT1FLzEn9I</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihue9R8m6FA" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihue9R8m6FA</a></p>
<hr />
<p>148 points and a few questions so it's worth a PS: </p>
<p>those are examples for FAKED videos, NOT REAL ones. </p>
<p>For &quot;real&quot; videos, go to YouTube and check for videos that do not have 6 figures worth of views.

<p>Think of it as our face turning red when we are uncomfortable or under pressure. Like I said, it really is more interesting than that but it's not as interesting as it were if they all could do it on purpose to blend in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Here is the open acces article with very nice pictures and photographs of the crystals that determine the colour of the chameleon. Distance between the crystals can be altered, leading to colour change (different wavelengths are reflected back at varying distances between the crystals).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
