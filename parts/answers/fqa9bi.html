		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a pretty interesting question, but so far there has been no citing of the literature. I looked into it (as a very bored recently graduated PhD with nothing to do during the coronavirus outbreak and a vast catalog of available research at my fingertips) and the answer is actually pretty elegant! Cited from:  <a href="https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1016/j.cub.2012.02.048" target="_blank"><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2012.02.048" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2012.02.048</a></a></p>
<p>This first question is whether or not action potential velocity is dependent on animal size. One could imagine that larger animals may have evolved more rapid firing time. It turns out this is not the case: &quot;Myelinated nerve action potential velocity is essentially independent of animal size and ranges from 10 to 55 m/s. Using a value of 30 m/s, toe to spinal cord transit time would be 1 ms in mice vs. 50 ms in horses, perhaps twice that to the brain; round trip 2 ms vs. 100 ms (spinal cord) and 4 ms vs. 200 ms (brain). Turning motor nerve action potentials into muscle contractions takes another 40 to 50 ms.&quot;</p>
<p>From this alone, one would expect that larger animals would have slower reaction times than smaller animals. However, this longer action potential time goes alongside longer limbs which have a longer period of motion. My understanding of a period of motion is the time to complete one full stride. The cited study found a general trend between animal size and stride period. Because of this, the larger animal can use the time between each stride to adjust, meaning that their reaction time is in effect not any slower because they literally have more time to react. &quot;Gallop period for mice is 130 ms and for horses is 600 ms. Mice thus have about 78 ms and horses 450 ms for spinal-based calculations, and 76 and 350 ms for brain-based calculations, to alter leg movements in single locomotor cycles.&quot;</p>
<p>In summary, yes it takes more time for nerves to send information to and from the limbs, but the larger animal has a longer stride which allows them to compensate for this increase in firing time.</p>
<p>Edit: added summary and fixed grammar.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The nerv signal speeds are largely the same in most animals.<br />
However, most animals most basic funtions are regulated by the brainstem that controls some muscle memory, auto responses and refleces. (such as breathing and other stuff - a famous example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_the_Headless_Chicken" target="_blank">Mike the headless chicken</a>)<br />
Many larger animals have &quot;lumps&quot;(mini brains/nerv bundles) that assists or can take over thoes functions.<br />
We allso all have a so-called &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut%E2%80%93brain_axis" target="_blank">Gut Brain</a>&quot;<br />
In short, if something can be automated, the body has found a way to automate it (when needed), but just as you breathe automaticly and manualy, the &quot;minibrains&quot; can be overriden to varius degree. (meditation, mind over matter, spiritual shanagans and all that stuff are properly trained/learned by strenghtening the connections between the (semi)automatic systems in the body and your brain - same way as when you practice a skill, neurons connections getting larger in the brain) -&gt; much more research is needed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nerves are incredibly well-insulated for protection of the amplitude of the neuron action potential, as it travels from one node of Ranvier to the next. The delayed reaction time is very likely the result of larger masses in motion requiring more time for mechanical action to take place. There’s actually a law for this, related to mass inertia.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
