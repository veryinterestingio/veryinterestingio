		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>u/somewhat_random touches on some important factors - even if a submarine has a sealed compartment, these seals will eventually fail. Water is quite capable at, with enough time, dissolving, corroding or otherwise wearing away at <em>anything</em>. Plus, submarines are rated for a particular maximum depth - below this depth, their hulls can't withstand the pressure, and fail. Surface ships are not intended to be underwater at the best of times and so will fail much sooner.</p>
<p>A large, and not always appreciated, factor in what will happen to organic matter in the ocean, is the <em>depth</em>. The depth that a submarine or ship has sunk to will have marked effects on what sort of biological breakdown processes are able to act. Depth affects three controls: bacterial concentration, water temperature, and oxygen concentration.</p>
<p>For example, if you check <a href="https://www.windows2universe.org/earth/Water/temp.html" target="_blank">this link</a>, it gives you what is called a 'thermocline' - the average temperature of the ocean at particular depths. The <em>USS Grayback</em> is about 426 metres below sea level (1,400 ft), so from the chart we can see that its local ambient temperature is around 15 - 20 degrees C. This is pretty good for microbial life. I'd say we could expect quite the community of life at this depth that are equipped to deal with surface organics. </p>
<p>There's still plenty (relatively speaking) of oxygen at \~400m depth as well. </p>
<p>Finally, microbe populations are quite depth-dependent too. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3122624/" target="_blank">This article</a> is an intriguing, yet dense, article that looks at microbe population in the ocean as a function of depth. Long story short, organic breakdown occurs to one extent or another at pretty much all depths (it turns out bacteria are <em>crazy</em> adaptable), but the rate of decomposition is quite depth-dependent.</p>
<p>What all of this translates to is that the <em>depth</em> that the ship sinks to will affect how quickly the organic matter onboard (i.e. the sailors, provisions, etc.) will be broken down. In the deep ocean, where oxygen is lower and temperatures are colder, life is, to an extent, slower. Breakdown happens over a greater period of time. Many of the bacteria that we carry with us will likely perish because the environment is too damn different, but local strains will replace them and break down the bodies. Various scavenging creatures will assist in this process too. Again, though, how <em>fast</em> this process happens will depend on how deep the vessel sinks.</p>
<p>As far as I am aware though, there is no depth that provides 'perfect preservation'.  As far as we can tell there is life at all depths of the ocean, so no matter how deep we sink we will end up as food for <em>something</em>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If the water environment is anaerobic, body fat undergoes a bacterial hydrolysis process (called saponification) that turns it into adipocere, a wax-like substance similar to soap.</p>
<p>It’s what happened to scuba diver Deon Dreyer, and cost the life of the the man who tried to recover his body, Dave Shaw (<a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/1922711/raising-dead" target="_blank">summary here</a>).</p>
<p>Edit: several people have commented about enjoying the Dave Shaw story. For the long form, I recommend the book titled <em>Raising the Dead: a True Story of Death and Survival</em>, by Phillip Finch, which recounts this sad but riveting chain of events in much more details.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With the exception of the Kursk, most (all?) modern submarine losses have occurred in waters that are far deeper than the crush depth of the hull. The submarine starts to sink, and at a certain point, the hull collapses in on it and crushes like a pop can being stepped upon.</p>
<p>It happens in a fraction of a second, the crew likely didn’t feel much. If it takes a little longer, it’s likely everything was ignited for a fraction of a second, just like the fuel in a diesel engine. It is an incredibly violent affair.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>IIRC the bodies of all the Titanic victims are completely gone now including the bones and the clothes. Everything has been eaten by fish or microbes even the skeleton. All that's left is any jewelry, belt buckles or other metal but that would be badly corroded and hard to identify as well.
I don't know the timescale and this is likely different depending on where in the ocean, how cold it is and how deep etc. But eventually the bodies are completely gone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to work with an ex uk submarine crew member and he told me that if you loose containment in deep waters the crew will actually burn to death; since the pocket of air in the submarine will be compressed violently by the incoming high pressure water. Perhaps someone with a bit more physics skill can clarify but it sounded reasonably  plausible. If the heat will last long enough to char and destroy everything before all the crew is squashed I doubt though...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
