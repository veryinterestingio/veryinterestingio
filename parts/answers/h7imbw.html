Does reducing the mass make a big difference in how fast we can get to the outer planets, or will gravity assist still be the dominant factor?

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I spent years waiting for New Horizons to make it to Pluto, I was so excited. I imagine it was only a miniscule fraction of how the team felt. Pluto was so much more interesting than I think 95% of people expected. </p>
<p>What is the team's feeling on possible subsurface oceans on Pluto or Charon? I don't know how to do the calculations myself but I would assume that Pluto has a bunch of tidal heating due to Charon. I never, never would have guessed we'd be considering Pluto as a candidate for life, but if it has subsurface oceans... Why not?</p>
<p>I'm grateful to the team for making this flyby happen! I can't believe what you guys achieved with Pluto alone, let alone managing to pull off the Ãšltima Thule/Arrakoth flyby. I desperately hope a third target can be found!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
