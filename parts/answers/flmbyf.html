		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh wow, some of these answers are full of misinformation...
You are all forgetting that for a virus to be able to use a mosquito as a vector it needs to replicate inside the mosquito, cross multiple barriers (gut barrier and salivary glands ) be viable inside the saliva, be able to infect human cells when entering through the bite, and finally it needs to be able to infect a healthy mosquito when it bites a infected human</p>
<p>So no, the new corona virus is not transmited through mosquitos</p>
<p>EDIT: Most of these answers &gt; Some of these answers.
As more replies were added, thankfully, more correct answers also showed up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Per the <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/myth-busters" target="_blank">World Health Organization</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The new coronavirus CANNOT be transmitted through mosquito bites.</strong></p>
<p>To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes. The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing.</p>
