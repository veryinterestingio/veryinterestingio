		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All sorts of reasons. To warn off predators, for sex, for eating.  </p>
<ol>
<li>All fireflies glow as larvae. In lampyrid larvae, bioluminescence serves a function that is different from that served in adults. It appears to be a warning signal to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predator" target="_blank">predators</a>, since many firefly larvae contain chemicals that are distasteful or toxic.</li>
<li>Photic emission in the adult beetle was originally thought to be used for similar warning purposes, but it is now understood that its primary purpose is in mate selection. </li>
<li>At night along river banks in the Malaysian jungles, fireflies synchronize their light emissions precisely. Current hypotheses about the causes of this behavior involve diet, social interaction, and altitude. </li>
<li>Female <em>Photuris</em> fireflies are known for mimicking the photic signaling patterns of other fireflies for the sole purpose of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predator" target="_blank">predation</a></li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>great answers so far! there's a really interesting phenomenon with firefly flashing known as <strong>entrainment</strong>. Basically, their flashing can be as a response to other sources of light, and fireflies will change the frequency of their flashing based on these other sources. What's more, the time it takes for a firefly to be entrained can be modeled as dynamical system - that is, a system that can be predicted as a function of time. </p>
<p>If a firefly starts flashing at a frequency X, and you flash another light at a second frequency Y, you can use dynamical systems to predict how long it will take for the firefly to entrain to your flashing. <a href="http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/griffit4/Math_Alive/2/dynamical_systems_lecture2.pdf" target="_blank">A mathier explanation is included in this lecture.</a></p>
<p>a secondary fun fact is that humans also experience entrainment. Some common examples are how the cadence of music affects our running speed, or how people walking together tend to step in sync after some time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a question about this. So, I know that the whole reaction is performed due to quorum sensing bacteria and their AHL autoinducers. What I don't get is how the organism, in this case a firefly, plays a role in initiating the AHL production from the bacteria in order to build up the concentration which then leads to the glowing enzymatic reaction. Are they getting a signal from the firefly itself? How does this work?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
