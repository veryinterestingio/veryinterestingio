		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dentist here. Yes it’s worth it. There is evidence electric toothbrushes do remove more plaque than manual toothbrushes. Also learned from a few periodontists that the circular spinning action of Oral-B is better than Sonicare’s vibration. If you use  Sonicare, go in small circles at a 45 degree angle into the gums when brushing the cheek/lip surface as well as the palate/tongue surface. No, the most expensive ones aren’t worth it unless you have lots of disposable income. They all fundamentally work the same, except the expensive ones have more bells and whistles. There’s a oral b pro 1000 on sale for 30 bucks at Best Buy. It’s the replacement heads where they get you. There’s countless pubmed articles backing up this claim. Don’t forget to floss and get your cleaning every 3-6 months.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dentist here. They are definitely worth it, but you do not need to spend $200. Get an Sonicare for $40 or so at Walmart and it’s gonna work the same as the expensive ones. The high priced ones usually have Bluetooth and all this stuff you don’t need.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Conclusion.

<p>Electronic toothbrush beats a manual toothbrush, and tends to lead to improved oral hygiene and health. The jury seems to still be out on whether bells and whistles are worth it. </p>
<p>EDIT: there was a personal anecdote here that some replies to my comment might refer to. Mods asked me to remove it and I agree with that so I edited it out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Found that article.
BLUF:  A $10 electric toothbrush is almost as good as a $200 sonic toothbrush. Either are much better than a plain old toothbrush.</p>
<p>Abstract:
With the variety of toothbrushes on the market, the question arises, which toothbrush is best suited to maintain oral health? This thematic review focuses first on plaque formation mechanisms and then on the plaque removal effectiveness of ultrasonic toothbrushes and their potential in preventing oral diseases like periodontitis, gingivitis, and caries. We overviewed the physical effects that occurred during brushing and tried to address the question of whether ultrasonic toothbrushes effectively reduced the microbial burden by increasing the hydrodynamic forces. The results of published studies show that electric toothbrushes, which combine ultrasonic and sonic (or acoustic and mechanic) actions, may have the most promising effect on good oral health. Existing ultrasonic/sonic toothbrush models do not significantly differ regarding the removal of dental biofilm and the reduction of gingival inflammation compared with other electrically powered toothbrushes, whereas the manual toothbrushes show a lower effectiveness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two types of &quot;sonic&quot; tooth brushes: sonic and ultrasonic toothbrushes.</p>
<p>Sonic toothbrushes rely on physical touch to remove bacteria and debris. The vibrations supplement the physical motion the human provides to physically remove undesirable particles.</p>
<p>Ultrasonic toothbrushes also use sonic toothbrush principles to physically remove debris. However, the vibrations are so fast as to break bacterial chains without physically touching them, reportedly up to 5mm away using &quot;waves&quot; (it's unclear from the literature if waves means air waves or the actually vibrations of gums or bone.)</p>
<p>FDA requires a toothbrush move at 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz to be called sonic. 20,000Hz or 2,400,000 to be ultrasonic.</p>
<p>There some studies show some effectiveness of ultrasonic but there are not many studies yet:
This study showed statistically insignificant improvements for treatment of a type of mouth ulcers: <a href="https://www.oooojournal.net/article/S1079-2104(97)90084-6/pdf" target="_blank">https://www.oooojournal.net/article/S1079-2104(97)90084-6/pdf</a> However, the numbers still showed improvements, including the non blind portion (switching placebo to non placebo)</p>
<p>Another study showed statistically significant improvements in reducing plaque formation, removing plaque, and reducing gingivitis over 6 months: <a href="https://www.thejpd.org/article/S0022-3913(05)80278-1/pdf" target="_blank">https://www.thejpd.org/article/S0022-3913(05)80278-1/pdf</a> </p>
<p>Of note, there are relatively few ultrasonic brushes commercially available.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
