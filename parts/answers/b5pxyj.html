		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Big wings means slower flapping to achieve flight - more surface area to push against the air. This decreases maneuverability but gives them more ability to glide/soar (fly without flapping). This makes sense for some butterflies as they're migratory. Also some large sea birds use this same strategy to soar for long distances. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most likely a variety of reasons where not a single answer could explain why.</p>
<p>Flight and flight power is one however I think some of these creatures have a really short life span.</p>
<p>Defense/camouflage in order to look bigger than they actually are or look like another animal. Moths at night would have markings that look like birds eyes at night to another animal looking larger than they are.</p>
<p>It could also be for mating in order to attract the best mate who may only go for the healthiest looking colours.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you have a small insect that weighs 1 mg and needs 1 mm² of wing surface in order to fly efficiently. It has a larger relative which is ten times as large.</p>
<p>Now the weight of the larger insect scales in all three dimensions: It's ten times as wide, ten times as long and ten times as high, so in total it weighs 1000 mg. Its wings are ten times as long and ten times as wide, so they have an area of 100 mm². So relative to its weight, it has a much smaller wing surface, even though its proportions are all the same, and a smaller wing means it's much less efficient.</p>
<p>This effect is called the &quot;square cubed law&quot;. For anything that flies it means that the proportions of the wings need to be bigger, the heavier it is. On top of that, large wings are generally more efficient, whereas small wings are <del>less</del> more aerodynamic - so an insect with very large wings might be able to fly for a longer time, but at a lower speed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
