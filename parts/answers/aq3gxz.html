		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s a book called “What a plant knows,” I can’t remember the authors name off the top of my head.
You may enjoy that. It explains all kinds of things like that in layman’s terms, but was written by a man with a PhD in biology (if I remember correctly) and had good cited resources. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all, a seed has a plumule (plant shoot) and  a radicle (roots). They grow due to a hormone called auxin.</p>
<p>High concentration of auxin in the plumule increases the plasticity of the cell wall and leads to an increased cell elongation.
For example, if the plumule were to grow horizontally, gravity pushes down the auxin to the  lower cell wall. This causes the lower cell wall to increase in plasticity and increases elongation of the cell walls while the upper cell walls grow with a normal elongation.
Because the lower cell walls have a higher  elongation, this causes the plumule to bend and grow upwards.</p>
<p>In the radicle, the same thing occurs. However, in the radicle, a high concentration of auxin decreases the cell plasticity and cell elongation. This causes the the top cell walls to grow with normal cell elongation while the bottom cell walls grow with decreased cell elongation, making the radicle bend and grow downwards into the ground </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Shoots and roots respond to gravity in different ways. When shoots and roots develop from the seed, auxins gather on the underside. This results in negative geotropism in the shoots [<em>the auxins cause the cells on the underside to grow faster, causing the shoot to grow against gravity</em>], and positive geotropism in the roots [<em>auxins cause the cells on the underside to grow slower, causing the roots to grow towards gravity</em>]. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
