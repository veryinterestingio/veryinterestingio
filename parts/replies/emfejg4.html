			<div class="markdown"><p>The alternate arrangement is one massive star in the centre, and 2 smaller stars close together, orbiting the giant together. </p>
<p>I think the one that people are curious about is the possibility of 3 stars of similar size, equidistant from each other. Which is possible temporarily, but highly unlikely (and therefore hard to spot), and unstable and temporary (and therefore even rarer). </p>
<p>But ya generally speaking, systems with 3+ stars, including 1+ star in distant orbit, is probably fairly common.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might want to recheck your nomenclature there. Beta Centauri is approximately 390 light years away from us, whereas Alpha Centauri is only 4 light years away. They are not part of the same system.</p>
<p>You're thinking of Alpha Centauri A and Alpha Centauri B, which are both part of the Alpha Centauri system. There's no such thing as the Centauri system â€“ Centaurus is a constellation, encompassing 69 separate Bayer systems.</p></div>		</li>
