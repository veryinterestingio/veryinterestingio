			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://youtu.be/V65IGIKXsVQ" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/V65IGIKXsVQ</a> this video is of Mikhail Lukin and I feel it's an excellent video explaining his work. I'm really impressed he can step back and explain the importance of his work in relatively easily understandable language even though he's obviously incredibly knowledgeable and English isn't his first language.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite. Red-Shifting doesn't decrease the speed of light, and this isn't red shifting.</p>
<p>Decreasing the speed of light means that the wave interacts with the medium its going through a lot, while the propagating signal doesn't get destroyed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ohhhh ok.  </p>
<p>Wait... can you red-shift light in like.. a lab setting?</p>
<p>What about blue-shifting - I'd love to be able to see those beautiful near infrared images of nebulae with my own eyes.</p></div>		</li>
