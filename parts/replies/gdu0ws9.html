			<div class="markdown"><p>It's because this is essentially the same as power lost to drag, which also follows V^(3). Power can be calculated as force * velocity, where the velocity in this case is the wind's. Since the drag force is proportional to V^(2), the power lost to drag is proportional to the cube.</p></div>		</li>
