			<div class="markdown"><p>The solar system formed from a cloud of space dust.  A region of the space dust was denser than the rest and therefore had stronger local gravity, which attracted more dust to it.  The rest of the space dust started spinning around this point.  </p>
<p>The denser area accumulated more and more dust and got more and more massive until it got big enough to initiate nuclear fusion.  It became the Sun.  </p>
<p>The dust spinning around it gradually coalesced into bodies.  These became the planets and other small things like asteroids.  </p>
<p>Point being, it all formed from the same space dust, more or less concurrent with the formation of the Sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This doesn't make sense to me. Wouldn't the radioactive decay of the meteorites begin when the elements were formed (I guess the supernova of a previous star) rather than when the stellar cloud in our solar system coalesced?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I remember correctly.  The radioactive materials form small pure crystals when the meteorite (or planet) is formed. Then you can estimate how old the crystal is by how much of it is lead (formed during decay) versus how much is the original material.  If you get lots of estimates from lots of crystals and you can get an accurate estimate of the age of the meteorite.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many elements form in crystal structures. When we find such crystal structures the percentage of different elements in it tells the age due to decay. If the atoms would have already decayed before the crystal formed than it would not have bound in the crystal.</p></div>		</li>
