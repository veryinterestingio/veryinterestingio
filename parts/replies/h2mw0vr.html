			<div class="markdown"><p>That's crazy. I grew up listing to WLS AM at 50kw. People would call in from all 50 states when weather conditions were right. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>ts transmitter was located in Tinley Park, Illinois where some of the neighbors were not all that thrilled about the antenna being situated in their neighborhood...apparently with good reason.... For example,florescent lights in nearby homes would remain lit even after they were switched off. However, as the story goes, the most bizarre event happened on a warm July night when a perspiring, overweight lady sat down on her toilet seat and got the shock of her life. It seems that the toilet seat was made out of aluminum and was just the right dimension to pick up some of that stray RF. The RF shocked her backside, and that caused her to leap up, lose her balance, fall, and break her leg.  Of course, WLS paid the medical expenses and also bought her a wooden toilet sea</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AM and FM work differently. I'm on mobile, so won't go into it now. However AM radio waves will bounce off the troposphere. This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropospheric_propagation" target="_blank">troposphere propagation</a> and amateur radio operators have used it to make contacts from absurdly far distances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In communist times Polish government had build a transmission mast that was for some time the tallest man-made structure in the world. The aim was to transmit channel 1 of Polish radio to the entire globe. </p>
<p>As the stories go, in the vicinity of the mast the light bulbs would glow even when removed from their sockets. There also were complaints of headaches, nausea and other health issues from the nearby populations, which used to be dismissed by the government at the time as sourced in superstition. I don’t know how much substance was to these claims.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add/interesting enough, rfid tags will communicate by changing between reflecting the signal back that they receive, and not reflecting it back!  Or they will alternate the length of time for a 0 vs 1, or they'll reflect the signal in two different ways.  So, you don't even need an amp in the tag to send the signal, since it's all back-scatter.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Imagine how much radiating heat the Wardenclyffe tower would have produced, it likely would have had a noticable effect on the local temperature. Then multiply that by towers all over the country or world, that'd lead to very noticeable increases in global temperatures.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's what I find frustrating will all these &quot;wireless charging road&quot; projects being invested in lately, supposedly meaning the end of range anxiety in EV's. </p>
<p>We're already having trouble to meet energy demand with renewable energy as it is, yet they want to introduce massive power losses so people wouldn't need to stop for a 10 minute charge.</p></div>		</li>
