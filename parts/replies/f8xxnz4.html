			<div class="markdown"><p>This would be true if you actually could write <em>a</em> as a sum of terms that were all equal to <em>e</em>. This is possible precisely when <em>a</em> is a positive integer multiple of <em>e</em>. Otherwise, the maximum occurs when <em>a</em> is written as a sum of <em>N</em> equal terms, where <em>N</em> is one of the two integers closest to a/e.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, good catch. Fortunately y^(a / y) is well behaved enough that the y = a / ⌈a/e⌉, a / ⌊a/e⌋ maximize y subject to the constraint n = a/y integer. (I find it a little unfair that y is allowed to take any real while n is restricted to the integers - at least, that's my excuse.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;e,&quot; approximately  2.71828, is a number that pops up a LOT in math.  In this case, OP has noticed that when you cut up any positive number into a set of (positive, to prevent cheating) numbers which add up to that number, if you multiply that set then you will get the <em>biggest</em> result by making the numbers you multiply as close to e as you can.</p>
<p>For example, 30 (which is very close to, but slightly larger than 11<em>e.)<br />
30=10 </em> 3<br />
10^3= 1000, but we get a much bigger number with<br />
3^10= 59049.<br />
e^11 is bigger though, about 59874.</p>
<p>Once your number is smaller than e the result gets smaller too, for example 2^15 =32768.</p>
<p>OP is asking for a proof to explain this.</p></div>		</li>
