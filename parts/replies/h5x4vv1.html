			<div class="markdown"><p>He’s literally the safest loan applicant in the world, lol. He can cover MORE than any bank could likely loan him. He could BUY the bank. He can loan any amount he desires and be charged the LEAST amount of interest that anyone else would. He never, ever needs to consider paying it back either. He’s completely outside the norm, literally in a category of one. Wealth so absurd that we really can’t wrap our hands around it, he lives for free, has everything he desires and pays for none of it.
He’s as incomprehensible to us as an alien entity from another dimension.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He is guaranteed to pay back, latest when he dies. His wealth makes it almost impossible for the bank to lose money on him. Therefore, they can't charge him high rates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They will, when he dies. But interest rates on that are like 1 or 2% (it's better they get something more than nothing in the risk free category unlike treasury notes that barely, if ever cover inflation) and the repayments would be deducted from earnings so eventually, his earnings become all interest payments and deductable to give a net income of a few thousand that he pays taxes on, while being able to spend millions a year, tax free</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also remember that Blue Origin is one of the largest black holes of cash to throw money into - and investors are adding to the singularity as well.  It's what you get when you want to 'innovate fast' and think that hiring ULA CEOs could do exactly the opposite of what they've been doing for decades.</p></div>		</li>
