			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but quite unlike other bodies in our Solar System, the magnetic fields of Uranus and Neptune are generated in a relatively shallow shell (presumably the dynamo action of the superionic ocean on both planets) rather than in or near the core. That really tends to drive higher order moments, specifically the quadrapole, which can tilt the dipole greatly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's mixed up a bit, I think the work you're referring to by Sabine Stanley on a stably stratified layer was to get Saturn's axially-aligned field, here <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2009GL041752" target="_blank">https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2009GL041752</a>. </p>
<p>She also worked on Uranus and Neptune, but the mechanism was different as /u/Astromike23 said <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature02376" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/nature02376</a>. It mentions a stably stratified layer too but my understanding is that's not the key component of the mechanism, it's the thin shell.</p></div>		</li>
