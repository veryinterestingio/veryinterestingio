			<div class="markdown"><p>So you're saying, even though my throat feels like it's full of phlegm due to a cold I shouldn't try to clear it, but rather try to leave the phlegm in there? I hoped my irritated throat could get better by trying to cough it free.</p>
<p>Edit: Condensed for clarity.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Productive coughs are healthy and should not be suppressed. They help to rid the lungs of mucus.</p>

<p>Physiotherapy aims to: 1) increase expectoration using effective coughing techniques for patients with productive but ineffective cough; 2) suppress voluntarily nonproductive cough; and 3) instruct patient in the use of physiotherapeutic equipment improving expectoration</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cough medicines. Cough suppressants for a dry cough or expectorants for a wet, productive cough that brings up mucus, are available over the counter and by prescription.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My own, inexpert opinion: take an NSAID like ibuprofen for any sore throat, and if your cough is productive, take guaifenesin to thin the mucus. You can also probably clear your throat more gently than you do by default.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two kinds of coughs. </p>
<p>&quot;Productive&quot; coughs are coughs where you're bringing up mucus out of the lungs. This happens because an infection in your lungs is causing the mucus to thicken, and coughing removes both the the thick mucus that would otherwise hurt your breathing and the bacteria trapped in it. Don't try to suppress a productive cough - it's important for your lung health. You can get medicine that tries to loosen or dilute the mucus, but they don't work very well.</p>
<p>&quot;Tickly&quot; coughs are caused by irritation at the back of the throat, often because your tonsils are swelling or because of prior coughing. These coughs don't do anything useful, they're just caused by your irritated throat triggering your cough reflex. Drinking honey and lemon tea or taking suppressant cough mixture helps soothe the irritation and stop you coughing. Coughing actually makes this kind of cough worse because it worsens the irritation, and it's fine to prevent this kind of cough if you can.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good explanations above. I would differ with you and say that “cords” is used synonymously with “folds” in the medical community, so it isn’t wrong as such.
Also, when smokers can’t speak there are many potential reasons: chronic laryngitis, Reinke’s oedema, laryngeal cancer and common. Vocal cord paralysis in such a patient might imply there is a lung cancer.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yah sorry I was being super generalizing about smokers. Was just trying to give one example from a smoker family friend who did indeed have lung cancer. Thanks for your correction.</p>
<p>And I know that ‘cords’ is used just as often in the medical community as among laymen from my experience with ENTs, but i assumed it was one of those things that’s just been said so often that people started running with it and it’s now accepted. In the opera community, voice teachers act like it’s a common misconception. </p>
<p>Is this wrong? I’m curious if medical texts use them interchangeably as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vocal cords is a very common terminology and has been in use for several centuries. Unsurprisingly, it comes from an analogy to string instruments (there's a lot of older anatomy terminology that's sort of more poetic and analogical like this). I'm not as familiar with medical texts, but you probably don't see it as often in medical texts anymore, even if it was standard terminology. I've seen a similar shift pretty clearly in the linguistics literature - older stuff is more likely to say &quot;cords&quot; and newer phonetics texts almost universally prefer &quot;folds&quot;.</p>
<p>I wouldn't say it's &quot;wrong&quot;, although I would say it's &quot;misleading&quot;, which is probably why it's falling out of favor. It's not that the the word is wrong or that doctors or linguists were confused about the anatomy, but that a lot of people who heard it for the first time got the wrong idea.</p></div>		</li>
