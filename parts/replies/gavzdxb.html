			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, Google also looks at how many times the thing you are searching for appears in the text of a website in order to know which are more relevant.</p>
<p>So if two sites have &quot;Nana's Polish Sugar cookie recipe&quot; in their text the one that has it more times will appear first in the search results. </p>
<p>But at the same time it looks at grammar and sentence construction so you can't just have Nana's Polish Sugar cookie recipe repeat 10 times in a row so they only way to insert it in the text is with long stories.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this adding to this, it is far from that simple.</p>
<p>If two sites have &quot;Nana's Polish Sugar cookie recipe&quot; in their text then the one that has it more times will appear first in the search results, if everything else is equal and there is nothing else to differentiate the two sites but, well, that is impossible.</p>
<p>There is far more that goes into search results than keyword density and grammar. Traffic numbers, average read times, image file names, image alt text, image load speed, total page load speed, internal link weight, number of external backlinks, authority of external backlinks, the actual domain name... all of this affects &quot;relevance&quot; and no two sites are ever going to be equal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add, I try to avoid these story sites like the plague, so I add searches like &quot;goodfoods&quot; which tends to bring up bbc recipes which are usually decent (take that with a pinch of salt) or &quot;bikers&quot; to get hairy bikers recipes as those guys are awesome.</p></div>		</li>

<pre><code>sugar cookie
"sugar cookie"</code></pre>
<p>the first one will match anything with either sugar or cookie. the second will require a match to exactly &quot;sugar cookie&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>heck even quotes around <em>one</em> word can be helpful, such as if you're specifically looking for a rare word/name that looks like the misspelling of another word (or many words, such as <code>verygoodfox</code> vs <code>"verygoodfox"</code>)</p></div>		</li>
