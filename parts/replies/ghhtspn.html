			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, the further you get out into the atmosphere (away from earth), the thinner the air is, and the less efficient it is at conducting heat.  Fewer, further apart molecules cannot conduct heat nearly as well as at sea level.  This is (part of) why temperature drops with elevation.  Anyone please feel free to correct me if any of this is wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It actually increases up in the exosphere because temperature is based on average particle velocity.  At those altitudes the large mean free path and exposure to solar radiation means they can move very rapidly without losing energy in collisions.</p>
<p>In addition to your point, water vapor drops off at higher altitudes as you go towards the stratosphere.  Water vapor is a powerful greenhouse gas and as the air gets drier it more readily loses heat to space as infrared.  You don't have clouds to reflect it either.</p>
<p>You also have emission and absoarption mechanics.  A photon can escape into space more readily at higher altitudes than lower where it is more likely to be absoarbed by another gas particle.  It can take about a million years for a photon to escape from the sun's core.</p>
<p>So temps drop off as you go higher but as you reach the top of the atmosphere you see them increase again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would add that moisture is what adds to the density of the air (along with smog). The more moisture, the more air can trap heat. Ever notice a rainy winter night is warmer than a crystal clear night? That‚Äôs because the moisture prevents the heat from the day to be completely released at night. The closer you get to the equator, the higher the tropopause, and thus warmer temperatures.
Here is a good explanation of the tropopause: <a href="https://study.com/academy/lesson/tropopause-definition-characteristics.html" target="_blank">https://study.com/academy/lesson/tropopause-definition-characteristics.html</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The primary factor is that pressure and temperature are inversely related.  As a mass of air rises, it expands, and its temperature drops.  As a mass of air descends, it is compressed, and its temperature rises.  </p>
<p>This is called &quot;adiabatic heating&quot;. It's the same thing we use to make the inside of our refrigerators cold, and the exterior coils hot.</p>
<p>Every 1000 feet a mass of air rises, expansion will cause a temperature drop of ~3.5F.  Every 1000 feet it descends, compression will cause a temperature rise of ~3.5F.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for this! I've been wondering how cars and greenhouses get so hot. It'd been explained that they trap infrared, but with no info on how that energy got in in the first place if it can't go through glass. I always assumed it was visible light being converted to infrared, which I guess wasn't too far off</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be precise, all the glass lets the visible sunlight into the car, absorbing little of it, like the atmosphere. Then that light hits the upholstery, which absorbs a lot of it (like the ground), heating it up. Then the heated-up upholstery radiates infrared, which the glass traps inside, because the same glass that lets most of the visible light through reflects much of the infrared back into the car, cause that's just the way glass is.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the nitrogen that makes up most of the atmosphere lets much of the infrared radiated by the warm ground back out into space. But gases containing carbon, like CO2 and CH4, act more like auto-glass (or greenhouse glass), trapping heat on earth and melting glaciers and icecaps and fueling wildfires by drying out vegetation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worth mentioning that global warming happens because CO2 and other &quot;greenhouse gases&quot; absorb and re-emit more infrared (thermal) radiation than normal air. This is important because the earth re-emits solar radiation as infrared. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb and re-emit this outgoing radiation in all directions, sending some straight back to earth, trapping the heat in the atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, atmosphere is a very pronounced gradient, most of atmosphere's mass is on the inner layer of the atmosphere, bigger and denser objects preserve better the heat (you can test this heating up both a glass of water and a pot, the pot will still hot longer), this plus greenhouse effect makes that all the radiation that enters the atmosphere get catch on the lower layers</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>The same is true for infrared radiation, which is what heats up Earth mostly. Rather than being absorbed by the air it‚Äôs absorbed by the Earth‚Äôs surface. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, no. Most of the heating is not done by infrared, it's half dome by visible light. Infrared doesn't have any special link to heat. The sun puts out about 50% of its power in the visible spectrum and beyond (UV), and the other 50% in infrared. Most of that infrared is also very near infrared at that too, that is close to red. See <a href="https://greensarawak.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/solar_radiation_spectrum.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
<p>As you can see there, there's a few spots where gases like water and CO2 absords almost all the infrared. Almost none gets to the ground. Visible light lacks any molecule completely absording it, so you logic about you can see through the air therefore infrared can go right through too is sort of wrong. And this graph barely goes into the IR spectrum, it's entirely near IR as again the sun primarily emitts visible light and close to it. The atmosphere absords even more IR as you go further into it, as shown <a href="https://cdn.eso.org/images/large/atm_opacity.jpg" target="_blank">here.</a> The first graph only went to about about as long as 2 Œºm, but really IR goes from about 1Œºm to 1mm, a large chunk of this wider graph. And a large part of that range is entirely or partially opaque, unlike the visible spectrum. So a lot of IR actually is absorbed by the gases by the atmosphere. </p>
<p>And this isn't just some pedantic correction, it's extremely important. This little quirk is how the glass on greenhouse work. Visible light from the 5700K (5400¬∞C) sun surface comes in through glass just fine. Infrared radiated from the 300K (25¬∞C) greenhouse does not go back through the glass through, it is trapped inside as the glass is opaque to it. Hence greenhouse can stay warm. Since the atmosphere is transparent to visible light and comparatively opaque to a lot of infrared, just like glass, enter the greenhouse effect. Good that water does some of this naturally so we don't freeze to death, bad that we pump out IR opaque CO2 rapidly and drive this effect even further.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Pedantic, but the Earth's spectrum from outer space is can be observed largely infrared. Your comment suggests that the majority of infrared isn't being emitted. They are, it just takes a longer time than visible light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, my comment suggests the surface IR doesn't directly reach space uninhibited. The atmosphere can very well emit it's own IR. It's just half goes back down.</p></div>		</li>
