			<div class="markdown"><p>This guy is absolutely on target. In the US, the FDA has unbelievably strict rules and regulations about labeling any product as &quot;curing&quot;, &quot;treat&quot;, &quot;rids&quot;... From a manufacturing standpoint (my husband is a quality director of a pharma/cosmetic/OTC plant), the plant can avoid some FDA involvement if there is no claim. Hence the disclaimer...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If they are genuinely deficient, diagnosed by a doctor, and are prescribed an injection, then it's essential they do it. Iron and vitamin b12 injections are good examples. But get blood work done to see if you are deficient rather than just fork money out for nothing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily disproven, just unproven. It takes a ton of research and money to prove the claim. However, since a lot of them are not regulated, there is no guarantee they are reaping any benefits. There is still quality testing that has to be performed and passed in order release the general public (mainly to prove no bacterial growth and sterility is maintained), but it doesn't mean it's going to do anything for them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically unless your doctor advises that you need to take a vitamin supplement, you probably don’t. Like in my case, my doctor looked at my bloodwork and saw that my vitamin D was low (I don’t see the sun much) so she told me to take a vitamin D supplement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't necessarily true. You can have a peer reviewed study showing that a supplement has some effect, but unless the FDA evaluates the study and approves the claim they have to have the disclaimer. Getting things approved by the FDA is super expensive. </p>
<p>Every supplement I take has claims on it, and I've looked up the peer reviewed studies which confirm those claims.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although, a &quot;peer reviewed study&quot; is a shaky basis for attributing benefits of a product. &quot;Studies show&quot; is a phrase that precedes incredible amounts of misinformation.</p>
<p>Is the study credible, or is it fluff that passes basic criteria of peer review? Is it compromised by commercial interest? What type of study is it? We're participants asked to evaluate their own experience, or was objective testing done, and either way was what you want the product to do the thing soecifically measured? Is the study repeatable and has it been repeated? Are the study's cohort members similar to you in a way that matters (e.g. if they all start with a vitamin deficiency you don't have, they may benefit more than you from supplementation)?</p>
<p>And so on. Publishing a few studies and pointing people at them rather than having some certification may be a symptom of the difficulty dealing with the FDA. <em>However</em> a supplement manufacturer asking people to read positive studies about their own product is a minefield. Most consumers won't have much or even any exposure to critical analysis of what is essentially medical research. That's why groups like the FDA are important, because people don't have the time to do that research individually and need a trusted representative to take on that role.</p>
<p>Although, the process often sucks and favours larger, wealthier players, because, as usual, Capitalism sucks at doing things for the good of society.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely, but I never looked into studies because the supplements told me to. </p>
<p>I looked into them because I was dubious of the claims and was looking to disprove them. Also, I was looking for potential adverse effects and interactions.</p></div>		</li>
