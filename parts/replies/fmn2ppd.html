			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there an anti-auxin chemical? Other commenters have mentioned that light destroys auxin, but would it be possible to inject a tree with a substance that would reduce or eliminate the auxin at or near or flowing from the injection site?</p>
<p>Or even better, could we put the tree on a type of &quot;dialysis&quot; during which we take the flow of nutrients, filter out the auxin, then return the leftovers?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The hormones and response systems at play have subtle, redundant relationships with plant behaviors and development. In general, decreasing responsiveness to these central regulators leads to local uncontrolled growth, but because they're important for so many things the overall plant ends up smaller.</p>
<p>Studies on this stuff show complex responses depending on which thing you mess with: production, transportation, sensing...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're called cytokinins. They promote cell growth and division. </p>
<p>Growers often use a method called &quot;topping&quot; where the highest stem of a plant is taken off in order to reduce auxin delivery to subtending branches. Both auxin and cytokinins can be applied exogenously (from the outside). They act based on their ratio to one another so to modulate growth you dont need to remove auxin, you just add cytokinins.</p>
<p>Google images &quot;auxin vs cytokinin&quot; and look for one of the pictures that shows images of various plants/plant parts treated with different ratios of the two hormones</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is great, thank you! I understood about topping, but asked in part because I've heard that there are certain trees that when you top them they stop growing.</p>
<p>Also, I was curious about injecting a substance (cytokinins) or reducing auxins locally, so as to affect individual branches or segments rather than applying to the entire plant.</p>
<p>I have long wondered if it would be possible to use tubing to redirect the flow of one part of a plant to another.</p></div>		</li>
