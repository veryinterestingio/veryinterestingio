			<div class="markdown"><p>A few years ago I had to finally get rid of my 1998 Honda Accord. It had 220,000 miles on it, ran great, and the AC still worked perfectly, never had to have it serviced in any way during the life of the car. The only reason I had to get rid of her was because the sub-frame cracked, rendering it unsafe to drive.</p>
<p>I sold it for $400 to a professed Honda enthusiast who planned to take it down south and restore it. The dude showed up in a '97 Accord that looked like it had rolled off the showroom floor. Best Craigslist transaction ever.</p>
<p>Some days I still think about where that car is now...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why isn't automotive ac sealed and powered by an electric motor like a fridge? I assume the alternator doesn't provide enough electricity, but couldn't that output just be increased like a generator that powers a refrigerator? Maybe that would decrease gas mileage too much?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cost and a massive reduction in mileage (basically you can't meet environmental standards).</p>
<p>Also, a car can last years without issue (my car is pushing 8 years old with no changes to the AC). So it's not really a problem requiring a solution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Belt drive components on ICE vehicles are a lot easier to integrate than an electric motor because the only electric power source you have is the alternator. You could get fancy and beef up the power output of the alternator, but that becomes an exercise in trade-offs and optimization they many OEMs don't want to do when the belt driven design simply works and prices are cheap. </p>
<p>Switch over to EVs and now the belt drive doesn't make much sense and it is much easier to integrate electronically driven components. There are other issues such as getting the right voltage and current to the motor and then specific controls algorithms need to be defined and implemented, the parts will be more expensive until high volumes are achieved, but you can get a much more power efficient design which is crucial for EVs at this time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ive only been doing it a little over a year but i make around $20/hr. For the area I live in that is actuslly pretty good. I also get bonuses for certain jobs/sales. For example in the summer if I do a duct job i get an extra $500 that day. Most people I know work for someone else for a few years then start there own company. Also some companies do piece pay where you are paid a percentage of a job, some do hourly, some do a combination of the two.</p></div>		</li>
