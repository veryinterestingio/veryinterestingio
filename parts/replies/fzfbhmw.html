			<div class="markdown"><p>maybe our brain tries to find a ,basic reaction' for a ore complicated situation what gives us a shorter reaction time.
In a heartfelt moment you can feel overwhelmed by all the stuff you are experiencing. So you kinda have to process all the stimuli that are coming in which might cause stress since you have no sudden answer how to react. which can be fatal in the wild</p></div>		</li>

<p>Although we've evolved to lose our dense fur, we still have some hair and arrector pili muscles</p>

<p>That's almost unbelievable. I once read as well that we technically have still hair over all of our body -even in our face- but most got so thin and coulorless over the time that we barely notice it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not how evolution works, if having goosebumps had a negative affect on your ability to reproduce then yes, it will eventually go away. But the reality is having goosebumps doesn't really affect anything at all</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unlikely. They aren't serving us much now, but there also isn't a strong pressure selecting against them. There isn't a huge cost to getting them. Having or not having goosebumps doesn't significantly effect your chances of reproducing, so it won't be selected for one way or another.</p>
<p>Theoretically, there is a small caloric cost to having and using those muscles, and even with no cost we might expect it fade over a very long time, but evolution happens over hundreds of thousands of years and something like this would be on a much longer timescale than something that has a bigger effect.</p>
<p>That's why we have so many &quot;useless&quot; traits like this</p></div>		</li>
