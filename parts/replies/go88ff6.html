			<div class="markdown"><p>It shouldn’t destroy the spike protein. But the data shows that Sinovac’s vaccine has much lower efficacy (just under 60%) than the mRNA vaccines from BioNTech-Pfizer and Moderna (&gt;90%). That being said anything over 50% is decent and better than the influenza vaccine we get every year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This actually depends on the trial. The 60% result was on a trial of Brazilian healthcare workers, whereas other trials from Morocco, the UAE, and Turkey, that were on the general population (and thus much more typical viral loads) showed around 80% effectiveness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to what Pipe wrote, which I agree with, inactivated vaccines are also the least effective method (but among the safest, though not as safe as a subunit vaccine). The immune response you get out of it is quite mild. If you think back on the poliovirus vaccines, this was a huge point of discussion, especially when the attenuated vaccines started giving kids polio because the virus reactivated via recombination/mutation. We've mostly stuck with inactivated vaccines, so they're quite standard in the field.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It didn't just start giving kids polio, there are now more people with new vaccine-caused polio every year (i.e. some level of neurological damage) than there are with wild polio. They still administer the live vaccine in the third world where there still is wild polio. However, they have modified the vaccine to remove the strain that was causing almost all of the vaccine-caused polio. In the first world, polio is so rare that the lower efficacy of the inactivates vaccine is outweighed by the elimination of the possibility of vaccine-caused polio.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The chemical they use targets DNA/RNA specifically and is big standard for inactivated vaccines so at least in principle no.</p>
<p>There could possibly be a difference in the folding of the spike protein in the monkey cell line they use for culturing it.</p>
<p>It could also just be that with the whole virus your body makes antibodies against parts of the virus that don't matter for infection, diluting your overall antibody response.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Nope, other way around. It's typically a much more robust immunity because you have antibodies to multiple target proteins, typically including the same spike protein. If the virus mutates and that target changes, you have others ready to go, and if the spike protein is still a target, you also have other targets so it's even better.</p></div>		</li>
