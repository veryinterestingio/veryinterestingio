			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially.</p>
<p>If you image those crazy star trail pictures or car light trails, they happen because light hits everything.</p>
<p>Lighting on still objects doesn't change, so it'll come out super sharp.</p>
<p>Lighting on a moving car does though. So it'll capture the light from the tail lights for example through multiple frames to create that trail.</p>
<p>With the final image, you get a still highway, trees, canyon idk making stuff up, but also that car tail light driving through the road.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>star trail photography is more often made up of multiple less-long exposure shots stacked on top of each other ( <a href="https://markus-enzweiler.de/software/starstax/" target="_blank"><a href="https://markus-enzweiler.de/software/starstax/" target="_blank">https://markus-enzweiler.de/software/starstax/</a></a>  is a good tool for this)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't think of it as multiple frames. Think of it as one frame that captures a certain longer span of time. But essentially yes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but there are photographers though who take thousands of exposures and condense them into one image. But when it comes to film photography the easiest way to do a long exposure is what you're talking about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No such thing. Any photo isn't an instant, but captures some period of time. So really, there's nothing special about &quot;long exposure&quot;, it's exactly the same as any other photo.</p>
<p>Say, a normal picture might be taken at 1/100 exposure time, meaning the sensor/film is gathering light for 10ms. And a &quot;long exposure&quot; picture could be gathering light for 10000 ms instead. But time still passes in both cases, there's no fundamental difference between them.</p>
<p>A picture with a short exposure time still can have motion blur, if something moves fast enough. A picture with a minute long exposure time can be completely razor sharp if you're taking a picture where nothing moves over a minute.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, so I have seen posts from people who are shooting the stars over really long periods of time, more than 12 hours for example and I don't understand how you can get a clear shot of stars over a long period of time when the earth is rotating.  The camera itself is moving relative to the stars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the ones with multiple hours of exposure it’s likely deep space objects where the sub frame times are more like 1-5 minutes rather than seconds. Theoretically it would give the same SNR but in reality you’ll get a better image with longer sub exposures.</p></div>		</li>
