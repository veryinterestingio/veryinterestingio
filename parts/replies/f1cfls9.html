			<div class="markdown"><p>The hair on your head provides protection from UV rays. It also helps cool us by letting sweat collect and then evaporate. It’s why people of African decent have thicker, curlier, darker hair: they need more protection from the sun and need to be able to cool themselves more efficiently. And why people descended from areas with less sun have thinner, lighter, straighter hair: they need to let the sun in because there is less of it and they don’t need to lose as much heat because it’s cooler already. The hair on our head does little for keeping us warm.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When I shave my beard off in spring and another cold front hits, my face feels way colder than when I had the beard in the deep of winter. Maybe it doesn't do a whole lot, but it does something I would wager.</p></div>		</li>
