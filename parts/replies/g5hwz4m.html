			<div class="markdown"><p>Professional diver here, you're definitely on the right track. Couple of nitpicks though. Submarines aren't really pressurized, they maintain normal atmospheric pressure inside. The hull is incredibly strong to prevent it from being crushed: every 33ft of depth is equal to another atmosphere worth of pressure. This means that at 100ft, a submarine is experiencing 4x normal atmospheric pressure. Current military subs can routinely operate at 600+ feet. Maintaining internal pressure at the same as normal atmospheric pressure leaves them free to change depth or even rapidly surface whenever they need to, without worrying about barotrauma or decompression sickness.</p>
<p>The little hole in the inside window pane of the airplane isn't for pressurizing the cabin, it's for pressurizing the outer window pane. The outer window pane is the one designed to take the load of the cabin pressure. The inner window pane is for us to look at, and to stop us from damaging the critical outer pane. The little hole allows cabin pressure to also fill the air space, preventing the inner pane from having to handle the stresses. And, if the outer pane blows out, the little hole turns a gaping death portal into a tiny, very loud, annoyance.</p></div>		</li>

Of glass and that equalizes the pressure between them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I/EnchaladaOfTheSky is correct. The hole in the window is to help the pressure between the different layers of the window. Because the pressure inside the airplane is much greater than the outside air(at high altitude anyways) the interior windows could be a weak point. There are 3 layers to an airplane window, the outer one that takes the pressure load, the middle which is a backup, and the interior is basically there to protect the two important windows from passengers or anything else that might hurt the windows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Three layers of glass typically these days, but yeah, that's the general idea.  To try and keep the windows from frosting over, mostly.  People like to be able to see out of their windows to look at the clouds and the ground.  They wouldn't be able to do that if there weren't small holes in the windows.  There's no risk of the plane &quot;exploding&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're both correct.  </p>
<p>&quot;...Well, that hole actually reduces the pressure on the middle pane, so only the outer pane takes the force of the cabin pressure - and it experiences that pressure more gradually during flight.&quot;</p>

<p>If you look at an airplane window, there’s a tiny hole at the bottom. This is to pressurize the cabin, so your airplane doesn’t explode as it climbs in elevation.</p>

<p>Wow that's so wrong on many levels.  Other people have given better answers, and I'm just gonna provide a professional source: <a href="https://www.cntraveler.com/story/why-do-airplane-windows-have-tiny-holes" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.cntraveler.com/story/why-do-airplane-windows-have-tiny-holes" target="_blank">https://www.cntraveler.com/story/why-do-airplane-windows-have-tiny-holes</a></a></p></div>		</li>
