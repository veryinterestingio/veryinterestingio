<p>For light-duty applications (cars), it will be compressed gas.</p>
<p>For heavy-duty applications, it will be cryogenic (liquid) storage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to Wikipedia: </p>
<p>The energy densities (MJ/L) of cryogenic hydrogen and compressed (690 bar) hydrogen are about 8.5 and 4.5 respectively. This puts them squarely in between natural gas (LNG is 22) and lithium ion batteries (2.6). </p>
<p>I know that the advantage of gasoline and diesel are their high energy densities which allow long range, and the advantages of batteries are that they output electricity which can be fed into a much more efficient engine. </p>
<p>My question is: What is the advantage of hydrogen? It seems like the round trip efficiently isnâ€™t enough to justify the extra cost. And also: how much cheaper does hydrogen production have to be / how much more efficient do fuel cells have to be to make hydrogen have a significant niche?</p></div>		</li>
