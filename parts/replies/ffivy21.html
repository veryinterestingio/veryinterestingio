			<div class="markdown"><p>My wife is in nursing school and I just shouted, “hey you taught me that!!” Because she quizzes me to help her study. We also enjoy Grey’s anatomy more now (we’ve been watching it together since we met in high school in 2004) cause they say shit like this and I yell at her “you taught me that!”</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>She had increasingly severe flu-like symptoms for 3-4 weeks and hadn't eaten (because she threw everything up) for nearly a week. They ran dozens of tests for everything from bird flu to Hepatitis C. Nothing made sense. They did an x-ray and saw what they thought was an enlarged heart. During a follow-up CT scan they realized her heart was normal sized but surrounded by fluid. They rushed her to emergency surgery after seeing it to remove the fluid. The surgeon said that if he had stopped for lunch on the way she wouldn't have made it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually with heart failure (and cardiac tamponade line his wife had) you will notice you are markedly short of breath and unable to catch it. For example, mahbe you used to run half marathons, and now you can barely walk a few blocks without a break. This is because you heart isn't getting enough blood to you body and you need to take breaks to reduce the oxygen demand.</p>
<p>Here is a nice video explaining it: <a href="https://www.osmosis.org/learn/Cardiac_tamponade?t=23s&utm_source=back-bumper&utm_medium=youtube&utm_campaign=yt-preview&utm_content=cardiac-tamponade" target="_blank">https://www.osmosis.org/learn/Cardiac_tamponade?t=23s&utm_source=back-bumper&utm_medium=youtube&utm_campaign=yt-preview&utm_content=cardiac-tamponade</a></p></div>		</li>
