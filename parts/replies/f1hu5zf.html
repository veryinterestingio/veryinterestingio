<p>Also, although Jansky identified milky way sources generally, I thought Sag A wasn't really identified as a specific source until the 50's</p></div>		</li>

<p>If I face the center of the Milky Way, with my back to the North Star, the eastern sunrise is on my left and the western sunset on my right. If I were to peer into the center of the MW, is Sagittarius East on my left and Sagittarius West on my right? Or are they left/right of A* with my head tilted to match the galactic plane?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>The sky rotates around the poles</p>
</blockquote>
<p>from our perspective yes, but it is of course more accurate to say the pole of our earth rotates around the sky. </p>
<p>For newcomers to astronomy this is easiest to understand if you picture the earth as a spinning basketball at the centre of a large spherical dome. The stars are essentially painted on the inside of the dome, fixed and unmoving. The invisible finger on which the basketball is spinning is the earth's axis, making one rotation each day. The point of contact between the finger and ball is our terrestrial south pole. The finger points through the centre to the north pole and extends all the way to the ceiling of the dome. It's the same north. Our concept of terrestrial and celestial north are the same. East west and south are each relative to that polar line though the centre of the earth. East/west are arbitrary, since they circle back around, but for simplicity we use Greenwich as our &quot;zero&quot; same as we do for our clocks and universal coordinated time. </p>
<p>What throws a lot of people I think is we are used to picturing everything in an XYZ reference frame like in minecraft, but astronomy primarily works using a polar perspective. We <em>can</em> use the XYZ frame, using the north pole as our Z, and then we define X based on a yearly event: from the centre of the earth to the sun when it crosses the equator on the spring equinox. Y is simply orthogonal to X and Z. It's just not a useful frame because, you know, the stars are waaaay out light years away, barely imperceptibly moving in our lifetime so it's easier to picture them as painted points on a spherical dome. The bonus of it is you can define their position with just two angles - ascension and declination, essentially the latitude and longitude of the sky.</p></div>		</li>

So, I'm gonna go with that, even if it's a little confusing to include the word &quot;star&quot; in the name of a presumed black hole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;*&quot; is usually pronounced &quot;star&quot; in the sciences, eg C*-algebras (&quot;see star algebras&quot;).</p>
<p>&quot;#&quot; is a bit more tricky because Americans call it a &quot;pound&quot; but most of the rest of the world calls it a &quot;hash&quot;, or &quot;sharp&quot; in a musical context.</p>
<p>That's one reason the #metoo movement was at first met with some awkwardness in America.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Feels like #metoo was pretty clearly understood to be pronounced &quot;hashtag me too&quot; when it first came out... The awkwardness around the conversations it sparked was due to something else entirely.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The &quot;*&quot; is referred to in English as the asterisk, from the Late Latin &quot;asteriscus&quot; that itself is from Ancient Greek &quot;asteriskos&quot;. Which is translated as &quot;little star&quot;.</p>
<p>Because it looks like a little star. :)</p></div>		</li>
