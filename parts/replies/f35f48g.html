			<div class="markdown"><p>typically with Luminol you spray the area, darken the room and then take a veeeeery long exposure phtoo so that the faint glow shows up on camera. Luminol detecting blood traces is a very dim glow, so it's not like the movies unless there's just visible globs of blood everywhere, in which case, uh, you probably don't need the Luminol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Story time, I was working out of town and staying at a friend of mine's house, this house is 8000 square feet and only him and his wife live there. Whole wings they hardly ever went in. And there's 4 little Yorkies running around it. They couldn't smell it, but I could. I mentioned it to his wife and she said no, our dogs don't pee in the house. I went out to my truck  and grabbed my UV  flashlight, turn off all the lights, and it was like a horror show. Every piece of furniture legs, baseboard corners and hundreds of spots on  carpets glowed bright yellow green.
She actually called in a special cleaning crew to go throughout the house and sanitize and clean everything and said don't tell her husband. (Yeah I told him).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of you not to take your UV light back through once the cleaning crew was done.  It's hard to get rid of all the residue even if everything looks clean.  I cleaned the shit out of my carpet once my cat got over crapping everywhere and it looks brand new, but my UV light shows otherwise.  I mean the stains don't look as distinct as the did but they're definitely still there.  Fucking cat.</p></div>		</li>
