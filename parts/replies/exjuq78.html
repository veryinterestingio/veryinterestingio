			<div class="markdown"><p>9th grade teacher made the mistake of putting me at the back of the class where there was a spare chalkboard. Anytime she was out of class I would drag my nails down the board. People would freak out, cringe, yell at me. At least one time I was able to stop a person mid stride and nearly take a knee. But doing this seemed to numb my sensitivity to it. It no longer triggers much if any reaction in me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hard to speak authoritatively, but I imagine there are some people who have absolutely no issues with the fingers on a chalkboard sound, or other commonly hated noises, while potentially having a complete meltdown over something most people wouldnt find much issue with. For example, I cannot <em>stand</em> the sound of styrofoam rubbing against itself and will straight up end up in the fetal position with my hands over my ears if subjected to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd also love to hear more of you know anything about it.</p>
<p>I've recently been exploring autism on a social level, trying to understand what it's like.</p>
<p>For example, a scaled down explanation I once got for someone who has sensory issues is similar to having a blocked nose cold.
Everything is too bright too loud (not loud enough) uncomfortable, and expressing yourself seems impossible..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For those of use who would be called his functioning you may hear us say that outwardly we are high functioning socially, but inside our heads is a mess that is far from high functioning.
Females are especially good at “mimicking” the social behaviours around us which causes most people to not even notice or at best think we are just quirky or socially awkward.</p>
<p>The point is, a lot of us a socially passable and you wouldn’t know. The effort it takes to maintain that can be incredible. My whole day is spent fighting sensory sensitivities and I’m always right on the edge of a breakdown because it’s so draining.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hard to put my experiences into words with such a general question, but I'm happy to try and talk about this stuff more. I've been living my whole life as an autistic person and have a lot of autistic friends, so I've got a lot to say if you have specific questions?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funnily enough, you tend to find both extremes in autistic people - incredibly high sensitivity as well as incredibly dulled sensitivity (some theorize this may occur via high sensitivity people learning on a low level at a young age to completely filter out a ton of percieved  noises so they're not overwhelming, but there's no single conclusive explanation)</p></div>		</li>
