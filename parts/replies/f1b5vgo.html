			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the chart. It helps explain to me how I was able to basically survive on 5ish hours of sleep each night without much issue in college.  </p>
<p>I've always found that I've either got to hit that 5ish hour window, or push it out closer to 8 hours. There's a band in there somewhere where if I wake up, I'm just terribly tired all day, but a hour less or more sleep and I'm fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The cycles last for ~90 minutes. So, if possible, you want to try to nail 1.5h, 3h, 4.5h, 6h, or 7.5h, depending on your time privilege, to maximize the feel good factor. Fits your experience quite well, eh?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I don't understand is how some people can take a 30 minute nap. I need to sleep for 3 hours during a nap. Plus it takes me 30-45 minutes to fall asleep so I have to budget 4 hours for a mid day nap. But if I do that I can actually go out at night and have fun partying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are way too many factors per individual - and per day - for consistent timings like that to be set. It might help him understand how those gaps are bad places to wake up, but as far as timing your sleep you need to use an app like Sleep Cycle that listens to your breathing to detect wakefulness within a time window and gently wake you up. </p>
<p>I super recommend that.. it’s really unsettling to be honest, I find myself waking up and then hearing my alarm ten seconds later all of the time. The truth is I’m always awake at those times naturally, it’s just that no memories are being retained because there is no stimulus!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So basically it depends on whether you wake up from deep or light sleep</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Incidentally, that's also a determining factor of whether or not you remember your dreams. You're much more likely to remember if you slip into wakefulness from REM, quite literally popping straight out of a dream.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember using an app a few years ago that would try to figure out which part of the sleep cycle you were in, and it would wake you at the optimal time. It was basically a fancy alarm clock app where you set a range of time to wake up rather than a specific minute, but I don't know how accurate it was. I believe it was recommended that you leave your phone on your bed or near your pillow or something so it could sense movement.</p></div>		</li>
