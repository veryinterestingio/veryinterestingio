			<div class="markdown"><p>This is pretty thorough. The only thing I would add is a very minor clarification for OP. They're never really &quot;empty&quot;, just &quot;depleted&quot;. It's a question of economics. As production carries on, the cost of getting hydrocarbons out of the reservoir rises. Eventually it rises to the point where the value of the product extracted doesn't pay those costs. So production stops with some amount of oil &amp; gas still in the ground.</p>
<p>As commodity prices rise, production might start up again. New technology can also restart production in fields that had previously been economically inviable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true, and in many cases dictates the extent to which fields transition from primary to secondary or tertiary production (and as you say, means that fields that were &quot;exhausted&quot; before have been reactivated as new methods come on line or the price is high enough), but the point stands that economics aside, short of physically mining the reservoir, there is no real viable way to fully extract all the oil from a reservoir.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>true but as technology changes more can be extracted.  In new wells existing pressure is enough for the oil to flow, then pumps are added (lots of different pump types - just pumps are really interesting) when the flow decreases, them depending on the geology and available resources you can drill additional wells, start horizontal drilling  or flood the field with water or natural gas or carbon dioxide.  Steam injection can also be used for heavy oils fire flooding has also been used. - I forgot you can also hydro frack or add acid there are lots of things you can do to increase the flow of oil</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worth nothing this diminishing returns theory is the same logic used for industrial accidents like oil spills. 100% is impossible, but the levels underneath that like 50%, 80% 75% etc. Are used. Nobody ever agrees to clean up 100% of their mess, just a phased approach where they agree to a timeline and a money pledge to get to a certain amount (hopefully) or face further fines. Measuring this is nearly impossible and almost moved is held accountable past the initial public facing (PR campaign) cleanup phase because the costs to assess for the regulatory bodies is too high. Easier to just go after someone else. That one stuck with me, almost sounds like our tax system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To explain why the cost rises, it's primarily because of dilution by water and reduced reservoir fluid pressure.</p>
<p>When producing oil or gas there's always some &quot;produced water&quot; along with it, because the pore spaces in an oil reservoir aren't occupied by 100% oil, and because the water eventually infiltrates inwards from the edges of the area that is saturated with oil or gas, and starts mixing with it.  So, over time you might get 80% oil and 20% water at the start, then 50-50, then 80% water, 20% oil.  You can keep on pumping, but what you're getting out is less and less valuable and the water costs more and more to dispose of safely.</p>
<p>On top of that, the pressure of the reservoir may drop over time and make it more difficult to pump (reinjecting water at the edges of the field helps), and the compaction that was mentioned earlier can also reduce the porosity and permeability and do the same.</p>
<p>There are various techniques to enhance the recovery (secondary and tertiary recovery), but in the end, if you get 40% recovery of the oil that is in place (the &quot;recovery factor&quot;), that's pretty good.  Occasionally it's higher [Edit: with a <em>lot</em> of intensive tertiary recovery], but it's often lower.  Normally over half the oil that is there stays in the ground as uneconomic to produce.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In some cases over usage combined with the soil properties cause sinkholes. There was a very detailed problem in a Turkish Youtuber's channel. In Konya region which has about third of underground water reserves of the country, currently there are over 20 sinkholes and due to bad farming it is increasing.</p>
<p>Language in Turkish but you can see what I am talking about from the video:</p>
