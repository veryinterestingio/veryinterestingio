<p>Hi. No, there is no difference between the aurora borealis and aurora australis. They are caused in the same way by the same process and at the same time. When charged particles (electrons) are accelerated into the Earth's upper atmosphere they go equally to the north and the south. But we don't always see them the same because the conditions that the particles are hitting are different. For example, when it is winter in the north it is summer in the south, so the atmosphere will be colder in one hemisphere than the other. Also, if it is 24hr daylight you won't see the aurora in that hemisphere, but the aurora will still be happening even if you can't see it. Satellites in space can see the aurora in the ultraviolet wavelengths, so they can see the aurora even in daylight so they know it is still there.</p>
<p>The location where the aurora occurs directly overhead relates to magnetic field lines of the Earth that are breaking and reconnecting, which is what accelerates the charged particles into that atmosphere and causes the aurora. During the course of an aurora display the colours and lines will move across the sky. Generally it begins with a wide arc of green stretched east-west across the sky. It will gradually build and move south, then &quot;break up&quot; where it becomes more contorted and twisted and there may be more movement. As the display calms down again the arc will move north. This cycle can repeat and can last about half an hour or so. For more details of the process and what's going on you might enjoy my book, Aurora: In Search of the Northern Lights <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Aurora-Northern-Dr-Melanie-Windridge/dp/0008156115/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1460708740&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Aurora-Northern-Dr-Melanie-Windridge/dp/0008156115/ref=tmm\_pap\_swatch\_0?\_encoding=UTF8&qid=1460708740&sr=1-1" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.co.uk/Aurora-Northern-Dr-Melanie-Windridge/dp/0008156115/ref=tmm\_pap\_swatch\_0?\_encoding=UTF8&qid=1460708740&sr=1-1</a></a></p></div>		</li>
