			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree. I run my fast leg 2nd on the 4x1, because I can manipulate the exchange zone to give them a longer distance to run than the others. My 2nd leg usually runs about 115-120m, while my first leg and third leg only do about 90.  Additionally, they are running on the straightaway, which will obviously give them a faster time than if they were on the curve.</p></div>		</li>
