			<div class="markdown"><p>That is true. However if you have manufactured and sold something that is impacted by heat, it’s easier to stamped “Top Rack Only” or “Hand Wash Only” versus “can be placed anywhere inside a dishwasher if you don’t have a heating element or use an eco mode that doesn’t use the heating element if it is so equipped”. That just doesn’t have the same roll off the tongue feel. :)</p></div>		</li>

I keep reading it over and over, and the best is that by the time I get down to the fourth or fifth line, I’ve already forgotten what it said so I get to laugh at it all over again. Plus I learned something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All dishwashers have a heating element because without it they could not clean since they rely on heat.</p>
<p>Instead what some models do is place the heating element in or beside the circulation motor in the sump. What you may be thinking of are models with the exposed heating element at the base of the tub. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do they dry or run a sanitize cycle then?  I have never seen one like that.</p>
<p>I guess it could have a separate non exposed element to still heat the water or create steam to sanitize, but I can't come up with how they would dry without some sort of hearing element.</p></div>		</li>
