			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm so if we're talking about a hollow sphere there would be no gravity exerted on the shell at any given point? This blows my mind. I never considered it would cancel out.</p>
<p>Edit - just to be clear it doesn't matter how thick the shell is because it increases the mass on the opposite side too? I'm picturing a planet sized sphere - perhaps a dyson sphere. If I were human sized standing in the inside of this sphere I be would be pulled off the ground upwards towards the center ( hollowed area )? Effectively floating</p></div>		</li>

<p>Youâ€™re missing the most important clause of that statement in the theorem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All parts of the shell would be pulled inward. The center of gravity would be in the middle (assuming a perfect sphere).</p>
<p>It'd only be stable so long as the strength of the material exceeds the force of gravity.</p></div>		</li>
