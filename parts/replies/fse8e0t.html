			<div class="markdown"><p>In college I unloaded tractor trailers for lowes with 2 other guys. Sometimes we would get &quot;appliance&quot; trucks in that ONLY had appliances. The Samsungs were among the heaviest.</p>
<p>You'd have thought we were body builders if you saw us outside of work. I didnt even realize I was getting ripped until my shirt got soaked and I had to take it off, one of the night stockers was like &quot;dude, id fucking kill to look like that&quot;.</p>
<p>That was one of the best jobs I ever had, it never felt like work, ever. It felt like going to the gym everyday. And the manager was damn thankful for it, the turn over rate was so high in unloading, 90% of the time it was just us 3. I saw 16 people come and go over 2 years + years of that job. Some people would not even last the first week. The work was hard, but good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The joint damage comes from inflammation, not weight. Loading a joint actually makes it stronger. Thatˋs why ”fat” Powerlifters and such have really “strong” joints.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like this answer.   I'm a physician and I often obtain CT scans on patients in which we see a lot of adipose (fat) and not much muscle.   There was a concept of &quot;fat but fit&quot; which has been a subject of controversy and debate,  but it's clear that obese patients are a heterogeneous group with wide differences in overall fitness and muscularity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yes, definitely agree, it's a heterogeneous group, and people aren't all the same. I think &quot;fat but fit&quot; would probably better fit an endomorph athlete such as a wrestler, who is still in decent shape but has some excess mass, but they may not necessarily be obese. I have been to jujitsu classes with some guys and girls who would be considered obese but they can move surprisingly well! What it means for their organs, I don't know, but they do have my respect nonetheless</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same, until recently. Im f/5'9&quot; and walked around for 9 of the last 10 years of my (almost 40 year long) life ~220 lbs. Through more than half of that time I had a physical job but was def still borderline for my health to start going down hill if changes weren't made. I was very athletic when I was younger, thru HS, in amazing shape, weighed ~160 lbs. due to my build. I subsequently went through treatment (successful) for leukemia, and have since had a kid and my genetics' response to those hormonal changes makes me carry belly fat that will never go away now, so getting back to ~160 lbs. would be out of the question. Getting back into the kind of cardio shape isn't though. </p>
<p>I've lost ~45 lbs in the last year. Primarily from reducing my intake, which was the front end of the problem. The reduction in intake was sparked by a tragic event in my life. I didn't eat hardly at all for about 2 weeks after. During that time my stomach had begun to shrink. Since then I notice more how full I feel as I'm eating and just eat smaller portions most of the time. Now that I've lost the weight I need to get better about the food choices I'm making, and start taking advantage of the opportunity I have to better my heart/lung situation, which is pretty meh atm. Still have physical job.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the muscles that move that weight are primarily the large muscles, not the small stabilizer muscles that are important for effectively using the larger muscles.  This is one factor in the joint damage obese people suffer from.</p></div>		</li>
