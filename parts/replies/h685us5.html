			<div class="markdown"><p>I am surprised only this comment mentions menopause. Menopause is a bit of an evolutionary puzzle since, on its face, an individual who can't have children doesnt help the species propagate.</p>
<p>Except they do! Older females help the next generation (and the generation after) to propagate the species.</p>
<p>So the existence of menopause itself may be an evolutionary trick to help a species propagate and this we would expect species that have menopause would have relationships OP is talking about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. According to the “grandmother hypothesis,” humans evolved to have menopause, it wasn’t just a mistake or an indication you should be dead, because it takes SO much work to raise tiny humans and there is so much to be gained by more nurturing, that having a grandmother devoted to care for grandchildren was more evolutionarily beneficial than continuing to be fertile and having more kids after age 40 or so (I say 40 because while we now are pretty fertile beyond age 40 due to nutrition and lifestyle, evolutionarily fertility was low after 40 and menopause happened earlier on average than today’s average of 51).</p></div>		</li>
