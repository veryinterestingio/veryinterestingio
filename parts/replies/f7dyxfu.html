			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, provided the particles were small enough and far enough apart that they don't perturb other rings with their gravity. This is a very contrived arrangement that you wouldn't expect to occur naturally. This is how you might realistically build a Dyson sphere though - as a &quot;Dyson swarm&quot; of satellites covering the surface of the Sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. The equator would need to shift slow enough for enough matter to form a ring but fast enough for it to shift onto a new plane. The likelihood of this happening are nearly zero. Having said that,  so is your birth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It <em>could</em> occur naturally, since the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_limit" target="_blank">Roche Limit</a> of a satellite depends on its mass and rigidity, you could have a planet where moons orbiting perpendicular to each other both passed their Roche limits, one of which was close to the planet and the other far away.</p>
<p>Of course, it isn't common for planets to have moons orbiting outside the regular plane either. Most likely path I see is if the outer moon was a huge, loose comet which got captured in the planet's gravity after the rest of the system formed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What kinds of problems would you expect if we set up the swarm to all have a magnetic charge to repel one another? They would never collide, but would the force of the repelling be about to throw them off their orbit?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A major problem I haven't seen addressed is the geography of the planets. Because they're oblate objects. Some inclinations are more difficult to maintain than others. </p>
<p>You're going to need a way to correct these orbits if you want a perfect shell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A sphere isn't stable.  It could exist in an unstable configuration possibly due to a collision or something throwing debris at a planet.  In both cases, you are not likely to get a perfect sphere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think personally very few things in nature is perfect, but even an imperfect sphere would count as a sphere around a planet for me, but if I understood correctly, due to gravity's unequal pull it could destabilize the system of the sphere as collisions would occur until it settled down into a more stable position, commonly a sphere... I think</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not <em>could</em> destabilize the system, <em>would</em> destabilize the system.</p>
<p>To maintain a circular orbit above the planets surface, the plane of the orbit must pass through the center of the planet.  This means that if we tried to construct a bunch of planar rings like Saturns rings, those rings would have to cross each other's paths in order to be a stable orbit.  This necessarily means that the ring material will strike each other and destroy themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably the closest natural equivalent that does exist is globular clusters. Do a Google image search, they are gorgeous celestial objects. But they are also made of thousands of stars orbitting a common center of gravity, not a planet - and they only look globular because we are so far away we can't fully distinguish all the individual stars in a telescope, they aren't actually close enough together to collide.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Elliptical galaxies too. You can get a spherical shape if the &quot;particles&quot; don't collide, and star systems almost never collide with each other. You might get a few mergers in a globular cluster, but not enough.</p>
<p>Also, dark matter halos - the DM particles shouldn't collide with each other either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All the planets you see now in our galaxy, were once swirling levels of dust and smaller debris similar to saturn rings. The debris started clumping together colliding with other particles in a similar orbit, and formed planets or fell into the sun.</p>
<p>Saturns rings too will eventually clump together and likely fall into saturn or form tiny moon(s). The smaller debris making the rings, will eventually lead to larger solid bodies.</p></div>		</li>
