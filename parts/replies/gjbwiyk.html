			<div class="markdown"><p>You should try to take apart a small electric motor sometime. They are surprisingly simple and basically a small electric motor is the same thing as a generator it is just running in the opposite direction, instead of being moved to create electricity it is getting electricity so it can move.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Motors are generators in reverse.</p>
<p>Microphones are also kinda like speakers in reverse.</p>
<p>And another thing....? All large scale power generation really ends up being one thing...</p>
<p>End state: magnet spins in a coil of wire
How does the magnet spin? Magnet is spun because it's connected to a spinning turbine.
How does the turbine spin? It's turned by steam
How is steam generated? A pool of water is heated.</p>
<p>Coal power? Coal is burned, which heats up a pool of water, which turns to steam, which spins a turbine, which spins a magnet inside a coil of wire</p>
<p>Nuclear power? Nuclear reaction generates heat, which heats up a pool of water, which turns to steam, which spins a turbine, which spins a magnet inside a coil of wire </p>
<p>Solar power? Solar panels are used to generate heat, which heats up a pool of water, which turns to steam, which spins a turbine, which spins a magnet inside a coil of wire</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In alternating current (the kind that comes out of the socket), the electrons just run back and forth in place. Think about if you had a big pile of rocks on one side of a field, and some guy running back and forth, picking up a rock and moving it to the other side of the field. The guy is the electron here <em>edit</em> and moving the rocks is the work being done.</p>
<p>In direct current (the kind that comes out of a battery), the electrons run in a loop. That’s why there’s a positive and a negative side. So now think about a kid <em>edit</em>(the electron) <em>/edit</em> going down a water slide over and over. He climbs up the big ladder (the battery) and then slides down the water slide, then runs back around to the ladder to go again. <em>edit</em> (Going down the slide is the work.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it's not a complete answer but electricity isn't really the electrons. Electrons move through a wire at a positively glacial speed. What matters is the electromagnetic field, which propagates at the speed of light.</p>
<p>So using electricity doesn't &quot;use up&quot; a supply of electrons.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If I turn on a light bulb in my house, did the electron that runs through the filament literally travel all the way from the power generation station? </p>
<p>So is it like a river with a current?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They have made plastic magnets in the lab but it's difficult and they're not as strong as metal magnets.</p>
<p>Problem is when you make plastic you melt it and the election/atom orientation goes gooey too (edit: not really but ELI5). But if you melt it just right...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why electricity only works in closed loops, otherwise called circuits - as more electrons are pushed out of the coil, they push the ones already in the wire, and they push the next ones, etc, until eventually the ones in the last little stretch of wire push their way back into the other end of the coil.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, what about sticking a light bulb in that closed loop? Some energy is lost to create that light / heat -- does that come from the electrons running through it? If so, what replaces <em>those</em> electrons in that closed circuit?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The electrons are not being pushed out of the coil. The charge is not created by moving electrons. Electrons can move through 2 mm copper wire at 8.4 cm / hour and this isn't what is causing the current. The electrons are facilitating a charge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it a bit like the water in your central heating system. It gets heated in the boiler (given energy), then pumped to the radiators where it dissipates that energy into your room, then comes back to the boiler again, a bit colder (less energy).</p>
<p>Unless you've had a malfunction, you should be able to run central heating without having to add or remove any water from the system (apart from at setup).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends if we're talking AC or DC. In DC, they leave, and are replenished by elections being pushed into the other end of the coil (the circuit). Think of a pulley belt going a constant speed. In AC, they are pushed out then pulled back in. Think of a pulley belt switching directions on a regular beat.</p></div>		</li>
