			<div class="markdown"><p>It's far more than that - marketing is going beyond merely passively inviting you into the shop.  we're seeing the beginnings of behavior modification.  For example, top marketers know there's a &quot;loyalty&quot; window at big events during your life, like buying a house or having a child.  If they grab you during this window, you're likely to spend more at their store vs a competitor until the next life event.   There's also price discrimination - for example, some airlines and products will increase the price of goods if you're searching from an Apple device (but it gets worse the more they know), as opposed to an android.  There's even some rumblings of bank in-house algorithms that check your social media against those they know to be credit risks based on data (including credit score) - the more connections with risky individuals, the worse rates you may get or you may even get denied.  (No, that isn't just China)</p>
<p>Some marketing relies on GPS data, knowing your habits (like when you go to a store) and then combines it with a geo fence (a set location around a shop that pays for the service) they will hit you with ads or prioritize them in the search.     The scariest thing is you don't really know how your decisions are being manipulated.</p>
<p>Edit: one thing I forgot - some places give free wi-fi to track users' movements throughout the store and often that's what the store &quot;app&quot; is doing too (in addition to collecting habit data).  They're also doing it using your normal phone transmitted data (cell tower ping - I forget what it's called).  Your phone is also listening to you, particularly through apps you download.  Ever wonder why you have a conversation about, say spaghetti, with your phone near you and you're getting shown ads about it?  Now you know.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They have far more efficient ways of tracking your preferences.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On-device processing is entirely adequate for picking up keywords with minimal accuracy (after all, OK Google works and has for years; the tech has improved a lot since then). It doesn't need to be perfect; no-one will notice if you get the odd word completely wrong and send some weird ads.</p>
<p>That said, I haven't seen any evidence beyond 'I had a conversion about something odd and suddenly got ads'.</p>
<p>Might make an interesting science fair project to try and empirically test it.</p>
<p>I believe it's possible with adequate skills to replace the certs on the phone, MITM it, and inspect the traffic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I know, the 'I got ads for X after a conversation about X' comes from the ad supplier knowing you were very close to a person that has an interest in X, and X would be fitting in your profile.</p>
<p>I do not have any sources on this, however, I read an article months ago about this, so take it with a grain of salt. It does seem a lot more plausible to me than nonstop eavesdropping, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your last paragraph is flat-out false. You need to provide some pretty hefty sources for such an outlandish claim....</p>
<p>People have been saying this about Facebook for a decade, it doesn't make it true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work in marTech and one of the big value drivers was the identity keychain. Think of every data point that’s collected as a key on that ring. You’ll buy generic laundry detergent but always pay for name brand OTC drugs. You subscribe to streaming channels but pay extra to get the game. You used to buy diapers years ago, but now you’re looking at graphing calculators (and why they never go on sale). Tons of seemingly unrelated items that are collected and stored on that ring. </p>
<p>As a marketer, I want to sell my new widget, and I combine some research with assumptions and a soupçon of gut instinct to define what I think my customer looks like and buy ad impressions (ie getting eyeballs on a banner ad on a website) targeting the people who I THINK my customers are. </p>
<p>Then, if I have a ton of money and fancy software, I can take the advertisements that were sent out and focus on the prospective customers who bought. Looking at their orders, I have no idea what makes them similar. But I can input that back into the software and say hey, let’s ONLY send ads to people who resemble these people (by way of their shared identity keychain attributes). </p>
<p>There are 3 “types” of data being used:</p>
<ul>
<li>1st party data: I go on Chewy.com, I buy a bag of sensitive stomach dog food, pay for it and provide my shipping/billing details. The data they collected in that transaction is first party data because they collected it from me, their customer. </li>
<li>2nd party data: this is the one that’s often forgotten, in my experience. Basically, 2 companies who have aligned interests share data. If I make peanut butter, I might be VERY interested in what data the jelly producers might have on their customers. So I set up an agreement with them to do co-marketing, buy the data, whatever, and then I get a big list of jelly customer data. It’s first party data to Jelly Co but second party to me at Peanut Butter Inc. </li>
<li>3rd party data: this comes from all over the place, but basically if I don’t have enough data on my own and there aren’t companies willing to partner with me, I can straight up buy the data. Everything from your transactions on your credit card to the brand of cereal you always buy with your grocery store loyalty card is fair game to buy as long as it’s in the T&amp;C’s you signed that they might sell it. </li>
</ul>
<p>A few caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li>these are REALLY basic examples and don’t go into the rules around anonymizing data and when you can de-anonymize non-first party data </li>
<li>a lot of the tech behind this will change when cookies are no longer “a thing”</li>
<li>there are more players in the data game than most people would like to believe, meaning the upside is HUGE. </li>
<li>this is only a TINY SLICE of how data monetization works</li>
</ul></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes,  if knew their work email address.  That would give me their name and company they worked for.</p>
<p>LinkedIn would give me more information, perhaps their Twitter account.</p>
<p>Twitter account may give me their Facebook page </p>
<p>Facebook would give me photos of their local area and groups they belong to.  One may be a local group stating the area they live in.</p>
<p>Phone records would then give me their address</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about stuff like other random websites they go on. Could they find out what porn sites they’re signed up to? I’m not signed up to any (it’s all free what’s the point) but was just curious. Could an individual find out what people buy online?</p></div>		</li>
