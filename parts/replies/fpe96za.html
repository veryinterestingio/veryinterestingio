			<div class="markdown"><p>Most spiders don't have feet like geckos (though some spiders do, such as <em>Philodromus dispar</em>, which has <a href="https://jeb.biologists.org/content/jexbio/215/1/179/F1.large.jpg" target="_blank">these feet</a>) but instead <a href="https://i.redd.it/z208wcorxzx11.jpg" target="_blank">uses little hooks</a> to grip and climb and if a surface is too smooth then a spider can't get a grip. Enamel, the stuff bath tubs are coated with, is also smooth like glass, but it could potentially be made more slippery by soap scum or cleaning agent residue (or at least be cleaned more often than windows).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Please stop talking out of your ass. First you claim that windows are dustier and therefore easier to adhere to, despite the fact that surface roughness has virtually no effect on adhesion to any surface, and ignoring that there is no reason to believe that dust has a stronger adhesive or cohesive strength than the spider legs themselves. Then you claim that soap scum would make the surface of a tub &quot;more slippery&quot;, despite the fact that soap scum is a solid material that is strongly adhered to the tub, which should improve adhesion by your own logic.</p></div>		</li>
