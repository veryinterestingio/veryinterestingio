			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question. Round-trip efficiency (RTE) is an important part of the overall value equation. If, for example, you charge the PSH system during low-price hours, store the energy for several hours, and then discharge onto the grid, higher RTE losses means the price differentials must be greater to make up for the lost energy, which come at a cost.</p>
<p>As part of the cost and performance characterization study PNNL just completed for the US DOE (Kendall Mongird was the primary author), we researched this question by reviewing extensive literature, holding discussions with industry stakeholders, and collecting surveys from manufacturers and developers. We evaluated the RTE for six battery technologies and four non-battery technologies. Here are the results: PSH (80%), lithium-ion battery systems (86%), sodium-sulfur batteries (75%), redox flow batteries (67.5%), compressed air energy storage (52%), flywheel (86%), ultracapacitors (92%), lead-acid (72%), sodium metal halide (83%), and zinc-hybrid cathode (72%).</p>
<p>You have probably heard much higher RTEs for batteries. We have completed extensive testing on several battery technologies. When you include losses during rest, auxiliary loads, temperature fluctuations and other factors, real-world RTEs are lower than those commonly reported.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is that the case just for battery storage?  How to real-world RTEs for PSH compare to what is commonly reported in the literature?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is more of an issue for battery storage, and some chemistries are more consistent than others. We’ve recently completed extensive testing of Li-ion and flow battery systems. The Li-ion tests yielded fairly consistent results, with RTE averaging between the high 70s up to 90% depending on how the batteries are used, the ambient temperature when the operation is completed, and the rest between operations. The flow battery system tested in the 39-71% RTE range. The issue is that if you test in a laboratory setting with consistent temperatures, exclude auxiliary loads, and follow duty cycles that are advantageous to the efficiency outcome, RTEs will be higher. Just as the deviation between reported values and reality are lower for Li-ion batteries relative to other chemistries, it is lower yet for PSH because the factors listed above have little impact because PSH aux loads are always part of the base system and are small compared to the huge energy output of the PSH. Similarly, PSH can’t be configured and tested in a laboratory under ideal conditions. PSH is a more mature technology, with over 100 years of operation. Thus, it’s performance is more consistent and well documented.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey,  that's really cool. Could you provide a link to the report? Are most of the RTE losses in PSH due to the pump process or the generation process? Electrical or mechanical? 80% seems pleasantly higher than expected; I would have guessed 40-60%.</p>
<p>I'm in the motor control field but at a much smaller scale (100-1000W)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm also interested in how this efficiency compares to other energy storage methods.  Also, say I build a water storage tank to do this because I don't have access to a natural basin.  How does this compare to the cost of a battery?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you do not have a natural basin it is really quite expensive.</p>
<p>I'll give you an example. Let's say New York decided to replace the Chrysler building with a big box, dimensions 70 x 70 x 300 meters (so the Chrysler building would approximately fit inside), with the entire interior used as a water tank. It would have an energy storage capacity of 2.2 TJ assuming 100% efficiency. This is about 600 MWh, which is enough energy to power Manhattan for roughly 20 minutes.</p>
<p>An equivalent amount of lithium-ion batteries would cost under $100M at today's wholesale prices. I doubt you can build that box for under $100M, let alone the turbomachinery.</p>
<p>Just for fun, if you decided to fill the Chrysler-building-sized box with lithium-ion batteries, it would store enough energy to power Manhattan for 8 days (assuming 250 Wh/L; newer models would do better). Even the relatively space-inefficient nickel-iron or lead-acid batteries would provide roughly a full day of power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like your analogy, no you could not build it even close to $100M. The Chrysler building is 1,000,000 SF. $100/SF would not even be close. Mainly because Manhattan construction costs are drastically marked up compared to rural construction.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Batteries use very bad chemicals, which are expensive. (Lithium and a couple others).</p>
<p>For the simplest type of engine and reservoir you don't need all of this, only copper for the spools(of the Dynamo/motor) and some material as a case.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you have to build it from scratch (rather than e.g. digging a hill or mountain) then not really, you need a lot of weight very high to store a lot of energy. s'why I don't really believe in the &quot;stack concrete blocks with crane&quot; energy storage thing. Pumped hydro works because you can store ridiculous amounts of water (millions of m³ / billions of gallons), which translates to large amounts of energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To me, this is a method for making renewables economical. You’re going to lose energy doing this, but it makes the unpredictable generation of renewables, more predictable. Pretty neat</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We agree. There are many moving parts as you might imagine. On one hand, PSH can aid in the integration of renewables, particularly large-scale wind. However, renewables offer energy at a very low marginal cost. Note the use of the word marginal in the preceding sentence. There are no fuel costs, so on the margin it’s quite cheap. Renewables lead to more intermittency and deviation between load and generation (which PSH can help) but they also reduce energy prices on the margin, which hurts the bottom line for PSH. Also, PSH plants are typically quite large. Thus, as they reduce transmission congestion and shift regional supply curves, the impact is to dampen prices and damage the value proposition for PSH.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You note that PSH can help mitigate the inconsistencies in renewable generation. To what extent can renewables continue to grow without storage solutions? I assumed this was a critical factor.</p>
<p>Are there storage methods better suited to this application?</p></div>		</li>
