			<div class="markdown"><p>Birds live much longer than small mammals.  This is probably because birds can fly.  Because birds can fly, their risk of predation is lower. Because their risk of predation is lower, they can live longer and reproduce longer on average, and they have reason to adapt to a longer lifespan.  A mouse is going to get eaten in a year or two anyway, so it doesn't need the capacity to live longer.  </p>
<p>You also see this with bats (live longer than similar sized mammals) and ground birds (shorter lifespans)</p>
