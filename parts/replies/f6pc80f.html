			<div class="markdown"><p>Further to this: when a woman gives birth there can be a time where this confusion hits a critical mass. The woman who he has been sexual with now falls into the category of Madonna / mother. An object that should not be desired. For the woman in this situation it is usually internalized as her fault he no longer desires her. “Perhaps he doesn’t want me because my body has changed.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see what you are saying. I read Priscilla’s book. She denies there was any kind of sexual relationship before they got married but I don’t believe that was true. I think her becoming a mother put her firmly in the non child category. His fetishes about purity and white underpants might not have been about the Madonna but more about innocence and virginity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is crazy how it even happens today. As a woman you get more views, likes, follows (our version of iconography today) the more skin you show, the bigger your butt is, the bigger your breasts are. Modern expectations of motherhood are near impossible to maintain to the point where most moms feel like bad moms no matter how good they are doing. I think the Madonna/Whore complex is becoming less of an issue. Men are are more accepting of mentally and sexually powerful women. That women enjoy and have sex too without being whores, and that they are still desirable marriage partners. With so many people waiting much longer to get married until well into 30s, it is just not feasible to expect a “pure” woman.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was a while ago so I don't really remember, but I was young and didn't want to have sex yet, and especially didn't feel emotionally ready.  So instead of communicating our different expectations, he straight-up stopped talking to me.  This was after we had a few make-out sessions and he kept trying to take it further.</p>
<p>I think my mom was trying to say he put me into the &quot;whore&quot; box, and when I wouldn't sleep with him I became useless to him.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit: To clarify, she was trying to emphasize that he wasn't worth the trouble.  My mom wasn't calling me a whore!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can recognize symptoms described in psych literature without making a diagnosis, and this happens all the time. For example I could notice my friend was isolating himself without deciding he has anxiety and depression.</p>
<p>In other words, it's silly to assume that mom in this story &quot;thought he had pyschological development problems&quot;. She just described a common pattern that related to her daughter's experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the part where Freud is wrong. It's not a psychological problem. It's a societal problem. Men in our society are in effect taught this. Our culture creates this dichotomy between the pure virgin and the kinky slut who wants to have sex. </p>
<p>Consider the &quot;girl next door&quot; vs. the bombshell, or the &quot;girl you'd take home to mom&quot; versus the girl into kinky sex. It's part of the culture to divide women in this way. </p>
<p>Freud noticed a real phenomenon, but incorrectly assumed it was just a few mentally unwell individuals who would believe it. Instead, it's just about how strongly they accept what their culture says on this subject.</p></div>		</li>

<p>i think that misses the point in the same way freud did. this is a <em>people</em> thing, with freud's fixation reflecting his era's focus on male-centric reasoning for damn near everything. <em>people</em> have a propensity to view themselves and others in dualistic, polarizing fashion that expresses in a multitude of ways.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>or society</p>
</blockquote>
<p>while this is closer to the mark, i think it'd be reasonable to test as to whether <em>women</em> do this - especially when they speak about rival women. your promiscuous best friend would <em>never</em> hurt anyone (and how dare you judge her promiscuity) - until she sleeps with that guy/girl you liked, in which case, <em>that whore</em>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I had a girl who hooked up with like 30-40 guys before she started dating me tell me that she felt wrong for wanting to have sex with me because it was wrong to &quot;want to hook up with her boyfriend&quot; as if love and sex are two separate things that can't be mutually inclusive. I always assumed she just didn't find me attractive or that she was just cheating on me on the down low. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had a girl once stop talking to me because we did sexting things. Everything was going super well for a few weeks, very good connection, a lot of flirting. And then after we sexted, not even real sex just sexting, she had to stop talking to me because she no longer felt an attraction. Could've just been that I wasn't very good :) but if she was serious, this Madonna-Whore thing seems very compelling.</p></div>		</li>
