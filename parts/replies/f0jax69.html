			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're happy with a shampoo+conditioner you would probably be happier with a higher quality shampoo that you use much less of (just barely enough to bubble your head).  Most people use harsh shampoo and way too much of it because they are taught bubbles = good. If you have short hair, conditioner is most likely unnecessary. If you have long hair, a separate conditioner is a must.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>if you rinse and it doesnt feel clean = you didnt get full coverage.  What gives you the impression that you need to touch every follicle with bubbles for your head to get clean? I had this habit for a long time too, but i have found that using like 1/4 of the shampoo i used to works even better for how my hair looks, and my head doesnt itch and get dry.</p></div>		</li>
