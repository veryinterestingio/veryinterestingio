			<div class="markdown"><p>Multiple problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>contamination: it's rare to have plastics that are clean. Most if not all have dirt on them - food or whatever else was stored in the plastics, ink, glue, coloring agents, aluminium foil/lid remnants and similar. Unlike glass or metal where melting it down simply burns up contaminants, it's hard and expensive to get plastic waste clean enough to put them back into manufacturing - especially for food containers.</li>
<li>compound plastics. Many if not most plastic products are not consisting of a single type of plastic - while stuff like a soda bottle is 99% PET (with the exception of the cap), something like a pack of cheese is actually consisting of <em>at least</em> two types - a hard-ish package and a soft lid. Consumers usually don't separate the two parts mechanically, thus the packaging is unrecyclable.</li>
<li>Multi-layer plastics. These are even <em>worse</em> since customers can't separate the layers of plastics themselves and machines can't either.</li>
</ol>
<p>The result? Most plastics are burned for energy, down-cycled to stuff like dampening mats or street filler, dumped in landfills or dumped somewhere in the environment.</p>
<p>Current research is going on with solvents - think of stuff like acetone, that break down the polymers to their original monomeres (e.g. ethylene). This is difficult for a number of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>since you have mixed plastics coming in, you need to have the waste go through <em>multiple</em> rounds of different solvents to break down the various plastics and layers.</li>
<li>solvents are... well, you ever opened a can of nail polish remover? They're volatile as hell meaning you have emissions issues and a non-zero explosion risk.</li>
<li>it takes a lot of energy to get the monomeres back <em>out</em> of the solvent solution, which means that <em>for now</em> it's orders of magnitude cheaper to simply make new plastics than to go the recovery route.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Re: point one, I was at a facility not long ago that collects rubbish from the beach and prepares it to be recycled into new products. They’d already sorted it (including by colour) and had us scrub it down with steel wool, scrubbing brushes, and toothbrushes to remove contaminants before tossing it in the shredder. This HAD to be done by hand, including cutting open anything enclosed so we could get at the inside. It’s not a very fast process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why wouldn't the contaminants just rise to the top/stay at the bottom, allowing for separation?  For the multiple plastic type issue, couldn't they just have big filters since they'd have different melting points?  Generally speaking, most plastics are made of only  a couple different combinations, so the vast majority of plastic could be separated with only 3 vats.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Polymer scientist here, most commonly used plastics (polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene) are made by radical polymerization which has three main steps: initiation (start) , propagation (&quot;polymer growth&quot;), termination (deactivation of reactive functionalities).
This last step makes it impossible to add more monomer.
As to fuse &quot;degraded polymers&quot; it would be impossible as there are no reactive functionalities to &quot;stick them back together&quot; (due again to the termination step)
With this in mind you can see why it's so hard to completely recycle these types of polymers.
Some types of polymers based on another type of polymerization (polycondensation) could I suppose be repolymerized with new monomers , but you have to keep in mind that it is very difficult to reprocess these polymers and to obtain properties similar to the original material.
Sadly what you propose is impossible in most common cases and in the cases where it would be possible it would be very difficult to process (time,money , energy cost) and you wouldn't even obtain similar properties.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sigh, poor PET, always gets listed first. Well sorted PET can be recycled almost as well as glass. Glass can't be used indefinitely because it gets contaminated too, and PET has the same problem. The way recycling plastic is currently handled ruins the potential of a really good material. Not the fault of the &quot;plastic&quot; in this case.</p>
<p>Others do degenerate no matter how carefully they're sorted and treated. And if some of the pseudo-biodegradable materials get mixed in, you can maybe use it for park benches or mix it into asphalt, it's too brittle to become anything decent anymore.</p></div>		</li>
