<p>Hire / do lobbying on the part of workers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lets say you are a recent graduate, you are in debt, you need a job right out of school. You get interviews for your position at two companies, one unionized and one not unionized.</p>
<p>For the non-unionized job, they offer you 38k a year with 2 weeks vacation. You don't know how to access information about average salaries, you are in debt and behind in payments, and they say they have many applicants and need an answer by monday, and that it is non-negotiable. They stress that unions require you to pay over a hundred dollars a month in fees, and you can negotiate salary increases yourself at anytime (that will routinely be rejected or pushed into the future), you'll end up making more money in the longer term. With unions they say, it is impossible to hire and promote young guns like you, as they protect old employees long past when they should have retired. When something goes wrong and you feel mistreated, you are on your own to research and pay for a legal team, and it is always you vs a large company.</p>
<p>For the unionized job, they offer you 45k with 2 weeks vacations and some performance/overtime bonuses. When it is time to negotiate salary, the union does it on your behalf bringing to bear the collective knowledge of all employees salaries, the market trends, cost of living, and likely information about the companies balance sheet. With fees you would end up taking home 43k + bonuses. When you get sick, the union represents and protects you. When you are injured, same thing. If they want to fire you, a union rep is there and backing you against the company.</p>
<p>The best proof of how good unions are for employees, are how much some companies fight them. They aren't fighting them because the companies are interested in their employees, but because they know unions, backed by decades and thousands of studies, result in higher salaries, more protection, and a more powerful, well treated workforce.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's crazy that as a teenager I was brainwashed with all that antiunion bullshit. My high school history and economics classes were rife with it. I left high school believing unions were my enemy.</p>
<p>Now, having worked in my field both covered by a union and not, under a union I see consistent pay increases, ample paid leave, scheduling consistency (I work in a 24/7 operation), and when I point out bad practice I have people to back me up and make me heard. I had absolutely <em>none</em> of that without a union.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This money comes from 2 places.</p>
<p>1) union dues, every union member pays X into their respective local/international union. This money is the keep the lights on  and keep the lawyers paid money. </p>
<p>2) every hour the employee works the employer (company) pays Z into the respective benefit funds, pension, annuity, medical, education, work preservation. </p>
<p>To break down the second one, if you make $50/hr pay and $40/hr in benefits then it costs the company $90/hr for you to work. Unions want you to look at it like you make $90/hour because you do, that money is paid into your funds to help your union.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dues, but honestly they're almost insignificant.  I was in a union for eleven months and regret not one second.  Sure a lot of old people who sucked at their jobs were there, but I was making good money at an easy job because of my representatives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not the only power, but it's certainly the strongest. Union members can slow down production without actually stopping work (though that's often illegal). They can drum up bad press against the company. Taxi drivers in Europe rather famously jammed up public roads protesting Uber drivers (which served only to piss off the population and inform more people about Uber). And of course they wield enormous political power, both directly through member votes and indirectly through <del>bribes</del> lobbying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well this is partially true. There are many types of work actions that a group can take. They can use the media, letter writing or phone campaigns, etc... to put pressure on management. Strikes are definitely the most powerful weapon unions have, but there are many other tools the group may utilize before resorting to the nuclear option.
