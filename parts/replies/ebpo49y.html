			<div class="markdown"><p>If I'm reading your statement correctly (it's a bit beyond my grade C A-level biology from 20 years ago) do anatomy experts not actually know how the attachment happens/works? Since it would seem there's no distinct join as one tissue(?) blends/transforms  seamlessly into the other?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They know how the attachment work on a cellular level, but it's just that embryologically speaking there is no differentiating line that you can draw (between tendon and bone) because the site of entheses develops as one whole component. Basically the tendon end develops/grows at the site of entheses and is merged from the beginning during the embryological development of the musculoskeletal system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe it would give more clarity to ask/answer what the nature of the connection is. Tendons are collagen tightly bundled to provide appropriate strength, and bones are collagen reinforced with calcium phosphate to provide rigidity, so maybe the clearest answer is that collagen fibers interconnect as usual, and the extent of the bone is just that of this tendon/bone structure which is reinforced with mineral hardening. </p>
<p>I'm nothing close to an expert and I'm sure there's something more to it than that, but I think that comes closer to making this answer fulfilling - is this explanation essentially correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok so on a cellular level how does the cell of a tendon attach to a cell of bone and how do they attach to the &quot;inbetween&quot; cells which are neither tendon nor bone?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To explain it as simply as possible, they kinda morph into each other.  There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion_molecule" target="_blank">adhesive proteins</a> that connect them. The cells themselves transition, from bone to tendon to muscle though. There's no clear line where they do it though. They're kinda &quot;one&quot; yet eventually at some point in the connection there is an obvious collective differentiation in the cells.</p>
<p>In a weird way, the whole body is like this actually. All tissues connect and are essentially the same, yet differentiate at some part when they have a different &quot;type&quot; or functionality.</p>
<p>Another way of explaining it is: Imagine a string, growing longer at one end. As it grows, it changes color forming a spectrum along its length. If the string were alive, the parts with different colors might be different tissues, which do different things from one another. It's still basically the same string though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look up Dr. Spina and his talk on BioFlow. What you'll learn is that at the cellular level the only difference between bone, tendon, muscle ect. Is the difference if percentage of collagen and elastin. There is no clear definition, because everything is connected as one seamless unit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Zonula adherens happen between epithelial cells (in the skin or lining of GI tract) . Tendons and bones are connective tissue so don’t have adhering junctions between the cells, they’re mostly made up of an extracellular matrix secreted by the actual cells. The “connection” Is from Sharpey’s fibers which are mostly collagen fibers that are continuous with the connective tissue of the tendons and the periosteum of the bone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>If you look at a histological section of it, there is no point of clear differentiation between where the bone ends and the tendon begins, but rather there is fibrocartilaginous tissue present at the site of entheses. The adhesives that you are probably looking for are zona adherens (adherent junctions) which are normally placed between most of the cells and not just at the enthesis.</p>

<p>Thank you very much, that was very interesting, informative and concise.</p></div>		</li>
