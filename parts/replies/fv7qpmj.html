			<div class="markdown"><p>I can relate to this. Recently had several seizures. Vitals - only abnormalities were a mild increase in heart rate and blood pressure. Ended up having radiographs, an ultrasound, a CT scan, a lumbar puncture which fucking <em>hurt</em>, blood cultures, a MRI, and an EEG.</p>
<p>The diagnosis - combination of stress, lack of sleep, and dehydration being the cause.</p>
<p>The power of the brain over the body is real, just look at things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takotsubo_cardiomyopathy" target="_blank">Takotsubo cardiomyopathy</a>. The brain can just go &quot;nope, not doing this anymore.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve seen this happen first hand. Several years back, my uncle passed away from a stroke. We were at the visitation the night before the funeral and his wife walked up to his casket for one last goodbye. After a couple minutes, we saw her collapse - massive heart attack. </p>
<p>The hardest part was watching her son (EMT) and her sister (nurse) perform CPR on her while the ambulance arrived. She was gone before they could even get her to the hospital. I think they were both in their 50s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the brain is the body. Society for the longest time lived under the idea of the mind body split, that the mind and body are two separate things, but the brain (at least) is part of the body, and even if the mind is a separate thing, its so tightly coupled to the brain that talking about them as two separate things makes very little sense except for maybe very specific cases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once encountered a patient who came to see the doctor I was doing an internship with because he thought he had tuberculosis, a family member of him had had tuberculosis recently and he was coughing, shortness of breath, body was aching everywhere and he was looking like shit, he literally looked like a dead man... He was inmunosupressed and waiting for a kidney transplant so he was pretty close to a dead man if he had the TB... He didn't have it, he had the symptoms, and you could really see he had them... We got to the conclusion it was a conversive/somatization syndrom from the huge anxiety of thinking he had caught it after we got a clean x-ray and analític...
Stress is way bigger and complex than most people think, it's a phisical thing</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think about stress (sympatho-adrenal activation) as a re-ordering of priorities to emphasize the short term: you can't worry about long-term things like heart health when you need to out-run a predator. Stress causes long-term health deficits in the same way short-sighted politicians forego bridge maintenance for the stimulatory effects of a quick tax cut.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also psychological factors <em>are</em> physical factors. We often forget that we <em>are</em> physical creatures, thoroughly and absolutely. If <em>anything</em> in your body is changing, it's caused by  pulse of electricity, a physical force, or some chemical interaction somewhere in your body.</p>
<p>I think people generally don't understand the extent to which these physical interactions are far reaching. How they don't just control us; they <strong>are</strong> us. How <em>non-human</em> organisms living in your gut can manipulate your brain to trigger impulses that cause you to eat what the organism needs to survive. How years living in complete isolation, extreme abuse, or simply a bizarre environment can warp the psyche and turn an otherwise &quot;normal&quot; person into something macabre. How <em>every single thing you do</em> changes you, usually in ways you probably don't want to change, and you usually can't see it no matter how hard you try because your brain is hardwired to &quot;protect you&quot; from your own faults so sometimes can't or sometimes won't connect those neurons and because a chemical process in the brain produced the idea <em>before you even became consciously aware of it</em> (so you don't get much of a chance to process it rationally).</p>
<p>We are so goddamned controlled by our material and chemical natures that I sometimes wonder what agency any person really has. We're like very complex robots that don't know we're robots.</p>
<p>But yes, ask any psychiatrist or neurologist. The psyche is an abstract representation of a (whole lot of) physical phenomena. And those phenomena are interconnected. If something, anything, changes in the brain, those changes are going to radiate out and cause apparent changes in many other parts of the body. The wonder of the machine is in its beauty, not in its agency. That all those physical interactions could work together to make us what we are, although we surely are (very) far from perfect, and that the vast majority of each of us in our own existence is <em>completely unaware of them</em> together make a perfect testament to how little we truly understand our own existences and the universe we live in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well said. </p>
<p>This is one reason awareness training can help. Things arising from physical causes are mediated by our consciousness/psychologically, and we can influence our body in turn by out thoughts. We can't affect everything, but we are one of the main players in the game to get our body from day to day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I try to explain this to my husband. Thanks for putting into better words than I have been able to.</p>
<p>Psychological issues are not separate from the body. You can't just &quot;think&quot; away the stress when your body has learned to react that way as defense.</p>
<p>That being said, it's not entirely about body. Abuse, isolation, etc are all part of it and it turns into a cycle. Your thoughts also impact your health, as proven by the success of Cognitive-behavioral therapy, but ultimately it can be extremely difficult to &quot;get over&quot; mental issues when your brain is pumping out cortisol like a geyser. This is where medications can help control it.</p>
<p>Therapy can help you become aware of your thoughts and how they affect you. Overtime, you can &quot;unlearn&quot; the cognitive habits that affect the stress response, but it's hard work. I'm 3 years into therapy and still can't do it every day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I went to a talk once where they showed pictures of kids who had suffered severe emotional neglect (not physical, mind you) as infants. They asked us to guess their ages, and most people guessed between 6-8 years old. The kids were teenagers. </p>
<p>It's wild to me when people say &quot;it's just in your head&quot; as if that isn't, like, a physical place in your body. Not only is your brain an organ, but it is THE organ that controls every other experience, sensation, and physical development in the rest of your body. It's like if a plane was crashing and someone said &quot;it's just in the cockpit&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
