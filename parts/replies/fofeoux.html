			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer you're looking for OP. Low atmospheric pressure hypoxia is fundamentally different from garden variety respiratory depression because the partial pressure of oxygen is so incredibly low at those altitudes, oxygen reverses flow from the body into the air because normal flow of oxygen from the alveolar to blood and then tissues requires a narrow range of oxygen partial pressures and if it's disrupted, oxygen can flow the wrong way triggering hypoxia response much faster than if oxygen is simply cut off but partial pressures remain standard as they are at our everyday living sea level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that pressure and volume are inversely related. So if he holds his breath during depressurization, his lungs would expand due to the pressure decreasing. He may eventually be unable to hold his breath due to the volume of air in his lungs expanding. This is why when you get trained for SCUBA diving, they tell you to always breathe out when ascending (the pressure is going down).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. Most of the air in the lungs will escape. This is unavoidable. Total pressure is basically given by the pressure in the aircraft. With 100% oxygen you can have enough oxygen in the lungs even at the low overall pressure.</p>
<p>It's not a good solution and would still harm you over time - but it will keep you alive and somewhat awake long enough for the plane to fly down to a safe altitude.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well atmospheric pressure at 35000 ft is about one quarter of what it is at sea level. Sudden depressurisation with a closed glottis (necessary to hold your breath) will result in your lung volume attempting to quadruple . Let’s say you had just exhaled a normal breath. About 2 litres of air would be left in your lungs (this is the functional reserve volume physiology nerds). That volume would need to expand to 8 litres to have a pressure equal to the new atmospheric pressure. The normal total lung capacity is normally 6 litres so this would be probably pretty uncomfortable. I think there’d be a positive intrathoracic pressure of about 1/3rd of an atmosphere, or about 300 cmH2O, which is very high (for context a ventilator uses about 20 cmH2O of pressure to inflate your lungs by about 500ml.) so I’d think it’d likely cause quite a lot of trauma if you tried to hold your breath in this situation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a similar effect when breathing nitrogen (or some other pure gas that doesn't contain oxygen).  This makes nitrogen an effective and humane way to kill most animals -- they will choose to asphyxiate, as long as there's something interesting like food involved.</p>
<p>Rodentia (including bunnies) are a notable exception, because they can actually sense the lack of oxygen, not just the buildup of carbon dioxide.  So for them, the fear/terror/etc you'd normally expect from suffocation would be present, and this would be the exact opposite of humane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The pressure changes aren't that great as when ascending when diving.  At 8000 ft altitude (typical cabin pressure in a pressurized aircraft), the ambient pressure is 75 kPa, and at 35,000 feet (typical cruise altitudes being in the mid-30's), it's 25 kPa.  In contrast, with diving, the pressure increases by 1 atm (100 kPa) with each 33 feet of depth.  So ascending from 100 ft of depth to sea level results in a change in ambient pressure by 300 kPa.  There is also the issue of time spent at the higher pressure, and how much nitrogen gets loaded (dissolved) into your blood.</p></div>		</li>

<p>At the same time, the carbon dioxide does, too - which means that the acidity sensors that tell you that you need to breath don't trigger, so you don't realise that you need to breathe.</p>

<p>Thanks you for clarifying this part, which always bugged me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This doesn’t totally make sense. The partial pressure of CO2 in the atmosphere is basically 0, so every breath you take in has no CO2 and that’s why the lungs can get rid of CO2: it diffuses down it’s pressure gradient from the blood stream into the alveoli and out your mouth. At altitude, the partial pressure of CO2 is still zero so being at altitude should not effect this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The partial pressure of CO2 in the blood stream is around 40 mm Hg, and respiratory drive is affected by only small changes.  The part of the body that is detecting the CO2 partial pressure is the carotid body, which is measuring the CO2 in the blood.  That the CO2 partial pressure in the atmosphere is essentially nil is irrelevant for respiratory drive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct - although technically it’s the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveolar which is the important number as that’s where gas exchange takes place. This is always lower than the atmospheric pO2 and can be estimated using the alveolar gas equation. (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolar_gas_equation" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolar_gas_equation</a>). </p>
<p>You’re essentially actively breathing out oxygen. If you find yourself in this situation it would actually be better to let air out of your lungs once (to avoid trauma from the high relative pressure in your lungs compared to the atmosphere) and then hold your breath. Your useful conscious time would probably  be higher.</p></div>		</li>
