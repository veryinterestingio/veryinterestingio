			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep.  Speaking from personal experience, Anti-cheat, DRM software, and Windows Presentation Foundation are the top 3 reasons why a game won't work via Proton.</p>
<p>Anti-cheat and DRM software are both fairly intrusive.  They hook deep into the OS to, essentially, spy on all the programs currently running to make sure none of them are behaving in either a cheaty or pirate-y way.  Given that the entire &quot;OS&quot; they're talking to is actually a fake compatibility layer, their attempts to hook into it either fail entirely or immediately look highly suspicious to them.</p>
<p>WPF is an annoying side issue.  It's a Windows-only code library that's essentially used to make interfaces.  It's often used for game launchers simply because it's fast and easy to code with, but for whatever reason WINE and Proton just don't have a compatibility layer built in for it.  There's no technical reason they couldn't as far as I know, it's just a huge project to rewrite the entire library to be Linux compatible and no one has taken it on yet.</p>
<p>Outside of these three things, most games will at least function on Proton, though a decent number are prone to crashes or instability (which gradually gets fixed as Proton gets updated)</p></div>		</li>
