			<div class="markdown"><p>I also wonder if we get rid of potential germs by having our noses run during cold weather, when we are more likely to spend the majority of our time indoors. As a bicycle commuter, I seemed to get fewer colds during the winter then when I rode the bus to work. Or is the difference attributable to simply being crammed into mass transit with so many other humans?</p></div>		</li>
