<p>This is a good opportunity to use the Future perfect tense: &quot;The Earth will have already been destroyed several billion years earlier.&quot; </p>
<p>(In the future I'm talking about, this has happened between now and then)</p>
<p>Otherwise, thanks for the explanation!</p></div>		</li>

<p>The Sun will actually swallow the Earth 7.59 billion years from now, less than a million years before the tip of the RGB, which is where the helium flash happens. In fact it will swallow the three innermost planets in the last 5 million years before helium flash.</p>

<p>The Sun will visibly change when it begins burning helium. It will (over about 10,000 years) shrink and get hotter for a while, and then gradually get larger and cooler again for the next 130 million years as an AGB red giant before it dies.</p></div>		</li>
