			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this true though? I thought Einstein proposed that light always travels at the same speed no matter the speed of the observer. So you would never see light ‘slowing down’.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't travel at the speed of light, but lets say that its 99%.</p>
<p>You would see light traveling at the same speed and in fact you would see the other person turning off the light.</p>
<p>Its just that your time is massively slowed down and if you stop traveling at 99% the speed of light just after you see the other person turns off the light you would realize that in fact a lot of time has passed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In this case it is true.  There is a violation of physics by moving away at the speed of light which is why the light is always on (actually this isn't really true, since at the speed of light, time would stop for you).  If you moved away at only 99.999999% of the speed of light, you wouldn't violate physics and the light approaching you would appear to you to be moving at the speed of light.  To maintain this appearance, your view of time has to slow down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, no.  It is spot on.  The speed of light is constant for all observers, no matter how fast they are moving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's.. not what they said. Also any particle with mass moving at the speed of light is completely meaningless to begin with</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That might sound nice but it's completely wrong and missing the point.</p>
<p>You cannot travel at the speed of light. It's impossible. Trying to get relativity to make a prediction for that scenario isn't going to work.</p>
<p>If you travel close to the speed of light then you'll see the light switch off immediately when you leave just like everyone else. If someone in the room waits for one more second before switching off then light then you'll see the light switching off after much more than one second (depending on how close to the speed of light you are), but that is a mixture of time dilation (what OP is asking about and what you don't have in your comment) and simply the time light needs to reach you, two completely different effects.</p></div>		</li>
