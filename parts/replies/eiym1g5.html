			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I was going to say, I know there are many things with wavelengths smaller than light, such as gamma rays (which have a wavelength smaller than a diameter of an atom). Could they be used in any way to possible way to “see” an atom?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Technically, it's electromagnetic radiation. Visible light is between 380 - 740 nanometers in wavelength. </p>
<p>Gamma rays have a wavelength of .01 nanometers. So they would be able to resolve a much smaller object than visible light. </p>
<p>That having been said, the amount of energy in a gamma ray might also destroy your sample. </p>
<p>Your original question was too see something like a proton. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A proton has a diameter of approximately one-millionth of a nanometer&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can't do that, even with gamma rays it seems. So we have to use something else. </p>

<p>Have a look at this, we use an atom to touch a sample, and feel the atoms in a molecule. We can produce pictures like this. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This blew my mind, I haven't studied chemistry so I always thought that those diagrams were purely concept representations of a molecule just like we do with atoms. I had guessed that the links between atoms were extremely bendy and some of them would bend in strange forms, but I am so impressed right now by this... I can't believe it </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A typical wavelength used in a crystallographic experiment is about 1 nm in width. For comparison, visible light has a range of 340 to 780 nm. So X-rays are already much smaller! Gamma rays are smaller still, and I'm not aware of them being used for such purposes.</p>
<p>EDIT: As pointed out below, I meant to say 1 angstrom, which is 0.1 nm in size!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a crystallographer, I approve this message. It is amazing what you can do with a lot of math and scatter patterns. Though cryoEM is the current golden child, I think x-ray crystallography will always play a strong role in how we see tiny things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hah, right. Colleagues of mine have despaired that cryoEM will make X-ray crystallography &quot;obsolete,&quot; but I think the fears are a little bit overblown. Crystallography will remain relevant for a decently long time, still.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed! I believe the same thing happened when NMR became big. But crystallography still has a huge place. Each technique has it's pros and cons and it is great to have them all  at our disposal. Just is disheartening when all the job posting want cryo experience &gt;&lt;</p></div>		</li>
