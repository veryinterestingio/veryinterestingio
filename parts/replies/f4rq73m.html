			<div class="markdown"><p>How about topical—skin adhesive patch medications?
I’ve personally had a terrible experience with topical testosterone and I had friends try quitting successfully with nicotine patches.  I think they have pain medication too. </p>
<p>Do they all work the same as IV but just slower?
I’m wondering if a propofol type patch could replace or supplement melatonin as a sleep aid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Topical adhesive patches follow the 6-18-end of patch rule. Typically patches won’t start to take effect until 6 hours after application, will reach peak/steady state around 18 hours, and continue to deliver that steady state for 72-120 hours (3-5 days). Keep in mind that heat will increase absorption of the medication, so hot tubs, saunas, or fevers will cause increased/rapid absorption of the drug. All in all, patches are not a great option unless you have a self limited issue (for instance a 3 day scopolamine patch for a short cruise).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would... not be a good idea. Like, really not. Propofol kills unmonitored people very easily. It's not a playing-around medication. </p>
<p>Even if it worked, which it wouldn't, because it would take way more than you could put in a patch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Melatonin is a hormone the body produces naturally.  Propofol is a synthetic drug.  The 2 work in completely different ways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not aware of any evidence stating propofol to be unusually dangerous. It's never entered the black market. All we know of its use is either from criminally negligent doctors (MJ's doctor), or abuse by hospital workers. Neither of which are even remotely acceptable data points. These people inject the drug. IV drug use of any sort is unusually unsafe.</p>
<p>IV alcohol use could very easily kill you in theory. It takes 10 drinks of alcohol in a row to die. Something you can easily achieve with an IV.</p></div>		</li>
