			<div class="markdown"><p>ðŸ¤£ not special pizza. Just basic frozen.
Edit: when I bought it, it wasnâ€™t frozen. Just ready made. But you can freeze it when you get home. Like <a href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQt_Tl68AifDFVPS0NaNrjJzZHhHQJsbT-nbDLXXzehA9LkatXY&amp;usqp=CAU" target="_blank">this</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>Could see some highend restaurant like the Fat Duck including it and charging 500x the original price for &quot;oxygen absorbed pizza&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed! I didnâ€™t expect all this.
But yes, the options are a bit different here. The most famous is margarita pizza (tomato sauce /cheese) but Iâ€™ve even seen gyoza pizza too!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pizza-la.co.jp/sc_englishmenu.aspx" target="_blank">Pizza La</a> is popular, they are a big company here.
Also <a href="https://www.dominos.jp/en/menu-pizza" target="_blank">Dominos</a> . <a href="https://pizzahut.jp/order/pizza" target="_blank">Pizza Hut (JP only)</a>  as well. And of course there are numerous others, big and small. </p>
<p>My only disappointment is that normally you cannot go in and order exactly what you want, like cheese and extra mushroom. You kinda have to order whatever they have on they have on the menu already :/</p></div>		</li>
