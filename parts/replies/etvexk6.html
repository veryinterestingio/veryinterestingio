			<div class="markdown"><p>I get similar headaches/migraines if I overuse my shoulder, it doesn't take much at all. Getting someone to pound on the shoulder knot with their closed fist feels like heaven. Ice is probably one of the best advice given for constant severe headaches. I carry an ice pack wherever I go in case I need it since they're so frequent.
A roller ball filled with diluted peppermint oil is also in my arsenal along with aspirin containing caffeine only taken if nothing seems to work &amp; has gotten too severe.</p></div>		</li>

<p>My friend gets chronic migraines and she has a &quot;headache hat&quot; that she keeps in her freezer. It's pretty much an ice pack that you can wrap around your head. I tried it once when I was at her place and it worked wonders.</p></div>		</li>
