			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was young I used to play with a guy that played with Louis Armstrong and other jazz greats. I could always play the real fast stuff but he really put me in my place and wouldn't let me hear the end of it if my time wasn't perfect on slow stuff. Since then the vast majority of time I practice rhythm I do it at a real slow tempo. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why practicing with a metronome is key. Both for exercises and solos. Having the coordination to keep the tempo with your left foot on the high hat is also useful. What also helped me was emulating some I saw Chad Smith do when I watched him from 5 feet away in a small venue. Regardless of the tempo or whether he was actually open/closing the hi hat on every quarter note, he was vigorously bouncing his foot on every 8th. Surprisingly difficult to bounce on every 8th and only open/close on every quarter, but it helps you keep perfect time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep the slower the harder in my opinion! If I’m recording something that’s quite technical I quite often double the tempo to make it easier to keep time</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the 80’s, I had a drum teacher and he would have us practice at 80bpm instead of 120 because if we didn’t know our parts at slower tempos, we didn’t know the part. He wanted us to know the notes instead of playing it by rote. </p>
<p>Jokes on him, I moved to bass guitar and play everything by rote. </p></div>		</li>
