			<div class="markdown"><p>We also now have treatments that suppress the immune response. Many of the younger deaths were caused by a cytokine storm, an over-reaction of the immune system. The fact that the 1918 pandemic occurred in during World War I obviously had a dramatic impact on the outcomes as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just as a side note, no medicine/intervention has improved outcomes in MAS/cytokine storm. We do have drugs affecting the inflammatory cascade such as IL-1 and IL-6 inhibitors but none have shown a decrease in mortality. Data has historically been with very few patients so maybe a significant outcome will be noted with the number of patients being studied with COVID.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, putting aside antibiotics and respirators, a lot of people who develop pneumonia from covid are given pure oxygen to breathe, without being put on a respirator. It's possible that could have made a big difference with the 1918 flu, if it had been more commonplace at the time. We have also seen that antiviral drugs and monoclonal antibodies are effective, which were not available in 1918.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. If we did not have high flow oxygen to give patients, I would not be surprised if the CFR would go up to the same percentage as the Spanish flu. Lots of people go to the hospital and get put on oxygen, and they get better over time and are discharged with oxygen at home until they can function without it. But just on their own with 100 year old &quot;medicine&quot; a lot of people who require oxygen today would die or have permanent brain damage, and maybe worse lung damage from all the heavy breathing. Giving high levels of O2 allowes the person to breathe at a much lower respiration rate which might protect their lungs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Given that more than half of COVID-19 patients in ICU survive (in England, it was 80% by June), I think it's safe to say the mortality rate would be, at least five times higher if we were under 1918 conditions. This would put IFR to at least 2.5% (assuming the conservative 0.5% IFR), on par with the lower bound of the 1918 pandemic. Realistically, mortality rate would likely be even higher than that, so 5–10% doesn't seem so unreasonable, and that's on par with 1918.</p>
<p>So yeah, I agree with your assessment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Steroids are not inconclusive and have shown proven benefit in critical and severe illness. Obviously being on the ventilator at all is a bad prognostic factor but to say ventilators don't make a dent in patient outcome is also patently false. We've had decent success recently with early intubation compared to previous strategies of letting people huff away on a bipap for a week without improvement. Obviously outcomes are still not great, but it at least gives people a chance</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lot of misinformation here. If you're saying being put on a ventilator means your already in bad shape then that's true. When someone is put on a ventilator it is to attempt to save their life. Imagine what the survival rate is for patients who should be put on ventilation but aren't. Near zero, not 50%. Saying they don't make a difference is not true.</p></div>		</li>
