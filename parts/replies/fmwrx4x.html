			<div class="markdown"><p>How the blade length affects efficiency and noise (considering the same air flow)? I know for a wind turbine the power generated is proportional to the square of the radius, but I don't think the inverse relation applies to fans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The power generated being proportional to the square of the radius equation holds, but for a wind turbine this assumes the blades have an infinite aspect ratio.</p>
<p>For a low speed, low displacement, static fan, the same equation works, but the area of the blades comes into it as a term.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is room to go from 3 blades to 5 or even 6, as shown in OP's pic.</p>
<p>That would allow you to get more airflow at a lower speed.  At some point the airflow off a blade interferes with the next one, but it doesn't seem like that'd be a problem at these lower speeds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding more blades adds more weight, increasing the amount of power input. Itâ€™s also adds surface area, meaning more drag. You end up right back where you started with the few thicker blades.</p></div>		</li>
