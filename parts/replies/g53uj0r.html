			<div class="markdown"><p>Even healthy people have viruses living inside them all the time. Part of our microbial inner ecosystem of 'commensal' (happy helpful) bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes, and yes - even viruses. Any number of those could mutate and become pathogenic to the new Martians. Especially if the Martians began setting up agriculture on Mars and were in constant contact with animals they were using for food or whatever.</p>
<p>There is evidence of microbial life on the moon (astronaut poo bags) and comets. Microbes (bacteria in this case)have been found causing corrosion on the international space station.</p>
<p>They are super hardy, super adaptable, and they follow us everywhere. The flu as Earth people know it, may not occur in Martians. But something equivalent probably would pop up pretty quickly. Especially in close quarters with recycled air and water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if you sent a bunch of people to mars with the flu, eventually they'd fight it off (or die) and mars would be flu-free.  The problem on earth is that flu can hide out in animals for a while and then jump back to people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, a otherwise-healthy population might eventually win over the specific strain of the flu, but not having symptoms is not the same as not carrying the virus. As we all should know from the current Covid-19 epidemic. So even if everyone on Mars did not have flu symptoms, that would not mean that the virus was gone.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Mammals developed the placenta as a result of a virus influencing our DNA. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>That sentence intrigued me. I wondered how and why. So Google to the rescue. A search found an <a href="https://whyy.org/segments/the-placenta-went-viral-and-protomammals-were-born/" target="_blank">article</a> that described not only the uniqueness of the placenta, but how it was developed as a result of an interaction with a virus. It‚Äôs funny how one thing leads to another.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So per this link - <a href="https://twitter.com/erictopol/status/1304076454259380225?s=21" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/erictopol/status/1304076454259380225?s=21</a> flu was virtually eliminated during the winter in the Southern Hemisphere this year because of covid precautions. If we took a similar worldwide initiative and people cooperated, wouldn‚Äôt flu disappear?  Unless of course the theory that flu lays dormant in certain people and reactivates in the fall is true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In parts of South East Asia, Malaria was close to being eradicated up until a few years ago. Cases have started shooting up because new strains of the parasite have evolved to adapt with the measures we put in place to eradicate it. Eventually, these pathogens find a way.
Even if we worked to eliminate the viruses that cause influenza, similar to what we see with covid, it wouldn't take much for another similar acting virus to pop up. Especially if we went back to the same pre covid society, planes/restaurants/socializing, after &quot;eliminating&quot; the virus.
I can't speak to the &quot;dormant until fall&quot; theory as I haven't come across that before. Plenty of viruses CAN survive in people long term using methods like sequestration (think HIV). But I don't know if influenza viruses would be among these.</p></div>		</li>
