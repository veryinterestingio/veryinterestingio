			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good scientific explanation: especially at birth, the skin contact (literally when giving birth, and for example when feeding the baby) enables the exchange of (good) bacteria between the mother/father and the newborn, that will make it so the baby can grow healthy.</p>
<p>Of course there could be some response associated to the skin-skin contact that triggers the release of &quot;feel good&quot; chemicals in our brains, hence creating stronger bonds with another person. But an example (specifically for the mother/baby scenario) you could look into is the oxytocin hormone.</p>
<p>On the other end, if you're interested in the topic, you could research a bit regarding the gut-brain connection due to the gut microbiome. A fairly recent &quot;discovery&quot; in science that proposes that different microbiome compositions in the gut may alter the way we think and act by interacting with the brain!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes that's what I meant with &quot;literally when giving birth&quot; ahahah, and I agree with you on the other point too, but there is for sure bacteria on the skin that can be transmitted to the baby, with contact other than ingestion while breastfeeding? I honestly don't know since this is not my field of study and I didn't go much in depth, unfortunately.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I noticed after writing that it may have sounded like that with the column. I meant that the top comment was a scientific explanation, not my message (after all this is ELI5, but if you guys want my microbial genomics notes from last uni semester I can share them).</p>
<p>I'd say that the microbiome impact on the organism is, If we want to say it like that, a very strong hypothesis with a fair bit of research backing it up.</p></div>		</li>
