			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I live in the Netherlands, so pretty much every day. The idea that the absence of an upper frame is to make it easier to step through makes sense. I completely understand that design. But the bikes with upper frame that are supposed to be men's bikes just don't make sense.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why not? It's not like it's usual practice for men to hit their balls on the top tube.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol I kind of imagine it's more risky. For example, when you have to make a sudden stop here. Bikes are an everyday means of transport (at least here they are). A lot of bikes = a lot of sudden stops.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because thei are not supposed to be man's bikes, bikes are unisex. Those bikes are just designed for other purposes, like mountainbikes, bikes for riding fast on street or to cross, etc. Usually you decide if the bike is for a man or a woman from the lenght of the tube and the size of the various parts, but that also can vary as there are tall women and short men of course... in my country we call the kind of bikes you talk about &quot;bici da passeggio&quot;, &quot;bikes to take a walk&quot;, so bikes designed to ride slow on normal roads.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really by design. A Mixte is a unisex bike. When bikes came about they were one design to a degree. All women were permitted to wear were dresses and skirts. When they started riding bikes, they needed bikes that allowed them to ride in their attire. Another reason there is almost no pics of women on high wheelers.</p>
<p>Bikes for women continued to be built in this style  despite more women wearing pants. Manufactures for higher end specialized bikes, like types of mountain bikes prefer the design to cater to function than the sex of who's riding it. As far as generic bikes... well go to a big box store and you will see male and female Cranbrooks, Roadmasters. The Margaritaville is strictly a females bike, the Panama Jack is a strictly mans bike, by design.</p></div>		</li>
