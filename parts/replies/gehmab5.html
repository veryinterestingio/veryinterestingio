<p>Edit: for those asking why I wouldn’t do it for such a small fee, I already have an extremely high credit score. It’s a great option for those with low or no credit though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The principle of paying a landlord to tell a creditor that I can borrow some money seems a bit ludicrous. How much do they ask to do this? </p>
<p>If you live in a building with a front office, you can probably afford to put your day to day expenses on a credit card and pay them off immediately for free, and build credit that way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The entire concept baffles me, honestly. Over here, your eligibility to take out a loan depends on whether or not you have unpaid debts and how much you earn. You don't need to <em>build</em> a score, it's simply something you have as a function of your income. I don't see how having a record of constantly taking and repaying loans would show anything except that I have a nasty habit of loaning money at the drop of a hat, yet in the US this is apparently a good thing. What?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on which score you're talking about. My credit report has nothing bad on it and for reference, my FICO 8s are all over 800. Mortgage scores pulled in the 730s and I missed the highest bracket. In that context they don't give a shit how good your line-by-line is: if you pull low, you pay more, because Credco said so. </p>
<p>I got the Experian paid tier to suss this out and it turns out it was because of too many accounts with balances. I have about 15 CCs, all of which I use actively, and just leave them on auto-pay. These are small balances by the way, total utilization was 6%. But because scoring is stupid, that's considered so risky as to bring a flawless, extensive 15 year credit history to a 730 score. Lol.</p>
<p>I paid them all off before they reported that month and had the lender re-pull and recalculate. 790s. Guess I'll take it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Score still matters a ton. They are looking for problems more than anything.</p>
<p>But yes they also want to see credit variety. That is, however, also factored into your score.</p></div>		</li>
