<p>Same principle, though. Put your phone on the desk beside you and it records you. If you are used to noise, it has the ability to play various &quot;melodies&quot; from droning to music.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That sounds like an issue with water or an iron shortage. I'm not a doctor, though, so what do I know?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok but this doesn't describe why. I'm sure there are chemical/ physical reasons this happens. We need a play by play. Get out the ap bio book.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Certain “I have slept well” chemical needs to be released for exactly ~8 hours of sleep. If it’s more than that, this hormone cannot find free “cells” to cling to and it just kinda floats there but the body thinks these superfluous hormones are not superfluous hormones, and it treats them as normal ones, causing some malfunction. It’s something along these lines afaik.</p>
<p>The specific hour-by-hour circadian rhythm probably only holds because a person needs about 10-15 minutes of sunlight three times a week to maximize intake of vitamin D for health benefits; also sunlight triggers the “I need to be awake now” chemical, which moonlight does not, so it’s just more practical to be awake during the day. So again, it’s not like your body “knows” the time of day. It just happens that the circadian rhythm pattern is a good pattern to follow for health maintenance.</p></div>		</li>
