			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of times it people not following the traffic laws by driving exceedingly slow, or driving the same speed in the passing lane as the guy in the lane next to them, or its people PURPOSEFULLY being assholes. Sometime I will be behind two slow drivers blocking both lanes, going 5 mph below the speed limit, only for me to pass one of them going 65 mph (in the passing lane) only to have the person in the slow lane somehow catching up to me and riding my back right side in the slow lane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for calling it the &quot;passing lane&quot; instead of the &quot;fast lane&quot;. I don't understand the number of people that just think the left lane is for going fast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, traffic is such in many places that all lanes are used heavily and so the idea that there is a designated &quot;passing lane&quot; is becoming somewhat quaint.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my state the rule is &quot;slower traffic keep right&quot; which effectively does make the left lane the &quot;fast&quot; lane.</p>
<p>Most roads I drive on have too many cars to make the left lane passing only. And, if people are consistently driving faster in the left lane, it does effectively become the passing lane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I don't get the &quot;fast&quot; lane reference either. There is a &quot;slow&quot; lane, which it is in essence, I mean people can go below the speed limit, if theres no explicit law against it, in that lane. The other lane IS a passing lane because in essence you should only be going as fast as it takes to pass a person going the speed limit or below. They are going the speed limit at 55 mph, then you can go 60 mph to pass them, not 90 mph to pass them. I really hate it when I am in the passing lane, going 5 or 10 over to pass someone going below the speed limit, and then some jerk comes flying up, easily 85/90 mph and starts tailgating me before I can even complete my passes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Phantom traffic jams are the worst. It’s because so many people ride others asses the guy at the front taps their brakes which cascades back so that that one area becomes the spot where you have to tap your brakes. </p>
<p>Compound that across multiple lanes and you’re in a traffic jam for absolutely no fucking reason.</p></div>		</li>
