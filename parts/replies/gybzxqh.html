			<div class="markdown"><p>Improving your heart is great!  If you want to run, get some decent shoes, read a little bit about running, and go for it!</p>
<p>Edit:  Re-read the seed comment.  Enlarged heart is not the same as a strengthened heart.  Enlarged, the heart basically thickens INward, decreasing the ability to pump as much blood per beat.  A strong heart will have more muscle, but it builds outward and allows the heart to hold more and thus pump more blood per beat.</p></div>		</li>
