			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. It’s the mother’s IgG antibodies that are able to cross the placenta. The baby doesn’t really have a developed immune system and wouldn’t be able to make its own antibodies or maintain its own immune memory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If a vaccinated mother is breast feeding ,the antibodies might be transferred to the child so these antibody helps in the immune response, but however the child's cell never get to produce their own antibodies hence no memory cells are formed, so the vaccine might go in vain rather that show effect (the point of ate vaccine is to create an immune response in the body)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The placenta is very effective in filtering viruses, be them natural, inactivated, or antigens (subsets of viruses), and as others have said, the immune system of babies generally &quot;kicks in&quot; (in terms of efficient protection) at about 9 months old. So in &quot;utero vaccination&quot; doesn't seem impossible to me, but quite unlikeky.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Antibodies are just special-shaped proteins made by one type of white blood cell that stick to an antigen to disable it and mark it for destruction by other white blood cells.  Because a newborn isn't making its own antibodies yet, injecting a vaccine, milk or no milk, isn't going to boost the baby's own white blood cells' recognition of what covid looks like to produce their own anti-covid antibodies for when real covid comes around.  The mother's antibodies will stick to the spike proteins created by the vaccine to disable it, and the baby's immune system learns nothing about what covid's spike protein looks like to attack an actual covid virus on their own if an infection comes at a future date.</p>
<p>The mRNA vaccines aren't actual viruses to be fought.  mRNA is a one-time blueprint your body uses to make proteins, and an mRNA blueprint is destroyed in the process of making a protein.  The vaccines are blueprints for making just one non-working piece of covid (the spike protein), so when you're injected with the Pfizer or Moderna shot, your body follows the blueprint and makes one covid spike protein for every piece of mRNA. In the process of identifying the created spike proteins as foreign objects and destroying them, your white blood cells learn how to produce antibodies that stick to that specific piece of covid, which reactivate when a real virus comes, since covid's covered with that same protein. They use this method to treat diabetes.  People are injected with the mRNA blueprint for insulin, and their bodies produce insulin protein (while consuming the mRNA), which gives them insulin to process sugar temporarily.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is that right? Is transcription destructive? I didn’t know.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The mRNA is not combated - outside of non-specific things like RNAses. The immune system raises antibodies against the protein product that gets translated from the mRNA, not the mRNA itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whatever's in a vaccine is harmless to a baby, so their immune system doesn't need help to fight it. As it is his first encounter with the pathogens, it will take some time (\~2 weeks) to recognize and eliminate them. Antibodies from breastfeeding will do their thing (capture the pathogens), but in no case it can help the immune system of the baby to get ready for the next attack.<br />
The baby needs to select its own cells that are able to recognize, target, and kill the pathogens.<br />
I never heard of breastfeeding helping or interfering with vaccination.<br />
That being said, without breastfeeding, antibody protection from the mother decline quite fast after 6 months, while the baby's own immune system kicks in after 9 months (source: I'm a biology teacher). So it's better to vaccine kids as early as safely possible.</p></div>		</li>
