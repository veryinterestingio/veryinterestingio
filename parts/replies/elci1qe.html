			<div class="markdown"><p>After all the clear circle jerking about how superior it is to use gendered words this video was great.</p>
<p>This entire thread is basically &quot;IT'S SUPER GOOD AND GIVES MORE INFORMATION AND HAS NO NEGATIVE SIDES U SUXS&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah I'd just like some nuanced discussion instead of the thread being basically brigaded by the fact that that non gendered languages are really unrepresented on Reddit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Singular they has been used for ages :/ historically it's been relegated to use as a pronoun for an unknown gender (&quot;Whose keys are these? <em>They</em> left them on the table.&quot;) but now it's also a conscious decision that some people chose to have it as their primary pronoun. However I won't continue this topic because it's not relevant to OP's question.</p></div>		</li>
