			<div class="markdown"><p>In biology there is a term called diffusion which means that water likes to enter areas of high salt content. This applies to your fingernails: water will diffuse in because there is more salt in your fingernails than in your bath water. If you add salt to your water you will notice that this does not happen as now water from your body is leaving and entering your bath water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Google says our blood has about 140 milliequivalents/liter, so if you just match your bath water to that then it should work. It’d be rather tedious to find an accurate amount of bath water, then measure the salt and actually dissolve it all in there though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>isn’t that osmosis, not diffusion? Ive always learnt that osmosis was the movement of water from a low concentration of a solute to a high concentration of a solute, and that seems to be what you’re describing there</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you are discribing is actually diffusion the important difference is that osmosis needs a barrier that (in this case) is permeable to water so the absolut salt content (as in gramm) stays the same while the movement of fluid will try to balance it.</p>
<p>So a cell in purified water will absorb water to balance out the salt content until it will rupture or or saltwater will dry out cells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Osmosis is a type of diffusion. Diffusion can be any substance in any space, but osmosis is specifically water moving through a semi-permeable membrane</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does a minute amount of that water then enter your body (through the nails)? Or does it evaporate away into the air? Can anything besides water get into your nails?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Permeability depends on the membrane or a pseudomembrane and the size of the molecule that may diffuse or not. Generally, in biological systems, through osmosis, water is pretty much the largest molecule that will diffuse without a pore being present in the membrane. Some gasses can diffuse in small amounts too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this doesn't explain why nails become very fragile if repeatedly soaked like constantly wearing gloves in a wet environment or sweating while wearing them.... I have weak nails to begin with but if I'm wearing work gloves in a wet environment, they will barely make it to the tip of my finger before breaking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like putting a piece of cardboard in some water, taking it out for 5 minutes and putting it back in the water. It will never fully dry out! Your nails are similar in that the keratin layer needs to be fairly dry to hold its structure. If your hands are always wet, the nails will always be soft. </p>
<p>Working in these conditions is hard. I wear nitrile gloves all day everyday at work, so I get it.
If you can, change your gloves and dry your hands as best you can when possible. You could also try applying a nail strengthening nail polish. While this won’t completely fix the issue it may help some.</p></div>		</li>
