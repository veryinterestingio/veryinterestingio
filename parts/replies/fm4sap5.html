			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't discount the commentor's main point: South Korea did testing of contacts, not just testing of symptomatic people like Italy and the US.</p>
<p>Obviously if you're not even testing asymptomatic people <em>or</em> contacts of positive tests, the data isn't going to show many asymptomatic cases, if any at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If those cases belonged to a cult then likely there are some strange and restrictive dietary practices that could have lead to a weak immune system, control of foods and food intake are very common with cults. could also be sleep deprivation and/or extreme physical taxation - also tactics with cults.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Median age 48. A substantial amount of cases in the 15-34 age group. Germany is not testing as rigourously as South Korea, but they do relatively often test close contacts before they show symptoms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find it odd that South Korea's elderly population has a much lower rate of transmission than Italy's elderly population. If indeed the youth were that much more asymptotic, then I would expect to see much higher transmission rates in the elderly. This makes me think that something is missing from the story the data is telling.</p></div>		</li>
