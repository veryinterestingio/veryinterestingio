			<div class="markdown"><p>UV exposure is the biggest factor, a little less so in sagging than in fine wrinkles. It's also major contributing factor in why African and East Asian skin often ages relatively well, the former being due to dark skin being naturally more resistant to UV damage and the latter due to the religious sun protection measures taken by many east Asian women, including use of sunscreen/sunblocks containing ingredients which provide superior UVA coverage when compared to products available in the USA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question. While the term is 'solar elastosis' and solar elastosis is often seen in conjunction with early damage to the basal layer of the epidermis, wrinkling where the sun doesn't shine is the result of other factors. Some of this has to do with poor performance of metalloproteinases with age related collagen remodeling.</p>
