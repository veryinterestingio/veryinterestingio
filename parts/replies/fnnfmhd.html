			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what bothers me as a migraine sufferer, especially when I cannot work because of them. People are under the impression that because they’ve have a bad headache that they’ve had a migraine, and they are not the same. I’ve also had bad headaches, while I hate both, I’d take a bad headache over a migraine any day, I can function with a bad headache. My migraines can be so bad I’ll feel delirious. Lights, noises, and particular smells can set me off in a split second. I had a horrible migraine one winter day I’d had all the blinds down, decided to just peak outside, it had snowed and the bright white made me vomit instantly.</p></div>		</li>

He spelled it out for me but I couldn’t even understand what letter he had just said mentally despite hearing them lol. I legitimately thought I was having a stroke because my migraines usually make the left side of my body numb. I don’t get them too often but I know if my eyes are having trouble focusing its time to sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you identified any triggers? I have that, but its generally on the right side of my body. My parents thought I had a stroke. I seem to just randomly have 2-3 within a month once or twice per year so just trying to see if there's anything I'm doing</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was hospitalized in January because I thought I was having a stroke, the right side of my face and right arm went completely numb and I couldn't figure out what year it was. There was no headache or pain though. They didn't even mention the possibility of migraine when I was at the hospital and considered it a mini stroke. When I followed up with my primary she said it could have been a migraine. I guess I always thought a migraine had to come with a headache or head pain</p></div>		</li>

<p>Absolutely. On a similar note, I went to school with someone who had clinical insomnia (it was a side effect of another condition). It absolutely ruined his life - he'd be incredibly tired but unable to sleep for literally days on end. It stopped him being able to operate in almost any sphere - physically, mentally (he had to re-take the whole year at school because of the disruption to his studies), socially. Gravity would finally kick in and he'd basically pass out for 24 hours - again, ruining him physically, mentally, stopping him being able to keep any sort of appointments or deadlines, to say nothing of not being able to drive or do anything that would cause an accident if he did suddenly fall asleep. And then you had people saying they were an insomniac because they stayed up late on the internet arguing about video games.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Man, as someone with Narcolepsy, it feels so incredibly nice to hear someone who doesn’t experience this feeling of chronic, severe sleep deprivation, empathize with it. Not many people understand what Narcolepsy is ACTUALLY like, but it’s an incredibly nasty quality of life disease for that reason. Thanks for being an empathetic person! Makes me feel better at 5:20 am while desperate for sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like insomnia has to be one of the worst things to have.
I have gone without sleep 2 times in my life, and those 2 days had to have been the shittest I've ever felt. Couldn't focus, not hungry but hungry at the same time, felt like I wanted to puke.</p>
<p>The thought that that could be someones constant life seems terrifying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can empathize. I don't even get headaches, only the aura. I'll suddenly smell EVERYTHING in the room at once, then my sense of proportion gets fucky and I feel like I'm 1.25x my normal size for a few moments.</p>
<p>At first it was terrifying, but now it's just inconvenient and mildly terrifying. I'd much rather have a headache.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand this. I get the ocular auras, and if I take a large dose of pain meds at just the right moment, I can avoid the head pain. However, pain medicine does nothing to stop the inevitable extreme light sensitivity and nausea that hits me like a brick wall the second the ocular auras finish filling my vision and they finally break.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It took me forever to realize that heightened senses warn of a migraine.  I thought the only real clue was seeing a visual aura (based on what my mom told me - and she had never had one so why she had to be the expert is beyond me).  Once I realized that being able to hear a fruit fly fart was a clue, I could take my medication in time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So much this!  I get migraines from time to time (just 2 days ago).</p>
<p>Mine are always preluded with visual disturbance (which can be very tricky when I need to get home).  20-30 minutes later my vision clears up and I'm hit like a truck.</p>
<p>It's exhausting!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm just getting over one. My whole day was ruined/unproductive. I get blurry vision that lasts anywhere from a few minutes to, at the longest, several days. I'm always trying to put into words the experience but it can be really difficult (not just because of the mental fog that comes with it, there literally don't seem to be words to describe some side effects). Helping my SO understand what I am going through is challenging.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a girlfriend that tried to tell me that a migraine was &quot;just a headache&quot; and that I was being unreasonable when I'd go to the bedroom, turn lights off, try to get cool without being cold, and for the love of God, do. Not. Make. Noise.</p>
<p>Because I was young and stupid, i decided I'd walk her through my next migraine. I stayed out in the house. I described what I saw and felt. For an hour, I explained in excruciating detail what a migraine felt like... Except that my migraines affect my ability to think and speak. I sounds like I'm obliterated drunk. But I was convinced that I was making coherent descriptions of what I felt. Apparently, I was really just babbling quietly while I cried and held my head. She never gave me shit after that day. We didn't last long after that, anyway.</p>
<p>My wife understands and will just let me be alone in our quiet bedroom. It has blackout curtains. It is my sanctuary. I also figured out that caffeine triggers my migraines, so I just don't drink delicious soda, anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I describe my halos as &quot;a tear in the fabric of the world.&quot; I learned that if I manage to go lay down somewhere cool, dark, and quiet when I first notice the halo, I can avoid most of the subsequent pain, which used to be debilitating. </p>
<p>A while back, a neurologist and artist who suffers migraines painted her halo so her colleagues could better understand. It was nearly exactly the same halo I see. </p>
<p>I feel lucky; my wife doesn't get halos and has found no way to &quot;head off&quot; the headache at all. She recently had plastic surgery to release the cranial nerves in her neck. The procedure isn't covered by insurance, so we coughed up $5K for a discounted rate. We may have to do it again next year for the front side of her head. Worth every damned cent if it works (we won't know for another 6 mos if it helps).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've only had a handful of ocular migraines, but the first time it happened to me, I thought someone had slipped me some kind of drug or maybe I was having some kind of seizure. Was blown away after googling enough and found images that were nearly the same as the visual disturbances I experienced. I assume is similar to what you see as well. I always found the appearance of the halo to feel &quot;violent&quot; and just ambiguously wrong somehow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get really bad headaches. They last for days. The pain is pounding/throbbing. They're resistent to NSAIDS. It isn't a &quot;normal&quot; headache, but I don't get other migraine symptoms. My Dr told me it could be migraine because the pain I was describing sounded vascular. She told me to try a triptin, and if they work, then it's migraine. It does help, so she might be right. I think for some people, migraine is just a really bad headache. I do call them migraine but I always say they're very mild compared to other people's.</p></div>		</li>
