			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to type something to help you, but I don't think that's possible. </p>
<p>Instead, I'd like to ask a question: is there anything that someone could say to you via the Internet today that would help you? </p>
<p>I don't even know if you're a man or a woman. My imagination doesn't stretch far enough to take in your entire experience. It sounds like you had access to some pretty good medical support, which is awesome. I hope time treats you well.</p>
<p>It's hard to imagine hurt like this and not want to help. I'm sorry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There really isn't words either online or in person that can change the pain. Having said that, I don't mind when people send messages of support. I'm a firm believer in trying to help others is the best way to help yourself. Everyone hurts when they hear about a child dying. There were times right after she died I just didn't want to hear I'm sorry again. This past Wednesday was her birthday so this week has been extra heavy. </p>
<p>Thank you for the message of support. It's always nice to know people care.</p></div>		</li>
