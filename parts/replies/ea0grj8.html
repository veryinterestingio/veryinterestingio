			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason why having a model of the kilogram is a problem is because it's impossible to keep it at a constant mass.  When you get to extremely fine measures, you can have all sorts of issues.  Any handling of the model risks adding or removing mass just from touching it.  Add in the possibility of atoms of the model randomly decaying over a long period of time, or the possibility of the vacuum container being imperfect and causing a reaction with the air...  For everyday measures, doesn't make a big difference.  But when you need precision, for industrial or scientific purposes, it matters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, that's not how it's defined. Those aren't universal constants, and at high precision is very prone to inaccuracy. </p>
<p>The kg is now defined with the plank constant, whose unit is the Joule. Since we already have constant-based definitions of time and distance, you can extract mass from that.</p></div>		</li>
