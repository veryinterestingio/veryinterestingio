			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, and the .357 magnum was originally just a technological update to the .38 Special, since modern metallurgy and powders could handle significantly higher pressures in the same size cartridges, resulting in better ballistics in the same package.</p>
<p>In order to prevent people from blowing up their older guns, they increased the case length of the .357 but seated the bullet deeper. They have virtually identical case volume but you can't put a .357 magnum into a .38 Special chamber.</p>
<p>However, the other way around is possible so most .357 revolvers can also shoot .38 Spl.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The .38 Special, in turn, was derived from the .38 Long Colt, which had a 0.357&quot; bullet in a 0.381&quot; brass case.  And <em>that</em> cartridge was derived from the .38 Short Colt, with a 0.375&quot; bullet in a 0.379&quot; case.  The SC is also the predecessor of the .38 S&amp;W.  None of which are related to the .380 Auto...</p></div>		</li>
