			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I wouldn't go so far as to say knowledgable... It is certainly possible that legends of multi-headed creatures may come from observing such things in the wild. A particularly strong case can be made for this in regards to snakes. Many snake monsters from mythology have multiple heads, such as the Hydra. However, I suspect that multi-headed animals also come in large part from the idea of 'two-faced': Using multiple heads as a metaphor for having a temperamental personality.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Dicephalic parapagus occurs in humans. It can happen in pretty much every single multicellular organism. The rarity is them surviving development and infancy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not completely uncommon in sheep or cows, though usually they don't make it past infancy.</p>
<p>It's been known to happen with kittens too, so theoretically I don't see why it couldn't happen with a lion, but again, it's unlikely they would survive past infancy, if not outright stillborn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure why you need a <em>mammal</em> with 2 heads to come up with the idea of Cerberus.  I'd imagine seeing a two headed snake or turtle is enough.  Humans aren't <em>that</em> lacking in imagination.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is quite poetic - but technically incorrect. Most oviparous snakes will lay their eggs and then incubate them until they hatch. It is the moms job to keep her snake eggs a safe temperature and sometimes rotate them (depending on species) as needed. The mom doesn't fuck off until the babies are hatched.</p>
<p>In the snake breeding world it is not widely agreed upon whether to remove the eggs after they hatch and incubate them in an incubator or to just let mom handle the duty. I believe most serious snake breeders remove them from mom and incubate in a professional temp and humidity controlled incubator. I decided to let mom handle the duties. She did a pretty good job, but I did have 1 bad egg. I am not a professional breeder.</p>
<p>Getting the eggs away from mom may or may not be easy, depending on mom's mood:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now I know how to describe the behaviour of Australia's brush turkey and its baby raising habits. Male builds big ass mound, shags interested female who lays big ass egg in mound and then fucks off. The heat of the mound decomposing incubates it and the chick grows up alone, a neglected child.</p></div>		</li>
