			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps a stupid question: Why can’t we just use the contaminated steal and have a new “zero” on the instruments? If I know that a scale says nothing on it is 5 pounds and I get on, I can just subtract 5 and get my actual weight. Wouldn’t we be able to do a similar thing with radiation instruments and gauge the real levels even if the steel has contaminants in it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To make steel, iron ore is first smelted in a blast furnace. Crushed ore is continuously fed into the top of the furnace, air is continuously pumped through the side, and the molten iron falls to the bottom. </p>
<p>It's not the iron ore that is radioactive.  It's the air that is being fed into the blast furnace. That air carries slight amounts of radioactive dust. It's extremely little, but we are talking about equipment designed to quantify even that tiny amount of radiation. </p>
<p>We <em>can</em> produce new, low radiation steel if we really want to. But to do so, we either have to purify the insane volume of air that will be used to smelt it, or find a different smelting process for the raw ore that won't introduce such contaminants. Either option is technically possible, but economically impractical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How hard is it to purify dust from air?  It seems, even for a massive airflow, you could filter the dust with the equivalent of a few giant HEPA filters. Or is one of the gases, like the CO2, radioactive?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this radioactivity exclusive to weapons testing or does (unshielded) reactor operation also contribute.</p>
<p>Could a pre-oklo sample of steel be used to make instruments more sensetive than pre-40s stuff??</p>
<p>That would be cool...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds a lot like Clair Patterson's attempts to test samples for lead...turned out that everything is contaminated with it. Especially in the heyday of leaded gasoline...his mission was to eradicate it. Which he pretty much did. Amazing dude.</p>
<p>His testing methods became so good that he could sample ice cores from the arctic and see the effects of ancient Roman lead-smelting...</p>
<p>edit: in case anyone is curious, this article is fantastic. Fair warning- don't start reading it if you aren't prepared to devote a LOT of time to finishing it.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Truth, background levels are higher since the Manhattan project, there's actually a different value for carbon dating now than there was when they first started. I'd have to go before and dig through my course notes to find it.</p></div>		</li>
