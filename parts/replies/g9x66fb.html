			<div class="markdown"><p>Herpesviruses donâ€™t ordinarily incorporate their genome into the host genome. Instead they form an episome that remains in the nucleus and replicates along with the host genome. In fact, no human virus, other than the retroviruses, requires actual incorporation into our genome.</p>
<p>Edit: Apparently HHV-6A and B are examples of a viruses that <em>require</em> incorporation for latency. I still stand by the statement that this is an exception for the human viruses of the family.</p></div>		</li>
