			<div class="markdown"><p>Having spent my entire life in restaurants: I have never run into a restaurant that uses the &quot;cooking wine&quot; from the grocery shelf. Every restaurant I have ever worked in uses the cheapest wine it can get its hands on, usually in the form of very large boxes, but it is truly wine, not the salted, expensive, gross stuff that the grocery store sells in the spice aisle.</p>
<p>That being said, there are super subtle differences in varietal when cooking but for the vast majority of people (and restaurants) these differences are negligible or not worth the costs of stocking different wines. I mean, once you are braising beef and veg with it, red wine is kinda just red wine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Exactly this. </p>
<p>My rule of thumb for home cooks is to use the cheapest wine you would actually personally drink. </p>
<p>A- You’ll have leftover wine to drink. </p>
<p>B- While aroma and flavor does cook out, you don’t want to bank on cooking out all the undesirable ones. They might stick around and ruin your dish.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We keep a magnum of Mondavi Sauvignon Blanc in the fridge just for cooking. We get it at the wine store attached to our local COSTCO. It's not quite acceptable as table wine, but it's just fine for poaching, deglazing, and in dishes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s odd the grocery store cooking wine here is way cheaper than regular wine. Like 80 ¢ for 500 mL.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where I live the laws around alcohol and sale basically make it impossible to use anything other than cooking wine for dishes. The agency in charge of alcohol has some pretty difficult requirements for storage, sale, and inventory of commercial alcohol supplies. </p>
<p>That's not to say we won't borrow take a small portion of something for a sauce and not report it but keeping anything other than salted alcohol or syrup around the kitchen is a major problem. We had some beers hidden in the shelves that we use for marinades but if the inspectors found those we'd lose our liquor license.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>FYI, some &quot;cooking&quot; wine is cheap wine that also has salt added.  This is why it's not sold with the rest of the wine, and is usually next to the spices in the main grocery section.  It can be sold without ID because it's not considered an alcoholic beverage.  At least that's how it worked where I grew up, since grocery stores were not allowed to sell wine or beer at all.</p>
<p>That's worth keeping in mind because it will dramatically change how much salt you might need to add to a recipe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did not know this! I have always assumed when using cooking wine it's going to be more bitter than drinking wine, but had no idea it was due to added salt! Good to know!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t want to derail any of your very good comment above, but most reputable restaurants won’t use this type of cooking wine. We will usually just use the house wine, or cheap but drinkable bottles if we do want a certain variety.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, this is why cooking wine sauce is a great way to use a wine that has gone off.</p>
<p>It may be completely undrinkable, but as long as it's not outright turned into vinegar it's probably good enough for use as an ingredient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work for a fortune 500 company that does a lot of stuff with real estate.  Back in the financial collapse of 2007/2008, we purchased a few large portfolios of real estate that had been repossessed.  Part of that was from a former vineyard and winery in Georgia that had gone under, and that included what was pretty much a full warehouse of wine.    </p>
<p>Well, there was a reason the winery went out of business.  The wine was so bad, we couldn't give it away, not even for making it into vinegar.    Since you can't just dump that much wine down the drain, we had to pay someone to dispose of it.</p></div>		</li>
