			<div class="markdown"><p>Also rounded corners don't wear down as much as angled edges/corners. And when coins used to be made with precious metals - you don't want the coin to wear down as you will lose valuable metal. Gold is very malleable, so a corner could break off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why they put ridges on the edges of more valuable coins. Back in the day coins were worth their weight in the metals. People would shave off the edges. The shavings would be melted down for more wealth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With silver coins people could avoid the punishment for clipping, being boiled alive, by putting them in a purse and shake it vigorously for several minutes; this would simulate normal wear and tear. They would then remove the coins and burn the purse, picking up small melted fragments of silver afterwards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They started as balls of metal which were pressed into flat coins. This always gives you a circular-lish shape.I think today they stamp them out of sheet metal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is important. You have to consider the method of producing the coins.  A square coin needs a square die; the corners of a square die will crack and fail far earlier than a circular die.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not correct. They had molds for circular shaped coins with little tunnels where the liquid metal would be poured into.</p>

<p>What's the point of making balls first anyway?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it's absolutely true. Some of the earliest coins were used by the Lydians, who definitely did strike the shapes from balls of gold or a gold/silver mix. Why? Because a single hammer blow is a fuck load easier than melting goldnand pouring it into molds. Gold is soft. Why make it into balls first? Because it's more reliable to get a standard shape from the striking. Have you never done something similar with play-doh?</p></div>		</li>
