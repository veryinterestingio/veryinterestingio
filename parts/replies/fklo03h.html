			<div class="markdown"><p>Exhaled air has much smaller concentration of CO2 compared to almost clean CO2 coming out from fizzy drinks</p>
<p>Also I think that CO2 in air is tied up to other gasses someway, so it's not as reactive</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not really the nitrogen creating the fizz. Nitrogen is practically insoluble at the pressures used in draught systems and that's actually the point. You see it used to pour things like coffee or wine where you don't want them fizzy. Or the other major use is for beers where the extra pressure from the nitrogen is used to force the beer through a restrictor plate in a stout faucet. That plate agitates the beer and causes the CO2 carbonation to come out of solution. That foam is them forced through tiny holes in the plate that breaks them up into the little creamy bubbles you're used to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>CO2 is pretty naturally well suited to the application. For one, fermented beverages going back thousands of years have been naturally fizzy from carbon dioxide as a byproduct of the fermentation, so we know that works. You could force a similar effect from other gasses with similar solubility.</p>
<p>Trouble is there aren't that many gasses that 1) are safe and 2) dissolve as well as CO2. Gasses like ammonia and hydrogen sulfide dissolve great, but are unsuitable for being stinky and poisonous. Things like nitrogen and argon, which are non-reactive and odorless, don't dissolve well. They need pressures orders of magnitude higher than CO2 to get the same amount of  fizz and they'd quickly go flat.</p>
<p>About the closest gas that would do the job similarly would be nitrous oxide. But if you're familiar, you might understand why we don't want to be topping up all of our fizzy drinks with that.</p></div>		</li>
