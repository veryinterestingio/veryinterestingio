			<div class="markdown"><p>As much as I'd like this to be true it's more of an old myth that helps people air their grievances against &quot;the man&quot;. I've seen dozens of acts pushes by labels and media that just haven't connected with audiences, sometimes it simply doesn't work. Quite often in fact</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a myth, if it were true why wouldn't all their artists be successful? Why would they ever produce flops? Also why would they continue to sign popular acts if they could just make a new one from scratch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is incredibly true. I've worked as a musician, and now I'm a scientist, and the same thing is true in both worlds. Nobody cares about new ideas or creativity. They only care about things that will make money. The problem is that you have to come up with a million new ideas before you have one that is good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do artists stay with labels as they go? Because it seems like based on what you mentioned they do for them, the Ed Sheehan and Lady Gaga’s of the world who write all their own music and have money to spare wouldn’t need labels... do they still use them?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In general yes, because they weren't always that successful and with labels you sign a contract that usually lasts for a certain number of albums/years. Some artists after their contracts are up will leave and start their own label if they can, or now in the digital age start just dropping music when they want. However a label also does lots of promotion for music and things like that which are helpful/valuable, so even most successful artists are signed to a label.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Artists sign long, long, long contracts with record labels, over many many years. Weird Al's intial record contract was for 14 studio albums plus some number of compliation albums, and lasted 32 years, although most aren't quite that long, they are usually in the ballpark of 5-10 albums.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really? I thought most artists sign 4 album deals max. I was thinking about how Justin Bieber hasn’t released an album in years and wondered why. Thought, “hmm maybe he completed his deal with the studio and he’s just chilling and enjoying life.” Because when he was first starting, he was cranking out music left and right, then took that 3 year break for purpose, then 5 years later for his upcoming album.</p></div>		</li>
