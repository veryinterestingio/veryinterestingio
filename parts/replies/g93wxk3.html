			<div class="markdown"><p>If I remember from high school biology, it’s called a ‘gene cascade’ which regulates the order of development of different body parts. Basically gene activated leads to another gene activation and so on</p>
<p>Edit - it’s actually called ‘HOX genes’ but I think the above principle is part of the process</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Hox genes are a set of genes whose products work as 'transcription factors' meaning they influence the expression of other genes which ultimately leads to 'directing' how the body plan forms.
This plus gradients on various proteins in the embryo together makes a very complicated array of factors that influence how and where various tissues and appendages form.
Would love to tell you more and in better detail but I'm a biochemist and by no means a Developmental Biologist who would be best equipped to talk about this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am by no means a particular expert in developmental biology, but it all kinds of goes back to the idea of segmentation. You see this in a lot of different types of animals, including earthworms, insects, and vertebrates (like humans).</p>
<p>On a really basic level, we're a bunch of repeating segments--look at our spine and how it's a bunch of very similar bones repeated and again. Each vertebra has arteries, nerves, and veins (and bones, in the rib cage) that come out of it in a roughly similar pattern and head out to supply the areas at that level. You can see this when you look at something like a map of <a href="https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-8be44/images/stencil/1280x1280/products/2666/4893/Dermatomes18x24__62039.1372616082.jpg?c=2" target="_blank">dermatomes</a>, which are the areas where touch is sensed by the nerves coming out of specific vertebrae.</p>
<p>How this forms in humans is really, really complicated and we still don't quite understand, but at a really basic and oversimplified level it's related to having a simple gradient of specific hormones/other chemicals along the length of a very early embryo--so near the &quot;tail&quot; end, there's a lot of the chemical, and near the head end, there's not a lot. Certain genes get turned on and off based on the specific concentration in that area. For example, at a certain concentration point you get a series of genes turned on that causes a cascade of other effects that leads to tissue growing out and forming a &quot;bud&quot;, which then elongates and forms primitive arms or legs.</p></div>		</li>
