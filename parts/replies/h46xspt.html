			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what he's trying to say is that when he was a boy he would go to countries in Europe and run into Germans.  Those Germans mentioned enjoying their time in those countries when they were young too. Sounds like the older Germans are former soldiers who enjoyed their time in the other countries when they were occupiers.</p></div>		</li>
