			<div class="markdown"><p>Good summary, I'd like to add the following:</p>
<p>When I'm pinching your arm, it's <em>more likely</em> to be a subcutaneous injection (more likely but not always, in children I'd pinch to locate the muscle).</p>
<p>IV injections are preferred in easy access medium sized veins, for most medications, as you inject straight into the vein, there is no question of absorption, 100% of the drug reaches your bloodstream (look up bioavailability), as opposed to tablets or lotions where it does get absorbed.</p>
<p>There are far more than 3 ways to inject medications, here are a few:  </p>
<p>● Just like Intravenous(IV), I can access an artery : an intra arterial injection.<br />
●in certain emergency conditions I can't find a vein, I may push the drug through the blood supply system of your large bones : an intra-osseous injection.<br />
●obstetric labour analgesia is usually given as an epidural, above a layer covering the spinal cord. You could also inject it beneath this layer and just above the spinal cord: intra-thecal injection.  </p>
<p>●I can inject various anesthetics behind and around your eye, as either retrobulbar or peribulbar injections.  </p>
<p>●I could also inject meds straight into your eyeball, behind the lens, into a space called the vitreous: intra-vitreal injection.  </p>
<p>There are of course many more, but they are quite outdated and rarely employed, because of better alternatives.</p>
<p>As a side note, when giving intramuscular(IM) injections, I actually pull the needle back before injecting, if I suck up blood into the syringe , then I'm in a blood vessel, and I need to redo the procedure.</p>
<p>IM injections are in no way inferior to IV injections, and can be used in emergency and life threatening conditions to great effect, with a solid margin of safety. As an example, it is perfectly acceptable to administer adrenaline to someone in anaphylaxis, via the IM injection.</p>
<p>Edit: To the physicians and nurses pointing out that it is no longer recommended to aspirate before an IM injection, you're <em>RIGHT</em>. Since this was reddit and I just wanted to provide some extra info(mostly to non-healthcare people) about the various routes of administration of drugs, I took a slightly more relaxed and casual approach. Mainly because I don't expect anyone to start giving IM/IV/SQ/ID injections after reading this comment. My professors still aspirate, and I mostly don't. I learned when aspiration was still the norm, and every so often automatically will aspirate, even to this day. Call it a force of habit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Works well and is an easy access when IV is difficult to acquire for any and all reasons.</p>
<p>Plus, usually you're not really aware of anything if we consider intraosseous(IO) access. I hear the military has other protocols vis-à-vis IO use but then again, their work environment is slightly different.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Please don't.</p>
<p>Also, how do you pronounce &quot;vitreal&quot;?</p>
<p>Is the 'i' like &quot;widow&quot; or &quot;vital&quot;, and is &quot;real&quot; like &quot;real&quot; or &quot;Montreal&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mom gets these injections every few months, due to high blood pressure cutting off blood flow to her retina. The numbing drops make it so that she doesn't feel a thing. The problem is the numbing agent causes a burning sensation, so I have to drive her home from her appointments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's also why most doctors won't just stick you, push the plunger, and be done. They pull back on the plunger first and make sure it doesn't draw blood. If it draws blood, they reposition to make sure they are injecting it into a muscle, not a vein.</p></div>		</li>
