			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, and finding fossils in limestone is not rare at all, especially for shelled sea life. You can break off just about any piece of limestone here in Minnesota and find something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a quick correction. Igneous rocks are formed in the mantle rather than the core. The core is made up of two layers, one of which is a mostly solid iron ball and the other is liquid metal, but those are both fairly dense compared to the mantle and so have sunk to the bottom.</p>
<p>The mantle sits on top of the outer core and is where all of the molten rock is. This brushes up against the crust and where the fault lines have formed is where this magma leaks through (as well as through volcanoes), which is where we typically find igneous rock.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Igneous rock doesn't preserve fossils, because it originated as crazy hot magma at the center of the earth.</p>

<p>Magma doesn’t cone from the centre of the Earth! Although the rock that melts to form magma begins doing so at depths much deeper than humans have ever drilled down to, this is still just anywhere between 10 and 200 km into the Earth. It’s a good 2,900 km deep until you reach the very edge of the Earth’s outer core, and another 3,400 km or so before you reach the centre of the Earth. So magma is actually generated very close to the surface when viewing it on the scale of the whole planet. </p>

<p>Certain types of sedimentary rock, like shale, limestone, and sandstone, are the best at preserving fossils. </p>

<p>Limestones are not great at preserving fossils, unless they happen to be made largely from fossilised organisms in the first place. Limestones may also dissolve somehwhat which is not great for preserving fossils. The other rock types you mention can indeed be excellent for fossil preservation, though the key factor is the size of the grains. The smaller the grain size, the more closely packed the grains can be, and protect the remnants of any dead organisms within. For this reason, the absolute best type of sedimentary rocks for preserving fossils are mudstones, which is handy for palaeontologists seeing as mudstones make up about 85% of the Earth’s non-limestone sedimentary rocks.</p></div>		</li>
