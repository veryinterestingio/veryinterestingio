			<div class="markdown"><p>My parents have an ice maker in their freezer and no one ever uses the ice in there because it's gross. It tastes like whatever food you have in the freezer and when you grab it with your hands, it makes your hands stink and feel like there is a coating or something on there. We have a dedicated ice making machine in the basement that everyone uses instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree but it gets neglected because we've all just gotten used to using the ice maker downstairs. It makes better ice anyways, regardless of taste. The freezer isn't gross by any means, but it's just got a lot of different types of shit in there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, you're not touching every damn ice cube. You'd have to smell it yourself because I don't know how to describe it. It's definitely to do with the ice and not reaching in to grab cubes.</p></div>		</li>
