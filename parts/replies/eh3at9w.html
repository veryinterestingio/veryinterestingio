			<div class="markdown"><p>Second this. Also, some people can find they get bad <em>cough</em> gastrointestinal problems. Feeling very very sick/being sick or diarrhoea etc. They go away after about 2 weeks, but taking them at night means you can try and sleep through the problems rather than having to puke up breakfast at work. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thirding the above - a lot can be taken before bed. Also, I found that this faded a lot for me - mostly, I was just so used to apathy that all of the feelings I suddenly felt were an overload, and I had cycled over the negative so much that I was more prone to it. As I got used to emotion and built more positive thought patterns, the sensitivity faded. Still, you should be able to take before bed - check with your prescriber first, but I would recommend it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the reason I made this post actually. On the 25th it'll be a month since I started taking this SSRI and I've had a lot of up and down days both mentally and physically. Good luck fellow redditor!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good luck to you too! Some days are better than others, but nothing too horrible. To me it just feels a bit like PMS - fine one minute, ready burst into tears or tell someone in the office to fuck off the next. Physically Iâ€™ve had no symptoms, but I am still on half a tablet...things might get interesting when I start taking a full one at the weekend!</p>
<p>Having said all that, my mother started taking the same SSRI about a year ago and had zero side effects. She reckons she felt much better mentally within a couple of weeks. This is a woman who has IBS and has bad reactions to all sorts of medications.</p>
<p>Hope things even out for you soon!</p></div>		</li>
