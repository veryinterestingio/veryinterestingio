			<div class="markdown"><p>Nonsense. Mutations occur randomly each time the virus replicates. If the virus encounters a host with a vaccine primed immune system, it will be eliminated before it has a chance to undergo significant replication. In an unvaccinated host, the virus is undergoing millions more replications, and this is much much more likley to mutate. </p>
<p>Furthermore, There is evidence that these variance are primarily originating from people with compromised immune systems (strains with multiple mutations emerging simultaneously). Vaccines decrease the overall spread of the virus and therefore the exposure of potential immunocomprimised hosts, thus  decreasing the number of potential variants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In your first paragraph, you talk about how mutations might occur in an infected host.  In that instance you are talking about random mutations, but without any selective pressure those mutations only represent a tiny fraction of the total virus in said host, because the mutations are purely random.</p>
<p>Once you introduce a selective pressure such as the antibodies that exist after recovery from infection, the proportion of mutants that can avoid immune response with respect to the total amount of virus in an infected host becomes exponentially larger.</p>
<p>The effect I just described was actually observed in in-vitro experiments in the paper I linked above.  The conditions used in the experiment would be similar to the cases you described involving immune compromised individuals who can't clear infection, but would also be observed in recovered individuals who are later experiencing a secondary infection.  Viral load would be greater in the immune compromised individual compared to secondary infection in an otherwise healthy person, but when considering how many recovered people are currently on the planet, their contribution becomes quite substantial.</p>
<p>Here's a second article that discusses this topic
from April 1st in The Lancet, if you're interested:</p>
<p><strong>SARS-CoV-2 evolution and vaccines: cause for concern?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(21)00075-8/fulltext" target="_blank">https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(21)00075-8/fulltext</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given that the antibody response to the spike protein is so focused, could mutations in these restricted sequences lead to a less efficacious vaccine, if the human immune response is specific to the vaccine sequence? <strong>These mutations might be driven by antigenic drift, or by selection, either during natural infection or due to the vaccine itself</strong>. When a virus is grown under the selective pressure of a single monoclonal antibody that targets a single epitope on a viral protein, mutations in that protein sequence will lead to the loss of neutralisation, and the generation of escape mutants. This sequence of events has been shown in the laboratory for polio, measles, and respiratory syncytial virus,7 and in 2020 for SARS-CoV-2.</p>
