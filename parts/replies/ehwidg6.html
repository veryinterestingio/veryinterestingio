			<div class="markdown"><p>From webMD and /u/danby:</p>
<p>Hair on the scalp grows about .3 to .4 mm/day or about 6 inches per year. Unlike other mammals, human hair growth and shedding is random and not seasonal or cyclical. At any given time, a random number of hairs will be in one of three stages of growth and shedding: anagen, catagen, and telogen.</p>
<p><strong>Anagen</strong> - The active growth stage (between 2months and 6 years).</p>
<p>During this phase the hair grows about 1 cm every 28 days. Scalp hair stays in this active phase of growth for two to six years (depending on the individual).</p>
<p>Some people have difficulty growing their hair beyond a certain length because they have a short active phase of growth. On the other hand, people with very long hair have a long active phase of growth. The hair on the arms, legs, eyelashes, and eyebrows have a very short active growth phase of about 30 to 45 days, explaining why they are so much shorter than scalp hair.</p>
<p><strong>Catagen</strong> - The hair follicle regeneration phase. About 3% of all hairs are in this phase at any time. This phase lasts for about two to three weeks. Growth stops and the outer root sheath shrinks and attaches to the root of the hair. This is the formation of what is known as a club hair.</p>
<p><strong>Telogen</strong> -  The resting phase and usually accounts for 6% to 8% of all hairs. This phase lasts for about 100 days for hairs on the scalp and longer for hairs on the eyebrow, eyelash, arm, and leg. During this phase, the hair follicle is completely at rest and the club hair is completely formed. Pulling out a hair in this phase will reveal a solid, hard, dry, white material at the root. About 25 to 100 telogen hairs are shed normally each day.</p>
<p>*e: <strong>tldr:</strong> Terminal hair length is pre-programmed. Scalp hair is naturally the longest. The length of time it grows does vary by individual, with 6 years generally the maximum. When it stops growing, the follicle atrophies and is eventually shed beginning the growth cycle anew. Each hair follicle is in a random stage and not uniform, so unlike some other mammals such as dogs that may shed seasonally, we shed a small amount of hairs daily  (25 - 100 usually). Because of that small amount we may not even realize that all our hair is continually being regenerated at some point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So one time a single hair grew in between my eyebrow and hair line but it was spider silk thin. Never even saw it or noticed it till it reached all the way down my face.    Impossibly thin.   Nearly invisible.   Pulled it out and it never grew back.   </p>
<p>Why did that happen?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does the body know the length of the follicle of hair? When you get your hair cut it begins to grow again or if you shaved your arm for instance it'll grow until it's back to the original length.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to think it was because you just “shed” eyebrow hair before it can get longer... but the follicle cells are actually “programmed” to stop growing every couple months. I’d be interested to know more about it though</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wrong. All hair cells just grow for a period, rest, shed, repeat.</p>
<p>The cells aren’t “programmed” and don’t “know when to stop growing”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wrong. All cells are “programmed” - DNA is the code. </p>
<p>And I never said the cells “know” when to stop - only that they are programmed to do so every couple months. But this is ELI5, so that’s actually a great way to describe it.</p>
<p>Go argue semantics on /r/science or something</p></div>		</li>
