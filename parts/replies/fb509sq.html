			<div class="markdown"><p>That reminds of of Febreeze. It's an odor *killer*, not a cover-up. But when people use it and then don't smell anything, they assume it's not working. They added scents, and sales improved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes there is a &quot;Zero&quot; or &quot;Free&quot; etc branded version.   No added scent.</p>
<p>EDIT: Wow. Lot of people stoked about Febreze, lol.

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is technically just a cover up. The main ingredient in Febreeze is beta-cyclodextrin. It's a ring shaped  molecule. The water in the spray helps to dissolve odor causing molecules and then the cyclodextrin surrounds it. This makes it so the odor molecule can't bond to your scent receptors. The molecules that cause the scent are still there, but your nose can't smell it because it's been masked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right. The covering-up function is pretty pathetic if you calculate how many malodor molecules the Febreeze can trap. Cyclodextrins are much bigger than malodor molecules and the two bind one-to-one, so you don't get much bang for your buck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The protein stains are primarily removed by enzymes in laundry detergents. Also, Laundry detergents are already basic(pH above 7, average is 10+ for heavy duty detergents), so essentially the vinegar would be neutralized by the detergent if used simultaneously. It does help clean the washing machine on its own by removing hard water stains &amp; deposits that can trap smells and breed bacteria. In short, Vinegar does a poor job of cleaning clothes but a good job of cleaning your washing machine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah wtf do they mean about breaking down minerals &amp; proteins? Maybe helps get them into solution, but I know for a fact 5% acetic acid wouldn't do shit to proteins. I hardly think a small addition of a bit of 5% acetic acid would do much against the pH of the detergent as noted above. OP sounds like they read a 'vinegar solves all home problems' book and posted their synopses</p></div>		</li>
