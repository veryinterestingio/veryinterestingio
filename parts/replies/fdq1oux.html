Dry air and dry skin like feet or hands will also be slippery at extremely high pressures, its about the interface between materials more than the lubrication effects on friction. Perhaps you could even say that trapping liquid in the interface helps hold a vacuum to induce extra help from the surrounding atmospheric pressure.</p></div>		</li>
