			<div class="markdown"><p>He's saying the mechanism for inflammation does not exist for single cells.  It, by definition, requires multiple cells in which the individual cells are expendable.  I get your question, and the wording made a leap, but suffice to say inflammation as commonly understood cannot exist for a single celled lifeform.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good answer. I’ll also add that it helps to think about what “inflammation” really is. Inflammation as we observe it is vasodilation, cellular migration, with interleukin and cytokine release at the site of whatever it is that pissed off the resident immune cells there (could be dendritic cells, histiocyte, mast cells, etc). The vasodilation is caused by these signaling components that are released by the cell. This is what causes the redness, and swelling. These immune factors also stimulate the sensory nerves in the area and attribute to the pain factor of inflammation. </p>
<p>Single celled organisms don’t have any of these things. They are just one cell. Just like you said: when they’re hurt or infected they’ll usually just walk themselves off the mortal coil, or one of your specialized T cells can do it for them.</p></div>		</li>
