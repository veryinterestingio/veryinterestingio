			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of sequencing being done by various groups so they can track the mutations. The <a href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/collaboration/covid-19-genomics-uk-cog-uk-consortium/" target="_blank">COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium</a>, for example, states they have over 150,000 samples.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They'll look closely at everything, both new and old samples and also the coronaviruses in the suspected original species (leading suspect is bats) - they want to find where in the timeline it jumped species. When a sample is collected, the location, date, and other info is (hopefully) attached to that sample. If we understand where, when, and how it jumps species we can better prevent outbreaks in the future.</p></div>		</li>
