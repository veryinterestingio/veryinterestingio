</blockquote>
<p>The short answer is yes. Most people will produce antiviral antibodies following exposure to any virus.  However, these antibodies are not always effective at completely getting rid of the virus, so the virus might still continue to hang around indefinitely even after the person has recovered from the acute (initial) illness. The consequences of having a virus still present, depends largely on the type of virus. Sometimes the virus hangs around forever, but doesn't cause any additional problems. Sometimes the virus re-emerges years later, causing problems, like in the classic examples below:</p>
<p>1.Chickenpox (caused by the Varicella Zoster virus): Most people will recover from chickenpox and have circulating antibodies. Even though we typically regard these people as immune,  the varicella zoster virus, (VZV), will persist by hiding out in a dormant (or latent) state in the nerves throughout the body. If a person's immune system is weakened, the virus may re-emerge causing the disease &quot;shingles&quot;, which is most commonly seen in the elderly or immunocompromised. If you've been vaccinated against chickenpox you will not develop this complication. </p>
<p>2.Some viruses hang around, slowly causing damage over the years. A good example is the Hepatitis B virus. You can tell if someone has been infected with HepB in the past, because they will have various circulating antibodies specific to the virus. However, in order to actually get rid of the virus, they must make an antibody specific to a protein on the outer viral capsule, called the Hepatitis B surface antigen. About 5-10% of infected adults will not make this antibody. So even though these people have circulating anti-Hepatitis B antibodies, and appear healthy, they will continue to harbour the virus, because they didn't make the right antibodies. Over time, the virus may eventually cause irreversible liver damage, which can go unnoticed for decades. These people are at risk of developing cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer.</p>
<p>3.Epstein Barr Virus (EBV).  This is the virus that causes mononucleosis  (aka “mono” or the “kissing disease”). About 90% of people have been infected wih EBV by the time they are adults and will have circulating antibodies. However, following the initial infection, the virus usually persists at low levels in a latent phase so that it can evade the host’s immune system.  This won’t be a problem for most people, but in a subset of people, this virus may become oncogenic. EBV has been directly linked to a number of cancers (especially lymphomas). </p>
<p>4.Measles: Most children clear the measles virus following the initial acute illness and make antibodies. However, this virus may persist in a small subset of patients and reactivate many years later, causing a severe and often fatal neurologic disorder called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis.</p>
<p>So in all of the above examples, people recovered from the disease and made antibodies, but still harboured the virus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mem B cells are very important for responding to secondary infection, but they are generally not producing antibodies.  In fact they are sorta docile cells when there is no infection going on that we term &quot;long lived.&quot;</p>
<p>The real producers of antibodies for the long term are LLPC or long lived plasma cells.  They cells stick around in your bonemarrow and continue to produce antibodies against all sorts of pathogens that you are immunized against.</p>
<p>Another nit-picky point is that B cells actually do most of their refinement (SHM) after the virus has been cleared.  It takes upwards of a month to start producing LLPC and mem B cells.</p>
<p>That said, everything else you mentioned is spot on, especially the bit about low antigen load and the adaptive response not getting a stab at it in time before the innate system clears it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi there! That’s not quite correct — well, it is correct, but isn’t quite complete. If a disease is eliminated very quickly by our innate immune system, antigen presentation may not activate the adaptive immune system. And since antigen presentation is a key part of triggering the T-cell immune response, there may not be any T-cells created at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That had been explained, so I didn’t get into it as well. There is a gradient between just the innate system responding and the body producing the specific antibody for a specific target that will be detected by an
antibody assay.</p>
<p>As an edit, even more that the body will then create the memory b-cells, t-cells and long lived plasma cells.</p></div>		</li>
