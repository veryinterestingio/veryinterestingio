			<div class="markdown"><p>Some teeth whitener works by removing the top layer of enamel. That is generally the most stained so it makes your teeth whiter.</p>
<p>Modern toothpastes just have the bleaching agent in them.</p>
<p>The exception is anything with charcoal. Charcoal is abrasive and you shouldn't use it on your teeth.</p></div>		</li>
