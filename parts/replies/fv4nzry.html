			<div class="markdown"><p>Another cool way to check this is to hold one hand with the index and middle fingers splayed, like this: ✌️  </p>
<p>Stretch that arm out, line up an object between those fingers, and alternately close each eye. When you close one eye, the object will still be visible between those fingers, but when you open that eye and close the other, it won’t line up anymore. One of your eyes is “dominant”, in the same way you can have a dominant hand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also a slick life hack for estimating distances this way....</p>
<ol>
<li>Hold your right arm out directly in front of you, elbow straight, thumb upright.</li>
<li>Align your thumb with one eye closed so that it covers (or aligns) the distant object you want to measure.</li>
<li>Do not move your head, arm or thumb, but switch eyes, so that your open eye is now closed and the other eye is open. Observe closely where the object now appears with the other open eye. Your thumb should appear to have moved to some other point: no longer in front of the object. </li>
<li>Estimate this displacement XY, by equating it to the estimated size of something you are familiar with (height of tree, building width, length of a car, power line poles, distance between nearby objects). In this case, the distant barn is estimated to be 100′ wide. It appears 5 barn widths could fit this displacement, or 500 feet. Now multiply that figure by 10 (the ratio of the length of your arm to the distance between your eyes), and you get the distance between you and the thicket of blueberry bushes — 5000 feet away(about 1 mile).</li>
</ol>
<p>(click the linky, it has a drawing and explanations about how this works)</p>

<p>BONUS life hack: To estimate how much time remains before the sun sets, hold our your arm straight towards the horizon. Stack your fingers together and estimate how many finger-widths can fit between the horizon and where the sun is located now. For every 1 finger-width you can fit between the sun and the horizon add 15-minutes of day-time left before sunset. So if I can visually fit 3 fingers on my outstretched arm between the sun and that tree line way over there I know I have about 45 minutes left until the sun sets behind those trees.

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is super neat. Your closed fist at the end of your outstretched arm has an angular width of about ten degrees, or about two degrees per finger (including your thumb). The Earth rotates 360° in 24 hours, or 15° per hour. That’s a quarter of a degree every minute, which should be eight minutes per finger, right? </p>
<p>It would be, except that we have to make a few allowances for things like latitude and season, and also because we don’t call it sunset until the sun is completely behind the horizon, which extends the length of each day by a little bit. In a temperate latitude, like most of the US, fifteen minutes per finger is close enough, and we’re accustomed to thinking in terms of quarter-hour intervals anyway. Plus, if you want to know how close sunset is, it’s probably pretty close already; the timespan is short enough that you’re unlikely to be off by more than a half hour or so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another fun thing you can do is relax both eyes, creat a diamond between your right and left hand's thumb and pointer finger, focus on something inside the diamond, and bring that diamond straight towards your face. It will land over one of your eyes instead of on your nose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>r/crossview this is an awesome thing to trick your eyes into seeing 3d. You combine two images into one where the images are the same picture taken about eye distance apart. This simulates what you do in real life and you can see the picture as you would in real life.</p></div>		</li>
