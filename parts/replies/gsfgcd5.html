			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best explanation, IMO. It can get a bit more precise, even, though less ELI5: we all are moving <em>through spacetime</em> at the speed of light. This starts to give a rough understanding of why sufficiently fast motion of the observer actually slows down time itself. When you travel at a significant fraction of the speed of light, you're in effect &quot;borrowing&quot; from your total speed through spacetime; by increasing the magnitude of your speed through the &quot;space&quot; part, you are thus decreasing the magnitude of your speed through the &quot;time&quot; part to compensate (and what I just described as &quot;traveling at a slower speed through time&quot; is experienced as time itself slowing down).</p>
<p>I find that, when explained this way, the whole idea starts to become slightly intuitive (though still completely mind-breaking).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, and it &quot;explains&quot; why light speed is absolute: say Vtotal=
Vspace+Vtime (very rough formula). If You're stationary, the Vspace=0 and Vtime=c, you experience the fastest time pace. </p>
<p>For light, Vtotal=Vspace=c and Vtime=0. In the referential of a photon, time is effectively stopped. It experiences no time from its starting point to its destination, be it millions of lightyears. Light effectively travels instantaneously from its point of view.</p>
<p>Whatever your speed is relative to the photon, the photon goes to Vspace=c and Vtime=0 and you'll appear to be stationnary relative to the photon, your speed is not relevant for a photon.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The slower you are at traveling through space, the faster you travel through time.</p>
<p>The slower you are at traveling through time, the faster you travel through space.</p>
<p>The are indirectly proportional. You cannot get from point a to b point very quickly but take a long time doing it.</p></div>		</li>

Thank you for that, that has broadened my understanding of this phenomenon by a mile.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If i got things right, what they meant to say is that you travel through <em>spacetime</em> at a fixed rate because of a combination of your mass and your velocity. Your <em>real</em> speed should be the speed of light.</p>
<p>BUT due to having mass, the more mass you have, the more <em>space</em> you occupy and thus you borrow from the time part of spacetime, which leads to you going slower when it comes to travelling through time.</p>
<p>If i had to extend this line of thought, thats what happens when you orbit a black hole, the gravity is so intense you go through time dilation, you travel much slower through time compared to the rest of the universe.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's the default speed of everything. It's just that matter gets in the way and makes things slower. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Matter doesn't &quot;get in the way&quot;.  Matter is simply traveling through time and has to &quot;share&quot; &quot;THE speed&quot; between both time and space.  The faster you travel through space, the slower you travel through time.  The slower you travel through space, the fastrer you travel through time.  This is why you age faster when sitting still and slower when moving fast.</p>
<p>Light, on the other hand, does not travel through time at all, so it appears to travel at &quot;THE speed&quot; through space relative to everything else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't understand your statement that light doesn't travel through time at all. Light exists here in one second, and 300,000 km away a second later, so isn't that traveling through time? I think you mean that light never changes the rate at which it travels through time, whereas matter does.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, what you are describing here is the observer traveling through time.  </p>
<p>Light itself does not have proper time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess it’s more accurate to say light doesn’t have mass. So perhaps I should say mass gets in the way. I dunno, I’m not a physicist, I just read up on it a little.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best explanation of why nothing can travel at the speed of light I've ever read. Thank you. </p>
<p>Now I'm wondering if we could somehow play around with other elements like 'time' and 'mass' inorder to cross large areas of space without having to work with just 'speed'.</p>
<p>I'm a completely non-scientifically minded person so the line above probably makes zero sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Light does not, unqualified, travel at the speed. In a vacuum, light travels at the speed of causality. Outside a vacuum, it does not.</p>
<p>Speed of light refers to c, which is constant, rather than the speed at which light travels, which is variable (but limited to c).</p></div>		</li>
