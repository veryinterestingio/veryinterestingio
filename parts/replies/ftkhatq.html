<p>What technology is used to track such numerous,  small debris?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>unfortunately I wasn't involved in that aspect and have no deeper knowledge of it. all I know is that we track about 20-25k such objects and we use groundbased-sensors allover the globe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>my professor in college was one of the leading experts in space debris tracking! they use normal ground-based telescopes and look for glint off of small objects-- that's the only way you see them. Then, you cross reference the location, time, apparent brightness (which can correspond to size and optical properties) and then plug that in to a massive database tracking historical data and propagating that forward in time! You can estimate the location of any object at any point in time by knowing its orbit.</p>
<p>So most of the job is monitoring known objects and tracking orbit degradation, but the exciting bit is when you get a data point that doesn't match with any of your known objects. Then it could be a new one!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's extremely thorough, thankyou.
Another follow-up question if you don't mind: Would the same principles apply to, say, rockets to mars, where we'd have increased relative velocities?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes.</p>
<p>the main problem is that we littered the space around earth. there still is junk floating around in space, but it's more closer to a planet (which traps it for a while in its gravity before it succombs and falls down to the surface). and well, a large to the overwhelming portion of the junk (&quot;debris&quot;) floating around earth is from us, from space-missions, broken off bits from satellites, etc.</p>
<p>but yes, even if you travel towards Mars at lets say 100km/s (voyager1 has a speed of roughly 17km/s), the core principle would stay the same. actually the impacts would become slightly less of an issue, as more of the particle would &quot;evaporate&quot; in that short-lived fusion ball.</p></div>		</li>
