			<div class="markdown"><p>This is so weird to me. Where im from everywhere still teaches cursive by default afaik from the age of, like, 10 or so (at least, i know it was still standard as recently as the late 00's). No offense to you guy, but since everyone above 10 writes in cursive here when i see printed letters my brain thinks im reading something written by a child!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think there is some confusion. I'm from the UK, and I never learnt traditional &quot;cursive&quot;. But I did learn essentially what we called joined up writing. Basic stuff, just connecting each letter to the next. Yanks seem to do the same from what I've read on here and from what I've seen in person. Cursive is more like calligraphy to me IMO.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They just write it in print I believe. <del>In the US I don't think cursive handwriting ever became a mainstream taught skill</del> (I could be completely wrong on this but this seems to be the case every time the subject comes up).</p>
<p>Edit - Ye, just incorrect about that so ignore it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fair enough. I just see threads for this subject and it's usually people from the US that are confused as to what cursive even is but I guess that's just my anecdotal evidence (also more likely due to this being a US dominated website).</p></div>		</li>
