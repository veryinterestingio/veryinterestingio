			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, what OP is describing is very unusual on PC. Generally when a game is downloaded and installed it will be the latest version of that game at the time of download.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe that's generally the case, but I recently purchased RDR2 and the first thing it did after downloading the game is installing an update when the last update came out a few days earlier. I noticed because I tried to play the game right after it finished installing. If I had just waited an extra 10 minutes, I probably wouldn't have noticed. It also was just one big download, containing all updates so far, so from a user experience perspective that's not bad at all.</p>
<p>Probably that's how it works with certain games for whatever reason because of some choices the publisher makes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>RDR2 uses Rockstar launcher on top of Steam, iirc.</p>
<p>Usually what happens is: game has its own launcher, and every major update they push everything to Steam, so you get a reasonably fresh version of the game and then all launcher had to do is pull fresh binaries from the CDN and maybe some assets (models, textures, etc), which is usually not that much.</p>
<p>And Rockstar being Rockstar botched that process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because Rockstar are assholes and make you use their launcher. This didn't used to be the case and for example GTA 5 was updated through Steam.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You would be correct. The publisher decided that, although the game was being sold on Steam, making it work both with and without the Rockstar Launcher was too much work. So they didn't do it, and forced Steam users to use both (granted, the R* Launcher is in the background, but it still causes this issue).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just throwing down with this.</p>
<p>On PC Steam, Origin, Uplay, GOG and Epic give you the latest version of the game that is available.</p>
<p>I have never, ever, had any require another update after a purchase (they may update later but at the moment of purchase you can play right away with the latest build).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had it happen for the first time a couple days ago.  Bought a game, installed it.  Then noticed there was an update.  It was release day for that game so maybe they dropped a day zero patch in the middle of me downloading the original version.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not too sure about some of the other platforms , but origin with battlefield V specifically required an update in game after I just downloaded the patch in origin.  While it wasn't a big update, took like 30 secs to a min. It pretty much is what OP described</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As you say, it happens with online games with launchers on top. One of the worst offenders i've seen was final fantasy XIV where you download about 10 GB on steam followed by 20 GB on launcher. Discovering that update with bad internet is very painful</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I quit playing games for a while. I went to the store to get an Xbox game, super excited to play it. I put it in and immediately I'm prompted with a 10+ gb download. That's 2-3 hours when you don't account for the shitty wifi reception combined with roommates using the internet. Could easily take all day. I honestly bitched about that for several days. Why else would you buy the hard copy of the game if it's not actually on the disc.....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I remember correctly (some graphics programming person once explained it so my version might not be 100% correct) that was often about re-downloading DirectX due to some strange update issue. Between bigger versions they had minor tweaks, usually for specific issues/games and just updating to the highest DirectX version wouldn't necessarily get you the update of some minor side version.</p>
<p>But by installing the needed DirectX version you get the needed files in some folder, even if you already have a more modern version.</p></div>		</li>
