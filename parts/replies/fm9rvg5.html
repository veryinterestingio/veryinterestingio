			<div class="markdown"><p>To play devil's advocate, technically speaking most diseases can be spread by asymptomatic people. For example with e.coil; a person who doesn't wash their hands after using the bathroom would cause cross contamination with any surface they touch afterwords.</p>
<p>Also a question that needs to be asked is how often people realize they are experiencing symptoms?</p>
<p>It is now spring and allergy season is here. I know one reporter here in Chicago who tested positive talked about how her symptoms were so mild she assumed she was experiencing allergies only finding out two days later that it was Covid-19.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>SARS was easier to contain because there were less asymptomatic carriers. Not sure what your point is about e.coli, other than that cross contamination is a vector. The person who did eventually contract SARS showed symptoms and was removed and quarantined before they could infect too many people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well OP was asking the difference between the two diseases sars and covid. Ofc there are other diseases spread. </p>
<p>People blow off the symptoms of covid because they can be not that severe. Sars u knew someone has it since the symptoms are much more severe.</p></div>		</li>
