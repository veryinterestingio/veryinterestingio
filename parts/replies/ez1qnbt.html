			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! This is me! Ik I’m getting one when I feel like my sinuses are starting hurt. I figured out they were actually migraines; after years of trying and failing with many different sinus and allergy medicines. Idk anyone else that gets them this way.
I have a very animated face when I’m talking or reacting to something. So this theory could explain why! Thanks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have spent literally years thinking I have &quot;sinus headaches&quot; as mine are always exactly above the eyes, in the eye-brow region (radiating &quot;into&quot; the eye socket) where the two frontal sinuses are. The fact that migraines (which run in my family) are often only on one side and with aura etc. also didn't help as this suggested that mine &quot;are not actually migraines&quot;. (But there are many other indications that it is indeed migraines). Then I found out about &quot;supraorbital neuralgia&quot; which described my symptoms to a dot, so I am pretty positive it is these types of migraines.</p>
<p>To describe it: It is like this area or these nerves (right above the eyes) are &quot;tender&quot;, this is also why pressure/massage etc. can relieve or possibly even prevent these migraines.</p>
<p>And there are so many other indications...for example...one trigger can be when I am out in the sun (squinching), rest assured I will get a big ass migraine later that night.  Or sitting on the computer for a long time or whatever eye-strain. There is 100% a link. These nerves are also in some weird way &quot;hooked&quot; or &quot;looped&quot; through muscles on the eyeball..I found that &quot;eye exercises&quot; like rolling the eyes in certain ways (when I feel tenderness so that a migraine COULD come on)...because the movement of the eyes relieves tenderness. Or slight massages of the forehead/brow area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if I'm gonna sound insane but I have headaches in my neck/throat. Specifically around the carotid artery/SCM/vagus nerve area. I know it's a headache because it starts as a normal headache.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really related to headaches, but to confirm that migraines can be other places than the head. My kid has &quot;abdominal migraines&quot;. Symptoms present as a particularly fetid smell on his breath, followed by bouts of nausea hours later, usually around dinner time. Around 2 in the morning he'll get woken up by what he described a giant hand squeezing his mid-section, this pain intensifies for hours, with episodic vomiting and diarrhea interspersed. Pain eventually reaches a point that has him squeezed into the fetal position and screaming. This would happen about every six weeks like clockwork. We checked everything, intestinal malrotation, auto-immune diseases, various scans and cancer screenings, as well as dozens of unproductive trips to the ER. Finally we spoke to a pediatric nurse at a check up and she mentioned this. We thought she was joking but we looked up the symptoms and it was like reading a narration of his episodes. Advice for treatment options ranged, but we opted to start low level first, home remedies. Turns out, for him at least, a hot compress on his stomach in the beginning of his symptoms works best, letting him sleep right through the whole ordeal.</p></div>		</li>
