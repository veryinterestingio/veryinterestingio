<p>I use traiditional ones infused with local herbs that promote skin regeneration, but I doubt that'd be available in the US.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Don't jellies do the opposite of let it breathe? Those things are pretty thick to keep the moisture in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think &quot;keep it moist&quot; is the actual benefit. A wound that's left to breathe will dry and and scab, which is useful if you need it to be dirt-resistant quickly in the wilderness but bad if you want it to heal without scarring. Keeping a wound covered in Vaseline and a bandage will let it heal with less scabbing and a better final result.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, yes, depending on how thickly you lather it on. But itvs not like you're going to sleep in a vat of it, or apply it every 30 minutes throughout the day. Just find a good balance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I fell on my face one night and scraped my whole cheek. </p>
<p>Kept it moist the entire time it healed and it never scabbed, just turned pink and then to my normal skin tone. Petroleum jelly and baby oil gel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>a wet wound heals twice as fast as a dry one. in hospitals this is why they keep major wounds bandaged. the trick is to change the bandage every 8 hours and clean the wound as well.</p>
<p>letting a wound air out is a wives tale and not medical science, it works better for smaller wounds where convenience is an issue. the wet healing is more applicable in a hospital setting.</p></div>		</li>
