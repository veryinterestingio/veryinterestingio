			<div class="markdown"><p>Netflix measures a lot of other things, too. Including retention. So they may look to see if members who watch a show are more likely to stay members than those who do not.</p>
<p>Edit: I'll also add another possible benefit. The movies and shows Netflix licenses have two drawbacks: they are often (maybe always) licensed for a limited time, AND have fees they have to pay to the owner, per view. (There may be exceptions there, but that's the general arrangement, as I understand it.)</p>
<p>When Netflix makes their own show, though, it's theirs as long as they want it. And they avoid any ongoing licensing fees. They trade that for the production costs up front, but there's two benefits to that. Long-term, the subscriptions gained/retained can cover those costs and make a profit, AND it's much easier to budget for. Once they've made the film/series, no more costs. But a per-view licensing deal is ongoing and variable. Ongoing and variable is not loved by finance departments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not quite accurate. Films made under the Directors Guild or SAG-AFTRA will owe residual payments to the director’s team and to the actors, even if made directly by Netflix.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not really just about new subscribers. Subscriber retention is huge too. If there's nothing new or good to watch, people will just cancel. If it was just about new subscribers, they would barely need to make new shows, as there's already enough on there to keep a new subscriber busy for months.</p></div>		</li>
