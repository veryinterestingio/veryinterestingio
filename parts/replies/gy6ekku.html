			<div class="markdown"><p>Any populations separated for long enough would eventually see enough genetic drift to radiate into new species, but given the success of our species and self-removal from the food chain that genetic drift would be operating on a scale several hundred thousand years long. We're smart enough to remove or negate most of our environmental pressures which slows down the rate of genetic drift somewhat.</p>
<p>What we would see from a population trapped in say, northern Europe, would likely be more and more hair over time to help trap body heat, a general rise in body heat production, and possibly the reintroduction of the ability to self-produce Vitamin C, but most species that hit the level where environmental pressures aren't much of a concern see their rate of genetic drift slow to the point where significant changes are few and far between.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Darker skin is protective against the ultra violet radiation from the light thereby needing more time exposed to the sun's rays for conversation into vitamin D.</p>
<p>The idea is less intense sun in the northern regions, skin lost the pigment over a long time to adopt to low sun light. So that absorbs vitamin D quickly but is maladapted for intense UV rays, hence why it burns easier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Blue eyes for example have lower pigmentation, which is created by melanin<br />
Eye Pigment<br />
Eye color is created by melanin, which also dictates skin color. The more melanin in your iris, which is the colored area surrounding the pupil, the darker your eye color will be. Caucasian babies are born with no melanin, and thus have blue eyes, until about three years of age when their eyes darken to its permanent color (Asian and black babies are born with dark brown eyes). More melanin also means better protection from the sun-- the pigment in your eyes literally protects your retina.<br />
Macular Degeneration<br />
Age-related macular degeneration is more common in Caucasians than African Americans, as eyes with less pigment allow more light in the eye. But, studies show people with dark brown eyes are subject to greater risk for developing cataracts. Protecting your eyes from direct sunlight can lower this risk, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the detailed answer. It led me to a Google search that suggests blue eyes may be more advantageous for seeing in the dark and are less prone to developing cataracts. It is also claimed that all blue-eyed individuals share a common ancestor. I can't speak to how factual this information is, but from my own experience I was suspecting there was very little advantage to having them since they are so sensitive to sunlight, so would be happy to be proven wrong!</p></div>		</li>
