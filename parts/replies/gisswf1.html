			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why I love reddit. How someone so perfectly qualified to answer this person's random question just happens to read it today and haa time to answer it just astounds me.</p>
<p>Thanks for the question OP, and for the excellent answer, professor! Definitely something I've always wanted to understand too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1) I’ve never seen “parent/child”! Only ever “parent/daughter”. Always make jokes about the unnecessary gendering of isotopes hahah.
2) I’m a thermochronologist (Helium!) doing some dabbling in U-Pb &amp; Rb-Sr and I never thought I’d see Concordia mentioned on Reddit in such exquisite detail. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, when I started teaching this course I made a point of using parent/child because the parent/daughter always seemed weird. It's definitely not common, though I have seen it a few other places. </p>
<p>Enjoy the He. I firmly in the middle, using a ton of U-Pb, but increasingly getting into thermochronology as well, but more on the side of how to model the cooling history as opposed to the details of the analytical procedures.</p></div>		</li>
