			<div class="markdown"><p>Would you mind answering a question I've had for a while? Why would different NSAIDs affect people differently if they target the same enzymes? For example I get headaches occasionally that do not respond to Aspirin at all, Paracetamol sometimes helps, but ibuprofen works every time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two general factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>Though they target the same enzyme, they don't all target the same exact location on the enzyme, or interact with it the same way.  This seems minor, but can change the outcome drastically, classic example is Aspirin.  It covalently bonds to the active site, effectively knocking out platelet binding capacity for the life of the platelet.  This partly why it is consider &quot;cardio protective&quot; where as the other NSAIDs come with warnings about cardivascular incidents.  </li>
<li>Until Personalized medicine fully ramps up, everything is going to have fairly wide response variation, because: genetic variation.</li>

Can you elaborate on how personalized medicine can solve this problem.?</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of the differences are due to selectivity of the drugs for COX1 vs COX2 enzymes.  Broadly speaking, COX1 assists in blood clotting and protection of your GI tract while COX2 is involved in inflammation and pain. </p>
<p><strong>Low dose aspirin</strong> effects COX1 enzymes more than COX2 so it isn't a useful analgesic, but is very useful in preventing blood clots. This is why it is used to help prevent heart attacks. Higher doses of aspirin (not massive doses) will provide an analgesic effect as well.</p>
<p><strong>Ibuprofen</strong> is a nonspecific COX inhibitor which means it inhibits both enzymes roughly equally and is more commonly used as an anti-inflammatory.</p>
<p><strong>Paracetamol</strong> is a generic name for acetaminophen which is not a NSAID. It has a different mechanism which isn't well understood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tylenol or Paracetamol (depending on where you call home) has some pretty adverse effects on the liver,  I was aware of a toxicity study in rats where the was some liver damage even at normal dose level, it's also a bloody aweful drug to overdose on, as the cause of death is usually liver failure, long drawn out liver failure!</p></div>		</li>
