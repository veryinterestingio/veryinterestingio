			<div class="markdown"><p>Fireflies can synchronize their blinking pattern depending on their degrees of connections.
It has been tested that a LED can trick their pattern (see Robin Meier and Andr√© Gwerder)</p>
<p>It has also been observed in humans watching a fire walking ritual. Heartbeats synced more or less, and the closer they were synced, the closer people actually were : family, long-time friends.</p>
<p>I extrapolated a bit by comparing rocks and living entities, but i think the &quot;locking pattern&quot; is studied in Chaotic Systems (Chaos Theory).</p></div>		</li>
