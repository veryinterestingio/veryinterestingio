			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a parallel there, so sort of, but not really.</p>
<p>The point of giving malaria was to give someone a fever (and they ramped it up by swaddling them in electric blankets, using hot water bottles, etc.) bad enough for the body to be able to rally against syphilis.  That's why we called it pyrotherapy, or heat therapy.  It wasn't reliable, but it was better than the alternatives we had, and it ultimately relied on fever's ability to slow bacterial reproduction until the immune system caught up as alluded to above.  Getting the body hot enough to directly kill syphilis would kill the patient or leave them a vegetable.</p>
<p>We have lots of chemotherapy drugs and lots of different kinds of cancer, but the general principle of chemotherapy is to find a drug that will kill certain human cells (cancers) faster than other human cells.  The immune system doesn't play much of a role for two reasons.  First, one of the reasons cancer is so insidious is that cancer cells are your cells, and successful cancers are ones that manage to fool the immune system into not responding.  (Your body kills other pre-cancerous cells that fail this test all the time.)  Second is that the immune system often gets hit hard by chemotherapy drugs themselves, since it's hard to target them.</p>
<p>The task of designing a chemotherapy drug that only hits cancer cells is herculean and really can only happen with very specific kinds of cancers that have mutated in an exploitable way.  People treat chemotherapy like the people designing and using it are barbarians using the leech and the saw or something, but the problem is just <em>really hard</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well this is NOT easy to explain, and I find myself lacking a definitive answer. From what i can read <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4858228/" target="_blank">HERE</a> it has to do with a cumulus of factors: enzyme inhibition, increase of the bacteria's metabolism (which together with the body's ability to lower the supply of nutrients helps further kill the bacteria)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but in order to infect a healthy human the bacteria need to either reproduce faster than the immune system can respond, hide until the same thing happens, or just be present in enough numbers at the start that it doesn't matter.  </p>
<p>So they need to be superbly adapted to living in a human.  Human body goes: ha ha rule change bitches, and increases the temp.  The bugs no longer have quite the same edge as previously.  Maybe enough to for the body to win the fight.  But also maybe not- lots of people died from infections before modern medicine, after all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Biology is very delicate. At high heat proteins can unfold, from droplet like things or precipitate out. If those don’t happen, heat can change the enzyme efficiency or dynamics to change the delicate balance of the many working parts of cells. So though sometimes a little heat can heat simple processes up, organisms are usually extremely attuned to living at a certain temperature.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It is also worth noting that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30539506/" target="_blank">some</a> cancers have better treatments (immunotherapy). We are working on expanding this approach.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m actually on immunotherapy for MS, although the drug I’m on was originally designed to treat leukemia.  They’d often pair it with chemo to make it more effective for cancer patients, but people with MS get it alone.  </p>
<p>I can’t imagine how they feel when it’s paired with chemo, because I feel like crap after just the immunotherapy.</p></div>		</li>
