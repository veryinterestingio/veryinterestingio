			<div class="markdown"><p>Many animals in captivity often limit defecation to a particular part of their enclosure like a corner or somewhere they feel safe. Animals are often like us in that they try to avoid defecating in places they eat and sleep (really depending on the animal) so you might not see them doing this in their main living area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Primatologist here. I worked with Spider Monkeys in Belize and we observed areas under trees where there was a large amount of fecal buildup. It wasn’t clear if these were actual latrines or if these areas just coincided with preferred sleeping spots. We noted every time one of these spots were utilized and it was pretty rare that they were used outside of sleeping times. They did forage in these areas during the day and they did not exclusively use the “latrine” areas to go to the bathroom. </p>
<p>The only primates that have had latrine behaviour documented are lemurs. Remember that lemurs are actually fairly separated on the evolutionary chain from New World and Old World primates and tend to have more primitive characteristics. Thus, this behaviour may be a primitive hold out. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, more fascinatingly, humans are the only animal whose movement leads with the genitals. Normal standing posture has the penis protruding way out in front.

			<div class="markdown"><p>It isn't a design flaw, because it isn't by design. Evolution doesn't plan ahead. We started like every other primate, genitals tucked under and intercourse from behind; missionary position isn't something you see a lot outside humans.</p>
<p>When some mutation made us start to stand more erect, we were not designed for it (hips, pelvis, etc.); but it was so advantageous it overcame the negative points that came with it. Being able to sprint is such a big evolutionary deal we can deal with childbirth and intercourse not working the way it had for millions of years. Some stuff is cramped, some stuff is out of place, but whatever.</p>
<p>Don't think 'someone screwed up their design'; think 'when something better came along, the other parts of us had to deal with it best they could'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s funny you said that because I just read a book on World War I and the soldiers said how  once they went over the top of their trenches into battle, they were always aware of trying to protect their genitals. Even though bullets and mortars were flying everywhere, they felt that their genitals were in an exposed spot.</p></div>		</li>
