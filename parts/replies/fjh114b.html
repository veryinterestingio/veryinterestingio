			<div class="markdown"><p>Best way to tell is to turn on the hot water all the way up. When it's at it's hottest the water should be a little uncomfortable but not so hot that it scalds you.</p>
<p>Edit: to clarify, I mean to turn the hot water all the way up at the faucet not at the hot water tank</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it has a tank, do not decrease the temperature of the hot water heater too much though, that is a health risk.</p>
<p>You should have a mixing valve directly off the hot water heater that lowers the output temperature of the water to a safe hot, which then gets mixed again by the shower to 'warm', but the water in the water heater should stay quite hot. Depends on the model, mine has many settings, and &quot;B&quot; is the minimum recommended for safety.</p>
<p>Also, keeping the water heater very hot makes it last longer.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Your hot water tank should be around 140. You could maybe push it to 130, but you probably don't want more than 110 coming out of your taps. So you mix it at the water heater first, down to the max temp you want coming in contact with skin (my house has a separate 'pure hot' line coming out to go to certain appliances), and then your shower adjustment range will feel more granular too and your tank will last longer.</p></div>		</li>
