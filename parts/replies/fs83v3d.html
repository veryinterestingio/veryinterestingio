<p>That’s also, why you AREN’T supposed to stare down a gorilla, because then they try to punch your face in.</p>

<p>There was this zoo where out of the blue the gorilla jumped out of the exhibit enbankment and beat the shit out of this old lady. turns out every day for like 5 years she would go there, stand in the same spot, and stare him in the eyes for like an hour.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, this was Bokito in Rotterdam. Best part was When Bokito entered the cafetaria where a guy was working the fries and burgers and was oblivious to the panic outside. Bokito approaches the kitchen, burger guy turns around, sees a live gorilla standing meters from him and simply drops on the floor from shock. He woke up in the hospital a few days later.</p>
<p>Bokito didn't touch him btw. That lady tho was lucky she came out of it alive.</p>
<p>To end the story, Bokito wasn't euthanized, because it was obvious he was provoked and he didn't harm other people nor did he kill her, which he easily could have done.</p></div>		</li>
