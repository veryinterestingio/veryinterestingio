			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. People seem to completely misunderstand the care and process involved in producing the exact right type of mould in the exact right way when making cheese. </p>
<p>Compared with old cheese which just has random mould on it.</p>
<p>Mushrooms were a great comparison. We eat mushrooms from the store but wouldn't go picking random ones unless we really knew what we were doing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>also what makes cultivating mushrooms so difficult outside of lab settings</p>
<p>there’s probably no hobby more reliant on sterilization than mushrooms. If there’s an environment you’ve created that’s perfect for mushrooms it’s also perfect for mold and some other stuff. In the same way, we like that fungus but literally any other mold growing means mission failed and scrap it all</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a comparison mushrooms are literally fungi fruiting body.</p>
<p>If you leave mildly cheese long enough it will grow mushrooms and no you definitely don't want to eat those.</p></div>		</li>
