			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm currently listening to an audiobook titled &quot;The True Creator of Everything: How the Human Brain Shaped the Universe as We Know It&quot; by neuroscientist Miguel Nicolelis. It is a pretty fascinating read so far. In it one discussion is about how primates are very social and primarily use touch in their social interactions yet humans evolved away from this. One theory is that when the brain evolved we replaced much of the touch interactions by developing language instead.   </p>
<p>He goes on to talk about how talking, namely gossiping, fires off neurotransmitters and releases dopamine. Its audiobook so I can't pinpoint exactly what &quot;page&quot; it is that the study he cited about gossip but it is very interesting.   </p>
<p>Sorry got off on a tangent but your comment reminded me about the chapter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course they do. They also feel cold too, which is why they hang out in the hot springs.</p>
<p>Their fur is designed to prevent them from staying wet and becoming popsicles in the cold weather when they leave the hot spring.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is not obvious at all. Air is a great insulator and a layer of air trapped between this dense layer of fur, for surely hair cannot grow so dense as to become waterproof on its own, should serve to keep the heat away from them. </p>
<p>If I am not mistaken, exactly that is one of the purposes of why otters are trapping air in their fur, to keep the cold of the water surrounding them at bay</p></div>		</li>
