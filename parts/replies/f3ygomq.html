<p>Victorian Era engineers often built things with huge safety margins</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's technically not true, technically. They didn't know the real strength, so they'd overbuild to make sure it didn't fall down. Since it sometimes still did, it's clear that the materials had lower strengths than they thought. </p>
<p>Think about it this way - you read somewhere that a 1&quot; square steel tube can support 10 tons per square inch. You can't find out how true that is, nor can you find out if that means on it's end, as a vertical post, or sideways, or even at a 45Â° angle or what. So you use 4 square inches to support 10 tons. What's your safety factor? You don't know. It may be negative, it may be 4, who knows? </p>
<p>The Victorians had a decent idea of how strong a metal bar would be, and could calculate the moment based on load and length and all that, but if the steel was somehow sub-par, the beam might have been much weaker than needed. So they had a safety factor based on certain assumptions that they knew was a reasonable best guess, +/- a factor of 10. </p>
<p>Today's engineering is way better because we have better materials - precise steel alloys with tolerances of .01% and rigid quality assurance standards. This lets us actually calculate a real safety factor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, things that were going to fall down, generally did so either during construction, or in the first few years. If it stays up for 200 years, then with proper maintenance, it'll stay up forever or until maintenance gets too expensive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thatâ€™s just survivorship bias. Victorian engineers also built plenty of stuff that fell down within a few decades.</p></div>		</li>
