			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, I'm a geneticist and I used to work with wheat.</p>
<p>Ignoring any accidental mix-ups, almost all bread is made using flour derived from multiple plants of the same variety. Additionally, wheat is grown from seed so each plant is slightly different from the next in a single batch. There is even slight detectable variation in plants that were grown from seed resulting from self-pollination, which is usually the case for commercial varieties as this stabilises the genetics. You'd therefore probably be able to trace the bread back to a particular variety using SSR markers but not to a specific plant grown in the field.</p>
<p>Hypothetically, if the loaf of bread under investigation was made using only flour from a single variety, then finding this variety would be possible but extremely laborious. It would require analysing all the possible varieties you think it might be and then looking for a match in SSR calls. There may be some varieties with sequence data available but the majority of breeders wouldn't want to share the exact genetic makeup of their creations in fear of someone using the knowledge to create an equivalent or even better variety.  </p>
<p>To make the job even more difficult, a lot of commercial wheat cultivars will be fairly similar and differ at only a few loci on their chromosomes. As some DNA may be degraded in the baking process, there's also a chance that some of the unique markers we're looking for to distinguish one variety from the next could disappear.</p>
<p>There is actually a company in the UK known called 'Plant Breeders Rights' which registers varieties in the UK for protection of intellectual property. Your best bet would be to bribe this company with the hope that they might hand over some data for you to use. ;)</p>
<p>TL;DR
You could trace it back to a variety (but not an individual plant) and only if you have a lot of money and time on your hands.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Let's say you had the time and resources of the US government. If you built up a database of the DNA of wheat from every wheat farm in the US, like let's say took 100 samples from every wheat farm that paid taxes at any point 2000 through 2020, could you take any loaf of bread, without a label, and using its DNA trace it back to a farm? How useful and significant would it even be in the first place?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have time to revisit this, I'm wondering if you would have any insight about how very different Turkish varieties of wheat are compared to U.S. and European wheat.  The bread in Turkey was amazing to me.  Of course we had great bread in Germany but it still wasn't ekmek or pida.  I realize that the sourdough culture used in Turkey may differ substantially from anything I could get in Europe or here, but still I wonder if the wheat is the real difference.  I hardly eat bread at all anymore because it always disappoints. I certainly don't bother with non-sourdough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, I’ll say up front, I deal entirely with prokaryotes, which wheat is not. However, when we want to identify a bacteria, we will examine the 16s rRNA gene, the gene that encodes for the RNA that makes up the ribosome. It’s particularly useful in that it’s conserved enough (or similar enough) in all bacterial species that we can create a single set of primers (short single stranded DNA) that can bind to that gene in every bacteria. But it’s also different enough that, when we sequence it, we can then run it through a database (called BLAST, or Basic Local Alignment and Search Tool) that will compare it to every known DNA sequence we know of, and if we have pure enough, well sequenced enough DNA, we can identify precisely which organism it came from. </p>
<p>Now as I said, I’m not an expert with eukaryotes like I am prokaryotes, but I do believe that the 18s rRNA gene in eukaryotes (and therefore wheat) works the same way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That does it for species identification. I think the OP wants to trace back to the specific plant or at least subpopulation. That's where the rRNA won't cut it and you'll have to look at fingerprinting polymorphisms. I have no idea how genetically variable our wheat strains are, though. Probably not much. Then again, plant genetics is weird, so who knows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>88 Celsius sounds undercooked to me. I usually bring my bread up to 97c core temp. That seems to be the conventional wisdom here in northern Europe. This works for an ordinary flour water salt sourdough bread, but especially when you include some whole grain flour.</p>
<p>Curious to se so many american (?) google results mentioning lower temperatures. I also notice those pictures showing really lightly baked breads with no apparent crust. Cultural differences?</p></div>		</li>

<p>88 C sounds low to me, too (I'm American). Most recipes I have that say an internal temp are more like 93-95 C. I haven't seen a temperature for them but would expect the hearty whole grain breads of northern Europe (like a German volkornbrot) to need higher temperatures than that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How the heck do you even measure the core temp of a loaf of bread? Do you just stick an instant read thermometer in it? I'd be afraid of messing with it too much and deflating it or something.</p>
<p>I bake bread a lot and I just tell if it's done by looking at the color of the crust, the whole idea of checking the core temp sounds foreign to me.</p></div>		</li>
