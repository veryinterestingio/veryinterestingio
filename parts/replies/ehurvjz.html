<p>The answer is homogenization. Yes emulsifiers help, but the real trick comes in at the homogenizer.</p>

<p>It's really the combination of the two that makes it incredibly stable. I did a stint in the QA department of a company that supplied the cocoa and stabilizer mixture. I personally tested every single batch that shipped. Just heating the milk, adding the cocoa mixture, and shaking it would keep the mixture pretty damn stable for at least two weeks. The homogenizer and mixers increase the stability that extra bit needed and ensure uniformity when shifting from batch testing to mass production.</p></div>		</li>
