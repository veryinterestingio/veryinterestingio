			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, yeah, I remember reading about that. As an additional question: are there viruses that cause an infection but don't ever cause symptoms? Such that you'd only ever find out about them by observing them under a microscope?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there are some viruses that seem to be completely symptom-free, though they are the exception, not the rule. More common are viruses that occasionally cause symptoms, where “occasionally” might range from one in a thousand all the way up to 100%. </p>
<p>The classic examples of symptomless viruses are spumaviruses (“Foamy Viruses”), members of the retrovirus family that are widespread among animals (though there doesn’t seem to be a true human version). The most studied (“most” is relative, since these don’t seem to cause any disease there’s limited interest in them) are simian spumaviruses, since these occasionally infect humans - still, apparently, with no symptoms at all. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>FV [foamy virus] is considered non-pathogenic in natural and experimental hosts but systematic, longitudinal studies have not been conducted to verify the apparent non-pathogenicity. Humans can be zoonotically infected with a variety of SFVs originating from Old World monkeys and apes (OWMA) through occupational and natural exposures but demonstrate an apparently asymptomatic though persistent infection</p>

<p>The reason these viruses seem to be so harmless is that they infect cells that are about to be shed anyway, so they don’t end up significantly changing the natural biology. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>While FVs share many features with pathogenic retroviruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus, FV infections of their primate hosts have no apparent pathological consequences. ... We show that superficial differentiated epithelial cells of the oral mucosa, many of which appear to be shedding from the tissue, are the major cell type in which SFV replicates. Thus, the innocuous nature of SFV infection can be explained by replication that is limited to differentiated superficial cells that are short-lived and shed into saliva. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the longest time we thought that non-symptomatic viral infections like HPV basically did nothing. And then we discovered their replication impacted cells and lead to oncogenic effects.</p>
<p>All this molecular biology stuff is so incredibly complicated, I think we are only beginning to scratch the surface of how all of these things interact. Some foamy viruses were discovered after I was born and I'm only 36. IIRC some zoonotic infections have also been isolated from cancers in humans. I'm curious to see if we will eventually see some sort of cancer link.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That starts to get in to semantics, since by definition, you must have illness (at some point) to be considered &quot;infected&quot;, otherwise you are just &quot;colonized&quot; by a virus. And you are colonized with countless viruses. The microbiome is made up of not just probiotic bacteria but viruses as well. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>Poliovirus</em> can infect a person without causing any symptoms. It’s an example of an inapparent infection; the virus gets into the host and begins to replicate, but only enough to ensure that the virus can be spread to other hosts and not enough to actually cause disease and therefore no symptoms.
When polio was just one of many disease people had to be concerned about, a majority of people were infected with <em>poliovirus</em> but never showed any symptoms, allowing them to continue spreading the virus around. However, a <em>poliovirus</em> infection will reach someone and replicate enough to cause disease, as well as the symptoms that go with it.</p>
<p>There is no virus, at least none that I know of, that can cause infection without <em>ever</em> showing any symptoms. If that were case, it would either be the most useless virus ever, or the most deadly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It depends on what you would define as the goal of a virus.  If it was to replicate and survive then a highly infectious virus that caused no symptoms would be the ideal virus.  If the goal of the virus was to kill as many hosts as possible then it would be the worst virus ever.  The problem is that the more lethal a virus is, the less chance it has of surviving - this is the problem with ebola, it is so lethal that pandemics burn out by killing those infected before they can spread it and it only survives due to natural reservoirs in animals that are not susceptible to symptoms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Women actually are occasionally checked for HPV - there are tests that detect only the high-risk strains that may lead to cervical cancer. Herpes is the one we really never check for because so many people are seropositive(have antibodies present in their blood) without ever showing symptoms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you think about it it's actually an evolutionary advantage for a virus because it makes it more likely to spread.  The problem with this latest SARS2 virus is ironically that's it's actually not that deadly and very likely to have asymptomatic carriers.  This makes it spread really quickly and cause more problems.  On the other hand imagine a virus that kills anyone the moment they catch it - this wouldn't last very long.</p></div>		</li>
