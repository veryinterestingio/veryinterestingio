			<div class="markdown"><p>Sodium and chlorine are not trace elements in this context, they form major ions both in the minerals/compounds that are weathered then delivered to the oceans, and within the seawater itself. </p>
<p>Sodium is contained in the most widespread silicates in the crust - plagioclase and alkali feldspars. After decomposition by chemical weathering, the liberated Na+ ions from these feldspars makeup the vast majority of Na supplied to seawater. Chlorine in seawater may have been derived from subaerial and subaquatic exhalations (ie. volcanic gases/ash ejected into the atmosphere which subsequently dissolve into seawater, and water ejected at deep sea-hydrothermal vents) and the decomposition of micaceous sheet-silicates on land which also are subjected to chemical weathering.</p>
<p>Also, oceans do not simply accumulate salts endlessly over time. There are removal processes as well as this supply of salts. Hydrothermal vent systems remove certain salts as well as adding others (there are other removal processes too). The history of ocean salinity has not been a linear one, with each salt having its own set of chemical kinetics controlled by all sorts of geological factors. </p>
