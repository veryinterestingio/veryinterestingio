			<div class="markdown"><p>Am also a geneticist and vouch for this poster's answer. The specific test for determining relatedness  between individuals is called Identity By Descent, which looks at the fraction of shared polymorphisms between people. We use this test in our own lab to verify that the families we study are related the way they state they are, very important when you're looking at inheritance patterns for a genetic feature. And I will tell you...the data doesn't lie. Some days figuring out the real pedigree is like an episode of Maury.</p>
<p>23&amp;Me, while they are direct to consumer and there is a lot of mistrust for how some larger companies have handled private data, have also been making actual research contributions from their dataset. And not just funsie genetics, they've done studies on real medical topics like autism and infertility too. That's nothing to sneer at!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this a serious question? Lol.</p>
<p>No. HIPAA requires that people be specifically consented to share their genetic data with other companies. If they aren't, then the only way you can share data is in aggregate, ie &quot;42/1700 people had variant A&quot;, such that it's not possible to uniquely identify anyone in the dataset.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, there are still vaccination and climate change deniers, so why expect anything different with DNA and genetics? People that know absolutely nothing about scientific evidence get really caught up with words like “theory” or “99%.” Nothing can be 100%; If I jump out of a spaceship without a spacesuit, there is a .000001% chance that an alien ship would  appear right as I exit the spacecraft and save me. Basically, people are dumb.</p>
<p>Edit: added a 1 to the end of the alien probability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can someone tell me why the test I did six years ago detected no Native American dna, though both grandmothers were born on Cherokee and Apache reservations and said they were Indian. Were they lying or did the test miss something?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's impossible to know for sure why you tested as having non-native. One option is that they were lying, or misinformed. Another is that due to the nature of genetic inheritance and meiotic recombination you did not get any native american markers passed down to you --  a biological explanation. Or a technical explanation, simply, there are not enough markers in the database to give good estimates on native american ancestry. This is a huge problem with essentially all non-white europeans as the number of sequenced genomes/samples is magnitudes higher for europeans than for other ethnicities. </p></div>		</li>
