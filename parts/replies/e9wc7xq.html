			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good answer. It depends how you define acid.</p>
<p>Arrhenius: MUST BE IN AQUEOUS STATE (dissolved in water), and must increase the [H+] in solution. Is it at acid before it is dissolved? Perhaps a semantic issue here.</p>
<p>Bronsted-Lowry: Must donate a proton (H+). Could be any state in theory.</p>
<p>Lewis: Must accept electrons. Could be any state. We don't even need to think of water as the medium or solvent.</p>

<p>Another note for OP, who I believe is probably thinking of Arrhenius acids: liquid is not the same as aqueous. Liquid particles can freely flow past each other in pure form; but Arrhenius acids are not <em>liquids</em> per se, they are in an <em>aqueous solution</em>. This means that they are dissolved within a liquid. For instance, HCl is a molecular gas in pure form, but when it is dissolved in water, the H+ and Cl- dissociate, giving the solution more H+, thus making it acidic. Water (H2O) can be thought of as H+ and OH-. When there is exactly as much H+ as OH-, the water is neutral, but when there is more H+ than OH-, the solution is acidic.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Interesting stuff to say the least and looks harmless. Until you touch it or it gets onto something.</p></div>		</li>
