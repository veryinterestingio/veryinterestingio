<p><em>&gt; Circulating antibody titers were not predictive of T cell memory.</em></p>
<p>In other words, SARS-Cov-2 antibodies do decrease over time but the body has four different antibody memory systems (<em>&quot;Immunological memory can consist of memory B cells, antibodies, memory CD4+ T cells, and/or memory CD8+ T cells.&quot;</em>) meaning the immune system can quickly mount an antibody response even if there isn't much in the way of antibodies circulating at the time of attack.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of antibodies as specialized weapons that are mass-produced to help your body fight off an infection.  Once the infection is gone, there's no need to keep a huge supply of these particular weapons, because they won't be useful against any other germ.  Instead, your body keeps a number of blacksmiths that know how to produce that weapon, and some veteran soldiers who know the tricks required to fight that germ.  If a new infection tries to get started the blacksmiths will get to work producing new antibodies and training new blacksmiths, while the veterans can immediately start fighting the infection and training new soldiers on the proper techniques.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can think of it as the body now has a blueprint stored that it can use to quickly mass-produce if necessary.</p>
<p>This also indicates why vaccinated people can still be infectious: They don't get sick themselves because the body can quickly produce a response if needed, however, during the short period that takes, the infection can be transmitted to another person.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a non-responder to the MMR.  Despite having it seven (yes, 7), times, my titers are always low and every new employer and/or educational I institution requires a booster.  Do you by chance have any info on the MMR.  I'd love to provide figure employers with an article so they will accept that another booster will not do anything.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The key idea (that these studies do not test for) is the presence of T-cells that are dormant but are reactive against these pathogens.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are also memory B cells that hang around and allow a quick reactivation of antibody production.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They actually just approved one t-cell immunity test for covid-19, but it's not widely in circulation yet. There's this myth of going around that for some reason the vaccine will protect you, but a prior infection will not. This is patently and completely false. Currently the best vaccines are about 95% effective against symptomatic covid. So 1 in 20 people can still get sick. Meanwhile, reinfection rates are estimated between 1 in 2000 and 1 in 10,000. There is nothing close to a precise number on this right now because it's so rare that it's basically anecdotal. That being said, hundreds of millions of people have been infected. Even if the odds are as low as one in 10,000, you're still going to have thousands of examples of it. You obviously don't want to catch it. That's a horrible way to become immune. Plus you can infect others, develop lifelong complications, and help mutate the virus. But if you did have the misfortune of catching it, you're very unlikely to catch it again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's recent data showing that in people who resolved their infections, a single dose of the vaccine is enough to generate comparable titers as two-dose vaccinated people:
