			<div class="markdown"><p>I read once that dandelion and clover used to be preferred for lawns because it was natural and you can make teas from the dandelions (plus they look like little flowers). Until herbicides were introduced to get rid of undesirable weeds. The herbicides also killed the clover and dandelions but not all types of grass so the manufacturers advertised that the once popular dandies were in fact an undesirable weed and people bought into it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This past spring I seeded my yard with clover. It’s just now beginning to take root. I chose clover because I live in mountainous countryside so it won’t affect my neighbors yards. It provides excellent ground cover and naturally enriches the soil with nitrogen (no fertilizer needed). It uses less water. And the deer and elk keep it nicely mowed, adding their fertilizer to it too.</p></div>		</li>
