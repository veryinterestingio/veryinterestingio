			<div class="markdown"><p>Not op or a doctor, but i'm constantly on call as well.</p>
<p>You plan like anyone else. You and the people around you get used to appointments being cancelled/rescheduled all the time.
People who can't handle that tend to find their way out of your live. The people that are left usually won't make a fuzz when you let them know something came up and you need to reschedule the dinner (again).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't, really. You get divorced 4 times, and your kids barely know you, or you find a position where you don't work so much. I'm a specialist in high demand, so I can do this. I've had to let go of some of my ego and also some of my altruistic tendencies in order to take a schedule with less call, for my own health. The world will not end without me, though I am useful to society. Anyone who doesn't like that I no longer work as much can kiss my ass. This goes completely against my years of training and indoctrination as a physician, of course.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They kinda don’t. That’s why there’s the joke, what’s the best way to hide $100 from a neurosurgeon? Pin it to their kid. Neurosurgeons are so underserved as this guy said, they work crazy hours and train for so so long. They deserve every penny they make.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a PA. I rotated through neurosurgery as an elective, and was offered a position post-graduation during my rotation, the first time they'd ever done so they said. I thought I wanted to do neurosurgery before the rotation. I turned down the offer and never went back to the specialty. </p>
<p>It takes a special dedication to live that life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same for me. I'm a resident in internal medicine. Yes, there's is a doctor on duty for my patients when I leave. But also for the other 120 patients in internal medicine + calls from other departments. So I also only leave when everything's done. The doctor on duty is for emergencies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In your specialty it makes total sense that one person does the whole job. Handovers were difficult in mine too, but with an extremely low potential for life-threatening complications (inpatient psychotherapy).</p>
<p>But most wards? Most patients have common problems and get common treatments. If there is something unusual going on, these people get extra time at shift change meetings and rounds. There will be a large warning on the chart with allergies or unusual medication. </p>
<p>And it's not like 20 docs take care of the patients. It'll be 3 or 4. You know the patients because you see them every day. Here the shifts of nurses and docs don't change at the same time, there is an overlap of at least 2hrs in acute care. If something didn't get mentioned during the team meeting, it'll come up along the way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The statistics of patient complications doesn't include the &quot;staff complications&quot;. Being dead tired is as bad as being drunk. Driving home after 18hrs of work is a risk too. </p>
<p>I wonder if someone compared the numbers. Preventing two patient deaths by working long shifts wouldn't be a good deal if tired staff ran three people over on the way home. </p>
<p>Working night shifts is unhealthy for most people. Long shifts are stressful and draining. Being overworked all the time <em>is</em> a health risk. Saving two patients and killing three staff in the process wouldn't be a good deal either. </p>
<p>The hospital's statistics will not show such &quot;collateral damage&quot;. I'm quite happy with laws that regulate maximum working hours per day/week. Without them employers can squeeze staff even more, all for profit. </p>
<p>(It's still bad enough. One of my employers simply relabeled night shifts as &quot;on call&quot;, and because there is a bed you could theoretically sleep in during down times, which don't happen, the night doesn't count towards your working hours anymore. Welcome to legal 32h shifts that aren't even paid well, because half the time was just &quot;on call&quot; background duty)</p></div>		</li>
