			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/105/43/16636" target="_blank">this paper</a> implies that the large wings of butterflies and moths specifically <em>increase</em> agility </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your cited paper, while interesting, specifically says that the hind-wings (which are the smaller rear set of wings behind the primary flight wings) are probably entirely for maneuverability. This doesn't say anything about the large fore-wings increasing agility.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, anybody who ever saw a butterfly can attest that they are pretty agile for their size, dragonflies on the other hand are all kinds of derpy, at least when i was a kid and they were more common in my area, it was common place seeing they hitting somebody in the face</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dragonflies might be clumsy in some ways, but don't be fooled, they're the best airborne hunters of all insects due to their ability to accurately judge the trajectory of flying prey and move to intercept.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In fact dragonflies are extremely precise in their flying. They have eyes that are as big as their head, and are really good at stationnary flight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm, 'dragonfly airports' were a regular thing for me on summer nights at the park with friends. We would catch them easily because there were so many in one place, and they were seemingly unaware of our presence. We would then release them from our hands all at once and yell &quot;dragonfly airport!&quot; as they flew away. Good times.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if size had nothing to do with it and was sexually selected or related to mimicry to better avoid predators (bigger wing more room to display colorful pattern). And any benefits to flight were just a byproduct?</p>
<p>Just tossing an idea out. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both can be true and do not negate one over the other. You can have two pressures selecting for larger wings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are just so many inaccuracies here.<br />
For birds wing length decreases maneuverability (but improves the ability to fly fast and long distances) while wing surface increases it. That's why birds living in forests usually have rather short but very wide wings.  </p>
<p>For butterflies however the large wing surface makes them extremely agile in the air. Not as fast as dragonflies or hawk moths, but much more maneuverable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true and demonstrated in how we apply it in human aviation. It's referred to as wing aspect ratio. Compare the long distance and maneuverability characteristics of a Boeing 747 vs an F/A-18 Hornet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you apply the same dynamics to those though ? They're not flapping with their wings, and they are propelled by their engine. </p></div>		</li>
