			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. Leads me to ask.. what is happening (chemically then?) that makes it register as an emotional release..? Does the muscle tension followed by release simply release dopamine/“feel good” chemicals?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've massaged people who've cried on my table (I'm a massage therapist).</p>
<p>The way I understand it is people's bodies hold certain movement patterns, ways of moving their body with tension persisting in certain areas. That tension can be caused by feelings of stress or unreleased trauma one may have experienced during their lives. Usually more physical than emotional but that can also happen.</p>
<p>Those feelings of stress are then associated with feeling &quot;normal, together&quot; and are &quot;familiar&quot;. When the tension releases, that feeling of relaxing and letting go feels soooo good but can sometimes feel extremely emotional to some people. I'm not sure chemically what happens. </p>
<p>But I think the same sorta applies to screaming. We're &quot;holding in&quot; alot of emotion, not breathing right with our diaphragm, not allowing movement to occur naturally. Screaming could release the tension in the belly and diaphragm. Next time you're actively focusing on something notice if you're breathing normally. You probably won't be because holding your breath is an automatic response to stress.</p>
<p>Plus, screaming and running are natural responses to feeling threatened. So it might relate to an older part of our brains that need an outlet like that to feel like they've responded appropriately to a threat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've cried while getting a massage. I was going through a rough patch and my therapist asked me if she was using too much pressure and I said &quot;I can take it&quot; and she told me &quot;It's not about how much you can take, but how much you can let go.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s part of it. The thing about the brain is that not everything can/has been explained. Often, things like this “release” fall into this category, with many people feeling a huge amount of relief/dopamine while others feel next to nothing/zero release with the scream. The brain is a funky and fascinating thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And a physical release release is also associated with an emotional release. If you reduce your blood pressure, you will also have an emotional response. Indeed, you can regulate your stress level simply by breathing: <a href="https://rightasrain.uwmedicine.org/mind/stress/why-deep-breathing-makes-you-feel-so-chill" target="_blank">https://rightasrain.uwmedicine.org/mind/stress/why-deep-breathing-makes-you-feel-so-chill</a></p>
<p>Our physical, emotional and mental state are all extremely interconnected, and often where one stops and another begins is not really obvious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the brain is an interesting thing, and screaming for this “release” can have vastly different effects. Personally, it has worked for me. In regards to it being socially acceptable, where I live (USA) you should probably do it in private/alone in nature to avoid unwanted commentary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't be surprised if those tickle/giggle parties are working on the same principal. I think it sounds creepy, but laughing releases a lot of stress. Not sure about tickling though, because being tickled to the point you lose control is also pretty stressful.</p></div>		</li>
