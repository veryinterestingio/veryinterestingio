			<div class="markdown"><p>What if you take into account photons and other particles other than atoms? Since, for example, you can see a distant star anywhere within a cubic meter, doesn't that mean that space is filled with photons?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iâ€™m confused, he mentioned 1 atom per cubic meter, which would calculate to 10^-6 atoms per cubic centimetre. This is five orders of magnitude beyond you lower bound...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But if you DO get into quantum mechanical gibberish, the answer changes completely. Space is not empty, itâ€™s frothing and bubbling with activity. It does not have zero energy, so depending on your definitions it may even be said to have a color.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, depending on what answer you are looking for it can be any of several completely different things. Other ones are space being infomation or a projection created by a lower dimension.</p>
<p>Btw the color in my judgement is that of the background radiation, without much knowledge I dare to claim it has been in the visible spectrum at some point in the past and is now extremely red shifted.</p></div>		</li>
