<p>That piece of common knowledge has been revised fairly recently. The original number didn't count red blood cells. And since those are ~84% of the (human) cells in our body, the number was a bit off. Current estimate is that the 'foreign' cells in our body are roughly equal in number to our own, depending on how recently you've taken a dump.</p></div>		</li>
