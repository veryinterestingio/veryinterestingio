			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I they also specifically chose colors that were NOT associated with any specific gangs at the time. Red (bloods) and blue (crips) are the two colors I can think of off the top of my head. Hence they picked green, purple, and orange(?) for the gangs in San Andreas. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, yeah, I'd get it if it was a ban on ALL t-shirts - there are places that do that here, too. But this is much more specific than that. It seems pretty clear now from answers that it's a gang affiliation thing but I can still barely wrap my head around it. That's <em>horrific</em> - good grief, talk about living in fear all the time. Are there really places in the States where ordinary people's lives are that affected and controlled by having to be scared of gangs? I live in a rough part of inner London (one of the few places in the UK that has anything much like US-style gangs) and it's only ever an issue if you're in some way involved with those circles.</p>
<p>I can't help but suspect that the difference is guns. Our gangs have an extremely hard time coming by them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, if you’re in an area with heavy gang violence/turf wars you just make sure you aren’t wearing either colors and you’re good. The colors are a uniform and you don’t want to end up wearing the enemy’s uniform </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never come across an actual &quot;No solid tees&quot; dress code and I live in a top 50 sized city in the states so I'd say it's probably not all that common across the country. That said:<br />
In college I had friends that were from areas that definitely had gang activity and said bans/dress codes do exist...but it's really only in the stronger gang areas so most people wouldn't be going there for their beer spot anyway. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My friends and I went to a bar in Chesterton, Indiana and a friend couldn't get in because he was wearing a plain white t shirt. It blew our minds, unless Chesterton has some sort of underground gang activity that none of us ever heard of. We went to the bar down the street a bit and had a good time. Fuck that other bar. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s common in certain places in California. Even on Grad Night at Disneyland I think it’s prohibited to wear a plain colored t-shirt, apparently even white.  Someone said they only really enforce this with boys and less with girls though. </p></div>		</li>
