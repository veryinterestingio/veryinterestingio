			<div class="markdown"><p>Of note:  we're sort of hitting the limits on some ways in top end design, but not in consumer electronics.  Part of what makes this keep working for consumers is that we're not using the high end stuff in our daily lives yet.  As prices for fabrication go down it becomes practical to do so.  It'll be a while before we catch up to the bleeding edge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s also the matter of chip specialization.  As one simple example, look at Apple’s new A13.  It has a decent-size chunk of the die dedicated purely to matrix multiplication, which is the operation that makes a neural network (AI) go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends what you call “consumer electronics”. All smartphones coming out these days are usually using bleeding edge nodes. Right now all new phones are at 7nm and we’re coming up on 5nm pretty quickly. If you don’t consider those nodes “bleeding edge” I don’t know what is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the real bleeding edge stuff seems to be military grade specialized chips, though I'm only a little in the know there.  Which phones are using 7nm chips? Last I heard, they were companies aiming for it, but I'm pretty sure my phone use is a 10 nanometer chip, and it's one of the more common models in use right now.</p></div>		</li>
