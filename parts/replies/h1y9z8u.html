<p>&quot;Beer before liquor - never sicker.&quot; Right, because you got buzzed, then made bad decisions and drank way too much <em>stronger</em> alcohol. Plus, you consumed it later in the night so your body had less time to process it before you went to sleep, so you wake up feeling like absolute garbage. No wonder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also worth noting, beer has a higher water content than liquor. By switching to beer midway through the evening, you're staving off dehydration just a wee bit more.</p>
<p>Most hangovers are fueled mainly by how dehydrated alcohol makes you.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I mean, that's part of it, but you can still feel like shit even if you do a good job of keeping your fluids up. Metabolizing alcohol just leaves a lot of nasty shit in your blood that low key poisons you while your body works to further metabolize and/or eliminate them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s funny because in my country we usually say the opposite, after a beer you’re fine if you drink a stronger drink, but if after a liquor you go and drink something with lesser alcohol you’re due for a bad night</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the second point, I would assume (partly through years of personal non scientific experimentation) that just as how the non-alcoholic ingredients in a drink effect how you feel when drunk, they also effect your hangover, resulting in most mixed drinks leading to worse hangovers than beer. For example whiskey and soda, similar or less hungover than same amount of alcohol from beer, but whiskey, soda and a cup of sugar would be worse. Anyone know of rigorous research on this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have links but I'm pretty sure a lot of sugar intensifying hangovers is a thing with a known mechanism, and there is a class of chemicals called congeners found especially in brown liquors that can contribute to worse hangovers.</p></div>		</li>
