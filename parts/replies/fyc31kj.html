			<div class="markdown"><p>Not being rude but honestly all those bullet points seem like something that can be covered in an online certification class.
I’m in a profession with ongoing training required that sounds like it is at the same level of complexity. It is just information you are required to have and know - not learning something very complex that requires a tenured professor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It sounds like the real question should be the other way around: Why do librarians only make $50,000 a year when their field requires a master’s degree? Ugh, it sucks. Though, I work in a clinic in an area where the licensed therapists—also requiring a master’s—only make about $35k a year. So I feel your pain.</p></div>		</li>
