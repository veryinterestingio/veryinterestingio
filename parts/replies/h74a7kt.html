			<div class="markdown"><p>Its only annoying for 30 mins to 1 hour. And you get used to it. The bell isn't really that annoying, but it is confusing because, if you don't know the stops to stop at, you will just stop and nobody get off. Or do what I do and don't stop for the bell. Then they just shout or come to you to stop at the next stop.</p>
<p>As long as you didn't target the driver personally, and make her feel bad, or verbally or physically attack her, you're all good.</p>
<p>Kids will be kids and its quite nice to hear them excited about leaving school and being generally kiddish. Reminds me of my younger years.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Interestingly, we had one on which the power steering worked, but only to the left.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Power steering (at least in most passenger vehicles, I'm not sure about buses and heavy duty vehicles) is basically a hydraulic system built into the steering rack. When you turn the steering wheel it turns a pinion gear, which moves the rack left and right which in turn pushes and pulls on linkages to turn the wheels. With power steering, the hydraulic fluid from the P/S system (powered by a pump attached to the engine) pushes left or right on the rack to assist you, and there are seals on each side (and a few more in other places) that keep the fluid in whatever chamber it's supposed to be in and maintain the pressure that makes the system work.</p>
<p>If you're not at all familiar with hydraulics, think of a big syringe filled with vegetable oil, with a tiny nozzle at the end -- push on the plunger and a stream of oil comes out of the nozzle. Now imagine the rubber part of the plunger (seal) is cut to shreds, when you push on it the fluid will just escape above the plunger and almost none will come out of the tip.</p>
<p>If one of those seals on your steering rack gets worn and leaks enough, the power steering fluid will just squeeze past the seal instead of pushing on the steering rack (path of least resistance), but the system will still work fine the other direction if that side's seal is in good enough shape. All vehicles with power steering (maybe not in the last 10 years, technology has come a long way) still have a mechanical rack and pinion which connect your steering wheel to the steering linkage, so when your power steering fails you can still control the vehicle, it just requires a lot more effort.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heavy duty vehicles don’t use a rack and pinion system.</p>
<p>The concern here is mostly a burst hose or just a lack of hydraulic oil which leads to a complete loss of steering assist. Steering is still possible with a higher force though.</p></div>		</li>
