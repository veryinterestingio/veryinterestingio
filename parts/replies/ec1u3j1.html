			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha, the accelerator is filled with silicone oil (for compressibility)and the jar just has standard hydraulic oil (for incompressibility). </p>
<p>It’s called a jar because when it fires, the tool produces an impact with a ‘jarring’ effect, hence the name. </p>
<p>Side note: glass would be a very bad material to use for this tool haha </p></div>		</li>
