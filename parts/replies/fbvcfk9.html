			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope there's no detectable phase change in most cases.  The disordered layer that exists at the surface of ice exists regardless of temperature. Pressure can only affect the melting point by a few degrees Kelvin/Celcius. It wouldn't do anything say 10 degrees below freezing.</p>
<p>Surfaces very often act differently than the corresponding bulk phase.  Which is partly why their physics and chemistry are a nightmare to work out compared to the bulk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would argue maybe even just wrong, not oversimplified. If the ice is pretty cold, like, say, -40 sort of thing (F or C, doesn't matter). You're gonna need to produce 1000 Bar or so to melt the ice. That won't happen under ice skates. But even if it would, it won't happen under gentle contact (where ice is still very slippery).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Friction plays a role as well, also -40 ice isn't slippery and nearly impossible to skate on, optimal skating ice is between -10/0.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I should have specified I meant specifically ice near 0Â°C and 1 atmosphere of pressure. I was also under the impression, as someone else pointed out, that ice gets less slippery as it gets colder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does.
But I don't think that's pressure or friction melting but solidifyication of the surface layer.</p></div>		</li>
