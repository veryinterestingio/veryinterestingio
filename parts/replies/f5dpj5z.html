It's sort of like a mix.between confusion, dizziness, and lightheaded. Right in between all three.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well when you have the flu a part of your brain called the hypothalamus which is like the thermostat of the body raises the temperature of the body. This is because at the slightly higher temperature the viral or bacterial enzymes won't function and that helps your body's immune system to take care of the infection. At the same time this is a trade off. Several of the normal enzymatic processes of the body also slow down because of this and that's why one feels tired / foggy when under the weather</p></div>		</li>
