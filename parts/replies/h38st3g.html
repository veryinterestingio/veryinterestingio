			<div class="markdown"><p>I wasn't thinking so much about the wing, but about the fuselage, and given your comments, the nose cone in particular.</p>
<p>For most crafts, would they have areas that behave like a bluff object and areas the behave like a stream lined object? If so, then would the dimpling be beneficial in those areas?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most aircraft don't have any part that is a complete sphere, that is free to rotate in any direction while in-flight.</p>
<p>Only the dimples that are located near / ahead of the boundary layer separation zone will actually help keep the BL attached to the golf ball, thus reducing overall drag. The other dimples actually increase drag a bit, but are needed due to the random orientation to the air flow.</p>
<p>On an airplane this isn't needed due to the streamlined shape of all the components and the predictable direction of airflow. But if it IS needed, then a row of vortex generators works better. These are those little wing-spike things you can see on top of some wings, at various angles to the air flow. These also help keep the BL attached in certain circumstances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, aircraft do have devices that work similarly to how a golf ball’s dimples work. Essentially, turbulent flow is more energetic than laminar flow and it has a higher tendency to stay “attached” to the surface it’s flowing around. Many aircraft use <a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/kU78ZRjrjD9EkfSy7" target="_blank">vortex generators</a> or other devices to induce some turbulence in the flow over the wing surface (or elsewhere) so that it resists flow separation (stall).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The effect works regardless of spin. I don't know off the top of my head whether the Reynolds numbers involved with a baseball bat swing make it worthwhile doing on a baseball bat or not. But in principle, the same effect applies to cylinders as it does to spheres, depending on the Reynolds number.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Re for a typical baseball bat (2.5 inch diameter, 70 mph) is about 1.6 * 10^5.</p>
<p>Experimental results suggest that dimpling the bat could reduce drag by about 50%.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't require laminar flow, but the fact that they're streamlined already reduces the tendency for the flow to separate at small angles of attack.</p>
<p>For something that needs to have a spherical (or close to it) shape, you don't really have the option of streamlining it. But adding dimples is another way to reduce separation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Laminar or turbulent flow doesn't really matter as much. What is bad is the transition between the two flow schemes, which is often chaotic and cause vibrations that can destroy the wing. </p>
<p>So at the speed that a typical sized place flies at, most of the flow around the fuselage and wings are laminar. Therefore, to reduce that chaotic vibration, aircraft designers strive to keep as much of the flow laminar as possible. (This is a simplification)</p>
<p>On the other hand, a golf ball sized object travelling at golf ball speed, the flow is mostly turbulent, so to improve that object's flight stability and range, it's best to dimple the surface so all flow around it is turbulent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wings just require an angle of incidence to produce lift (which is why planes can fly upside-down to some extent). Laminar flow (to the degree that it actually happens with different airfoils) reduces the drag associated with this lift, very important for performance.</p></div>		</li>
