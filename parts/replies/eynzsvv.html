			<div class="markdown"><p>Afaik the part of the brain that is responsible for &quot;logical thinking&quot; is less active while we're dreaming. Hence we don't notice missing context and other inconsistencies.</p>
<p>However, I don't think this is true for lucid dreams. One way of entering them is by noticing the errors. Those dreams are really weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The most common lucid dream I have is thinking that I can see my room around me, but then I realize that my eyes are closed. I know that's wrong, but I can't quite figure out why. It's... pretty weird indeed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s usually my floating jumps that alert me to a lucid dream. If I can squeeze my butt to fall slower or even float up, I know it’s a dream. How well my butt-squeezes work, after that, depends on my level of control. Sometimes I can straight fly, no butt-flex. Other times, no amount of booty-bearing bears results.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mine too! Like I’ll dream places that as far as I’m aware in conscious memory I’ve never visited, but in my dreams they’ll be familiar. Or I’ll meet people that are purely in my dream world, and know them as friends etc, but I’ll never have met them in any part of real life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! Omg that happens to me too! I have a very vivid dream life. There are places in my dreams that probably don’t exist in real life but I have been there several times in my dreams over my entire life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that's kind of what I was getting at. During my dream this fake memory gets installed, but when I wake up, there is this period of time where I question if that memory was real or if it was just something in my dream.</p>
<p>What happens during that time period between waking up and realizing that the memory wasn't real that makes me realize the memory wasn't real, it could be something completely mundane, but within a few minutes I know that it wasn't real. Is it like a little metaphorical check mark box next to that memory in my brain that gets clicked and flags that memory as &quot;not real&quot;? If so, then is it possible for your brain to not check that box and you permanently go on living your life thinking your dream memory is real?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Damn, that's scary but as the brain can block stuff that really happened and also in dreams it can install fake memories, maybe it's possible to have false memories of things that never happened...(?)</p>
<p>I have a couple of those (some stuff that may have happened when I was like 8 or 10)... I remember them, but I'm not sure if they ever happened (would have been weird if they did tho) but my brain tells me they did, so whenever I think of it I'd just say...well whatever xD</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right: It’s like dreams I’ve had, in which I deal with the <em>aftermath</em> of my close friends having died days prior. At no point in the dream do I actually experience the day they were in a car accident—that memory, although completely fictional, is taken as a given throughout the dream. Pretty creepy, honestly.</p></div>		</li>
