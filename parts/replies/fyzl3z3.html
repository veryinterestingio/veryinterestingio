			<div class="markdown"><p>My HS physics teacher, eons ago, had a little setup that he'd present to us as a puzzle. It consisted of two closed boxes. One box had two toggle switches labeled A and B, and a standard AC cord &amp; plug. The other box had two lamps, one red and one green. The two boxes were connected by a single length of two-conductor AC cord.</p>
<p>Switch A controlled the red bulb and switch B controlled the green bulb, independently. The problem he gave us was &quot;There are four parts inside the boxes. What are they?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>More specifically, switch A is wired to a diode such that only the positive side of the AC waveform can pass and switch B is wired so only the negative side can pass.  Each lamp is also connected to a diode so the red lamp only gets powered by the positive waveform and the green lamp by the negative waveform.</p>
<p>Both switches on = full waveform = both lamps</p></div>		</li>
