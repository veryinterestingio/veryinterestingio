			<div class="markdown"><p>Evidence has shown it is as effective as trauma-focused CBT. EMDR has people do essentially the same thing as in CBT, just with added bilateral stimulation has not been shown to increase efficacy at all. As long as you don't charge more for CBT or imply to patients it is more effective, I think that's fine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope... I'm an NHS employee, so I don't charge a penny! Nice guidelines recommend both therapies. However, I personally feel that one can be proficient in EMDR in a relatively short time scale in comparison to CBT-TF. I only know of one person trained in the later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is my hesitation with trying it. Every explanation I've been given for how it work sounds like a bunch of magical BS...even when it's explained well in a scientific way it sounds like some new age shit. BUT there's so much evidence for its efficacy, both anecdotal and now more and more studies, that despite my misgivings I can't dismiss it out of hand. </p></div>		</li>
