Even isolated man made ponds will develop aquatic life within a few years. Heron and seagulls are great at spreading fish populations. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fish biologist here: this is incorrect.  Oh, there are endless rumors of it happening, and it's not impossible that it could have happened at some point, but I've never seen it conclusively documented in the scientific literature.  I can also tell you from personal experience that many fish eggs are not sticky (although some are).  It's <em>definitely</em> not how fish got into the great lakes specifically, and its probably not how fish got into whatever specific lake or pond that you, reader, are thinking about. </p>
<p>So, how <em>did</em> fish get into the Great Lakes?  It's quite simple: they swam there.  But, you say, how could they swim there?  The great lakes flow out through Niagra Falls, how could fish swim up that?</p>
<p>The answer is that where rivers flow today is not where rivers have flowed through all eternity.  Specifically, when glaciers were melting there was a lot of water moving around on the landscape, and glacial dams caused enormous temporary lakes, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Agassiz" target="_blank">Lake Agassiz</a> to appear and disappear, with water draining in different directions at different times.  Streams also changed direction of flow over history through the process of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_capture" target="_blank">stream capture</a>.  At any rate, it's quite clear that most if not all the fish in the Great Lakes swam into them, or an ancestor lake or river that eventually drained into them, <a href="http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/f81-206?journalCode=cjfas#.XEkUUFxKiUk" target="_blank">from the Mississippi River Basin</a>.  It's not a big leap, the watersheds are adjacent to each other and even today have been bridged by humans.   </p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong> Take a look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Maumee#/media/File:Glacial_lakes.jpg" target="_blank">this image</a> to get an idea how great lake drainage has changed over time.  Note that the region used to drain southward.</p>
<p>But, you say, I know this little pond and how did fish get in there?  Well, I can tell you the number 1 way is transport by people.  People will move fish into <em>any</em> body of water imaginable.  Aside from that, most ponds have an outflow even if it only appears during flooding, and fish will swim up these outflows into many bodies of water that appear to be isolated.</p></div>		</li>
