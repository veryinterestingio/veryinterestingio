			<div class="markdown"><p>Using DST throughout the year would result in even more hours of morning darkness during winter for many people, pushing the biological clock later and later. This makes waking up more difficult for everyone, from school kids to adults, and is likely to worsen conditions such as seasonal affective disorders. Darker mornings and brighter evenings will push the circadian system later, and thus lead to later sleep timing. However, work and school hours do not change, so these later sleep times will result in more sleep deprivation and social jetlag (internal misalignment). Sleep deprivation and social jetlag have negative effects on physical and mental health, including increased risks for diabetes, obesity, heart disease, depression, and some forms of cancer. Brighter days and darker nights are critical for a healthier population year round. Thus, we are in favor of abolishing DST and observing permanent Standard Time (when the clock times matches sun times more closely).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This happened in Turkey. They stopped time changes a few years ago but on the wrong side.  Now winter mornings are dark very late and it's hard for kids going to school, getting on busses in the dark.</p></div>		</li>
