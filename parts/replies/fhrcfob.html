			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, can you explain why they put people with high fevers in ice baths? The fever is supposed to kill the infection, if they put in ice bath, wouldn't that defeat the purpose of a fever. Does the body produces more heat than needed during a fever that cause endangerment to the body?</p></div>		</li>
