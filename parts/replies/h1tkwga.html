			<div class="markdown"><p>Damn that's crazy. My cat gave birth and I didn't know until I realized she was awfully quiet and wasn't walking around. Found her in her kennel I bought for the birth and she already had 2 kittens and just made the face like she was pooping for the third. Maybe your cat is more comfortable than mine and survival instinct was too strong?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it comes to the cat's personality. I found her a month prior to her having the kittens and she was always happy to be around people. The reason I knew that she was going into labor, besides the screaming, was that her water broke on my lap while we were watching a tv-series. At first I just thought that she peed herself; but then she became exponentially more restless and I became really worried.</p></div>		</li>
