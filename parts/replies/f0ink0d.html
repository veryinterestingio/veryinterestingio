			<div class="markdown"><p>since AI isn't remotely literate yet and can't be trusted - yet - with open-end problems, many jobs are still safe for a while. But places like MacDonald's that are mostly rote will get automated. In the long term, AI will be able to read and do much more than it can do now. That might take several decades, but it won't take centuries. When that moment arrives, we will have to reorient how we think -- deriving our sense of self-worth from creative endeavors, rather than income, and some kind of UBI-like redistribution will likely become necessary. (The good news is that better AI will drive the prices of almost everything down.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, but I doubt actual goods will become cheaper. People keep making more efficient way to build and create things, while keeping the prices the same or more expensive (as it's a product made with newer &quot;better&quot; technoloy). Consumer market.</p></div>		</li>
