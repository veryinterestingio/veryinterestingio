			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great example! My only suggestion would be to edit it slightly so that the person speaking is also signing rather than having a separate person do it. It's then clearer that both bits of information have the same source and are transmitted together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You uh... do realize the signer is there for people IN THE AUDIENCE, right? There's no closed captioning for life. The deaf and hard of hearing don't get eyeball replacements that get closed captioning beamed directly to them. Yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well shit... Totally never thought about that! However, just to kind of shit it up a bit... We do have Bluetooth hearing aids now, so at least for the hard of hearing there's that.</p>
<p>Also, i thought deaf people weren't allowed to go outside! /s</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apart from the fact that doesn't do you any good if you are in the room, signing is (can be anyway) more efficient than just writing things on a wall or typing them in. Just look at a signer some time, they're keeping up with the speaker in real time, sometimes there is a pause but that can often be the signer waiting on the speaker. Typing in full is much slower and then you need a dedicated person to transcribe in real-time anyway so why not have a signer? Also, automatically generated captioning is just terrible.</p></div>		</li>
