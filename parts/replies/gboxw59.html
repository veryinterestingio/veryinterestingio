			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh. I have ACHOO and this visceral reaction to certain sounds. Makes sense that they're linked I guess. Mint gum and bright lights make me sneeze, and the sound of a pebble scraping against the sidewalk can ruin my mood for a good few minutes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Styrofoam drives me up the walls. I have to leave the room until someone, read: husband, has to take care of it for me. My coworker thought it was funny to hide pieces of it all over my desk at the office. He thought it was funny, most people at work think that I’m overreacting, but it’s a not fun time.</p></div>		</li>
