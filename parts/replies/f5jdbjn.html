			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a recurring nightmare scenario: I wake up, try to switch the lights on but it doesn't work, next some demon attacks me or I fall into a hole that suddenly appears below or some similar shit happens... Except that when the lights don't work I realize that I am in a dream, which at this point becomes a conscious dream. So, I just kind of lay back with a grin and enjoy the stupid show that my brain throws at me.</p>
<p>So much for preparing me for dangerous / scary situations...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I keep having dreams of my ex (who I would happily never see again) trying to contact me. </p>
<p>First I was having a meal with my boys and she walks in and sits next to and then is angry when I said leave we don't want you here.</p>
<p>Then just last night another where she was messaging me on messenger even though I have her blocked on everything. </p>
<p>I am confused if it has any meaning to my situation I don't want to ever see her again my brain seems to want to reply that stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Consider yourself lucky! During a particularly stressful time in my life I had  hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations. Almost like the opposite of a lucid dream. I would wake up having a panic attack. It was terrible.</p></div>		</li>
