			<div class="markdown"><p>Not more castle sets per se, but maybe castle sets and train sets. </p>
<p>Incomplete protein sources combine in the body if they're incomplete for different reasons - like grains and legumes which when combined have all essential amino acids in requisite amounts. Grains have less lysine but excess methionine, legumes the other way around. But they're otherwise very similar to animal proteins so I feel the &quot;building spaceships out of castles&quot; analogy is maybe a bit excessive.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's exactly what it means. The bottleneck amino acid is usually Lysine. If your protein mixture has a lysine content of ≥5.1% you can assume it a complete protein.   </p>
<p>Edit: keep in mind that it's enough to eat both protein sources over the course of a day, it's not necessary to eat them together in the same meal.  </p>
<p>Edit2: THANKS FOR THE GOLD.<br />
I'm taking that as an occasion to share an Excel Sheet I made to calculate the lysine completeness of any common protein mix. Enter the grams of protein and calculate: <a href="https://easyupload.io/ntkr6z" target="_blank">Link</a></p></div>		</li>
