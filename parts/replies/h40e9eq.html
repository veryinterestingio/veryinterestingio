			<div class="markdown"><p>That reminds me of Alain Bombard. Dude crossed the Atlantic with basically no rations or water and survived at sea drinking moderate amounts of seawater and the stuff pressed from fish. </p>
<p>He theorized you could do so and adapt to it in a survival situation, but only if you started drinking seawater as soon as fresh water were available and not out of desperation after you hadn't had any water for a while and your body is already weakened. I think he survived of fish, plankton and seawater for 65 days. There was one incident where a boat saw him and offered to bring him back but he refused saying it'd be undermining the credibility of the exercise or something along those lines.</p>
<p>He sent out a message to loved ones to say he was alright and they gave him a meal but ended up regretting it because the solid meal after you'd body had adapted to so little fucked him up.</p>
<p>He made it though. That trip took place in 1952, he passed in 2005.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, I feel like the real method is to mix a ratio of sea water and freshwater together to dilute some of the salt concentration. Salt concentration is a pretty objective measurement so it's hard to imagine your body would adapt especially if you immediately shifted to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was my understanding from hearing something similar a while ago. If you mix seawater with your small supply of freshwater you can stretch it out longer while not getting overly dehydrated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have very sensitive eyes. Ocean burns my eyes while sea or lake water is just mildly annoying. A chlorine pool will make me look as a slept depraved meth addict. So I'm on a 'don't look' policy when swimming. And I love swimming.</p>
<p>And crying hurts. I don't cry that often, but when I do I have to use a salt solution to clear my eyes. Just to get things normal. </p>
<p>I'm actually watering my eyes several times a day. Especially when I'm staring at a screen for a full day and forget to blink.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Frequent use of things like eyedrops, chapstick and moisturizers can force your body to become dependant on their continued regular use. Also, there is a preservative in some eyedrop solutions called benzalkonium chloride which is known to cause hypersensitive reactions. </p>
<p>It would be much better for your eyes if you just blinked more and avoided artificial solutions unless absolutely necessary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The redness relieving eyedrops are the biggest culprit in memory for kids with incredibly irritated eyes. Parents think eye drops are pretty low danger so they overuse/give then to kids whenever the kid's eyes ate a little irritated. It can look really bad and be a huge source of behavior problems in elementary students in my experience</p></div>		</li>
