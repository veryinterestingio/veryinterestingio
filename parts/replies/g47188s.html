			<div class="markdown"><p>Human sacrifices were once made on the hills above this river. Bodies burnt, water speeded through the wood ashes to create lye. This is lye - the crucial ingredient. The lye combined with the melted fat of the bodies, till a thick white soapy discharge crept into the river. May I see your hand, please? What is this? This... Is a chemical burn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact. There are places (like along the Ganges in India) where animals are slaughtered upstream and flow downstream towards natural lye deposits in the rocks of the riverbed that makes natural soap and people have been bathing there for hundreds of years in the natural suds that form. You know, and all of the left over viscera.</p>
<p>It's not quite human sacrifice, but still kind of metal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a thrilling story but it's far more likely that back when it was smaller groups of people they would be cooking over a fire would wipe out grease and other detritus from cooking vessels using whatever they had to hand:</p>
<p>Leaves, dirt, water, and—most importantly—ash left over from the fire or coals to use as an abrasive agent.</p>
<p>It would be a very small step from wiping out vessels with ash to recognizing an unusual property of the ash to then throwing handfuls of ash into a greasy vessel with some hot water (itself an extremely simple and intuitive method of cleaning) before you've got yourself the real beginnings of soap that can be used beyond <em>in situ</em> applications.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can also make it with other kinds of fat. I made my own olive oil based soap in quarantine, as a fun way to distract myself. I kind of want to try an animal fat soap because they’re supposed to have a lovely lather but I worry about it smelling piggy if I do something wrong</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course you can make it with an innumerable number of fats, but lard is the most common and probably the original source of soap.</p></div>		</li>
