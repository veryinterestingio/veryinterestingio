			<div class="markdown"><p>From my memory of college anatomy and physiology, it's just pull. Actin and myosin work together to pull. Muscles don't push, they can only contract. Am I misremembering something?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay.. so we have tissue in our tongues that can expand? Because every other muscle we have in our body only contracts or relaxes as far as I know?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you squeeze a water balloon around the middle, it gets skinnier and longer. This is because water is an incompressible fluid, and when you squish it out of one area, it has to squish into a different area.  </p>
<p>Your tongue operates on this water-squishing principle, because it, like the rest of you, is mostly made of water. It has sideways bands of muscle fiber that contract, squishing it thinner, which forces it to get longer. It also has longways bands of muscle fiber that can contract to make it shorter and fatter. It's basically a slab of muscle fibers facing different directions, that squish against each other to make different movements.</p>
<p>Fun fact, the fancy name for this type of structure is a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscular_hydrostat" target="_blank">muscular hydrostat</a>, and it's also how worms, octopus arms, and elephant trunks work.</p></div>		</li>
