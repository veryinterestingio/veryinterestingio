			<div class="markdown"><p>What about the shadow of the earth. Say if you are behind it, the sun blocked, out would obviously be much cooler than being in direct sunlight. I wonder what happens at the shadows border. Then on a much larger scale where you get gravitational lensing. Obviously light becomes visible but does the heat get bent as well?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're exposed to the Sun, you're getting hot from its direct radiation. The reason you're getting hot is not that the temperature of your surrounding space is high, but that you are absorbing the Sun's photons. Just like you can get hot on a very cold winter day if you're in the mountains and the skies are clear.</p>
<p>In the shadow, you're getting cold, again regardless of the temperature in that space, because whatever the temperature might be, it applies to the handful of particles that interact with your body, giving you almost no heat.</p>
<p>You make the distinction between &quot;heat&quot; and &quot;light&quot;, but that's actually the same thing. The photons are hitting you, giving you heat. If gravitational lensing bends the light towards you, ipso facto it bends &quot;heat&quot; towards you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it's hard to anyone to understand the temperature of a medium as being the temperature at which an object left there will settle. This definition works both inside a thick atmosphere and in a vacuum and anyone can understand it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would certainly be a useful quantity to define, if it existed. But what temperature an object settles to in these conditions highly depends on the object's properties. If it's exposed to the Sun, its albedo matters the most. A dark object will settle to a much higher temperature than a bright one, because it absorbs much more photons. Furthermore, the object probably won't even settle to a unique temperature, but to a fixed temperature <em>gradient</em>: there will be a permanent heat flow from its sunlit side to the side in the shadow. Unless it's rotating, in which case... well, you get the point.</p>
<p>If the object is not exposed to the Sun, then it will most likely settle to some very low temperature, regardless of a possibly much higher temperature of the particles hitting it. This is because it will radiate heat at a higher rate than it absorbs it from the scanty particles. However, even this number will vary depending on how the object's surface interacts with the particles: do they bounce off elastically or impact and transfer their energy to it? It depends on the microscopic details of the object's surface.</p></div>		</li>
