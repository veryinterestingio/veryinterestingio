<p>Links without an explanation or summary are not allowed. ELI5 is intended to be a subreddit where content is generated, rather than just a load of links to external content. A top-level reply should form a complete explanation in itself; please feel free to include links by way of additional context, but they should not be the only thing in your comment.</p>
