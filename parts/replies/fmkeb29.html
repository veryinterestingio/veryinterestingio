			<div class="markdown"><p>Speech is just a set of sounds that hold meaning because of their grammar and associations, formal rules of how they combine, and memories, feelings and actions they connect to.</p>
<p>People can create pictographic language, people can communicate in meme collages.</p>
<p>So insofar as we know how any kind of thinking works, thinking in pictures is just being able to do the things you do in thought in your own private language of shapes, pictures, colours etc.</p>
<p>Just like we think in language, but our thought is not dominated by rhyme, there's something beyond purely thinking &quot;in shapes&quot;, there's metaphor, context, invention. </p>
<p>But diagramatic and pictoral language has been with us for years, with people drawing in sand or picking up napkins or arranging things to make a point, gesturing and shaping space as they talk etc. and we obviously see and react by actually modelling space around us, so a lot of processing immediate practical experience can exist without any names at all, especially if it's something you do on your own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm gonna blow your mind ya'll ready for this:</p>
<p>Alright. Think about our language for a minute. All of our words and letters and sounds and shit. All our rules of precedence, syntax, grammar, format, and cultural influence. How every letter is made on paper, how we describe sounds (the cow goes &quot;moo&quot;), the very history of our language itself.</p>
<p>This shit is all a freak accident.</p>
<p>Imagine a couple hundred years ago some dude inventing the letter w decides the middle spike should be higher. Bam. That's what w looks like forever. Freak coincidence.</p>
<p>Someone decides to make the long A noise. That's a sound now. We're gonna use that. Again, freak accident. You know how I know that? Think about other languages. Other languages have seemingly randomized different letters, don't they? Japanese is missing L. There are languages that use what we describe as &quot;clicking noises with our tongues&quot; because we weren't fortunate enough to randomly graft a letter to that noise.</p>
<p>It's <em>silly</em>, isn't it? Language is just some random bullshit we all agreed on at some point.</p>
<p>Well, apply this to thoughts now. Surely thoughts must be similar, right? Even if we don't have the capability to assign the concept of moving, flowing shapes and colors to letters- just like those &quot;noises&quot;- we can accept that they exist and can be just as valid a way to express thought as anything else as long as sender and receiver (as the same person) agree on the syntax and grammar.</p>
<p>It's like that infamous line in some movie that I don't even know what movie it is- uh, anyway- a man locked away in a dark dungeon cell asks a friend and free man on their way out &quot;when you come back, could you describe the sun to me?&quot;</p>
<p>Of course, he has no real way of doing so, right? Well, not with words and letters. Not nearly adequately enough at any rate. But if we could peer into the mind and ask that question, we could be answered by projections of light and heat, by drifting shadows and blinding circles, by images of growing life and even the solar system itself. Orange, yellow, red, not nearly enough to convey the range of colors it really is- not as much as the thought of the entire array itself, from white all the way down.</p>
<p>That mental picture of how you could describe the sun with just your mind, without reliance on words but the full range of everything you could associate with it, some people are just stuck in that mode forever. They don't use words to think. Nobody has to. We're not born with the knowledge of our language, society gives that to us. We're born with thought.</p>
<p>Maybe we're the weird ones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Holy my chicken.</p>
<p>Words facilitate transmission from agent to agent because they make use of air as the channel, sort of. It is available, ready, and we can use it by uttering sounds with our troats, coincidentally. Evolution and culture eventually made use of that and based a code on it.</p>
<p>Images on the other hand are much harder to transmit. They generate in a brain and are as complex as real imagery itself in some cases or even more, but notoriously they are notoriosly difficult to take out. Words can take out tiny bits of them, ever so inefficiently and to little effect. A tiny effect that you can however hold thigh to and make use of, as is proven by the widespread use of language.</p>
<p>Images are abstract, complex, rich. The problem is not with the brains being unable to process their vast information and density, but rather with the inherent problem of relying on a system and code and trying to communicate over it to another agent and hoping that agent will be able to grasp it enough and make sense of it on their own as well.</p>
<p>Nature is beautiful, I guess.</p></div>		</li>
