			<div class="markdown"><p>If it happens often, go see a doctor. I'm guessing it happens when you eat dry chicken or maybe tortillas chips. You may have a problem with the sphincter at the bottom of your esophagus. It probably doesn't close correctly. It's not too big of a deal, but it gets worse over time....or it's nothing at all. But mention it to your doc.</p></div>		</li>
