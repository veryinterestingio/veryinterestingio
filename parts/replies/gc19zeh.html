<p>with a hot liquid you’re also melting the butter. </p>

<p>This crucial aspect is missing in most answers here. It has less to do with fast molecules and more to do with the water just melting/softening many cookieponents due to temperature even before beginning to dissolve them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I will add a preamble that I'm talking about UK-style biscuits here like chocolate digestives, ginger nuts, rich teas etc. rather than ultra soft barely cooked cookies.</p>
<p>The butter isn't just 'hiding' in the biscuit though - by cooking it in the first place it's undergone chemical changes so it's not like it melts out. </p>
<p>For your theory to make sense you would also see biscuits going soft and butter melting out of them if you heated then up by putting them in the oven, say - this doesn't happen, they just get hotter until they char.</p>
<p>There is some merit if talking about chocolate chip stuff as the chocolate would indeed melt thus losing any integrity it was adding to the biscuit, but the integrity of the actual biscuit itself is surely just a function of the energy imparted by the hot liquid rather than the liquid's reaction with the recipe's starting ingredients.</p></div>		</li>
