			<div class="markdown"><p>The other possibility it doesn't answer is whether people are being designated 'infected' twice, but were never actually cleared of the virus in the first place (ie false-negative).</p>
<p>If the statistics are any indication, I suspect the answer is, 'not usually', but like everything else in science and medicine, there're always outliers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually some reports actually responded both these questions. They reported a case where the subject was not immunosuppressed and they sequenced the virus both times, revealing that they were in fact different strains. (Sources: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00502-w" target="_blank">nature review</a> and <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.22.20192443v1" target="_blank">paper</a>).  </p>
<p>As this is probably rare, given the number of cases reported, the underlying cause of reinfection is still being discussed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed. Sometimes people resolve a disease, and just fail to make antibodies at the next exposure. Also, oddly enough, the measles can reset some of your immune system making you no longer immune to diseases you previously had.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would another possibility be that they were infected with two different strains? I’m no expert. But that’s something I thought about and I have no idea if that’s a thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is possible. It's also possible that immunity to one strain would provide immunity to others, but I don't think anyone knows yet which is why any reinfection cases are so sought after by the scientific community.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to hear an expert take on this, but my layman's take is that it makes it more likely that we get a partially effective vaccine. It is very unlikely that were going to get a &quot;1 shot and your immune forever&quot; vaccine for covid. More likely is that you'll get a shot and either be immune or more likely to have like rather than severe symptoms. And maybe you'll need to get another shot it 1-2 years.</p></div>		</li>
