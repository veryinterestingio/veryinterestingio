			<div class="markdown"><p>Those reaction time tests are skewed tho due to technical reasons (as stated on the website). </p>
<p>For example, on my notebook (which has an slow-ass 60hz panel) with a standard office mice I can consistently achive \~250ms on average. Though on my gaming setup with a 240hz monitor (AOC Agon AG251FZ) and my gaming mouse (Zowie EC2-A) I can consistently achive \~180ms on average.  So according the website's statistics i've turned from an average Joe to the top few % with inhuman reaction speed just by changing my setup</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One frame at 60 hz is only 17 ms. Any mouse should be under a few ms. I wonder if there's something else going on to explain the 50+ ms discrepancy, like larger screen, different environment / mental state, etc.</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_lag" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_lag</a></p>
<p>Basically, monitor takes time to process the input it receives before it has a finished frame that it can show to you. After it has a finished frame, there's also a delay of pixels physically lighting up(called response time). This is added on top of delay that's caused by having frame be ready on your computer between frame refreshes that's handled by refresh rate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Going from pressing a button or key through the USB stack (that may have multiple devices interacting a once) to wait for the OS to receive the changes then tell the application that it was clicked then for the browser to work out what to clicked and run some javascript that may need to be JIT compiled takes longer than you might think. There's a lot going on there, especially in the USB stack. Older PS/2 perpihials tend to be faster as they literally interrupt the CPU.</p>
<p>That not even to mention the graphics side of things, where on low-medium TN quality panels can take 10s of ms to change after recieving a new frame. Again older tech like CRT screens tend to have a much lower response latency. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could be your CPU, RAM everything and anything on my IPhone 7 I reached 300ms if I went to my gaming PC I’m sure it would be much faster.. but it does give you a basic value of your reaction in a sense it’s all relative. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read once that our brains actually sort of have a built in buffer for all of our senses to deal with this delay since different senses arrive at the brain at different times. I think they were talking specifically about proprioception and touch from a distant extremity like our toes. They went on to mention how it’s no surprise that our eyes and ears are both so close to our brain given how important they are to our perception of the world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a question about standing in front of a car and it beeping its horn and flashing lights and what do you notice first. The trick is people assume that as light is faster you see the flash, but the distance makes this negligable. The brain prioritises noise though and you actually sense the beep before acknowledging the flash.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A favourite psychology experiment of mine (from the 1970s I think) tests simple reaction time for auditory or visual stimuli, and I believe it is reaction time to an auditory stimulus that is slightly quicker (from memory it is about 20ms quicker). I used to demonstrate this as a practical when I was doing my PhD. I recall this being explained by the lecturer who ran the session as being due fact that the auditory nerve is shorter than the optic nerve, or because of other processing differences in the respective areas of the cortex. The motor response is basically the same, and with the stimulus so close the speed difference is negligible. I do recall my favourite student write-up from the sessions (I used to grade them), which explained instead that the quicker response to an auditory stimulus is due to the fact that ‘sound is faster than light’.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reactions times vary by sense. We react to sound slightly faster than visuals. We react to pain even faster because it's processed by the spinal chord instead of the brain.</p></div>		</li>
