			<div class="markdown"><p>This. My great-grandparents all had 10 kids each. If europe kept this up until today it would be very very overpopulated.</p>
<p>Rich people prefer having 1-3 kids and actually invest in them to help them be succesfull too, rather than 10 kids that are mostly left on their own and hope a few are healthy enough workers to feed you when you're old.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The key missing part of this is:</p>
<p>The more educated and literate the populace are the less power men have over women.</p>
<p>Women get a better chance at making their own future instead of being tied to the patriarchy, and (being forced to) end up as (underage) wives and mothers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely THIS. When  women become more educated they become less interested in spending their lives being brood mares. They realize they have options and they can have careers and support themselves without depending on someone else to keep a roof over their heads.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This seems very hard to search for so I'll just ask instead. Does this also translate to cultural and religious differences? Does fundamentalist catholic families have more children due to the women having less power? Does eastern european families have more children for the same reason (compared to northern europe)?</p>
<p>I'd ask about Islam aswell but that seems nigh on impossible to see given how much poorer the islamic world is compared to the christian. </p>
<p>I want to clarify that I'm not trying to prove anyone wrong here, just want to learn.</p>
<p>And a joke to end on. Does this mean feminism is literally a cause for the decline of the human race?</p></div>		</li>
