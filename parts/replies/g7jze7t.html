			<div class="markdown"><p>PhD-carrying scientist here. There are a couple of things right here, but also a couple of things wrong.</p>
<p>Water does bead on plastics, and that means a given quantity of water will have less molecules sitting right at the surface where they're free to evaporate, and more inside the bead waiting their turn.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the water can never run off, it will always be wet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the part where you've stumbled. After the first few seconds of being put on a drying rack or turning off the dishwasher, dripping stops. The rest of the water doesn't leave by running off; it actually leaves by evaporating into the air. That's why puddles in the street dry up, even though the water can't ever run off. (If it could have run off, it wouldn't have collected in a puddle in the first place - a puddle only forms inside a dip where the edges are higher than the centre, locking the water in place.)</p>
<p>The heat of the item really is the kicker. That's what gets donated to the water molecules, and speeds their evaporation. Plastic is less dense than porcelain, which means that a plastic cup has less atoms than an identically shaped porcelain cup. That means fewer atoms that have some heat to give away to the water in the plastic example, whereas the extra atoms in the porcelain one keep on helping the water molecules escape into the air.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chemist here. You are right. The other top voted comments are mostly incorrect. It it due to the hydrophobic (water hating) or hydrophilic (water loving) nature of the material. Because plastic doesn't like water, it beads. When water beads it takes more energy to evaporate. Because the surface of ceramics or glass loves water it spreads out.  Spreading out allows it to evaporate faster.</p></div>		</li>
