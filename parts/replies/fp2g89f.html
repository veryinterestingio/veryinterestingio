			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to emphasize one of the points here: if a science team already had  automated instruments set up before the crisis (a satellite, seismic network, etc) they may be able to take advantage of it during the COVID crisis.  And I fully expect to see some great papers that do that, but data analysis and publishing takes a long time.  By way of example, there was a <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/2002/020805/full/news020805-7.html" target="_blank">great paper</a> on the climate impact of airplane contrails after 9/11: it was published in August 2012.</p>
<p>But any science that involves setting up something new, or that isn't completely automated, is pretty much on hold right now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. And those animal colonies often take months to years to generate as well, which adds to the lag once things are able to get back up and running.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Including, of course, taking readings which are beyond the sensitivity of existing in-place sensors. Just because there's less background noise in some fields now doesn't mean that the sensors in place will have the capability to take advantage of that. And by the time more sensitive ones can be deployed (or, in some cases, designed from scratch), we're likely to have moved back to more regular noise levels.</p></div>		</li>
