			<div class="markdown"><p>It actually is profitable, albeit indirectly. By keeping other European countries on the Euro and common market, Germany prevents them from competing by adjusting their currencies. At the same time, it prevents a German currency from gaining value, which would make German exports more expensive.  </p>
<p>All of this means that the current situation greatly benefits German exporters, which is a huge boon to the German economy. </p>
<p>Others have explained this in greater detail in their own replies. </p></div>		</li>
