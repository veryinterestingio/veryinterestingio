			<div class="markdown"><p>Since roots “find” by growing, the newly grown cells adapt their metabolism to their surroundings and become used to more watery conditions, similar to how the water roots “know” that they live in water. When soil becomes suddenly waterlogged, the cells don’t have time to change their metabolism and often die from stress. It’s like the difference between being caught in a flood vs. going swimming - if you know you’ll be in water, you prepare for it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Swimming is a confusing sport, because sometimes you do it for fun, and other times you do it to not die. And when I'm swimming, sometimes I'm not sure which one it is. I gotta go by the outfit. Pants - uh oh. Bathing suit - okay. Naked - we'll see. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But what about when you then take that water-based plant and then pot it in soil? The cells have adapted to water, but now it's been transplanted to soil. What then?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Such things usually produce damp soil, not totally waterlogged mud.  If they do produce totally waterlogged soil, roots will just grow into the damp zone around it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Flowing water moves oxygen through the roots, while flowing through the ground to the water table, oxygen constantly being replenished with new water. </p>
<p>Stagnant water in a pot not draining anywhere looses oxygen and the roots suffocate.</p></div>		</li>
