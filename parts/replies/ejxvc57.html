<p>Plus i disagree that these punches are all upper body. They do a lot of weight transferring even on skates (they do it even when not fighting for shooting) and grabbing on to the other guy's shirt allows then to swing their body back with a lot of ease before going in for the punch.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Other hockey besides NHL gets along fine without fighting. And the style of play is great. The only 'policing' that needs to be done could be done by referees, just like any other sport. If a player gives your star a hard legal hit, boo hoo. Give their star a hard legal hit back. If they do an illegal, chippy act call a penalty. If they fight, give them a long hefty suspension and fine. Not complicated. Fighting could be eliminated instantly if they wanted to.</p>
<p>The reason the NHL doesn't do it is simple. They choose not to. Because they know fans hoot and howl during fights so they think it's a popular facet of the game they can't dispose of.</p>
<p>They are wrong. Fighting is phasing out as a part of the game. There are far fewer fights than there used to be. A larger number of fans increasingly appreciate pure skillful play over goon stuff. A player whose primary contribution is enforcer with little other useful skill is a waste of a valuable roster spot and is something more teams are finding they can do without... thankfully.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is the best argument for not outlawing fighting. It will die a natural death if it's allowed to. Kill it and you create a martyr.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>International Hockey and other leagues are significantly stricter when it comes to checking rules and fighting.   The NHL runs by it's own rules for the most part that's different from the rest of hockey.  Take rink size for example.  </p>
<p>The NHL itself only just started cracking down on hits/fights about 5 years ago, because injuries were getting worse and worse. (And the first couple years were HORRIBLY enforced too.)  </p>
<p>Hockey can certainly be played without the roughness, but it's still a huge part in modern North American Hockey.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And it's not like these guys suddenly started playing in the NHL. They've played their entire lives. They've played hockey without checking and where fighting could have big consequences. It's when a lot of money is involved that throwing down the gloves isn't as big of a deal anymore. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That's more aspirational than actual. There is plenty of &quot;extracurricular&quot; policing that goes on in other sports, sometimes drawing the ire of the officials and sometimes not. Major League pitchers don't hesitate to &quot;send a message&quot; by way of a 90 mph hardball to the back if they feel the other team is playing dirty.</p>
<p>Football, obviously, presents plenty of opportunities to lay a punitive hit on someone while staying just inside the envelope of what's legal - or, at worst, drawing a holding or illegal contact flag.</p>
<p>This is something I'll definitely give soccer (at least, the soccer I watch: EPL, UEFA, and the World Cup), the highly discretionary nature of how yellow and red cards are handed out keeps a lid on this sort of thing remarkably well. There's little ability to hide behind the letter of the law when the ref can just say &quot;that was a cynical foul; you're booked.&quot; Before I started watching, I was uncomfortable with leaving so much to the ref's judgement, but having paid attention for a few years, now, I think it's the better system. It means whenever a player pulls one of those &quot;we all know what you're doing, here&quot; stunts, they get penalized for it whether or not there's a specific rule detail that covers exactly that circumstance.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes they do. Seems plenty of people here still think major sports are played the same way they were in the 70s. This type of retaliatory action by pitchers is far less common than it used to be.</p></div>		</li>
