			<div class="markdown"><p>More sleep can help with that day's functioning but it doesn't work fully to reverse the ill effects and can mess up your circadian rhythm. Harvard study done recently addressing this. Too tired to go into detail on it but see link below.</p>
<p>Naps after all nighter help most without screwing up that night's sleep. But again, best is not to do it because a nap doesn't fix all the damage.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I'd advised sleeping until you wake up naturally(no alarm) after an all nighter. and if possible sleep as close to your regular sleeping time as usual or a little earlier, it will probably exceed your normally sleeping time but will not be double the time.</p>
<p>Best thing is to get back on regular schedule.  but there is no &quot;Making up sleep&quot; as the previous day has already happened and that day you would have had imbalanced hormones which will effect your ability to  perform for the day and could cause stress and other health issues that can have long term effects.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Also repeating this process can cause long term damage as stated above and will probably take more then 1 sleep session to recover and get back into rhythm.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>To much sleep can also cause problems.  like the inability to sleep the next night.</p>
<p>Sleep quality matters more then quantity.  forcing yourself to stay in bed when you are awake isn't going to help.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Me personally when I was 16 y/o stayed up for 40 hours slept at 10pm a little earlier then my usual bed time and woke up  at 4pm the next day and headed straight to a House league soccer game I almost slept through and played great.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This was the longest I have ever slept straight without waking(18 hours.   I have pulled other all nighters an slept for only 8 hours and felt great and other times felt like crap the whole day despite getting &quot;adequate&quot; sleep.  </p>

<p>Circadian misalignment, ie sleeping at 2am to 10am every night instead of 11pm to 7am, has been shown to have a lot of negative effects on the body.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As long as you’re getting the same number of hours of sleep, why does it matter what time it is? I‘m guessing the answer has something to do with body’s exposure to sunlight, but since most people spend most of our times indoors with artificial light, I would think that one’s sleep schedule wouldn’t be so relevant. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like I am on the fast track to a heart attack since I can't remember a time when I preferred a morning schedule. I actually looked for 2nd and 3rd shift jobs when possible so I could sleep in. My idea of &quot;morning&quot; is noon to 2:00p.m. I can remember as a young child sneaking into the living room while the babysitter slept, and watching the late-late show until the station would sign off for the night. Then I would go back to my room and watch the traffic drive by. It was a special treat if we had a snow or thunderstorm. I missed a lot of Saturday morning cartoons, but I preferred the late-night mysteries instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve been the same way since at least high school. For some reason my brain doesn’t want to shutdown at night, but is perfectly content sleeping all morning. I find it nearly impossible to get on a schedule that involves consistently waking up before 11am. It’s 1:40am now and I have no desire whatsoever to go to bed. Every night I have to force myself into bed even tho my mind is so active. I would love to get on a normal schedule but I honestly can’t imagine that happening. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is something called entrainment that tells your biological circadian clock what time it is. Sunlight is one of the reset button. Mealtimes are another. You can also take melatonin. These things come into play when you fly across the country and change time zones.</p>
<p>Artificial light also doesn't replace sunlight completely; it's different wavelengths and intensities. They do have special sun lamps that mimic sunlight, but most ordinary lights aren't built to do that.</p></div>		</li>
