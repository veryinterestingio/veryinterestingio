<p>I believe that there's wind passing over your house, and it leaks into the room through windows, or under doors.. the pressure in the room then becomes unequal, and the stream of blowing air from your fan gets misdirected towards the low side. </p>
<p>Next time it happens, put your arms out, and see if it is hitting one of your hands instead of your face. :3</p></div>		</li>
