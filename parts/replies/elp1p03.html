			<div class="markdown"><p>Knowing nothing about the situation, it's extremely unlikely that mining runoff sediment is <em>highly</em> radioactive. More than likely it's just barely radioactive enough to trip for regulatory purposes, and so no one wants to deal with it. Hell it might not even be radioactive enough for that and it's just a public perception problem that no one wants to deal with.</p>
<p>Edit: looks like the real problem is that it accumulates so fast it's too expensive to dredge. No mention of radioactivity anywhere, the plan would be to dump it back in the river downstream.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's part of why dams can be so damaging to ecosystems. That sediment would normally be washed downstream and form coastal marshes and wetlands. Without sediment buildup those wetlands are being wiped out along with the species that live in them.</p></div>		</li>
