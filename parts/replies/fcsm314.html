			<div class="markdown"><p>There's some errors in it, we don't have a high mountain range but we have a long one that runs the length of the east coast. Its called the Great Dividing Range and its responsible for making the eastern coast of Australia habitable. When mountains trap moisture they do it on one side. This is because moisture is carried by the wind towards the mountain. The side out of the wind gets whats called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain_shadow" target="_blank">Rain Shadow</a> a lack of rain. Whats happening in Australia is several points: </p>
<p>1) The Great Dividing Range is really close to the coast, there isn't much land east of it to benefit from the rain shadow effect, if you look at our population density maps you'll see that we're really crammed into that space. These are also the areas with highly regular rainfall (actually highest rainfall in Australia belongs to monsoon regions in the centre who get two metres in two days). </p>
<p>2) What this means is that the bushland to the West is very prone to fires, the plant life there actually relies on fire to cyclically destroy older trees and let their ash fertilise the soil for seedlings that have been waiting years for the opportunity. This also frees up a proportion of the water table for the new plants to grow in areas of low rainfall. This water table is also shared with the major river systems which are currently toxic due to a lack of waterflow, and with farmers and irrigators who draw from the water table and the rivers for farming.</p>
<p>3) Its estimated by several ecologists (this isn't a consensus view yet as its only recently been published) that these farming regions west of the GDR (regions that have historically persecuted ecologists that spoke up in the 70s &amp; 80s) that the water intensive farming are responsible for the bushfires in part. The impact on the river system and the fact that the Murray Cod is going through an extinction event as we speak is easily linked. But they have gone further to point out that water starved gum trees drop limbs that dry quickly and become fire hazards. The constant deprivation of water over several decades as resulted in gum trees going through the cycle quicker as it acts as a sort of natural balancing effect for growth and regrowth. Gum trees grow fast and in their proposed hypothesis the case is that the tree populations quickly outgrow the water availability and turn to dropping limbs immediately. This is supported by areas being hit with bushfires 3-4 times in the last decade which anyone who has worked in the Victorian CFA, or NSW RFS will say is not normal.</p>
<p>4) Rainforests in Australia are mostly east of the GDR, or are directly south of it, and they do not follow the same lifecycle as the bushland west of it. They're too moist, normally, for fires to spread and the flora &amp; faunna do not have fire survival mechanisms. The Otway rainforest in Victoria had fires once back in 1983, the only time since white settlement around the rainforest, which dates back to 1834 on the west side and 1826 on the eastern side. Right now the Otways are drier than normal and yet as recently as 2006 the area was still recovering from those fires. By comparison, the Daintree Rainforest in Queensland is now burning. Unlike the Otways, we have more records from the local indigenous tribes, and none of them have any record that the area ever experienced bushfire. These rainforests are amongst the oldest continually surviving rainforests and tropical rainforests in the world. Right now we have some of these burning, places that have individual ferns or trees that have gone several thousand years without fire now burning.</p>
<p>5) Thanks to progressive declines in rainfall, partly from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni%C3%B1o" target="_blank">El Niño effect</a> that occurred several times in the last two decades, we've not had rainfall across the eastern half of the country that was in-line with anything dating back to the start of historical records of annual rainfall. We've had droughts, on-and-off, but there has been almost no recovery when you look at the last 27 years of annual rainfall and compare to previous 30 years, or the 30 year block before. Saying we don't have mountain ranges and therefore don't have enough rain ignores a lot of early historical data, and contravenes the records of the indigenous peoples.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I studied all that but never used that knowledge in real world scenarios. It's very different to learn about rivers and mountains versus actually going over real examples to compare how different regions can be just from the lack of mountains.</p>
<p>I learned all that in school, but it never really <em>clicked</em> until many years later. As a kid it's just something that seems kind of obvious and unimportant until you realize the huge impact it has in the real world. And that's something that isn't really taught in school.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly it's atmospheric circulation. Hadley cells straddle the equator and transport warm air north and south where it cools, condenses and rains out. Next is a farrel cell which sits between the Hadley cells and polar cells which does the same transporting warm air from the sub tropics northward where it rains out, the final cell is the polar cell which does the same as the previous two but inverted. Where the Hadley cells meet the farrel cells is an extremely dry zone: picture the planet there is a desert belt along both southern and northern longitudes, atacama, Namibia, Australia on the southern hemisphere. Its the southern United States and Mexican deserts in North America, Sahara in africa, and the Arabian, central eurasian and gobi deserts. All of these sit on roughly the same longitudes due to these climate cells.</p>
<p>Edit: mixed up longitude and latitude :p</p></div>		</li>
