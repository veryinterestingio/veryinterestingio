Shunt (parallel) capacitors are used more often, because they cause fewer issues, but there are times where a series inductance is preferable.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're explanation made me remember a transformer we tested in Beaumont, Texas that was a 6 phase unit. Think of it as a conventional wye winding, but then a wye mirror image of it wound 180 degrees out of phase so that the output was 6 phases, 60 degress apart. Then rectified.  I was told it made for much less ripple.</p></div>		</li>
