			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like a lot of people this year are also learning this lesson when they began to work from home. When I began WFH I was sticker-shocked when even what seemed to be the most basic office chairs ranged from $300-600. So of course I bought a $50 folding chair from Amazon, because I had the mindset of &quot;I'll be returning back to work soon, and $500 for just a chair is insane&quot;. </p>
<p>Cue numb legs, stiff back, sore buttocks, and so much pain due to poor construction and padding. It's caused me so much problems that when a friend offered to give me his gaming chair (he was getting a newer model) I damn near cried. It's solved a lot of problems and I feel much better than I ever have in months, but at some point I gotta take the plunge and buy an actual office chair.</p></div>		</li>
