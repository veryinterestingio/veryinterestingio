Most pet snakes that eat mice are constrictors, which kill their prey by wrapping it up tightly in their coils and cutting off oxygen, thus suffocating it. They do not eat their prey live, at least not once they are adults and have moved up to constricting their prey.</p>
<p>However, the mouse/rat can still potentially bite the snake while being constricted, or sometimes the snake will for whatever reason not want to feed and the rodent will attack/bite the snake. </p>
<p>So there's very little to any risk of a mouse killing a snake after it has been swallowed, but it's still best to kill the mouse before feeding to make sure it doesn't hurt the snake prior to being ingested.</p></div>		</li>
