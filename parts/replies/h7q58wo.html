			<div class="markdown"><p>True but gas cars also have manufacturing costs. And all the oil and grease they take to run.</p>
<p>The argument that annoys me is when people add up all the emissions on an EV (manufacturing, transporting, driving, everything) and then compare it to a gas engine just driving. As if gas cars just spring up out of the ground.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gas combustion engines also have the benefit where they have been improved for the past 100 years.  Initially they were very inefficient, burning oil, horrible emissions, gasoline wasn't widely available so they had to burn whatever petroleum product was available. Environmental disaster. They have come a very long way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>EVs ARE considerably more carbon expensive to produce though. There are several papers that outline this. Also consider that buying a NEW ev to replace your old gas car is completely incremental because the gas car has already been produced. If you are in the market for a new car already, the math is more complicated, but people selling their 3 year old has car to buy a Tesla aren’t doing many favors for the environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes (although all car production involves heavy industry). It's generally considered that after about 4 or so years you're in the black, so to speak. Since most people expect their new car to last far longer than this, it's a worthy investment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've read an article somewhere on reddit that alone the production of the all of the gas in a car in its lifetime, before you burn it, is more polluting than producing a battery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also in battery vs fuel you have to consider the fact that even after use you still have the battery. The fuel, however, is lost to entropy after use. After a decade the battery might not be as good as it was when it was new, but the buirnt fuel is just useless heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but not as dirty and polluting as burning fossil fuels. We can't eliminate our impact without eliminating civilization, but we can reduce it. Solar panels and batteries, over their lifetime, pollute considerably less than coal, oil, and natural gas.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Even if all the power used to charge them came from burning fossil fuels, they'd still be more efficient per unit than an internal combustion engine</p>
