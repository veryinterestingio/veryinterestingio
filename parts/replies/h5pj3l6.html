			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to this:</p>
<p>In practice, there is generally a difference because the sun's intensity varies over the day. So if you spend between 11 and 3 in the sun straight, you'll have a huge sun exposure. If you space that out to between 9 and 5, with alternating 10 <del>hour</del> <em>minute</em> breaks, you will have lower overall exposure, because the sun isn't as intense in the morning and late afternoon. But that's down to sun intensity, not your skin 'recovering' and undoing damage.</p>

<p>Came home to LA and laid in the beach for 40 mins…was a lobster that night!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That excessive sunburn at the beach was due to the reflection from the sand and the sea. In Iraq you probably were far from large bodies of water and maybe you were laying out in the a grassy field, which would absorb more sunlight that sea and sand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it’s probably a bit more related to the intensity of the sun in that region. The ozone can vary across the globe. I think the water makes some difference too, though.</p></div>		</li>
