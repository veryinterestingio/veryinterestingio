			<div class="markdown"><p>Normally water forms into a hexagon like structure when it becomes solid do to the electrochemical nature of water. This is less dense than liquid water. Ice IV is ice formed in a square like structure because its formed due to pressure and can't be less dense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>compress Earth ice and you get ice II, the core of Ganymede is supposed to be made of it.  heat ice II under pressure and you get ice III.  or you can cool water to 250k at 300MPa (3000 atmospheres)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not at the pressure where it's in equilibrium with its environment. That level of pressure is well past being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_toxicity" target="_blank">toxic</a> to humans even at room temperature. </p>
<p>The best you could do is try to interact with it after it's decompressed to atmospheric pressure, at which point it would be transforming to ice-I, the equilibrium solid state at that pressure, and I have no idea how fast the kinetics of that transformation would be. Potentially instantaneous (e.g., the speed of sound in the material).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Once you go down 20km, there is no longer 20km of water to pressurize the ice, it'll decompress into liquid. iirc iceIV probably isnt even cold, as the pressure would generate heat on solid surfaces.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think withstanding the pressure to even reach that depth would be really difficult. </p>
<p>Not an expert but the Mariana Trench is like half that at it's deepest point and still has enough pressure to make exploration difficult. Then again there's still some sea life so maybe with the right anatomy?</p></div>		</li>
