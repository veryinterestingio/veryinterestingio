			<div class="markdown"><p>It's somehow more comfortable resting one or both legs on a foot rail while sitting on a barstool - just like some of us do with the bars on the barstools themselves. </p>
<p>It's also somehow more comfortable leaning against the bar with one foot placed on the rail. I guess maybe it distributes the body weight in a less &quot;static&quot; way? I've no clue, I just know it's more pleasant than standing with both feet planted on the floor. </p>
<p>(And for fucks sake, how I miss interacting with barstools and footrails...)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think because it encourages you to lean on the bar in general, one elbow on the bar top, one arm for your drink, one foot for the floor, one resting on the foot bar. Because this encourages changing position regularly you create less fatigue on certain parts of the body and spread the effort around your body.  </p>
<p>This is entirely speculation, but it's how I use a bar rail certainly. It's just somehow more comfortable to lean on the bar with one foot raised on the bar rail than it is with both feet on the floor. You put weight onto both of the feet evenly ish, so it's not exactly standing on one foot. I guess it's more similar to spreading your feet diagonally across the carriage on the subway to get better balance if you can't hold on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m a comfortable 5’11”. I could have swore the world was designed for people my height or slightly shorter. Yet I fond my legs dangling at many bars. Am I supposed to hope they have the right kind of stool and then tuck my feet into it.</p>
<p>Ever sit on the very back seat of a bus? My feet are just bouncing all over the place like a little kid. It not always uncomfortable but it always feels silly to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s very interesting. I bet that’s a big part of it. I wonder if any bars have 2 foot rests at different heights. I think I saw it once.</p></div>		</li>
