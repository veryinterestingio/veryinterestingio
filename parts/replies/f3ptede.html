			<div class="markdown"><p>Same as a mud wasp. They forage and feed for most of the season. Then, come mating time, they do the bee dance and then lay eggs in a hole somewhere. In the spring the babies bees hatch and the cycle repeats.</p>
<p>You can buy wild bee houses. Or just make one. It's basically just some wood with holes drilled in them. The commercial ones just look cute.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most bees are solitary. I remember seeing an interesting video about a guy making a bee hotel, but I can't seem to find it right now.</p>
<p>The solitary bees supposedly do a better job pollinating than hive bees, but get pushed out of the area by the honey bees we raise on purpose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More of a this is my home now. Generally you want to avoid drifting as other than weakening the source colony it can spread disease and parasites between colonies. Generally if you wanted to strengthen a weak colony you would take a frame of brood (baby bees) from a strong colony. This way the young bees are born identifying as being from that colony without the risk of them killing the queen</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Beekeeper here. I've used that new home adoption behavior to strengthen weak colonies.  If I have a weak hive I'll swap places with a stronger hive.  Foragers laden with nectar and pollen will come back home to the location they left to be greeted by new guard bees that don't know them, but they will let them right in because they are bringing in the goodies. The foragers will integrate right into the new colony.  I've never had any problems with them accepting the queen in many years of doing this.  The weaker colony gets a boost in forager population while the other colony will hardly notice it.  This works especially well in the fall when brood production is declining instead of donating a frame of brood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, all kinds of other insects will attempt to make their way into a beehive.  The smell of honey is strong, and many other species feel the risk is worthwhile.  The ground outside a hive is often littered with dead bodies both of invading species, and of bees that have died and are unceremoniously dumped from the entrance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe wasps/hornets do and to attack the wasp the bees pile on it and cook it with their body heat.  Cool as it sounds a few wasps will destroy a whole hive so it's not super effective.</p></div>		</li>
