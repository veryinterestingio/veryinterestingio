			<div class="markdown"><p>Best frozen chicken breast recipe: </p>
<p>Preheat oven to 350</p>
<p>Get a casserole dish </p>
<p>Put frozen chicken breasts in dish </p>
<p>Sprinkle seasoning (I like the pre-packaged “griller” mixes)</p>
<p>Fill dish with water until chicken is covered </p>
<p>Bake in oven until done (45 ish minutes)</p>
<p>I’ve always worked from home and like to forget I’m cooking and burn stuff. This way it can cook for hours and, as long as you take it out before all the water evaporates, you’ll have yummy chicken that is nice and moist</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Too many factors. </p>
<p>There's two frozen chicken products I love. </p>
<p>One cooks in 18 minutes at 400; 2 minutes longer and it's overcooked and dried out. </p>
<p>One cooks in 45-50 minutes at 375. This is still portions of a chicken breast. </p>
<p>A full bone in breast may take even longer. 5-10 lbs of breasts will take longer than 1-2lbs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is also recommended not to cook frozen chicken in a crockpot, actually. Two reasons.</p>
<p>1) Crockpots cook slowly, so the chicken ends up spending a long time in the temperature &quot;danger zone&quot; where bacteria can grow.</p>
<p>2) The chicken can cause the pot to crack, due to the extreme temperature difference as the crockpot heats up while the chicken is still frozen. Most brands recommend you pour some water in to help as a buffer.</p>
<p>So, you can do it, but you need to be careful.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's not really an issue if you then promptly heat it past that point, through and through. </p>
<p>The danger zone is mostly an issue if you leave a buffet sitting out for 6 hours while people sneeze onto it and lick the utensils, or if you leave it on the counter for a day, then put it back in the fridge and repeat, which will spoil it before you can cook it. </p>
<p>But if you leave food in the danger zone and then kill everything off by cooking, it's not a  real issue.</p></div>		</li>
