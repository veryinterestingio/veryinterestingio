			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is that there are at least four different types of cross head, and two of them are in common use in Europe: Phillips (two L, not related to the Dutch electronics giant) and Pozidriv. They usually work with each other in low-torque applications, but damage each other more quickly near cam-out.</p>
<p>As for Allen, internal hex threads are also known by a brand name (Inbus) in Germany, though the brand in this case is a lot more reflective of the shape.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 6 pointed star screws with a pin in the middle are security torx and they require specific security bits. I'm not sure what makes them secure tho because you can go buy a set of bits.</p>
<p>Torx screws were designed for maximum driver engagement. Because of the design they are really only good for low torque applications, where the increased engagement with the driver ensures that a more precise torque spec can be achieved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No problem stripping an torx. It's a nightmare to clean, so you just try to squeze the bit in as far as it gets, and voila! ;)
Jokes aside, it's my absolute favourite too. Can handle a lot of torque and with a new bit and quality screws you don't need to hold the screw. Just put it on the bit and it stays there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ehh... They're good up to normal consumer appliance torque levels, stuff you can reasonably do with a driver or maybe a 1/4&quot; ratchet. Once you get into the realm of automotive applications, it's annoying af. 150 lb-ft is no fun for anything but hex bolts.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As a bonus, it's kind of horrible, but if you have a very stripped Torx or hex socket screw, you can often take a big hammer and hammer a next-size-up Torx bit into the socket to remove the screw.</p>
<p>This method works the best on cheap, soft screws, but those are the ones that are the most likely to get stripped anyway.</p></div>		</li>
