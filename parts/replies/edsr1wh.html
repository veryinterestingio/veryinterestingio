			<div class="markdown"><p>ELI5 version: Imagine a ball pit filled with green balls and only 5 red balls in it and you standing on the side with yellow balls.</p>
<p>You throw the yellow balls in and each time you hit a red ball you remove the ball. The odds of hitting a red ball is low and get smaller every time you remove one. That's how the caffeine is removed. </p>
<p>Now imagine that the ball pit is filled with only red balls and you do the same. With every ball you throw, you hit a red ball and can remove it. That's how the alcohol is removed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is kinda making sense but I'm still confused. Why is caffeine a random chance? However alcohol is being metabolized at a continual rate</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The amount of red balls is an indication of the quantity. A beer with 4% alcohol contains 100 times the alcohol that a red bull contains caffeine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the amount of caffeine in your blood (first ball example) is fairly low compared to the enzymes that remove it (the yellow balls being thrown). Where as alcohol is the opposite, the amount of alcohol compared to the enzymes is rather high.</p>
<p>To refine his analogy a bit, imagine instead of just  removing a red ball, you just replace it with a green one, so that the total number of balls remain the same.  If you started with a full ball pit of red balls (as he does with the alchohol analogy) you'll quickly bring it down to a point where you do start missing all the time like with the caffeine example.  But that at that point the alchohol in you is in such a low concentration that your sober (possibly with a hangover).  </p>
<p>So eventually, when you get down the last bits of alcohol to remove, it's the same speed and random chance as caffeine, it's just the early parts that are working at a constant rate.</p>
<p>As to why you body seems to prioritize alchohol over caffeine, consider that alcohol is a literal poison to your body, and caffeine mimics naturally occurring chemicals in your brain.  So your body is gonna go into overdrive to remove alcohol cause it sees it as a threat, but might not even notice the caffeine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its to do with the amount of alcohol vs the amount of caffeine. If you consumed the same amount of caffeine as you would from alcohol you'd overdose for sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Attempted ELI5 version:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Caffeine - A school yard has 100 students running around outside. 1 teacher walks around to the kids at less them to come back in. At first, she finds large groups of kids but eventually has to pick up stragglers. The rate starts high and slows down.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Alcohol - A gymnasium with 500 students getting up from an assembly. There are 5 teachers telling kids to go back to class, but they are all jammed up at the doorway. The kids funnel out at a constant rate.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Your body is the room and teachers. When your body can handle a drug, the rate degrades as it becomes scarcer. When your body is overloaded, it funnels out at the speed you can handle it.</p></div>		</li>
