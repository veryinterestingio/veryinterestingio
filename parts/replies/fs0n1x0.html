			<div class="markdown"><p>I wondered about this myself.  I have Crohn's, and spent several years seriously struggling with bad malnutrition because of it.  My hair fell out, my skin got super-dry and fragile, don't even ask about my bones and teeth.  Right about the time I got surgery and things started getting better, I started noticing that my nails, both finger- and toe- , were becoming very thin, brittle and almost washboard-like, lots of ridges.  I imagine the malnutrition was causing it; I took vitamins, both pills and shots, but that's just can't replace proper nutrition.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you have any issues currently that you aren't positive are a result of your Crohn's disease then definitely bring them up to your physician. Malnutrition is a likely suspect but your medical history is pretty complex. Checking in with someone with training and familiarity with what you've been through would be a good person to double check with if you can.</p></div>		</li>
