In northern parts of England, it's common for an outside toilet to have been brought inside, and added adjacent to the kitchen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The rationale behind this is actually pretty interesting. If giving people a weakened viral vaccine rather than a killed virus vaccine you get waaaay more bang for your buck. </p>
<p>Polio is an enteric virus that only causes paralysis in an extreme minority of cases. The vast majority of infections are subclinical or result in mild gastroenteritis. Even better is that it is shed in feces. So if you vaccinate 1 person this way in an area with poor sewage/water sanitation, the odds are that their feces (and thus the weakened virus) will get into the water supply and thus &quot;vaccinate&quot; the local population.</p>
<p>For anyone wondering. The live vaccine is given also because it developes a stronger immunity than the dead vaccine. The live vaccine create mucosal immunity as well as systemic immunity (creates two different antibodies). The killed vaccine only creates the system antibody (IgG). Because polio infects the mucosa of the GI tract first, creating a mucosal immunity is really important.</p>
<p>However, this runs the risk of someone contracting polio. Even though this happens the Minority of the minority of minority of cases, it has what fueled alot of the conspiracies against Bill Gates. He has singlehandedly saved millions of millions of people but because of his support of polio vaccination, some rare people have gotten polio. Like hes saved far far far more people in comparison but i guess that doesnt matter to antisemetic conspiracy theorists. </p>
<p>Lastly, the reason we only use the killed vaccine in the US is because our water sanitation is incredibly good so the additional benefit of mucosal immunity doesnt outweigh the potential for contracting polio as a result of the vaccine.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So when they made the oral version of the vaccine, did they think this would happen? And why do they keep administering it this way if it causes others to get infected? Since it’s a weakened version of the virus do they not get all the effects of polio?</p></div>		</li>

<p>What is vaccine-derived polio?
Oral polio vaccine (OPV) contains an attenuated (weakened) vaccine-virus, activating an immune response in the body. When a child is immunized with OPV, the weakened vaccine-virus replicates in the intestine for a limited period, thereby developing immunity by building up antibodies. During this time, the vaccine-virus is also excreted. In areas of inadequate sanitation, this excreted vaccine-virus can spread in the immediate community (and this can offer protection to other children through ‘passive’ immunization), before eventually dying out.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the vaccines used to prevent and give herd immunity to wild polio is a live virus vaccine. This means that when administered, your body mounts an immune response to a semi-live but weakened version of polio virus. Because it is live, it can in rare cases manifest to a more serious case allowing it to spread through the fecal-oral route within a community usually causing severe disease in that person. Hope that helps explain that simply.</p></div>		</li>
