			<div class="markdown"><p>I have noticed everyone mentions the flapping noise, and this makes a good note of saying it will extend the life of the fabric, because it's not repeatedly being flexed (heated and stretched) but also the vibrations can cause slip in the tie down mechanism itself, an untwisted strap can be as tight as you can go, but two hours of highway and it will take a full ratchet on the action again, a twisted strap will not loosen off like this. </p></div>		</li>
