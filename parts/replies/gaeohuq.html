			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds accurate, but silly on their part... do they really think changing up the comics will lead to a drastic reduction of sales? Who buys entire newspapers just for the comics?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This part breaks my heart because at 34, I literally never looked the comics up online.<br />
I didn't even realize that was a thing you could do, given my generation made EVERYTHING available.
I still pull them out of the paper at my restaurant so we can all read them together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that is why comics from the 1930s are still running. It's good enough and not worth working on. They are unlikely to make much of a differance if they take a risk on some young new artist, but they know they will get angry letters from grandpa if they cut the 70th year of beatle bailey  so just keeping it the same forever is easiest.</p></div>		</li>
