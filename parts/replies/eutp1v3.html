			<div class="markdown"><p>Assuming the remote takes only two cells (as non-ancient ones usually do), just mix batteries, nothing is going to happen. For reverse charging to happen, the voltage of one of the cells has to drop to zero first (because up to that point it's just being discharged), and a remote that takes two cells is very unlikely to still work when one of the cells is at zero volts, so you will notice before anything bad happens.</p></div>		</li>
