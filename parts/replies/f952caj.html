			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't have to be like that for the rest of your life mate, are you on medication? You sound like me until a couple of years ago when I was diagnosed and started dexys. It's made a massive difference to my life, I still don't know what to say nine times out of ten, but I'm so much better at focusing and actually getting stuff done.
The other medication that helped me is Zyban/buproprion. It's prescribed as an antismoking drug as well as an off label antidepressant, but it basically just jacks up your dopamine a shit ton.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m on lisdexamphetamine, it’s pretty recent so I’m getting used to it. I’m just so cranky and self destructive in the morning, it has a tendency to ruin my entire day because I give up before getting started. </p>
<p>I just started on a new medication to help relieve nerve pain, a drug which has an antidepressant effect. I’m just starting up so it’s probably making me even more cranky right now. </p>
<p>I just want some stability in my life honestly</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not him but question. I'm on adderall generic 20 mgs daily and I don't feel like it's doing anything. I have like 5 papers to write before the end of next week and I know I need to get them done but seem to do literally anything else to avoid working on them, like replying to you. I don't do any drugs or alcohol or anything like that, more like watching videos, reading about politics, playing strategy games, etc., and all the time I think to myself &quot;I should really be doing my work,&quot; but then I just... don't. Did dexys help with that? How can I get my psych to change?</p>
<p>This sucks man... but reading about WHY I do these things, like the dopamine effect, does help. I didn't know that before. Maybe knowing I'm under the influence of something involuntary will help, or it will make me feel like I can't control it anyway so no reason to try. Agh</p></div>		</li>
