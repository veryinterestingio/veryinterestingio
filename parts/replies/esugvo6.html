			<div class="markdown"><p>This feels like a stupid question but I’ll ask it anyway - if foreshocks/aftershocks can only be designated after the fact, then what’s the utility of naming them as such? It looks like Thursday’s Mw 6.4 event was in fact a foreshock to Friday evening’s Mw 7.1, so why not just call them all earthquakes and be done with it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The designation of foreshocks and aftershocks is very entrenched in seismology but rather unhelpful in understanding the mechanics of multiple ruptures on the same fault or on adjacent faults, or what is generally referred to as triggered seismic events. A slip event on a fault can increase or decrease the propensity for further slip to occur in a fault because of shifts in the stress state along the fault with the first event. There is no rule that the first event that triggers a second slip event is necessarily larger or smaller than the second event. Yet, this seismology terminology would refer to the first event as foreshock if the subsequent is larger than the first, and as aftershock if the second event is smaller. This terminology just does not make much sense for those of us who try to understand the mechanics of triggered fault slip. The terminology was introduced when people thought they could predict large earthquakes from so-called precursory phenomena. Most of this has been debunked (such as the infamous Palmdale bulge).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly because naming them as such implies the relationship between these particular earthquakes. From a public perspective, it seems like semantics, but from a scientific perspective, relating foreshocks, mainshocks, and aftershocks to each other in time and space is important in our understanding of particular events and earthquakes more generally. In terms of public communication, aftershocks at least are important to discuss (and designate as such) as (1) we know they will occur and (2) while we cannot predict when and where they will occur, we have a good understanding from prior work of the relative number to expect, their size ranges, and how long they might persist, which is useful information (and communicates more than not differentiating them).</p>
<p>It's also useful to distinguish a normal situation with a mainshock (a significantly larger event than the majority of earthquakes in the sequence) that may or may not be preceded by a foreshock (a large event that appears to be a mainshock until a larger earthquake follows it) and a series of aftershocks (smaller earthquakes whose frequency diminishes with time and whose distribution occur within 1-2 rupture lengths of the mainshock) from something different like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake_swarm" target="_blank">earthquake swarm</a>, where you have an earthquake sequence but the magnitudes are all pretty similar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Makes more sense, thanks. What are the settings where earthquake swarms are more common than the foreshock-mainshock-aftershock sequence we are seeing in California atm?</p></div>		</li>
