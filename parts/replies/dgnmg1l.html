			<div class="markdown"><p>I got this a lot while rowing. While trying to count your strokes you have to focus on other things. My thought process was something like: </p>
<p>1...</p>
<p>2... sit-back, tap-out,</p>
<p>hard on the legs... sit-up... pull all the way through to the finish... keep that even stroke rate... quick tap-out... breathing... two strokes hard with the right hand...</p>
<p>6...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>haha throw in an extra. Unfortunately, the businesses that bought from us hated getting anything except exactly what they ordered. Too little and obviously that's a problem, too much and they wonder &quot;Did I overpay?&quot; And if I tried to carry out a rogue operation with the scale and a supervisor saw, there'd be plenty of &quot;dude, no&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also it wasn't uncommon to hear a loud &quot;FUUUUUCK&quot; across the warehouse from someone who lost count at 132 or whatever. That's if they were being dumb and not arranging them into rows or groups of 10</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I made up this game with counting. Pick a number. 14. Now try to count to that number in your head, while saying it out loud. &quot;Fourteen, fourteen, fourteen, fourteen, fourteen, fourteen, fourteen, fourteen, fourteen, fourteen, fourteen, fourteen, fourteen, fourteen&quot;. </p>
<p>I have some neat tricks to make it to any number. Use others to verify. </p>
<p>E: So you aren't allowed to use your fingers, or toes, or pen/paper, etc.. It all has to be done mentally.  I've never played with anyone, so I didn't think of ways to &quot;cheat&quot;, it was just a way to challenge my brain. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No it would go like this.</p>
<p>&quot;Fourteen, fourteen, fourteen, fourteen, fourteen, fourteen, fourteen, fourteen, fourteen, fourteen, fourteen, fourteen, fourteen, fourteen.</p>
<p>You aren't allowed to use your hands, or toes or anything. Just your mind. </p></div>		</li>
