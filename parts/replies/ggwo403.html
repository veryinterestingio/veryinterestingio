			<div class="markdown"><p>Road rash is typically a type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrasion_(medical)" target="_blank">abrasion</a>, an injury that is caused by rubbing against something. Some abrasions can also involve burns due to the heat generated, though if that is the primary injury, it'd be called a friction burn, not an abrasion or road rash.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can tell you it feels like burn as the patient whether or not it is medically one. Had a pretty deep “road rash” wound after getting hit by a car. My doctors deemed it and abrasion and sent me to a wound specialist tho it was a very small area luckily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not considered a burn medically, but often treated in a burn unit, because the patient has similar needs. I’m both cases, patients have significant damage to the skin losing its protective capabilities.</p></div>		</li>
