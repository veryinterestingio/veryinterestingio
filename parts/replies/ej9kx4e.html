			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve only recently found out I have it so I’m still working on that. But with my variety I just have to try and limit strenuous activity. With vEDS, it’s in my organs and arteries, so I could die tomorrow from a random rupture. Or I could die 20 years from now. </p>
<p>But for the most part, it’s a combination of specific exercises, building in days to recover during the week, vitamins and supplements along with lots of meds to keep my blood pressure a bit lower and just trying to live with it. There’s no cure, so it’s all supportive. I have to have all my teeth removed in a few months because it’s caused my teeth to die from the inside out. It affects so much of my body. Just gotta accept it and not give up.</p>
<p>Edit: Just for context, I’m 29. I have the joints of someone twice my age.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yet another fellow Zebra here. hEDS. I'm 33 and I've just recently had my second major joint repair surgery. It almost ended in total joint replacement, but that's always possible for down the road. We Zebras shoulder a great burden, no matter the variety. My heart is with you all, and I wish you well in your struggles and triumphs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve been amazed and comforted by how many fellow Zebras I have found in the wild so far. I just recently found a support group that has been a huge help figuring out ways to manage it.</p></div>		</li>
