			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, this is not correct. In the Solar System, it is likely that the giant planets migrated, perhaps twice: once within 5 Myr of the start (Grand Tack) and once at \~500 Myr (Nice model). The first migration (Grand Tack) helps to truncate the disk of material in the inner Solar System where the rocky planets formed. This is necessary in order to explain the small size of Mars. Earlier models of planet formation in which the giant planets remain in their present day positions produce planets at Mar's orbit that are much larger (see e.g. this simulation: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7hNIg9Gxvo" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7hNIg9Gxvo" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7hNIg9Gxvo</a></a>). The inner planets form more or less where they are now, with some shifting around due to interactions and impacts. Notice in that simulation how the objects stop moving around so much as the disk of material clears out and they get bigger. The Grand Tack model (where Jupiter migrates in to 1.5 AU), truncates the disk of material that the inner planets grow out of, which means there is less material present in the area where Mars eventually forms. In essentially all other ways, the formation of the inner planets remains the same (i.e., they form more or less where they are now). There is recent evidence to support this early migration of the giant planets from isotopic measurements of meteorites. There appears to be two reservoirs of material in the early Solar System that had distinctly different isotopic compositions, and the reservoirs seem to correlate with locations that are 1) interior and 2) exterior to Jupiter. The later migration of the giant planets (Nice model) scatters a bunch of asteroids and comets inwards, which explains a period of intense impacts on the inner solar system planets (called the Late Heavy Bombardment) after the rocky planets have already finished forming. This is where a large portion of the craters that you see on the Moon come from. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the link you provided says the opposite about inner planets: </p>
<p>&quot;The inner planets are not believed to have migrated significantly over the age of the Solar System, because their orbits have remained stable following the period of giant impacts.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
