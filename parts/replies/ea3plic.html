<p>I know that if you're coiling a rope, coiling in one direction is much smoother and uniform than the other (due generally to the way ropes are woven) - could the direction of coiling be a function of the specific pattern of scales, rather than an innate preference for one direction versus the other? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Horses are right or left handed. Most prefer going to the left (counter clockwise) in an arena, and bend (bring their left inside hind leg up under them more) to the left more easily. So we work on bending them to the right to improve balance and to overcome resistance. Whichever side they're stiff on, we bend. You can see it lunging them one way or the other, too. </p></div>		</li>
