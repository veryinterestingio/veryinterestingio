			<div class="markdown"><p>That gets a little bit outside of eli5, but they are trying to produce certain outputs of a cryptographic hashing algorithm. The reason why it needs to be difficult is that only one party can claim the answer for next chain in the block. If two parties happen to solve the puzzle at the same time, the blockchain actually splits, and will have two different records of the definitive ledger. Half of the miners will take one path, and half will take the other. The first party to solve the next puzzle will claim a solution and everyone, including those in the other branch, will merge to the longest chain. The difficulty of the puzzle is what makes bitcoin safe and the most permanent record in human existence. For example, let's say I sent you bitcoin 10 blocks ago. If I wanted to undo that, I would need to produce a chain of transactions 10 blocks long while still keeping up with the current blockchain. The amount of computing resources required to do that would be astronomical, and if you had those kinds of resources, it would be more profitable to just mine bitcoin blocks. In sum, it's the constant mining and solving of &quot;puzzles&quot; that keep bitcoin safe and maintain a clear definitive ledger.
Edit: as a follow-up, and super not eli-5, but if you truly want to understand bitcoin, you need to understand asymmetric cryptography and cryptographic hashing, which sound intimidating but is really not that bad. Once you understand those, read &quot;mastering bitcoin&quot;. It's a short read, and I'm super confident everything will click.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The puzzles are esentialy the locks securing a record of bitcoin transactions and who owns how much, solving the riddle allows you to verify the transactions.  </p>
<p>If one person was able to be the first to solve the riddle several times in a row they could use that power of verification to verify any fraudulent transactions made and have them seem legit. By making the problem insanely hard to solve, and by making solving it attractive to honest people by providing a reward, you make sure there's enough competition to make repeated solves by the same person next to impossible thus insuring that bitcoin remains secure. </p>
<p>Esentialy to cheat the system in bitcoin and create fraudulent funds you would have to posses enough computing power to beat the rest of the miners in the world to the answer several times in a row.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are not important at all. However, they are very hard to solve, and this prevents any single person or group from taking over the Bitcoin network. This is the primary goal - to make it difficult to verify transactions. In fact, there's a lot of discussion on if we can have a mining &quot;puzzle&quot; that actually does useful work in addition to being hard, rather than wasting all that electricity for nothing (the term is &quot;proof-of-work&quot;, so it's not <em>exactly</em> nothing, but it's like paying someone to dig a hole in the ground and then fill it again)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To keep it simple, if computing technologies allow for faster solving, the difficulty will scale such that the approx. 10 min solve time is restored. The same if more people/groups start mining, and technically the reverse should hold true too.</p></div>		</li>
