			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also important to note that it's not eye-movement that might be responsible, but rather a distraction that taxes working memory.</p>
<p>Which would also go a fair distance in explaining why the effectiveness of eye-movement therapy itself cannot be credibly explained.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Critically, when eye movements followed memory reactivation during extinction learning, it reduced spontaneous fear recovery 24 h later (ηp2 = 0.21). Stronger amygdala deactivation furthermore predicted a stronger reduction in subsequent fear recovery after reinstatement (r = 0.39). In conclusion, we show that extinction learning can be improved with a noninvasive eye-movement intervention that triggers a transient suppression of the amygdala. Our finding that another task which taxes working memory leads to a similar amygdala suppression furthermore indicates that this effect is likely not specific to eye movements, which is in line with a large body of behavioral studies.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was treated for ptsd with this method. Was very skeptical, okay, actually mocking, but it actually worked. The memory of the incident became significantly less intense, more distant and less detailed. I became more detached from it although I remembered it clearly, the terror of the moment wasn't there anymore. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. I’d been traumatised by a particular memory for years to the point I couldn’t even describe it in words, literally, I couldn’t say the words. I too was sceptical but also felt I had nothing to lose so went ahead. It was very hard getting through the therapy but yeah, it worked. I feel quite detached from the memory now too I barely think about it now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whoa! This lines up with my theory. In practicing both EMDR and various kinds of EFT, I've noticed that they actually function almost identically: the patient's focus is consumed in some form of physical activity (making eye movements in EMDR vs tapping on acupoints in EFT) while reprocessing the memories. Something about dual-focus accesses the traumatically stored material, and I could posit that it has little to do with exactly what physical activity is being done.</p>
<p>I like the idea that the eye movements trigger <em>rapid</em> reprocessing like some sort of waking REM state, but I've achieved similar results in patients through deep EFT (Matrix Reimprinting) sessions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you think this offers any explanation as to why activities such as music and dance are closely tied to expression of the self in so many cultures, and held with such importance? Does the concept of reprocessing paired with dual-focus have any overlap with them?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes exactly. I was immediately impressed with the efficacy of EFT tapping when first dabbling with it 15ish years ago, with myself and others, but <em>jeez</em> what an idiotic explanation they used, that &quot;energy system&quot; BS. ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who's gone through it, my experience was this: you enter a deeper state of candor and not giving a fuck because you're distracted by the visuals. It's all about spilling the beans on those unspoken thoughts and fears.</p>
<p>I've experienced this many times in non-therapeutic settings where I was engaged in another task and, when prompted on another subject, I'll pop off the first thing that comes to mind - uncensored and, quite often, to the shock of whoever's talking to me. As someone with Asperger's who's had to spend a lot of time manually tamping down my worst tendencies, having the filter come off like that is a noticable slip.</p>
<p>I'm curious - in your studies, does EMDR have a higher rate of success with men over women, or with autism-spectrum individuals?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's nothing like my experience.  For me it tapped directly into old traumas instantly and felt like I turbo boosted through an intense grieving\processing process that greatly diminished the ball of underlying shit that was at the root.  It felt like emotional surgery.</p>
<p>It was extremely effective for me </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't believe that there is a significant difference for success rates between females and males, but I couldn't say for sure. It's really not that simple because there is many factors involved. EMDR as treatment for what? EMDR is mostly used for treating PTSD, but also phobias and addictions (I was specifically looking into phobias). Most studies for PTSD for instance are confounded due to mixed type of traumas. Men are more prone to experience traumas in general, but women are more likely to experience sexual traumas. Women are also more likely to develope PTSD after a trauma and the PTSD tends to be more severe. As for phobias, women are much more likely to develope phobias, and seek treatment, for that reason men are usually underrepresented in most studies. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>War vet here (infantry). I don’t have PTSD but sometimes do have recurring nightmares. Some suggested to look into this. Your post (and the one you responded to) definitely helped me understand the process better. Do you think it could indeed address nightmares, based on your experience?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My issue was less nightmares and more anxiety attacks - like &quot;pull over to the side of the road because I thought I was going to have a heart attack and die&quot; type stuff. I'd definitely recommend it for unpacking that kind of baggage.</p>
<p>It's a lot more grounded than some of the sketchy yoga-voodoo-feel-good stuff out there; it might work for some people, but that sort of thing doesn't make me <em>comfortable,</em> personally, and that's a necessary first step towards defragging your baggage. But hey, your mileage may vary.</p></div>		</li>
