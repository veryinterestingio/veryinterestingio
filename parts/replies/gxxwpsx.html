			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically the only time I've fractured a bone (aside from my nose a few times) was punching someone on the rugby field. To be fair, they hit me first.  </p>
<p>The nose breaks were, unsurprisingly, also from rugby.  </p>
<p>Lots of concussions too.  </p>
<p>20 years (and counting) of rugby makes me frightened of growing older. But I love it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like you have to be built a certain way to play Rugby. Not necessarily just physically, but mentally. Hopefully, in your case, the concussions won't come back to hunt you. Hard to give up what you love, but no shame in walking away for your health. I'm assuming you punched the guy in the face? You also said &quot;they&quot; so I'm wondering if that means more than one punched you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sad to see this comment so far down. Hollywood has really done a number on people, with a lot of them really believing there is such a thing as non-lethal violence. Violence, in all forms, is potentially lethal. While movies don't show it as much as a grizzly slash across the stomach or a gunshot wound to the heart, blunt force can surely kill an organism. And a fist is nothing but a blunt object attached to your body. A single punch can kill people and has done so a lot.</p></div>		</li>
