			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep! I believe the process occurs in both genders and the process begins around late 30's to early 40's. This is quite early in my eyes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So it isn't water soluble, but is it soluble in something else?  Couldn't we use some special body wash to take the oils off and prevent the smell?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, although it is not water soluble, a Japanese line of anti aging products uses persimmon extract, which acts as a natural deodorizer against nonenal.
The extract comes from a fruit and contains a lot of benefits to promote healthy skin and anti aging.
There are also many other products to combat nonenal like some tea products but I do not know the specifics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds like bullshit.  First of all, soap doesn't just clean water soluble substances like sweat, those can be cleaned with just water, which is why they're called &quot;water soluble&quot;.  Soap acts as an emulsifier that, together with water, removes oil from the skin.  In fact soap with sodium lauryl sulfate, removes oil too well, leaving the skin dry.  If this nonenal that you're talking about is an oil, then soap will remove it, you wouldn't need some persimmon-extract beauty cream.</p>
<p>Frankly, I'm extremely skeptical of claims that some new extract or fruit or other item miraculously stops some of the negative effects of aging.  Not to mention, you highlighted a very early age range, 30-40, in which we'll start to need this product, which makes me suspect that you're trying to scare people into buying this Japanese persimmon-extract beauty product.  I imagine you're hoping a bunch of redditors within or near that age range will now go out and by the product, so they don't smell &quot;old&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can this be affected by dietary sources of antioxidants? Maybe specifically vitamin D since it seems tied to the skin somehow, what with sun tanning and all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. A healthy lifestyle can greatly reduce the smell of nonenal. No drinking, smoking, drinking water and getting adequate rest. All these factors lengthen your lifespan and slow down the aging process compared if you do the opposite of those above activities.
Green tea is a big source of antioxidants and can be useful in combatting the smell.</p>
<p>Vitamin D can help, but too much vitamin D can actually accelerate skin aging so be careful. And absolutely no tanning in my opinion when you hit the age where nonenal begins to become an issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My granddad was an avid runner and had to stop only in the last couple years. He and my grandma take long walks every day. They've always eaten pretty clean too, and obviously no smoking. He has a couple beers every night though, but i dose that doesn't make as much of a difference considering how healthy he is otherwise. He's surprisingly agile and fast for a 94 year old. And neither of them have that old person smell. Anecdotal, of course, but your advice seems to be helping them out.</p></div>		</li>
