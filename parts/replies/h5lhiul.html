<p>Think about the kinds of things you watch and whether you could handle some of those as background sound. Could be podcasts, could be videos intended to be watched. Just get into sleeping position and just listen until you forget to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Baumgartner Restoration. That dude has a very steady and calm voice, and often goes a long time working on a piece without talking. It's kind of like asmr but not unidentifiably gross (actual asmr videos make me really uncomfortable for some reason)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thatâ€™s exactly right. Iâ€™ve had trouble sleeping since I was a kid. Iâ€™ve been listening to Harry Potter read by Jim Dale nearly every night for like 20 years now. Always does the trick. Gives my mind something to focus on but is predictable so it doesnâ€™t keep me up. Itâ€™s like a dance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Podcasts are great for that too, as long as they donâ€™t have distracting ads or music. </p>
<p>I often fall asleep listening to podcasts of people playing Dungeons and Dragons or other TTRPGs; I think I may be conditioning myself to become sleepy in reaction to the sound of dice rolls.</p></div>		</li>
