			<div class="markdown"><p>Similarly, sugar and fat. A ring doughnut has a fairly even ratio of fat and sugar. A glazed doughnut does not. If you want to be able to eat like seven doughnuts, it'll be far easier to keep the ring doughnuts down than the glazed ones.</p>
<p>There was an experiment which i don't want to look up this time of night which had rats given the option of eating just sugar, just fat, or a mix of both. Rats given the options of just sugar or just fat would only eat a small amount. The ones given the option of eating both would eat far far more than the others.</p>
<p>This is also why cookies are so bad for you: not just because of the fat and sugar, but because we as humans are perfectly capable of consuming huge numbers of them and our lizard brain doesn't know when to stop.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Fucking cookies. I usually eat very low-carbs; off-and-on down into the keto range.  Hunger and cravings are a rarity.  Eating only a single meal a day is absolutely no problem.  If I decide to step off the bandwagon (i.e. for holidays, special occasions, etc) cookies are absolute kryptonite.  Fighting past this type of extinction burst is a herculean feat for me.  I've heard it said that the brain processes sugar cravings similar to the cravings of cocaine among addicts. I've got no idea if this is an exaggeration, and I've never done done cocaine but dear god do them cookies get a hold on me.</p></div>		</li>

It breaks down all of this and explains exactly why things the taste the way they do, and how to cook with just knowledge and no recipes. Would recommend</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love it. It taught me so many things about creating a meal and the little tips that come with it to make it pop. </p>
<p>My favourite tip so far (which I think might be from a podcast interview with her) is if you feel a meal is lacking something, take a spoonful of it and add salt, oil or butter or something acid to that spoonful and you can literally taste the difference in what it needs more of. </p>
<p>I was obsessed with it For a good while.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something I recently realized in cooking. Particularly when making copy cat chipotle rice. Too much lime on its own is overwhelming. The same with too much salt. But when balanced you can overload both and the flavor is incredible. Despite excess of each independently.</p></div>		</li>
