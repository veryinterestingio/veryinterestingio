<p>As a bonus, you can sell it at a loss down the road for a tax write-off if you set it up right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Value is determined by how much someone thinks it’s worth. One bit of advice I got when starting out is price your work higher. There are people who will see a work of art they kinda like and see it for a low price and not buy it because they think because it’s priced low, that it’s got less value. Jack the price up a couple hundred or even a couple thousand and that work might fly off the wall because that same collector may suddenly perceive that it has a greater value and therefor is like... better. </p>
<p>Its a strange logic but it works. My SIL will buy expensive shit because she perceives that expensive shit as having greater value than something less expensive that does the same job just as well</p>
<p>Also, just to reveal how art is priced... when an artist is represented by the gallery, the gallery may take as much as 50% of the sale value of the work. What the gallery does for the artist is show and promote the art, host an opening with food and drink, and they also send out press releases to local papers, magazines, and do other forms of advertising. When an artist makes a thing, they have to factor in the cost of materials (paint, the surface they’re painting on, frames if if needed that, etc), the time it takes to make it, the cost of overhead like studio rent (should be factored in even if you work out of your house). Like... say a painting is sold in a gallery for 2000. Gallery gets 1000, and so the rest of that 1000 has to be divided up in the artist’s expenses. If the artist underpriced themselves they could end up making less than minimums wage at the end of the day. This is a line I have to walk because my work can take 30-40 hours just to make one painting, factoring in overhead costs I may make 15-20 per hour on a painting if I sell it for 1000. Not all my work takes that long... I’m just using it to illustrate that what the artist sells the work for what seems like a lot of money, may not be as much as you’d think. I personally resort to doing commercial work to pay the bills, which is very common. Most artists don’t make their living as gallery artists though. The art you probably enjoy the most are artists who work for commercial studios and make art that’s a part of a brand. I have a friend who has won several awards because he and his firm does <a href="https://observer.com/2018/07/arbys-social-media-has-cult-fan-base-for-its-burger-box-sculptures/" target="_blank">advertising for Arby’s</a> his name is not mentioned in this article but he’s the one who makes the work. He was sharing it on Instagram for a while but Arby’s doesn’t want their brand compromised so you will likely never find out who he is, but he makes a really good living at making paper sculptures. Just saying... galleries are just one way art do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also a very good way to &quot;lock&quot; your money. If you suddenly have a large amount of money you don't want to spend and don't want to take the risk of investing it you could buy a super expensive painting for it. The price of the painting will never go down and there will always be interest in it once you decide you want your money again and sell it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But it has no value without pretentiousness. Even if you enjoy the concept, you can't just describe the art literally. You need flowery interpretations and extrapolations or you'd get <em>Paint Spatters #3</em> and <em>Banana On Floor</em> with no commentary and nobody would give a shit. These things are the very definition of selling the sizzle not the steak.</p></div>		</li>
