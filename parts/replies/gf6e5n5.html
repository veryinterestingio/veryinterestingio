			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone already answered about animal reservoirs, but to clarify: No, because this virus is zoonotic, meaning it also effects animals. Bats, raccoon bears, minks, cats, and dogs have all been shown to transmit it a bit. Thus, even if you vaccinate every human on the planet, there is still a mink somewhere who is carrying the virus. Even if you then vaccinate all livestock and pets, it'll live in the wild <insert animal here> population. And no eradication effort with wild animals will ever be successful, because if even 1 transmission of the disease happens 40 years after we've &quot;eliminated&quot; it, no one will have ANY antibodies for it, and it will again spread like wildfire. </p>
<p>Smallpox only worked because the only place smallpox still exists is in 3 test tubes in secure labs in -80 freezers, so barring human intervention, it won't get out now, when none of us have any antibodies for it. Literally anybody born after 1972 in the US, for example, will have never seen a smallpox vaccine or any virus similar to smallpox, and will have a completely virgin immune system, and get ravaged by it. It only takes one transmission undetected for it to flare up again, because no one &quot;just fights it off&quot; like they would the hundreds of cold viruses they're probably exposed to daily.</p>
<p>ETA: People tell me the US army still does the vaccine, so a few million people (less than 10 million, even with generous assumptions of family exposure to the live vaccine) might have some exposure at some point in the last decade. Still pretty small for the 350+ million Americans ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just one minor point - people in the US military are still being vaccinated for smallpox. Over 2.6M in the past decade according to this official article under the &quot;Why get vaccinated&quot; section: </p>
<p><a href="https://www.health.mil/Military-Health-Topics/Health-Readiness/Immunization-Healthcare/Vaccine-Preventable-Diseases/Smallpox/Smallpox-FAQs" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.health.mil/Military-Health-Topics/Health-Readiness/Immunization-Healthcare/Vaccine-Preventable-Diseases/Smallpox/Smallpox-FAQs" target="_blank">https://www.health.mil/Military-Health-Topics/Health-Readiness/Immunization-Healthcare/Vaccine-Preventable-Diseases/Smallpox/Smallpox-FAQs</a></a></p>
<p>Another note is that it happens to be a live virus vaccine and so the vaccine can spread to direct contacts and family members and there are documented cases of that happening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not totally true, we all got the smallpox vaccine in the army shipping for Iraq. Not your normal run of the mill vaccine either, little shrimp fork poked into your bicep a few times and it scabbed up  and you had to keep it covered. Small objection to one small part of your entry :p</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No because covid has animal reservoirs.  Smallpox and polio do not.  You would have to vaccinate or kill the entire animal reservoir for it to even be possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to try not to be a &quot;Yes, but... no&quot; guy here. </p>
<p>COVID-19 has animal reservoirs, but it doesn't easily get out of those reservoirs. We've had 4 billion-plus humans on earth since 1974 (currently just under 8 billion), and this virus only got to the human race last year. So it's unlikely that we will eliminate the animal reservoirs*, but if it's eliminated from humanity it may be another fifty years before it comes back. </p>
<p>*on the other hand, we've gotten rid of an alarming percentage of wild animals, something like 2/3 in the last 50 years, so ... maybe by accident.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory, but the problem with things like COVID is that they have carriers other than humans. Smallpox and Polio are only found in humans. </p>
<p>So even if you vaccinated every human on the planet for COVID, it would still exist in other animals. Eventually mutating into new strains that the vaccine would not protect against. This is part of why the flu is such a hard thing to handle. It is constantly spreading around through various hosts, mutating and recombining along the way. </p>
<p>To eradicate COVID or similar diseases, you would also need to vaccinate non-human carriers. That is very hard to do. It is being attempted with rabies and progress is being made. But it is hard enough vaccinating humans, much less figuring out ways to inoculate entire populations of animals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not really the children that need to be protected, it’s the older generations. </p>

<p>So where you might want to try to protect your 4 year old, your 65 year old is over 1000x as likely to die from it. </p>
<p>The question is kinda backwards, really it should be “how many people have to die before we get to 80% needed for herd immunity” and the answer to that question is everyone under 62 has to have it to get it to reach the minimum death count for herd immunity. </p>

<p>Of course, that’s a magic number, you can’t realistically get to this point without cross contaminating the elderly, but if there was no vaccine AND COVID offered lifetime immunity (this is a big jump!) then eventually COVID should dramatically drop in lethality because people would catch it when young and already be immune before they hit old age.</p></div>		</li>
