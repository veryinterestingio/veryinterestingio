			<div class="markdown"><p>if you pitch up a person's voice (without changing the speed), it sounds unnatural and artificial. that might be comical and have certain uses, but in general certain sounds only sound good at specific pitch ranges.</p>
<p>said another way: this is like asking why not just have an orchestra of cellos play all the string parts. In principle, yes, the cello can produce any note any violin can, just by playing up very high on the string. but because the instrument is larger, even if it is playing the exact same pitch as a violin, its sound will be affected, and the end result will sound strained and tight.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I used to play trumpet. Can you make an analogy with a trumpet and a related instrument?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think of families of instruments like families of languages around the world. Humans can all essentially produce the same sounds but the way we read/say them are different. If I asked you to pronounce the letter &quot;o&quot;, the tone may be different from the way I say &quot;o&quot; depending on our different language backgrounds and dialects. Sure, unification of families may make things &quot;easier&quot; but then we wouldn't have the wonderful richness of varietal sounds that different instruments can produce together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a fair question, and I'm not wholly familiar on the history there. For clarinet, at least, they have historically come in a <em>lot</em> of keys, and C clarinets are a thing. Over the years, though, the key work advanced enough that it became easier and easier to play clarinets outside of their 'main' key. So if a Bb clarinet is &quot;good enough&quot; for playing in C, and C clarinet is &quot;good enough&quot; for playing in Bb, which do you choose? For clarinets, people seemed to settle on the Bb, in large part because the two instruments have slightly different tones, and composers found the tone of the Bb to be more pleasant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But doesn't that make it... more complicated?</p>
<p>The way it works is that the composer wants a Eb played on a Eb clarinet so they write C on the sheet music but it sounds like Eb?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more complicated for the composer, but it's a heck of a lot easier for the musicians. And composition being complicated is relatively fine - you can take your time to get things right. But during a performance, if your clarinets all need to switch instruments mid-piece because of a key change you wrote (and that is quite common), you <em>really</em> don't want one of them forgetting whether they're playing a Bb clarinet or an A clarinet, and playing the wrong notes. And some clarinets just aren't used that frequently. You may get plenty of practice on your Bb or your A, and could in theory remember which fingering is which concert pitch for both, but then if your band director suddenly decides on a piece that calls for a basset horn (a clarinet in F, basically), you're going to be really happy to have your music already transposed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The composer writes a score in concert where every c is a c. The individual parts get transposed for the instruments. This is done digitally nowadays but when you’re used to it it’s very fast. Good musicians can often sight read and transpose if they’re reading music for a different instrument.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the composer has to deal with transposition, but there's also a benefit: you can understand every member of an instrument family with no extra work.</p>
<p>For example, when writing for clarinet, you need to understand that the chalumeau register goes from E3 to F4, the throat tones are F#4 through A#4, the clarino register is B4 to C6, the lower altissimo is C#6 to G6, and the upper altissimo is G#6 to C7.</p>
<p>Thanks to transposition, that's true of every clarinet. If clarinets didn't transpose, not only would the players have to learn shifted fingerings for every instrument, but composers would have to learn all of that too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This doesn't seem to follow on brass instruments, though: concert Bb is written as C for trumpets and Bb for baritones and tubas, but fingered the same for both (albeit a few octaves apart).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The situation with baritones is more complicated. While their music in bass clef is written at concert pitch, you can also find it in written in treble clef as a transposing instrument in Bb. This is to allow trumpet players to pick up a baritone horn and treat it as a trumpet that's just an octave down.</p>
<p>Rehearsal can get really <del>annoying</del> exciting if you're in a band where half of the baritone players read bass clef and the other half read treble.</p></div>		</li>
