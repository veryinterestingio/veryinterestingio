			<div class="markdown"><p>My feeling that most talk about AI in the long term is speculation, and what Ernie and I focused on instead in the short-term: what are the strengths and weakness of current technology, and what could be done to improve that technology. We can see quite clearly why current machines can't for example, read, and why popular techniques can't immediately solve that problem. One hundred years from now, machines will almost certainly be able to read, but it's difficult to fully imagine all of the consequences of that future capacity.</p>
