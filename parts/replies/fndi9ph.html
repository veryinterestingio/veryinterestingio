			<div class="markdown"><p>Not from a mole but I have a clear, ridiculously thin hair (thin as a spider's silk) that grows from my forehead, of all places. I always pull it out and it always grows back. Just every few months I spot this teeny tiny 2 inch long wispy hair.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same with the clear hair. Like fine fishing wire. I remember pulling the same type of clear hair from the same spot in my grandmothers chin as I do now on myself. Not out of a mole thought.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am. Blonde and straight hair.  Female. But this isn't like all the other hair on my body. My hairdresser finds really thick Asian quality hairs every now and then on my scalp. It's like those but on my chin and clear. Grandma who also had that one chin hair had raven black curly hair.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh someone else who grows clear hairs! I had a super long one on my side which I suddenly noticed, it was at least five or six inches and really thin yet surprisinly strong. I also had one on the side of my forehead, but it wasn't nearly as long.</p></div>		</li>
