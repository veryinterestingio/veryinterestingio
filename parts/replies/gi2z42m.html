			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure it's more complex than &quot;it all just works out&quot; - we're talking about major surgery here. But keep in mind that blood flow is to some degree self-regulating because if the flow is obstructed in one area, it'll build up pressure that stops the flow of additional blood to the area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But an artery that's sealed off can't run backwards, can it? wouldn't that clot?</p>
<p>I understand roughly that blood pumps from heart -&gt; artery -&gt; cells -&gt; veins (-&gt;heart-&gt;lungs) and repeat. Modern surgery might reroute and artery into a vein or something, but how did people survive amputation before modern medicine?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of ways it can fail to work out, causing swelling from blood getting trapped, or necrosis from inadequate blood flow.  If you have an amputation these days, surgeons will do several stump assessments where they make sure the circulation is adequate and you don't have bone fragments floating around.</p>
<p>They're trying to build you something that won't hurt all the time, and that will be a good foundation for a prosthesis.  In some cases that might actually mean doing vascular surgery because your injury happened in a bad spot.</p>
<p>Here's an article about stump assessment (they use the term 'residual limb' these days).  Notice the talk about stents and angioplasties, to fix circulatory problems that didn't resolve on their own...and on peripheral vascular disease, if they don't do this right.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much every part of your body has arteries and veins, of all various sizes.  Everything that needs oxygen will have blood flow, both in and out.</p>
<p>So, yeah, if I get what you're understanding is then yes, it just so works out.</p>
<p>There's an arterial branch to take blood to the arm.  So part of that branch would have been severed and sealed.  But other parts are also feed from what remains of that branch, so blood still flows to somewhere on what's left of that branch, and from there into a vein branch to go back to the heart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Similar to how your fingers don’t explode arterial blood just diverts through proximal capillary beds into the venous system. </p>
<p>The stenting and angioplasties referenced above are to address underlying vasculopathy that likely led to the need for an amputation in the first place. </p>
<p>Most people who get amputations get them because of infection or loss of blood flow. The infections are frequently because of diabetes or peripheral vascular disease. If you don’t address the underlying problem, or cut above it, you won’t heal the amputation site, which can lead to a need for revision of the site or a more proximal amputation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ahh, so the artery dead end diffuses into nearby cells and then back to veins?</p>
<p>And this won't cause insane high blood pressure or something?</p></div>		</li>
