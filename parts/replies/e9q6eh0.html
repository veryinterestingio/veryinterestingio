			<div class="markdown"><p>Another explaination: computers start from black and add light to get to white, while painters start from white and block light with paint to get to black. These different approaches require a different primary color set. </p>
<p>It might also be worth noting that with painting, you might actually be able to get a wider color range using cyan, magenta, yellow and black as your primary colors.  Some of those colors weren't widely available for painters a long time ago, though, so the tradition is to use red, yellow, blue, and black.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>FYI its actually magenta, cyan, and yellow that are used in paints/printers. along with a black pigment because it is difficult to perfectly balance all 3 go get a true black.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not when it comes to computers, the colour of a pixel is determined by 3 values (0 - 255) for Red, Green, Blue respectively.</p>
<p>(0, 0, 0) = Black<br />
(255, 255, 255) = White<br />
(255, 0, 0) = Red<br />
(0, 255, 0) = Green<br />
(0, 0, 255) = Blue</p>
<p>The colours you're talking about include for example cyan which for a computer would still just be adding value in the correct ratio e.g: (0, 255, 255) = Cyan | (255, 0, 255) = Magenta | (255, 255, 0) = Yellow</p>
<p>It's by playing with these values that a computer can display any colour, even obscure ones like:<br />
(188, 143, 143) = Rosy Brown<br />
(138, 43, 226) = Blue Violet</p>
<p><em>I used pre-defined HTML colours for the obscure colours, here's the list i used:</em> <a href="http://www.tayloredmktg.com/rgb/" target="_blank"><em><a href="http://www.tayloredmktg.com/rgb/" target="_blank">http://www.tayloredmktg.com/rgb/</a></em></a>  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an extension, and perhaps as an easy way to realize that we're talking about different things: if you combine the three primary colours of light, you get white light; if you combine the three colours of paint, you get black.</p>
<p>These are called additive colour mixing, when each extra colour you put down gets you more light (RGB, so monitors, lights, etc) and subtractive colour mixing where each colour you put down takes light away (CMY, so pigment, dye, etc).</p>
<p>Not sure if that adds anything to the understanding, but there you go.</p></div>		</li>
