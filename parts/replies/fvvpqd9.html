<p>Just like all electricity. I wish this saying would go away because it sometimes makes people think they’re safe in circumstances where they’re not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I know what you're saying, but if you've got a lightning rod nearby or are surrounded by a Faraday Cage around you, the current through your body will be negligible.</p>
<p>If you're somewhere with multiple possible paths for the lightning to follow, then yes, the current can/will follow all of them. Stay away from tall trees and water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about current through an insulator (ignoring ionisation)? Surely 0 current flows through the insulators, and air etc. as there are simply no free delocalised electrons to carry the current? </p>
<p>Isn’t it more accurate to say the current flow is proportional to 1/resistance of the medium? So if the resistance is double one path then it has 1/2 the current.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To my knowledge there’s no such thing as a perfect insulator except maybe a pure vacuum if that were possible. Even though e.g. rubber has an <em>incredibly</em> high resistance, the current flowing through it in an electric field is not 0. But your last statement is also correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Current flows through all possible paths available simulteanously given it has enough voltage to overcome resistance.</p>
<p>Say you have an exposed copper wire with live current going through, if you catch both end bare handed current is going to flow both through the wire <em>and</em> you. But since you have a higher resistence, current flowing through you will have lower amps.</p>
<p>If the voltage is low enough however, you can grab a live wire without any issue, regardless of the amps. I wouldn't advice doing so unless you know what you're doing tho.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have two resistors in parallel, one being 10 ohms and the other 10,000 ohms there is still current going through both resistors when you apply a voltage difference between them. Just way more current going through the 10 ohm resistor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Current is inversely proportional to the resistance. More resistance means less current flow. Insulators have very high resistance, so very little current flows through them. But you can still get shocked even if there’s an established lower resistance path. The shock will simply be less severe than it would have been without that established lower resistance path.</p>
<p>So let’s say there’s a circuit with current flowing through it. Then you touch it, and become part of the circuit. The established circuit won’t protect you from a shock, just because it’s lower resistance.</p></div>		</li>
