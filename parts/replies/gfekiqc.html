			<div class="markdown"><p>Would this be the same principle as to why you can't really see into a wooded area but can (more) easily see out of a wooded area?</p>
<p>I only ask because my house is surrounded by woods and often wonder if people driving by can see in because I can see them from my house, but whenever I drive around I can't even see my house despite knowing to look for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This might be conjecture but I would assume that has more to do with light and exposure. You can only see light that can escape and get to your eyes. If you have ever been on stage for something, it is sort of similar. The stage is illuminated really well, but it is super hard to see the audience because they are all in the dark. Not only that but it‚Äôs actually a bit harder to see them than if just everything were dark because you are adjusted to the high light. Laser pointers also are like that. If there is nothing for the beam to reflect off of in the air, you only see the spot in the surface. </p>
<p>Deep in the woods it is covered from light from above, and so you can only see what light comes out from the tree line. Inside however, you can ONLY see what comes in, and since it is darker, your eyes are adjusted to the low light. The actual amount of light coming through from outside is actually really high, relative to the area it comes from, even if that amount of space is pretty small overall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for that explanation. It's something I've been wondering for awhile but just never felt inclined to actually look up. I'd award you but I'm broke so here. üèÖ</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So nice to have an idea of what actually causes that effect!</p>
<p>I‚Äôve called it the ‚Äúcampfire principle‚Äù since I was a kid. A character in a book series* I was reading hid just beyond the edge of firelight, knowing that he could see people in the ring of light but they couldn‚Äôt see him.</p>
<p>*Ranger‚Äôs Apprentice, if anyone else remembers that. Good times</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An unmentioned and underappreciated effect is that our eyes key on movement.  You can clearly see the cars because they're moving.  The house is not and can go unnoticed because of this despite it being the much larger object.</p>
<p>You'd be amazed how much you don't notice around you simply because it didn't move, and how quickly you do when it does.</p></div>		</li>
