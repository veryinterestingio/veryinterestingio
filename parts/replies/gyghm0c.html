			<div class="markdown"><p>By this logic, how do vapour bubbles ever form at any temperature or pressure? This makes no sense to me: the water can &quot;no longer&quot; boil after reducing the pressure because the pressure has increased in the bulk of the liquid? But maybe I'm misunderstanding what you're trying to say.</p>
<p>The pressure at the surface of the liquid will equal the vapour pressure above the liquid plus any additional partial pressures from other gases. The pressure will then increase into the bulk of the liquid relative to that surface pressure. So if you remove the other gases, the pressure in the bulk liquid will also decrease.</p>
<p>Regardless, the very definition of boiling is that the vapour pressure of the fluid is equal to the system pressure. This allows bubbles to form in the bulk. Yes the depth of the fluid will affect this pressure. But this is small for fluids depths of cm or even m. For water, pressure increases by approximately 1/1000 of an atm for a depth of 1 cm.</p></div>		</li>
