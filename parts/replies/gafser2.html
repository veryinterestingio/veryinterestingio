			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a great question about the 'strength' of the adapative immune system response and the correlation to symptoms. In the case of Covid19, studies are finding that patients with severe symptoms have higher titers of antibodies (part of the adaptive immune system).</p>
<p>&quot;disease severity was associated with higher neutralizing antibody titres. It is not clear yet why neutralizing antibody responses correlate with disease severity. A higher viral load may lead to more severe disease and generate a stronger antibody response through increased levels of viral antigen. Alternatively, antibodies could have a causative role in disease severity, although there is currently no evidence for antibody-dependent enhancement in COVID-19&quot;</p>
