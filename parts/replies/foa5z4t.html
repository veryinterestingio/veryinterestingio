			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny you should ask.  My team is building the first &quot;version 1.0&quot; coral bleaching monitoring system with our partners at Vulcan (the late Paul Allen's organization) and other partners.  We should start to roll out the bleaching detection system in late 2020!  You can track our progress on our project website <a href="https://allencoralaltas.org" target="_blank">allencoralaltas.org</a> .</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, this is a fascinating resource and I'll have a proper look through this later because this could be really useful in my work, particularly geomorphic and benthic mapping of the Indian Ocean if that's well validated - I look forward to seeing how that develops. </p>
<p>On your project timeline it says that you will have a global reef extent layer available by Summer 2020 - does it look like this is still on schedule and do you expect that this will be available as a downloadable shapefile or similar?</p></div>		</li>
