			<div class="markdown"><p>Precisely. When you wonder why something costs more than a similar thing, it's almost never right to ask, &quot;Why does it cost more to produce this thing?&quot;</p>
<p>It's almost always better to ask, &quot;Why are customers willing to pay more for this thing?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Convenience plays a part in this as well. People are willing to pay as much if not more just they don’t have to leave their house. Case in point, here in aus I can get the new black ops Cold War for $78 in the shop, but I bought it online for $99 just so I didn’t have to travel into the city and sit through traffic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That answers  &quot;Why are customers willing to pay more for this thing?&quot; and therefore, OP's question.  </p>
<p>Also factor in the platform tax.  30% off the top for digital content goes to Microsoft/Sony/Apple/Google/Steam...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The best example of this is gas at a gas station. They change the price daily, sometimes multiple times a day. But the gas truck only comes once or twice a week! It's all the same gas! The price is what they think the market will bear. </p>
<p>Another good example is Grey Goose. It was a cheap, failing vodka brand, so some guy bought it, put it in a fancy bottle, and doubled the price.  Instant success.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a great example. If they expect future orders of gas to be more expensive, they’ll raise prices to make their current supply last longer to reduce total high priced gas they end up buying, instead of waiting for the actual order to adjust their prices.</p>
<p>Gas is famous for having inelastic demand and extremely competitively priced. Price changes are primarily driven by costs in this case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Grey Goose was never cheap and failing. The founder specifically branded it to create an illusion of quality to invent a luxury vodka market in America.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know a girl who loves Grey Goose and I have been unable to convince her it's over-priced. She just enjoys her drink more if she thinks it's in there. Sometimes I get her a drink with cheaper vodka and just let her think it's the goose, lol!</p>
<p>Things like alcohol people are also paying for the experience of buying and enjoying it, not only the product. You could argue the guy really did increase the value by putting it in a fancy bottle and marketing it better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But you answered the wrong question. The question was why digital is sold at a higher price than disk.</p>
<p>The reason seems to be <em>price discrimination</em>. People who want to buy digital have revealed that 1) they like the convenience of downloading, and 2) aren't interested in re-selling in the secondary market. As such, they should probably be willing to pay a premium.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>As to the question you seemed to be answering. There <em>is</em> a general tendency of the market price -&gt; marginal cost of production due to competition. </p>
<p>But the market for video games is what is called <strong>monopolistic competition</strong>. It's where producers have a monopoly on their product, but they face competition from close. but imperfect substitutes. COD and Battlefield are competing products but not the same. </p>
<p>A monopolist sets price equal to where marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost--because they need to recoup the high fixed costs associated with development. <em>This</em> is why video games, which have very low marginal costs in either disk or digital form, are sold well-above the marginal cost of production.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This is the key factor.  You are paying for the &quot;convenience&quot; of getting the product without going to the store.  Perceived benefits are very common.  You may be paying for a product that is heavier where weight or thicker where those properties don't matter but you feel better about it and so place value to it.  To some extent feeling better about it does have value but it's not as tangible as this product performs better.</p></div>		</li>
