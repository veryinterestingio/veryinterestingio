			<div class="markdown"><p>The first one sounds very doable, and I’ll definitely look into it. The second one is next to impossible I’m afraid, being that for the majority of my shift, which happens at night, I’m either required to clerk the desk for customers coming in, or make the lions share of the preparation for the upcoming day, things that the day shift couldn’t possibly fit into their schedule, such as making 40-80 sandwiches and baking the bread and stuff. The only time I can actually move is either during smoke breaks or to grab things out of the freezer/fridge</p></div>		</li>
