			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to clarify something, antifreeze is made with a different kind of alcohol called methanol which is absolutely not used in mouthwash.</p>
<p>Some *fun facts about methanol, it’s a normal byproduct of alcohol distillation and must be skimmed off the top before the good booze can be removed from the still.  Methanol will certainly get you drunk, but as your body metabolizes it it will destroy your optic nerves and cause permanent blindness.</p>
<p>Also a fun fact, typical treatment for methanol poisoning includes getting you really really drunk on ethyl alcohol (the kind we drink) to dilute it in your system.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For more fun facts, methanol is removed from ethanol by distilling at precise temperatures. The boiling point of methanol is lower than ethanol so it boils out and distills first. It's then collected as &quot;foreshots&quot; and can be found in low amounts in the &quot;heads,&quot; or first distillates, of a distillation. This precise temperature control is how distilleries remove a lot of the nasties that make alcohol taste bad (fusel oils and acetone), can give you worse hangovers (phenols), and can cause blindness (methanol).</p>
<p>This is only for small batch distillation, though. My understanding is that larger distilleries most often use a method of continuous distillation where the methanol is not removed because it is diluted to a ratio lower than it's dangerous levels. Since ethanol binds with methanol instead of methanol binding to the optic nerve, for example, it's not &quot;safe&quot;, but it's also not as dangerous.</p>
<p>Source: I was raised around home distillers and picked a few things up along the way.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A dodgy holiday drink made me go blind</p>
<p>Hannah Powell had been throwing up and felt exhausted after a night out on a bar crawl with two friends in Zante, Greece, in August 2016.</p>
<p>But it wasn't a hangover. The 23-year-old had drunk vodka that - unknown to her - had been mixed with deadly methanol.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on your comment a little, because I think this process is kind of cool, methanol by itself does not hurt you (any more than regular alcohol, anyway). What hurts you is that when your body tries to break methanol down, it breaks it down into formaldehyde and then formic acid, which is very toxic. If you had some way of preventing methanol from breaking down inside your body, you could drink a bunch of methanol and your kidneys would just eventually filter it out and you'd be fine.</p>
<p>That's where ethanol (&quot;regular&quot; alcohol) comes in: the enzymes in your body that break down methanol are the same enzymes that break down ethanol. What's more, those enzymes &quot;want&quot; to break down ethanol more. If you consume both ethanol and methanol at the same time, the enzymes will start to work on the ethanol first and most of it will get broken down before the methanol even gets touched. Meanwhile, your kidneys are working the whole time to filter it out.</p></div>		</li>
