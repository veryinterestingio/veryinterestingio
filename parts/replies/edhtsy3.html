			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel you friend. In high school for some strange reason I took both regular and AP physics then was an student aid for said physics class. Then in University I took all kinds of physics courses ranging from engineering physics to the basics of upper division classes and the whole time (7ish years of daily physics classes) angular stuff kept me up late studying. Even today I deal with it on a daily basis and nope I still hate it.</p></div>		</li>
