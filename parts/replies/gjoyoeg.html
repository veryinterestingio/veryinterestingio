			<div class="markdown"><p>I did mess up a little bit btw, in my explanation of water activity, and you probably read my unedited version. I forgot my chemistry, but basically, despite being called &quot;partial <em>vapor</em> pressure&quot;, partial vapor pressure refers to the pressure of a liquid (typically a solution). It is the pressure at the surface of the volume of a fluid where it abuts and exists in equilibrium with its vaporized form.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For example, there is a type of taste bud that senses bitterness. Sodium ions are able to bind to the parts of the food molecules that would connect to your bitter taste buds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'd just like to add that the concept of different taste buds reacting to different tastes is widely accepted as outdated by now. It's also not what is stated in the article you mentioned. They only say that sodium ions bind to bitter-taste-receptors (which are present on every taste bud).</p>
<p>Otherwise a really nice summary on a topic I often thought about but never actually researched. Kudos</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the study was hypothesizing that the ions formed from salt could interact with somatosensory receptors on a chemical level, not a physical one, but it's not very clear on this point.</p></div>		</li>
