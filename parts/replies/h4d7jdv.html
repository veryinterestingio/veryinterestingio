			<div class="markdown"><p>So here is the weird thing about shingles. It affects your nervous system. A few years ago at the ripe old age of 30, I threw out my back carrying home built server across a college campus.</p>
<p>I apparently pinched my sciatic nerve in the process. But then it got way worse all of a sudden. I lost mobility in my right leg, but the sensations would switch between feeling like my leg fell asleep, to being on literal fire (I don't mean like it just burns, I mean like it is actively SEARING as if it were being held in a flame), to feeling wet (for a while I kept worrying that I was pissing myself or bleeding), to feeling itchy like chicken pox, sometimes it would even feel like someone was tickling, pinching or grabbing me. It can be pretty freaky. </p>
<p>Then I developed a rash. </p>
<p>It turns out that somehow this also triggered shingles in me.</p>
<p>The symptoms of shingles can mimic those of sciatica. So we thought maybe it was just shingles for me and I would make a full recovery in less than a couple of months. </p>
<p>Nope it really was both at the same time.</p>
<p>5 years later and my right leg still occasionally decides to give out on me. It freaking sucks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow. That really does suck. I knew it usually happened in older adults, but 30 is very young to get shingles. Sorry about that :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got shingles on my face last year at 26, likely because my immune system was suppressed after contracting covid. Was not fun</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had shingles in my early 20's shortly after I left boot camp. Went to medical because I was having pain in my back and a rash was developing. I had no idea what was going on and the nurse that saw me before the doctor was no help. She looked at my back and said &quot;Oh yeah, looks like herpes. The doctor will be right with you.&quot;
Then when the doctor came in he looked at my back, walked out, and came back in with 3 other doctors. Once they finally left he told me I had shingles, aka herpes zoster, and he wanted to show some of the junior docs because being military doctors they rarely see it since shingles usually shows up in old people and not young soldiers and sailors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, that's exactly what did it. A doctor told me anecdotally that there has been a serious increase in younger cases in the last decade or so. He hadn't read any studies or statistics that confirmed this, but he said there had been an increase in a lot of stress and anxiety related illnesses around the same time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, I got shingles at a relatively young age and I associate it with the stress of having lost a loved one less than 2 months earlier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I also had a back injury that led to leg nerve issues, similar to yours but not quite as severe. I still have some nerve misfires around my ankle a year later but have otherwise recovered. </p>
<p>Nobody mentioned shingles, but I’m 60+ and planning to get that shot soon anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>GET IT. </p>
<p>Basically no reason not to since it's a vaccine, and the pain of shingles can be absolutely excruciating. You really don't want it if you can avoid it. Also it can only make any pre-existing neurological issues worse. </p>
<p>I am trying really hard but my insurance won't let me because of my age.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) and Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) are often triggered by viral infections, sometimes serious but sometimes the viral symptoms are mild and still lead to these debilitating conditions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's insane how we're rationalizing the death toll as it's &quot;less than 1% mortality&quot;, when there is a much much greater &quot;sick toll&quot; that isn't talked about so much.</p>
<p>More people got &quot;long covid&quot; than have died, more people are coming through this carrying debilitating medical debt (U.S mostly) and there are many hidden costs to the above which compound.</p></div>		</li>
