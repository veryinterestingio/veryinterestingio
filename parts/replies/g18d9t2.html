			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot; Even when girls got their first period at 16, they typically were not reliably fertile and able to get pregnant for a few years, meaning that first motherhood happened closer to age 18 or 20. &quot;</p>
<p>What time period are you referring to?  There doesn't seem to be a lot of research to back that up, unless you're specifically referring to children who are going through extreme hardship and malnutrition, such as during world wars and economic depressions.</p>

<p>&quot;While data is more limited, evidence from Roman Britain and medieval Spain show the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12520-017-0543-0" target="_blank">same age</a> for the onset of puberty at ten to 12 years. &quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A major change in age at first menstrual period is seen between people raised in hunter-gatherers societies (this is roughly the type of subsistence that humans had for almost the entirety of our evolutionary history) and agricultural societies (the type of subsistence almost all current humans have). The study you linked to only compared today's people with medieval European people, who were also agriculturalists. So the difference between today's agriculturalists and medieval agriculturalists isn't going to reflect the same difference seen between today's agriculturalists and prehistorical hunter-gatherers.  But a difference still existed between today and medieval Europeans, as the study you linked to says: &quot;The average age at which children entered puberty was the same as for most boys and girls today: between ten to 12 years. But medieval teenagers took longer to reach the later milestones, including menarche [first menstrual period]... The adolescent growth spurt that signals the most obvious external physical changes occurred between 11-16 years, and menarche at 12-16 years, with the average age at 15 years. In medieval London, some girls were as old as 17 before they had a period... For these teenagers, growing up in a rapidly expanding and overcrowded London, 26% had not completed puberty before they died at 25 years of age. &quot; </p>
<p>So average age of menarche today: 12.5 in England. Average age in the medieval period studied: 15.  I've seen other studies that put it at closer to 16. A significant difference. What the study also shows is that puberty happened more gradually then than it does today. So even though some initial pubertal developments are seen at age 10 or so, it is not rapidly followed by full fertility, unlike today, when we assume that if a girl is having a period, then she is fertile. It used to take several years before that child's body was able to accumulate the energy and resources to go through all of the stages of puberty. That is no longer the case, when food is so readily available. Plus there might also be a role played by environmental hormone disruptors today.</p>
<p>In any case, here's an article about hunter-gatherers that shows that there is a significant difference between age at first period [menarche] and age at first child--menarche is in such societies followed by years of suboptimal fertility, in the same pattern as children in medieval Europe took longer to go through the stages of puberty than kids do today: <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Age-of-menarche-and-the-first-reproduction-A-regression-line-and-95-confidence-limits_fig1_51589335" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Age-of-menarche-and-the-first-reproduction-A-regression-line-and-95-confidence-limits\_fig1\_51589335" target="_blank">https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Age-of-menarche-and-the-first-reproduction-A-regression-line-and-95-confidence-limits\_fig1\_51589335</a></a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Makes sense.  That clearly seems to indicate that human puberty &amp; reproduction is based on environmental &amp; nutrition &amp; social factors as much as, if not more so than, basic biology.  We're not dramatically different (genetically speaking) from our ancestors 2000 years ago.</p></div>		</li>
