<p>I miss that aspect of it . Shame it was slowly killing me and I had to quit :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can be introverted or extroverted at diff times. When feeling extroverted I can attend a loud event and put my own energy into it and just enjoy. But if I don't feel outgoing, noise and people bother me and I just want to go home and be quiet. Isolation lately isn't too terrible but sometimes I want to get out and interact with people.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The same way many introverts can stay home with a good book and not get bored.  Different people have different responses to different situations.  It's not that extroverted people like the exhaustion you feel from social interactions, it's that they don't get any exhaustion from the same interaction.</p>
<p>I'm no extravert, but I'm also not really introverted either and can happily go out to dinner with my friends and come home without it being 'a thing'.  There is no anxiety, I don't feel sick leading up to the event and look at ways to bail or escape during, and when someone talks I simply take what they say at face value and never bother to try to 'read between the lines' or worry if I've said the wrong thing etc.  Being out and talking to people doesn't take much more energy than being at home alone does.  It's not really harder (for me), just different.</p>
<p>However I remember dating as a teen and man I definitely got tired from those social interactions where all of that stuff DID happen.   I was nervous, excited, anxious and trying to pay attention to them while also monitoring my own my behaviour.  It's exhausting keeping all that up and if all your social interactions are like that then it's ALWAYS exhausting and taking breaks any way you can is reasonable.  But if you're extroverted (or even just middling like myself) then interactions aren't like that.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Huh, that's interesting to me....I'm introverted but am totally comfortable spending hours interacting with people I know (one-on-one or even in small groups), it's when I'm forced to interact with strangers that I get exhausted from the interaction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm the same. I think it's because talking to strangers requires taking mental notes of the conversation, monitoring body language and voice tones, being careful to meet social expectations of behaviour like politeness etc. Strangers require effort but with people I know we have a more shorthand way of interacting because I have an idea of their position and expectations of me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I should have clarified, I was talking one on one with coworkers, who aren't friends. I have a lot of situations where it's one on one conversations with superiors. I have one boss who will talk for over an hour and a half almost every time I walk into his office. I'm in middle management, so the conversation always starts about work, and then devolves into whatever random thought he brings up. So I have to stay focused and ready to respond at every mind numbing sentence.</p></div>		</li>
