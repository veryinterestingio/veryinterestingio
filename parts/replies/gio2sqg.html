<p>Water sticks to water, making wet things stick to wet things.</p>

<p>Water is actually both cohesive (sticks to itself) <strong><em>and</em></strong> adhesive (sticks to other things). So it's not just that water sticks to water, but that water sticks to most everything else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water is so jank.</p>
<p>Both adhesive and cohesive</p>
<p>Expands when frozen, instead of shrinking</p>
<p>Is one of the only materials that has a solid of itself that floats in itself (as in, the liquid is denser than the solid)</p>
<p>Water is the densest when at about 4 degrees Celsius </p>
<p>The fact it is even a liquid is really weird, as the two elements that make the substance are gases. (There are other examples of this, but it’s still uncommon)</p>
<p>Also, hot water freezes faster than cold water.</p>
<p>Water is weird.</p>
<p>Edit: So apparently the “Hot freezes faster than cold” is actually an urban legend and is not true. However, I’m 6/7 so point still stands.</p></div>		</li>
