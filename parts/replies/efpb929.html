			<div class="markdown"><p>I as chemistry student agree with your statements, but i have a question. Mercury has one electron more and has two full shells. Which should be even less reactive. So does the higher reactivity come only from it being liquid? Would liquid gold be more reactive than mercury? And if not why? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nitrogen is extremely reactive.</p>
<p>However, nitrogen gas is not because the nitrogen atoms are so closely bound to each other they aren't very willing to react with anything else.</p>
<p>We don't encounter individual atoms of most elements, we encounter molecules, because highly reactive atoms tend to, well, react, and thus not be individual atoms anymore.</p>
<p>Gold, as is commonly encountered, is bonded with other gold atoms. These bonds are strong and thus it is really hard to get gold to react with anything else, because you'd have to break very powerful bonds.</p>
<p>Mercury, conversely, is relatively &quot;happy&quot; with its orbitals the way they are, which means that mercury often exists in its elemental form - unlike gold, you <em>do</em> get elemental mercury, Hg(0). As a result, it is more reactive than the gold is, because the gold is already in molecular form, while mercury often isn't, so you don't have to break pre-existing bonds to get elemental mercury to react.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I respectfully take issue with several of u/TitanumDragon 's statements. </p>
<p>I agree that individual atoms of most elements are rarely encountered, with the exception of the noble gasses. Most of the other elements will be found as ions or compounds as they react to form lower energy, more favorable configurations. This is true for nitrogen: the N2 molecule has a more stable electron configuration than an N atom. I would call this the &quot;standard state&quot; for nitrogen, so I wouldn't call it extremely reactive.</p>
<p>Metals behave differently from &quot;typical&quot; compounds. There's a whole separate classification of bonding to explain how they work, and that distinctiveness is what leads to most of the interesting properties of metals like malleability and conductivity. This is the state of both metallic gold and metallic mercury. Mercury is liquid for reasons involving quantum stuff, but any time you have a contiguous mass of metal atoms they experience &quot;metallic bonding&quot;, which gives rise to certain behaviors common to all metals.
This metallic bonding breaks down when the oxidation state of the metal atom changes, which just means when electrons are puled away from the metal atoms. When this happens you get metal compounds like oxides or carbides or hydrides,but again this requires that electrons are removed from the metal atoms and that is harder when the atom was starting with a full shell.
Turns out, both mercury and gold are difficult to oxidize because of their full shell status. Not impossible, but much harder compared to more reactive metals like iron which will readily combine with oxygen to form rust. Going back to the idea of more stable configurations, gold and mercury in their atomic,metallic state already have pretty stable configurations relative to any compounds they might form. (It could be argued that mercury has a more stable electron configuration, but the details get muddy because quantum so don't worry about it) This makes both of them relatively resistant to oxidation and since chemistry involving metals usually needs them to be oxidized, they are both relatively unreactive.</p>
<p>However, because mercury is liquid at room temp and has a reasonably high vapor pressure it has much greater opportunity to interact with things like fragile meatbags. It is very hard to breathe gold and unfortunately easy to breathe mercury vapor. being a liquid Hg can get into places and will have more surface area when you contact it, so it's more likely to get into you and cause problems. Plus organomercury compounds, if you find any, are very acutely toxic and will irreversibly start you on the path to a prolonged and painful death. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mercury isn’t that toxic though.  Methyl Mercury is.  Elemental mercury is relatively benign comparatively.  Gotta think about absorption and polarity when considering any toxicity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a bit misleading. Methylmercury or any organo-mercury compound generally has a high acute toxicity, so any level of exposure is very dangerous. </p>
<p>Metallic mercury is not very acutely toxic, so it's very possible to &quot;safely&quot; handle it, play with it, what have you. It is toxic over a longer time frame, and continual exposure leads to some pretty nasty neurological effects. So it's still bad for you, just not certain-death-at-the-first-drop bad for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s why I said relatively.  Technically you could drink it without acute toxic effects... it would mostly slide right through you.  I’m studying toxicology for my PhD.  Everything is relative when you are talking about toxicity.  Mercury is talked about like it’s a death sentence to go near when it was used for years without protection throughout human history.  Same with lead.  It’s not good for you, it is toxic, it causes other symptoms before lethal doses are reached.  But most people don’t have a grasp that mercury on its own is dangerous yes, but not nearly as bad as people think.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've read that pure mercury is not absorbed easily enough into the body to be as immediate a threat as people often believe. I can't recall perfectly what I read, but I think it said something about even swallowing the stuff and not expecting a life threatening reaction. Of course mercury compounds are exceedingly deadly.</p>
<p>Is that information not accurate?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is basically accurate. Elemental mercury is not <em>acutely</em> hazardous, but it is toxic over extended periods of exposure. </p></div>		</li>
