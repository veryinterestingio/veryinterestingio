			<div class="markdown"><p>This answer makes the most sense in my mind: </p>
<p>Our noses points towards our mouths, makeing it easier to smell what we're about to put in our mouths. Pre-humans with noses towards their mouths were better at recognizing food that had gone bad by smell, which proved to be advantageous. This advantage lead to it becoming the norm.  </p>
<p>Given that evolution is not purpose driven, the other advantages of a downward nose (humidity/temp control, as mentioned in other comments) seems more like a convenient feature than the driving factor</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>could it also be we rely more on our visual and aural senses (especially when we learned spoken language) and have less of need for smell?</p></div>		</li>
