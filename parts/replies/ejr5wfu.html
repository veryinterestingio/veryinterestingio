			<div class="markdown"><p>Not in case of camels but would it be so hard for a body to evolve a special organ kinda like the stomach designed for longer or bigger water storage. Hooked up the right way it would be able so supply the body water where it needs it and would have enough storage for a day or something.</p>
<p>All though if i look at a 2 litre bottle it is quite big and it can't be compressed. So it would take up quite some space and adds a bit of bulk to your weight as you will be required to drag along 2-3 litres.</p>
<p>Bacteria and virusses might be an issue too as it might remain there a long there giving it plenty of time to grow and it might be harder for your body to clean them out.
Even your stomach can sometimes go bad if you eat the wrong thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a question. </p>
<p>A lot of folk say they're large because of their relative metabolism. That they're overweight because of a 'slow' metabolism, or that they can eat whatever they want because of a 'fast' metabolism. As i understand it, the more someone weighs the more they metabolize. That is, someone who weighs 120kg would burn more energy just <em>existing</em> than someone who weighs 60kg. But folk say they're fat because they don't metabolize as quickly as other folk do.</p>
<p>My question is: what's with that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking as an obese person, apart from the relatively few people who have glandular issues, the honest truth is that people in general really tend to underestimate what we eat. We do not intuitively understand what 100kCal looks like for various types of food and we don't instinctively visualise what our daily calorie needs are. I aim to lose 0.5kg a week and at my current weight and height that means I should eat no more than 2210kCal daily. There's absolutely no way to intuitively picture what that looks like which is why people like me really need to use apps that can track portion sizes and caloric values.</p>
<p>Lots of people buy into this &quot;listen to your body&quot; bullshit. Your body thinks you're a Paleolithic hunter gatherer one bad season away from starvation who needs all the fat and sugar you can get. Your body knows jack shit about life in a post industrial globalised food economy.</p>
<p>I apologise for the vehemence of my reply but I'm working on a serious weight loss programme (with the initial goal of just dropping from obese to overweight) and just by calorie counting and tracking the amount of everything I eat I've made decent progress (5kg in 6 weeks). Obviously I haven't hit the plateau yet but I keep repeating the above to myself so I can power through when the weight loss rate drops, as it will.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good for you.  You absolutely have the right approach and right frame of mind.  Just hang in there and you <em>will</em> lose weight.  As I think you already understand very well (I'm just reiterating for others), it's just simple math, and it's amazing how precisely you can predict your weight gain/loss if you keep track of everything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but keep in mind “good enough” leads to maximum efficiency in some cases. Several enzymes are catalytically perfect, meaning they’ve evolved to be perfectly efficient, due to high evolutionary importance </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>That is correct (in an ELI5 sense). There're probably thousands of examples (at least) of cases were evolution is not as efficient as it could be. If there is no selective pressure for efficiency, then efficiency isn't made (which you chopped off in quoting OP). </p>

<p>That is arguable.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If it was a greedy algorithm every mutation would be beneficial. But even harmful mutations can stick around; all that matters is that it isn't bad enough to prevent reproduction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, a greedy algorithm will climb to a local optimum. </p>
<p>Evolution combines this behavior (survival and reproduction of the fittest) with mutation providing random &quot;jumps&quot; to other potential optimums (though often those mutations don't provide something good and get wiped out by the first process)</p></div>		</li>
