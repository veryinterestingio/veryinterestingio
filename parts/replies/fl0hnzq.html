			<div class="markdown"><p>So, that's a complex and cool question. 'Raising in captivity' and 'domestication' are typically terms used for mammals and birds so they get us thinking about weapons in these type of animals. But we have other very cool animals with weapons that are frequently raised 'in captivity' really well. Beetles always come to mind and they respond really well to captivity - they even grow bigger horns than the ones we find in nature. The key to animal weapons is that most of them are sensitive to how well fed the animal is. If it is well fed, it will typically grow larger than average weapons.</p>
<p>TLDR: if you feed animals well, they will grow big ass weapons (most of the time)</p></div>		</li>
