<p>There is a limit to this though. The nerves that can be repaired in this way are relatively large.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And just to tie this back into your previous comment: </p>
<p>This is a large part of why major functions can often be restored, but fine motor control and sensation cannot. The major functions tend to be carried by the bigger nerves, so a mostly-good repair to that nerve will restore most of that function: but things like fine control and sensation rely on a network of smaller nerves which are not so easily repaired</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll never forget first reading about Aron Ralston in some magazine article in 2003 and he described in <em>excruciating</em> detail what it was like to cut through the median <em>(I think)</em> nerve and how it was the size of a spaghetti noodle and how it <em>jangled/buzzed</em> almost like your &quot;funny bone&quot; was exploding.  </p>
<p>He said that pretty much the entirety of removing his arm was an exercise in cutting dead meat and even breaking the bone be heaving his weight around was a relatively detached affair compared to the absolute here and now lightning bolt pain/intensity of having to cut through that wiggly little nerve...</p></div>		</li>
