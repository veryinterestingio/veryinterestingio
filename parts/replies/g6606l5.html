			<div class="markdown"><p>If the bacteria come from Earth, then this seems much more likely. Extremophiles might have been carried by a meteor impact. A lot more meteors have impacted Earth after life developed than space probes sent to Venus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This might actually mean that life started on Venus and then came to earth.  Venus was originally much closer to current-day earth in terms of environment.  And the first life on earth was Anaerobic as well.</p>
<p>So theres no reason this life couldnt have started on Venus roughly 3.5-4 billion years ago, then it got hit by a meteor and came to earth,  On Venus, all the types of life died off as conditions got harsher, but extremophiles evolved that fit the niche of that layer of atmosphere.</p>
<p>On earth eventually those microbes evolved into our branches of life we know today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't that mean that the earliest forms of life known to us should be extremophiles? Do we know what kind of conditions life on a primordial Earth could have endured?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC, it’s a lot easier physically to move outwards in the solar system than in towards the sun. Also, the solar wind blows out; maybe life arose on Venus first and came here later...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very cool information. A little off topic but if the process did work as you describe, where do you think earth would be in relation to the other life bearing planets? At 3.7 billion years, Are we old life or new life?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We’re new life if I understand your question correctly.  Earth is in one of the first 8% of planets that will ever exist in the universe meaning the universe might not be so quiet because it’s inhospitable, we might have just gotten to the party early.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However we also don't know anything about evolution speed. It took 1-2 billion years to get to a little more complex beings and get more-cell beings. </p>
<p>And even if there is life, giant dino-spiders that have a touching language won't have evolved to send anything into space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Meh 8% tries really hard to make it sound small but thats still gazillions of planets. </p>
<p>And idc how &quot;early&quot; we are in relation to the entire life of the universe, we are still several billion years behind the theoretical start.</p>
<p>Basically I'm saying &quot;we are early&quot; is a poor solution to the fermi paradox.</p></div>		</li>
