			<div class="markdown"><p>If by work you mean shifting colors away from blue, then yes, at least as best as my eyes can see. </p>
<p>If screens produce white by having all 3 colors on at the same time, then it makes sense that what should be white turns to a light peach color when I turn on the Night Shift</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does for me. The screen doesn't grab my attention as much. I have to try to focus on it. And when I start getting sleepy it gets really easy to just be like &quot;fuck it&quot; that's enough Reddit and I pass out. But I think the screen being dim also contributes greatly. Both hand in hand work well for me.</p>
<p>I also have my blue light on a schedule to turn on at 10 PM every day, even though i don't start going to bed until 11:30ish. Doing it slightly before bed helps me start getting sleepy when I need to.</p></div>		</li>
