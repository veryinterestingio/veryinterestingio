			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd also like to add on to this that you stop going through a withdrawal period.  Nicotine is a no shit powerful drunk and you taught your brain to adapt.  These physiological changes are significant and important but the brain is important too.  Some say that withdraw is so fast and so hard that that is the biggest factor. I don't know about that but it is a big change to your dome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, nicotine is generally an excitatory molecule in the brain, especially when it comes to reward-type pathways. It is an agonist for acetylcholine. Nicotine in your body acts as if you elevated acetylcholine in your blood. This can cause some short-term, then long-term changes to the receptors found on many types of neurons in your CNS. Along with the decreased level of actylcholine receptors comes a higher tolerance of nicotine. As you shock your system by ceasing to smoke, your neurons increase their number of acetylcholine receptors over time. This will have the effect of you becoming more initially sensitive to the ACh neurotransmitter but over time that will balance out to your original baseline.   </p>
<p>It's interesting that you are experiencing such a dramatic difference after a few days. Maybe you were smoking a lot beforehand.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Though I'm not sure why they right aligned the stuff on the right side after the first couple, as well as the left. You would normally want to align both around the center dividing line, so the left would be right aligned, and the right would be left aligned.</p>
<p>They left aligned the first two and then switched the alignment for some reason.</p></div>		</li>
