			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, these thoughts are called <em>intrusive thoughts</em>. 9/10 people have them. </p>
<p>In people with OCD, (the real kind, not the &quot;I like things neat and organized&quot; kind) these thoughts cause a lot of trouble due to the fact they will run through a feedback loop that isn't found in non-OCD sufferers. The brain is doing its job running through potentially dangerous scenarios, but with OCD the brain is hyperactive in these exercises and struggles to put the brakes on. The sufferer will experience greater anxiety over these thoughts than non-sufferers and can even experience meta-anxiety (being anxious over feeling anxious).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not saying this is a cure for anxiety disorders, I know they're a lot more complicated than I can provide medical advice for so you shouldn't take this as such...</p>
<p>However, certain Meditative practices focus on distancing your self from your thoughts, and eventually reaching a state, not where you don't care about them, but that you realise constantly that you are above them. At that point, intrusive thoughts are just another phenomena to observe your mind dancing over, and they become like nothing. Just another thought you know you'd never act on.</p>
<p>Sounds a bit crazy to someone not experienced in meditation, but it can be very subjectively beneficial.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have OCD and it is complete hell with intrusive thoughts, the people who claim you have it because you like to put something in like you don’t have it... you’re neat and good for you but you don’t understand the constant demon in your mind wondering about things you really don’t want you driving you to near insanity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Soooo in an ELI5 fashion these intrusive thoughts are like a normal, city car trying to brake from city speeds (healthy people stopping the thoughts), and with OCD it's like having a drag racing engine fitted into said car and trying to stop that from highway grade speeds?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, your body still lives in the stone age, where the only good calorie is the calorie inside your body, preferably stored in fat tissue, so you won't starve and your body can retain heat much better. This &quot;we have clothes, warm homes and a constant supply of high-calorie food&quot; is a very, very, very new thing (from an evolutionary point of view). This body functions evolved millions of years ago, when our early ancestors were not even an ape, while our current lifestyle is only several hundred years old (and it started around 8 thousand years ago for some, but famine was a pretty normal thing to have 3-4 hundred years ago).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Really, you can’t look objectively at your own brain. It’s just your brain having opinions on itself. </p></div>		</li>
