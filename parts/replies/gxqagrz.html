<p>Another example is human norovirus. It was first identified as a viral disease in 1968, visualized by electron microscopy shortly thereafter, cloned in 1990, but wasn’t cultured until 2016 - nearly 50 years after it was identified.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So since we’ve finally cultured it, does that put us closer to developing a vaccine for norovirus, aka the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norovirus" target="_blank">winter vomiting bug</a>?</p>
<p>I’ve been hoping for this vaccine for decades.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just checked on Wikipedia. It confirms that this cannot routinely be cultured in lab! Thanks, man. Wiki doesn't have a citation on it though? Any guesses regarding why it can't be cultured?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually when you can't grow something in a lab, you're just not getting the conditions right. The problem is, the right conditions could be so obscure that you'd never think of it. Temperature, chemical availability, host cell type, oxygen or Co2 availability, viscosity, etc. are all things you might have to keep tweaking. So the number of times you could try and fail could potentially be infinite.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most people don't know, however that could be a combination of lack of interest or need to research and that the virus is also very different from other poxviruses. Traditional means of culturing techniques do not work with it, so to research it, you often have to have live virus stored and isolated from a patient, or study its genome and each individual gene one by one for function, expression, etc.</p></div>		</li>
