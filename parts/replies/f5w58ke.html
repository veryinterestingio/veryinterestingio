			<div class="markdown"><p>Important to note for anyone wanting to buy whiteboard paint for a wall, that wall still needs to be perfectly smooth before the paint is applied. </p>
<p>Been contracted to do a few for government offices, we warn the clients it'd be cheaper and better to just buy a whiteboard but they insist on the paint. Then we give them the instructions, like waiting 72 hours before trying to use it. They almost always ignore the instructions, or don't want to pay for the needed wall prep to remove every last trace of texture. </p>
<p>Most of them have since been painted over, with normal whiteboards installed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Exactly this in a lot of offices.  They all write it off as the paint being crappy for the cost.   It is like 80 bucks for very small can if I recall.  Not cheap stuff.  Yet my whiteboard accent wall is still going strong after 5 years. </p>
<p>Not to mention the office housekeeping folks clean it with traditional sprays and not whiteboard cleaner.  Eating away at a lot of the surface over the weeks and months .</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If they really want a modern concept white board, they would by some acrylic^×× sheet and fasten it at the corners with some nice looking hex socket screws. Looks slick as hell, easily replaced, and perfectly dry erase until someone damages it. Also it can be installed by anyone who knows how to choose drywall anchors and use a drill. </p>
<p>^×× maybe Plexiglas, I think it's different than acrylic and one of the two is more resistant to solvents in the marker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a custodian, i have to say that i have never been provided with white board cleaner in 8 years of cleaning them. the closest i have ever had is window cleaner with scotch guard. Can't really clean those right if the company doesn't want to pony up the cost of bulk white board cleaner.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, you can buy 4x8’ sheets of whiteboard in the paneling aisle at the Home Depot or Lowes.  It’s much cheaper than buying whiteboards sold with a frame around them, and more convenient when covering a whole room</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My college built a brand new building and decided to go this route with their 12 new classrooms. They used the clear whiteboard paint and did 3/4 of the walls in each room spanning almost the entire wall. Professors could never completely clean the dry erase marker off of the wall or seem to know where the whiteboard paint ended so they always wrote on the actual paint. </p>
<p>It wasn’t long before they ended up replacing the whiteboard paint with Smart Boards or just plain whiteboards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back when I was an intern in college I was working on something late at night in my bosses office. I wrote a few notes down on his whiteboard and then when I went to erase them I realized that I had used a permanent marker. Oops!</p>
<p>I lucked out when I found a bottle of white board cleaner and decided to try it, the permanent marker came right off. The markers probably contain the same solvent that the cleaner uses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At the Oil companies I used to work for, pretty much every vertical surface was white metal sheets that looked like painted whiteboards.  Served two purposes - could write on them and you could use magnets to hold the very big and long seismic survey plots.  Worked great!</p></div>		</li>
