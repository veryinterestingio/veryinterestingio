			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny story about libraries. I worked at a library during college. But when it was closed (due to covid19) the only staff members that were allowed to go in were the janitors. One of the Janitors decided to dust some shelves and do some reorganizing. She reorganized the books by size rather than their LC call numbers. Turns out she has been doing that for a couple of days since closing. And when the circulation staff go back, they have to reshelve hundreds of books.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny how the brain works. Instead of a strict decimal system to track every item, each item is referred to several others for indexing. </p>
<p>The memory for “I need milk at the store” is indexed with, “we want pancakes for breakfast tomorrow” but also, “my son wanted choccy milk and it’s all gone now” but also, “I like choccy milk mmmm” and somehow, “it’s cheaper at Wegmans than Safeway” combined with “there’s a picture of milk next to the milk”.</p></div>		</li>
