			<div class="markdown"><p>Iceland is both. There is an Icelandic plume, which is sat beneath the ridge. This is why Iceland is there at all as a landmass, otherwise it would be just like any other section of mid-ocean ridge (i.e. submarine). </p>
<p>This is part of the reason Iceland has such cool and varied geochemistry.</p></div>		</li>
