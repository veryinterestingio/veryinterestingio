			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Larger animals have a slower metabolism, which means they require less energy to function.&quot;</p>
<p>That goes against everything I've ever heard or known about animals. Don't larger animals eat a lot more food? Sure maybe per pound it's less food than a rodent, but like, an elephant eats a lot more than a lion I'm guessing, and a lion eats a lot more than a honeybadger, and a honey badger eats more than a squirrel etc. Please correct me if I'm wrong</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. It’s relative. Larger animals require less energy per volume. They are more efficient. Though their overall requirement of energy is higher compared to a small animal. Their relative consumption of energy is a smaller % of their body mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to add to what the other replies said.</p>
<p>While yes your metabolism is slower, you can also store a lot more food, so a small animal finds a meal, they eat, then they have to find another meal.</p>
<p>A big animal can find a meal and eat it, and has more time to find their next meal</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pound for pound large animals are more efficient due to what the original comment outlined, partially.</p>
<p>Small animals tend to have high metabolisms and require more consistent influx of nutrients and calories.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, so MORE EFFICIENT makes sense to me. I struggled with understanding why larger mass didn't equal larger amounts of food for fuel, but if they utilize the smaller amounts of food more efficiently, I can understand that. I asked in another comment, but you may be able to answer me on this. For humans it's generally more food for a larger person. Is this because we are less efficient due to more access to food? I know that people universally don't always have access to unlimited food ( financial ability, government aid, places to grow food yourself could effect it) so are people more efficient, generally, when there is less access? Or are humans overall less efficient? I know this is kind of a broad question, but I'd be interested in your answer, if you have one!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But animals in the deep ocean (and marine animals in general, with the exception of mammals, birds, and a handful of fish) don't retain heat.  They stay at exactly the same temperature as their environment.  It's hard for marine animals to retain heat because it's generally lost quite quickly through the gills.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Certain processes can have a soft limit on how large an animal can get, and it always comes down to the specific animal.</p>
<p>A few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When you grow larger your size and mass dont grow at the same rate. This means you become too heavy for your bones and muscle at some point (this is largely relevant to land animals)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What about heat? Again, body mass grows faster than surface area. So how do you cool down a body that has so much more mass but only little surface area for external cooling?</p>
</li>
<li>Oxygen: You can get so large that the process that supplies oxygen to your organs simply cant keep up. (simplified: the blood vessels become so long, that the blood doesnt have any oxygen left at some point)</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are only a few examples. And its not to say that these problems are <em>impossible</em> to overcome. Evolution could always find mechanics to overcome this. But there might just not be enough selective pressure for these things to happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Smaller animals having a higher ratio of surface area to volume = less efficient body cooling and heating - so it’s actually more advantageous and energy efficient to be big than small. </p>
<p>The bigger you are, the lower your SA:V, the less you lose/gain heat.</p>
<p>Compared to a big animal in 100 degree weather, a small animal will get hot faster and expend more energy to cool down</p></div>		</li>
