			<div class="markdown"><p>Just adding here since its relevant. I have an incurable eye condition called Keratoconus, it's basically the surface of my eyeball is uneven so light doesn't enter my eye correctly and causes double vision/blurriness. The only treatment at the minute is to stop it getting worse.</p>
<p>My eye doctor told me in a majority of cases it happens from people rubbing their eyes too much.</p>
<p>Edit: Just adding for those curious, the way I always describe it to people is imagine someone rubbed vasaline on your eyeball.... That's what my vision is like, that smeary, greasy mess.</p>
<p>Luckily I only have it in one eye and it happened to be my left so my right (dominant eye) basically convinces my brain to largely go by the right side vision instead so I can still drive fine. It does however affect me on my far left side vision where my right eye wouldn't cover.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP, but they may be asking about the allergy symptom of itchy eyes. I know this time of year I'll get a tingle in the inside corner of my eye and when I rub it, it feels sublime. I want to keep rubbing indefinitely,  but when I stop there is a strange feeling in the eye that remains until I start rubbing the eye again. I have to force myself to stop, as eye rubbing is inevitably followed by mild inflammation, a runny nose, and congestion. OTC allergy medicine stops all of this.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I hate it because when I start I can't stop, but the tissue eventually feels like its been rubbed raw.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have not had that symptom before, that's interesting. I imagine it's because whatever you're allergic to is irritating your eye and surrounding tissue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's histamines, which is your body's response to the allergen. Allergies are an overreaction of your immune system to an innocuous foreign object. The histamines help the blood vessels transport white blood cells and the immune system's chemicals but they also make the local area super itchy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get the exact same thing as you! But also because rubbing your eyes releases more histamine so therefore more allergy symptoms so donâ€™t rub!! It makes it worse literally!</p></div>		</li>
