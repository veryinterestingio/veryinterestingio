			<div class="markdown"><p>Let me see if I got this right...so our brains left to their own devices would just concoct infinitely random ideas bound by nothing, but our sensory experiences shape and limit them to things that make sense given the physical reality we’re currently in?</p>
<p>That makes “lucid dreaming” seem so much less interesting somehow...like forcing your brain to color in the lines when it could be doing its own thing. Does it also explain why the dreams we have/remember are ones that match our own conscious experiences kind of closely?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1st paragraph: that's how i understand the quote. I studied visual perception and theory of the mind in uni and this vibes with our (still very much inconclusive) understanding of perception. You can prove this to yourself by going into a sensory dep chamber and watching your mind's perception without the direction or restraint of the senses. This intrinsic functional state (which validates all perception) is also why your nervous system responds to trauma regardless of whether it is seen, visualized, or hallucinated. Perception is always experienced as perception, and when dealing with ptsd you learn that only by acknowledging false perception as such is it consciously separated, and your nervous system does not differentiate between the two. </p>
<p>Your point about lucid dreaming is really cool!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To me, it helps to think of the brain as a system that's always moving, evolving, and constantly updating a model, as far as perception is concerned. The system has to take in inputs to produce some kind of output. The input could be the electric signals from our eye's cone cells, or they could be from other sources, i.e., internal. I think the system takes in all these inputs and processes them, produces an output, creates a &quot;new&quot; version of the model, and compares it to the &quot;older&quot; and current version of the model, and updates/matches it as needed.</p>

<p>Somebody in the comments here pointed out how PTSD can have everlasting effects on our perception, for example, seeing a traumatic scene that's happened in the past. I think that scene was so abrupt that it left a stamp on the mind, which is so impactful, that it's taken in as input into the perception system. As such, the output, the newer model, aka the perception itself, is corrupted with input that shouldn't have been there, causing people to see the traumatic scene overlapping reality.</p>

<p>I think the allegory of the cave kinda covers this  too. Basically, the people in the cave could only see 'reflections' on the wall due to a fire behind them, ever since they were born. That's all they knew. Then they found an exit from the cave, saw the sun, and the world outside, and they couldn't believe it. They saw the 'reflections' for what they really were, instead of assuming them to be living things. At that point, the system had updated its model to include the new input, namely the sun, the outside world, etc.</p></div>		</li>
