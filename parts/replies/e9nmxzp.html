<p>If you do it to polystyrene, like a CD jewel case,  (not the aerated or expanded PS stuff we use as computer packaging) or acrylic then you can easily see crazing in action. As in if you flex it enough the PS will shatter like glass. A small crack will cause a spider web to spread out from the fracture point. This is the same thing in other, softer thermoplastics, only on a microscopic scale. </p></div>		</li>
