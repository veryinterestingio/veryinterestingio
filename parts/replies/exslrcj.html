			<div class="markdown"><p>Your vestibular system actually gets used to rotation, though, so constant rotational speed will stop feeling like a spin after a while. This has actually caused pilots to crash many times in history from thinking they aren't in a turn.</p>
<p>But when she's moving her arms and legs and breathing heavily, the moment of inertia and center of mass are changing her rotation axis and speed, so the above doesn't apply. Of course the centrifugal stretching is still a thing either way. But Coriolis effects only occur in the inner ear if your rotation isn't constant because a rigid body only spins about one axis... with one sort of possible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_racket_theorem" target="_blank">exception</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It sounds like we need to define what &quot;the spinning sensation&quot; is</p>
<p>If the spinning sensation is just dizziness from the vestibular system, we can say it stops after a while</p>
<p>If the spinning sensation includes the feeling that a force is pulling your various body parts outwards, the answer is no</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the same thing I got from OP's question as well. That is to say, &quot;is Sandra Bullock spinning as a universal truth, or is she only spinning in relation to everything else?&quot; Or to put it another way, &quot;if she closes her eyes, is Sandra Bullock actually motionless while the universe spins around her?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's really, &quot;is her endolymph moving relative to her semicircular canal?&quot; Or to put it another way, &quot;are the inner ear organs telling her brain she's spinning?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Though this is all true, astronauts have reported that they often lose their sense of spinning while in space. It appears that some of the physiological effects on zero gravity--probably the blood pooling in the head--interferes with the function of the inner ear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><strong>I'm not 100% on this, but</strong> what it <em>sounds like</em> is the mind adjusting to the new sensations of the otolith in the inner ear. The otolith contributes to a lot of sensory illusions, including the one where Navy pilots taking off from a carrier feel like they're suddenly tumbling backwards even though they're being pushed forwards.</p>
<p>In space, the otoliths don't not rest in the normal positions -- there's no &quot;down&quot; for it to reference as normal -- so the slightest linear acceleration likely causes a similar sensation to what the carrier launch pilots feel in whichever direction.</p></div>		</li>
