			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxYTj2Mi0ro" target="_blank">Here's a video showing</a> how they take the skin from the donor area. WARNING. This video is a medical procedure. It does show open wounds, and blood, and stuff like that. If this sort of thing makes you squeamish, probably best you don't watch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for that. It was very informative. I would, however, like to express my inner monologue while watching that procedure. It went something like this: &quot; AAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUGHHH AUGGAAAHHD NNNNNGGGG AHHHHHHH! AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!&quot;</p>
<p>Is that a natural response? Do surgeons have to get used to this sort of thing or do they just not have that response in the first place?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cool video. </p>
<p>It seems to me like they cut quite deep in the video. Is that really required? Would this heal with little to no problems? Maybe our skin is thicker than I imagined..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The most interesting part to me is the mesher (not sure if that's the technical term). I received a split-thickness skin graft harvested from my thigh and transferred to my forearm. The scar at the harvest site is about 1” x 5”, and the graft is about 2-1/2” x 6”.</p>
<p>My layperson’s understanding is that the skin was perforated in a mesher before transfer. This allowed it to bond by allowing scar tissue to rise through the perforations and secure it in place like rivets AND let it stretch, covering more area. The resulting graft looks a bit like raw chicken skin, covered with a pattern of lighter colored spots. </p>
<p>Surgeons out there-is this understanding accurate?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Finally a topic I know something about.  Plastic surgeon here. </p>
<p>First terminology:
Graft: tissue moved from one place of the body to another without a specific blood supply
Flap: tissue moved that maintains it's blood supply.
Free flap/vascularized tissue transfer: tissue with blood supply that has its blood supply cut and anastomosed to artery and vein in the recipient site using microsurgery</p>
<p>The question is based on what is at the base of the wound and the goals of reconstruction. If there are critical exposed structures that will not heal without vascularized tissue (tendon without paratenon, bone without periosteum, blood vessels, nerves) you need healthy tissue in top. With no exposed structures you can frequently get away with dressing changes or vac therapy followed by skin grafting. </p>
<p>Certain trouble areas generally require flap coverage rather than grafting. Things like massive apr defects... Just because they don't heal well unless well vascularized tissue are placed at the site. The distal third of the leg has a paucity of lax tissue for rearrangement so this also frequently needs free flap coverage. </p>
<p>Because free vascularized tissue transfers are becoming common and easier, we go to this option more often than historically. We also use it to obliterate dead space. After a massive tumor resection there's open space in the body. These tend to fill with fluid (seroma) and create chronic non healing wounds or infection. We can move muscle or other flaps into these spaces to prevent this. </p>
<p>We also use free flaps for other fancy things. For example in a patient with facial paralysis you can transplant the gracilis muscle with it's nerve to the face, hook up the artery, vein, and nerve, and the patient (with therapy) will learn to fire that muscle for animation. </p>
<p>Integra is a bilayer material made from bovine collagen and shark glycosaminoglycans. You can place it at trouble wounds and occasionally avoid major surgery by seeing if the wound need responds. Free flaps are 6-12 hours so if you can avoid it, prob better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very informative thank you. So regarding the removal of large items such as tumours and the resulting empty space; do you just <em>shove</em> any old tissue in there such as muscle or skin? Inside the body? Or am I misunderstanding. I have an image of just tossing things in a hole and stitching it up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have seen several responses asking if excess skin from massive weight loss can be transplanted/donated for use. It would seem like this is a good alternative for burn victims but a quick google search revealed little except that there are difficult obstacles to overcome which make it an uncommon practice. </p>
<p>Could you explain why skin donation/transplants are not readily used?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is cadaveric skin. However the body does not incorporate it, is only temporary, and it eventually needs to come off. It is used for temporary coverage of huge wounds that you cannot harvest enough skin for from the actual patient. For example, in big burn patients you need to excise very large burns but are left with large wounds that need to be covered so that the patient doesn’t get infections or lose tons of fluid through open wounds. You harvest as much skin as you can to cover the wounds, and put cadaveric skin on the rest. Come back later when the donor sites have healed so you can continue doing definitive grafting.</p>
<p>Pain is not usually too bad. Split thickness skin grafts hurt more than full thickness because the nerve endings are still present in the exposed dermis, but it’s like a bad road rash.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m a burn survivor. They literally just explained it.</p>
<p>Said “I know it sounds a little weird, but” and we just trusted them. “Sure, whatever, fix me and don’t let me die plz”. </p>
<p>When you have deep enough burns for this sort of thing, trust me, there are a lot more things to be concerned about!</p>
