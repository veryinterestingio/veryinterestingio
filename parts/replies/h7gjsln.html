			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm astounded by the amount of effort and manual labor put into repairing a single tire. You could've said this was an instruction video of how tires were repaired back in the 50s and I would've believed you.</p>
<p>Do they really do this today? I would've thought there was just some machine which does 90% of the work for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am guessing because the use of such tires is limited and the inherent sturdiness of such tires is high doing it manually is easier and cheaper. machines are great at doing the same kind of task many, many times. Repairing this kind of tire seems to require an individual approach</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you can! It’s called rubberized asphalt. But the total use of shredded tires in all construction applications (there’s more ways to use them than just pavement) only works out to about 8% of the tire production.</p></div>		</li>
