<p>It typically also happens vastly more in compound lifts, as a lot of the time the &quot;shudder&quot; is due to compensation and balance (as this is where the errors in recruitment are most likely to happen as explained in top post). You're much less likely to get a shudder on machine lifts.</p></div>		</li>
