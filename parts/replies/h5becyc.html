			<div class="markdown"><p>It cam be, in fact contagious cancer is what plagues Tasmanian Devils. It only happens in very particular circumstances though, such as a species being highly inbred. This would make it more likely the proteins marking a cell as yours are similar to someone else's. </p>
<p>Another is that the cancer actually inhibits the expression of those surface proteins somehow, thus invisible to the immune system. This is the leading hypothesis on Tasmanian Devil cancer's contagious nature</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, dogs are not strictly inbred and they also have a contagious cancer. As do chickens.</p>
<p>And as do we. As someone else said, HPV is the most common cause of cervical, throat, and penile cancer. And infection is the most common cause of stomach cancer.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In a organ transplant the recipient is taking immunity suppression therapy to prevent organ rejection and if that organ donar had undiagnosed cancer the recipient can contract cancer from the foreign cancer cells</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No the DNA, or at least the surface proteins expressed by the cells do play a role. Your immune system is tuned to attack and destroy foreign cells, its why people with organ transplants typically have to take immune suppressants for the remainder of their lives or risk the organ being destroyed by the immune system.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what the science has said about if foreign cancer cells can spread in people taking immune suppressants, but without those suppressants your body would certainly destroy them.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Not certainly, or there wouldn't be cancer. Cancers already tend to initiate an immune response, and are only able to thrive if they escape the immune system, or its impacts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your cancer cells can escape your immune system because its the same cells as your body, your body knows not to attack itself, so cancer cells arent recognized by the foreign body detecting processes. When your immune system does detect and attack cancer cells, its because the cells exhibit some behavior that triggers certain processes evolved to combat cancer, and sometimes you get a cancer cell that manages to bypass all these triggers and thus can spread. The immune system has to recognize that a cell belonging to your body isn't behaving normally, which is tricky, and can be defeated with the right combo of mutations.</p>
<p>On the other hand your body is really good at detecting foreign objects, so if i were to inject my cells into you, whether cancerous or not, your immune system would detect it as foreign and destroy it. Your cancer cells don't have to deal with the foreign detection triggers in your body. I have a colleague that implants cancer cells into mice for study, it only works in a specific breed of mice which has no functional immune system, because mice with a functional immune system would destroy the cancer upon implantation. Human cancer cells are treated as safe to work with and are very common in many labs (like HeLa cells), if i could just breath some in, or accidentally stick some into my body and get cancer, it wouldn't be considered a safe material to work with.</p>
<p>As an analogy, when you get cancer, its like having an employee quietly stealing office supplies, if they do it subtly, they can get away with it. On the other hand if that employee went over to some other office and started stealing supplies, people would be wondering why this random person that doesn't work there is showing up at their office space, and will probably immediately confront them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But cancers ability to normalize its antigen presentation is the big reason it can evade long enough to proliferate. The thousands of cancerous cells we make in a day normally do their normal thing, flag themselves and are killed by NK. It's when one fails to present thats the issue. </p>
<p>The normal response to cancer is exactly the same as to a foreign organ, cancerous or not.</p></div>		</li>
