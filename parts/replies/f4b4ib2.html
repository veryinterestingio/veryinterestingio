			<div class="markdown"><p>For sure, it is important to remember climate models are an 'as best we know'. The complexities of the natural world are far more tangled than our current understanding and computing power can even start to fully comprehend. We can see symptoms quite easily but the causative driver is rarely a single source.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a geologist, what's your opinion on Randall Carlson's work and his ideas about a meteor strike in Greenland, and how that affected the ice sheets that covered North America, which in turn caused sea levels to rise.  Some of the dry falls and other imprints left behind on the coast of Washington are pretty spectacular!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://sites.google.com/a/bates.edu/sea-wall-project/_/rsrc/1456247180991/home/introduction-to-coastal-processes/climate-change-and-sea-level-rise/IPCC%20sea%20level.jpg" target="_blank">Sea levels had been rising fast thousands of years before</a> this proposed impact and the Younger Dryas event. I'm not sure how confident we can be about shorter periods given uncertainty in the data but much of it actually suggests the Younger Dryas was associated with the onset of a slower rate of sea level rise. That makes intuitive sense because the cooling of the high latitude Northern Hemisphere is likely to have temporarily halted or even reversed the deglaciation trend in that region, which was the source of most of the ice melt causing the eventual 120m deglacial sea level rise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good to see a person of science recognize the population is a growing problem.  Every single person we add increases the environmental impact either directly or indirectly (looking at you &quot;carbon neutral&quot; people because there's currently no such thing in a modern world) not to mention that short of a revolution in the way we produce food, both meat and veggies, we're looking at a potential crisis.</p></div>		</li>
