			<div class="markdown"><p>The way the light gets bent depends on a) the incoming angle theta1 and b) the two refractive indices of the two materials n1 and n2.
You can then calculate the outgoing angle via Snell's Law:</p>
<p>sin(theta2)/sin(theta1) = n1/n2</p>
<p>You have to do this twice for each ray, once for when it enters the lens, the other for when it exits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh so I can't really tell from the diagram itself unless we know the refractive index of the lens and air? (air's according to google is 1.0003)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So in <a href="http://electron6.phys.utk.edu/optics421/modules/m2/images/mfocus.gif" target="_blank">this</a> diagram, why is that the ray bends inwards when going from air to glass, and then bend further inwards when going from glass to air? Shouldn't they bend in the opposite direction when exiting the lens?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Draw the three important ones first. <em>Really</em> you only need any two of them to get the intersection point; the third is more like a sanity check. </p>
<p><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/YbvbDCZe5GUQBAxg9GSfQuMgsLMidex276W8uZFITRmRAqiAFQzWRQAsYORNid35CsGkOtck2bc9so79O4QbVbVI97cSAMLSwC8ZMQKU0_tBtJVtdI3B4Hg" target="_blank">Here is an image of just those three</a>.</p>
<p>Once you have that intersection point, you know that all other rays emitting from the <strong><em>same point</em></strong> will end up passing through that intersection. Draw a straight line from the source point to the mid plane of the lens - any line will do, doesn’t matter where it hits the lens. And then from the mid plane, continue that line straight to the intersection point.</p>
<p>The second “busier” image from my original post shows how you can map various points on an object.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Refraction happens when light crosses the intersection of materials with different refractive indexes. In this case, from air to the surface of the lens, and from the surface of the lens back to air. Inside the lens and through the air, the light travels straight.</p>
<p>The angle of the surface relative to the light determines how far the ray of light will bend. The lens has a curve so that light hitting the outside edge of the lens bends more than light hitting near the center. This the spherical shape of a lens bends all the rays towards a point.</p>
<p>Many diagrams use a <a href="https://www.opto-e.com/basics/lens-approximations-and-equations" target="_blank">thin lens approximation</a> of a real lens, which doesn't actually show how the light truly bends. In OP's post, the first two diagrams are thin lens approximations, the last one is a real lens.</p>
<p>As a general rule, any single element that focuses light down to a perfect point is going to be a thin lens approximation. In the real world, single lenses lenses have circular aberration like the 3rd example, where light focuses at different distances depending on where it enters and exits the lens. I'm not sure if there are aspheric elements that can solve that problem. I haven't studied them enough.</p>
<p>Camera lenses use multiple elements to try to correct for all these aberrations. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooke_triplet" target="_blank">cooke triplet</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-Gauss_lens" target="_blank">Double gauss</a> are the simplest designs I'm aware of that do a reasonable job of controlling aberration. They are by no means perfect, but they perform well relative to the number of elements and complexity.</p></div>		</li>
