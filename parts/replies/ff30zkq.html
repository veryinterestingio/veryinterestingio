			<div class="markdown"><p>That last part actually isn't true. Theoretically all wiring in your home acts as small horribly designed capacitors (two wires at different voltage potentials running parallel to each other). Because AC involves the voltage difference constantly changing electrons must to always moving back and forth through the wiring in your home. This uses up electrical energy and could (in theory) be measured by the electric meter. However it's probably too small to be detected. (someone who understands the math could probably calculate uA/ft or whatever, but that's above my abilities)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are talking about reactive power, which is when AC current is out of sync with AC voltage. The flow of electrons charging and discharging a capacitor when hooked up to an AC power source is one way to cause this phenomenon. Reactive power is different from real power, as reactive power does not actually waste energy (when all transmission lines are perfectly conductive at least). </p>
<p>Electric companies don't charge residential customers for reactive power, but they will charge industrial customers for it, since large draws of reactive power can put a lot of unnecessary load on transmission lines, which will in turn waste real power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, he is right, because the wires are not ONLY capacitors, they are also resistors. And as resistors, they dissipate actual power when current flows back and forth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At 60 Hz the losses are so low that they are unmeasurable by a utility electric meter. For a discussion about household energy consumption they can be neglected so I decided not to mention it. At megahertz frequencies it would be measurable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's somewhat relevant on large scales(transmission lines). Over long distances HVDC is more efficient for that reason.</p></div>		</li>
