			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve been growing mine out since quarantine started since I don’t care what I look like. I’ve never let it grow out before because it looks patchy/terrible at the start. 3months in and it still look pretty bad lol. But also idk how to groom facial hair since I’m usually baby faced.</p></div>		</li>
