			<div class="markdown"><p>Another important point is that these resistors generate a ton of heat that needs to be dissipated. Consider that an &quot;ultra fast&quot; charger is 200 kW. Meanwhile, a Tesla P100D outputs up to 440 kW (589 hp), and it can brake faster than it accelerates meaning the effective braking power is higher than 440 kW. </p>
<p>So, even with the battery charging at 200 kW under regen braking most of the braking power under an emergency stop condition would need to be wasted to heat. For a car it's simpler and more reliable to waste this heat directly to the brakes instead of through the powertrain.</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_current_brake" target="_blank">Eddy current brakes</a> can get around that issue by lowering an electromagnet until it almost touches the tracks. The magnet will then induce eddy currents in the metal of the tracks which slows the locomotive down while dumping the resulting heat into the rails instead of heating up the brakes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>in and of yourself you are right. However, the problem with eddy current brakes is that the tracks have to be prepared beforehand for their use, since the heating and thus the expansion of the rail has to be compensated. In addition, the signaling technology must be designed in a way that the currents do not interfere with the Signalling equipment.</p>
<p>For example, there are exactly two routes in Germany where this braking method may be used in regular operation. Both are new High Speed lines that were designed for those conditions from the very start. there are many routes where the eddy current brake may be used as a support for the main braking system, but only for emergency braking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also some systems allow the power to be put directly back into the track as electricity. Effectively one train slowing down helps another train to accelerate.</p>
<p>Dumping the power as heat is incredibly wasteful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent point, a regen brake capable of stopping a vehicle would not be able to convert the energy fast enough (unless just to heat like conventional brakes) and would be innefective as speeds decrease. </p>
<p>Maybe a hybrid system? So add some super fast charging capacitors that absorb what the battery charger can't, then as speeds drop to a level where regen becomes innefective as a brake, dump that energy into the motor (or specialised braking motors per wheel?) in the reverse direction. So active rather than passive electromagnetic braking, that powers itself as much as possible for a short period of time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Under Ideal Circumstances most electric European Freight Locomotives are Capable to generate Up to 240 kN of Braking Force. But this only works within a certain range of Speed. </p>
<p>Most Electric Brakes however Cut Out at five to eight kilometers per Hour. Still, even slowing down to that Speed using only the E-Brake takes considerable Time. Thats Why Freight Locomotives still need a Main Braking system. (Additionaly there are some Situations where the E-Brake can Not bei used, but that would be top complicated to explain, aus IT depends on the Kind of Loco and in the Rules of the Country)</p>
<p>That being Said, there are some Modern EMUs which use the Electric Brake as the Main Braking system. But still: the E-Brake Cuts Out a certain Speed, mostly at 20 to 10 kph. Then an auxilliary Braking system is used to come to a complete halt (for an example, the Parking Brake or a smaller dimensioned pneumatic Brake, or, of the Drivetrain has Gears, a Gear Brake)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a freight engineer I appreciate this comment. Most newer engines, dynamic braking is pretty effective until speeds as low as 3mph, older the noticeable cutoff is 10mph. Any chance you know the difference between DC dynamics, and AC dynamics? The only difference i know if I like AC engines a LOT better lol.</p></div>		</li>
