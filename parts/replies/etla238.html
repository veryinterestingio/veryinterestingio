			<div class="markdown"><p>You ever drop a chunk of dry ice into water?</p>
<p>The fog sinks, both because it's colder than air, and because CO2 is denser than air. </p>
<p>CO2 levels are also slightly elevated at the soil surface (and even more below ground), both because CO2 sinks and because plant root respire, consuming oxygen and releasing CO2.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. There is another post in this thread that explains atmospheric gases in normal concentrations better than I can.</p>
<p>But global CO2 concentration is 400 ppm. CO2 isn't threatening your life until about 40,000ppm. So even if that were the case, you would never know.</p></div>		</li>
