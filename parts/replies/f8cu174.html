<p>Because all we can feel. We can't feel absolute temperature, only the degree at which we lose or gain heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Remember this - comfort in your house/apartment has to do with relative humidity not the temperature. The closest to 50% RH your space is the comfortable it will be. Ex: 76 F and 50% RH feels much better than 72 F and 60-65% RH. </p>
<p>Learn how to dehumidify with your AC in the summer and get a humidifier for the winter to get close to 50% RH. 50% RH is also where most viruses and bacteria DO NOT thrive - <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/S9JGrzK" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/gallery/S9JGrzK</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. </p>
<p>The temperature you set is the temperature you want the room to be at. The AC will put out cold air until it reaches that temperature--<em>not</em> that-temperature air.</p>
<p>There's some leeway with that. Car air conditioners, for example, generally do allow you to control the temperature of the air directly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Them: It’s hot in here, turn the thermostat down. </p>
<p>Me: The A/C has been running nonstop since we turned it down this morning. It won’t make any difference. </p>
<p>Them: Just turn the dammed A/C down!</p>
<p>Me: <sigh> &lt;tap, tap, tap&gt;</p></div>		</li>

<p>I miss when they did. All the new cars have moved to an ambient temperature setting now. In all my old cars, I could set the air to exactly how I wanted it to blow. My current car blows air at whatever temperature it feels like blowing at that moment, and is dependant on what the outside temperature is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, while the first part of your answer is correct, the second is not. It was one of the most brain boggling things to learn for me when I started as a car AC engineer that the numbers on the dials influence your cars temperature, but do not define them. If your AC is blowing full tilt on a hot summers day, the air exiting the AC will have 4-6 °C, even if the dial is set to 22°C.
Furthermore the amount of sun etc. will influence that temperature even more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually the furnace or air conditioner is either on or off. If it’s on it’s on full blast. There is a thermostat somewhere and the unit operates until the thermostat reads the right temp then turns off until the thermostat temperature triggers it to turn back on. </p>
<p>If the room is 26C and you turn on the AC it won’t cool faster if it’s set to 24 or 18 it will just stay on longer at the low temp.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your registers usually blow about 20 degrees hotter or colder than the temperature at the return. So if your house is 76 and you turn on the aircon, the registers should be putting out air at 56 degrees. This is called the delta T.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't get why AC units even <em>have</em> both heating and cooling modes when they also have temperature gauges. Like, can you not just enter 25° and ask it to <em>either</em> heat or cool as required in order to reach that temperature?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're really talking about the thermostat itself. Cheaper ones don't have an auto mode, sometimes. There's nothing inherent to any forced air system that makes it incapable of doing that, at least not when it comes to usual comfort cooling.</p></div>		</li>
