			<div class="markdown"><p>No the event is people wanting to buy or sell stock, or maybe facilitate a takeover event. The stockbroker is a third party that will help buy up stock or they can act as a middleman in the event that a company wanting to sell stock needs the authority of several members. Insider trading would be like if the manufacturer of an item on the menu went and paid people to go order it to make it look more appealing to customers. Or if they deliberately messed up the recipe because they knew they were about to get a new job at a rival bakery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You ever heard about Eike Batista? The Brazilian who once was in the top10 richest in the world? He was known as the trade king, but all he did was basically this you just described: he would tell a large amount of people that one specific stock was about to drop, and everyone would take their money out of that stock, which would actually make it drop. Same would happen on the other way: he told people that one stock would go up, and people would buy that. That's one of the two basic ways he made a fortune.</p>
<p>The other one: he had several companies on his name, the most remarkable was one in petrol sector. I think it was OGX. They were basically like a Petrobras, Shell or Texaco: seeking for oil to extract and investing money in its extraction. Point being... Try to look up how much oil this company actually extracted. It's close to 0. They would made promises about found oil, spend some money on research and equipment, say they would start pumping out that oil in X amount of time, and keep giving promises, until one day the investors started questioning where TF is the promised oil.</p>
<p>Now put all that together with corruption scandals in which he was directly involved, and that's how he was brought to the light and, maybe, the only reason why he couldn't keep with the lies. I truly believe that if wasn't for the fact that he was deep involved in the corruption scandals (Brazilian politics, you know...) and shown so often in the television for it, also because his son was a moron who drank and drive, running over and killing a man with a very expensive car, if not for all this, he would still be top10.</p>
<p>Just one fun fact before I post: he got he's cars confiscated while being prosecuted, and the judge was spotted driving one of his cars, I think it was a Porsche Cayenne. IIRC, the judge was sentenced to... Retirement. With full benefits and keeping his salary. Things you might only see here...</p></div>		</li>

<p>Say you're a c level exec at CMG. You find out that ecoli killed yen people. No one knows yet. If you trade based on that information you're commiting insider trading.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The crazy thing is people are definitely trading like that.. and nothing happens to them. Had a company president take out all his stocks in the company right before we launched new software. The launch was a disaster and of course our stocks tanked. Why wouldn’t he be in trouble? It was clearly insider trading - so what evidence do they need to definitely prove insider trading, as it seems easy enough to say “oh well I didn’t make a decision based on THAT, I did it for unrelated reasons”.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;High, tech support? Yeah, I meant to buy 5,000 shares but I apparently fat-fingered it and bought 500,000, and the transaction was approved. This was two hours ago, I just caught it. Can you reverse the sale please? ... What do you mean 'no'?&quot;</p></div>		</li>
