			<div class="markdown"><p>If such a thing actually exists. Of course, there are jobs that don't require emotional labour, such as factory jobs, but that would be something different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it's hard to find jobs that have ZERO emotional labor.  Most jobs where you interact with the public expect certain emotional displays.  Jobs where you only interact with coworkers/internal members may require some emotional effort, but it's not necessarily a job requirement in the same way.  Notably in our representative sample of the US population of employees, 54% of the 3,000 sample had daily contact with the public, and 13% had some contact with the public, all of which with emotional labor expectations.  So it was only about 1/3rd without those expectations (jobs like computer analyst, assembly line worker, cook, janitor).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fair point. Yes, people can meet the expectations of &quot;service with a smile&quot; by simply showing positive moods.  Some days this is easier than others, of course.  Most of us, even those of us who are extraverted and generally positive people, likely feel fatigued or frustrated at times so may still need to act in some interactions.
Notably, another acting approach is to do &quot;deep acting&quot;.  Rather than putting on a fake mask (surface acting), deep acting refers to cognitive strategies that change one's feelings (like focusing on positive things, perspective taking) to be more aligned with the requirements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice to meet you and thanks for sharing your experience. Your point about psyching yourself up for the day - only to find it more difficult as your work changes - really resonates, and I don't think you're alone on this. Broadly, the acting strategies are thought of as ways employees report trying to meet those emotional demands of their job to company outsiders, but they don't necessarily solve the root of the problem. In customer service, this is often not feeling &quot;friendly&quot; in the first place. </p>

<p>I agree that employer compassion for employees would probably go a long way to making sure this emotional labor is easier, but in many cases I'd say employers don't see the incentive to make it easier. For example, jobs that require more emotional demands tend to be low paying (Glomb et al., 2004). In studying emotional labor, we find that work- or company-level solutions can help employees. There's evidence that your point about &quot;building a diverse culture of unique individuals&quot; can help; cultures encouraging authenticity can offer employees refreshing breaks from emotional labor when they're not interacting with outsiders. And, our study here shows that the emotional labor -&gt; drinking relationship is weaker for employees who have more control over how they perform their job. To the extent that employers can allow employees more freedom in how they interact with customers/patients/the public (or that they help employees to feel positively or refreshed), the more employees can act more authentically and the less it has to feel like &quot;labor&quot;. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This only goes for requirements to be positive though; jobs where employees are required to be neutral or stern are a different sort altogether ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to Bobby's reply, I think you make a good point re: the benefits of being genuine when interacting with supervisors and colleagues. Your supervisor will never know something upsets you if you don't express that sentiment somehow (within the bounds of professionalism). </p>
<p>Emotional labor, as we study it, has focused mostly on interactions with people <em>outside</em> your organization (customers, clients, patients, students, etc.), which is distinct from the points you raise about modifying your emotions with supervisors or other colleagues.</p></div>		</li>
