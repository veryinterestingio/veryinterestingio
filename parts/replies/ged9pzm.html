			<div class="markdown"><p>But how does it deal with being nearer or further from the object being measured (which would change the amount of IR radiation reaching the sensor)?</p>
<p>Also, how does it deal with dark Vs light coloured objects, since the colour affects how much ir is radiated at a given temperature?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Closer vs farther turns out not to matter so long as the object fills the field of view of the sensor: if the sensor is twice as far away, it receives 1/4 as much of the light emitted by each square inch of the object, but it sees 4 times as many square inches.</p>
<p>If the object is small, though, the sensor will see a mixture of the target object's temperature and the things behind it.</p>
<p>Dark vs light colored also doesn't matter, because this is light <em>emitted by the object itself</em> rather than the light reflected from other sources.   There is a related concept called &quot;emissivity&quot; that measures how &quot;glowy&quot; the object is compared to the theoretical maximum, but most common objects (food, water, wood, rocks, people) have an emissivity of almost 100%, so it doesn't matter much.  The biggest exception is shiny metals.  But many high-end infrared thermometers have a feature that lets you calibrate it for any given emissivity.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How would the thermometer distinguish between light emitted and light reflected. If everything is emitting IR shouldn't that IR be bouncing off objects?</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is right, but it's also a little bit wrong.</p>
<p>Color matters very much, <strong>but</strong> it is the color of the object in the spectrum we're using to look at it that matters. So the color we perceive with our eyes isn't very important indeed, but if an object is white at relevant wavelengths(1000-10000 nm maybe?) it will look colder than it actually is. Metals and glass will typically fall into this category. We just call it emissivity instead of color.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The lens in the thermometer focuses the IR from a cone in front of it. The further away the surface is, the larger the circle you are measuring (mine is labelled 12:1 ratio). So, because you are measuring the radiation from a larger area, further away, the total amount that reaches the sensor is the same! You effectively measure the average temperature of a circle, and the circle is bigger the further away it is!</p>
<p>The colour of an object affects its temperature, and so, how much IR radiation to puts out. For the other way around, you know that very hot objects glow different colours. Your IR thermometer should have an expected range written on it. (Mine says -50°c to 550°c) When an object gets hot enough to fall outside this range is about the point where its colour starts changing because it is too hot, so this is accounted for too!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>no idea if that is how “laser thermometers” work, but the peak frequency of blackbody radiation is related to temperature in a relatively simple way, so if engineering difficulties were not a thing, I would simply measure some range of the spectrum, find the maximum and translate that to temperature.
That way, your values are independent of range and thus intensities, assuming you have enough radiation to distinguish it from noise.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ahh, this explains a lot. Measuring temperature with a laser just seemed like magic.</p></div>		</li>
