			<div class="markdown"><p>While in endocrynology there's the idea of a set point (an average weight, and other factors that your body seeks to maintain). The theory that this happens <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2253845" target="_blank">does exist</a> what doesn't exist is a solid theory that states <em>what and why</em> this set point is created.</p>
<p><em>My personal view</em> backed by <em>personal experiences and opinions</em> with <em>no real scientific backing</em>, which <em>may be wrong or right</em> is that we do have a set point that affects our weight, but it's the result of a complex and chaotic system of balances that happen in our body. That is our body weight &quot;equilibrium&quot; also affects other systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our emotional state (emotional eating). How well do our hormones handle these issues?</li>
<li>Our eating habits. How often, how much, what quality of nutrients and under what conditions.</li>
<li>Our gut flora.</li>
<li>How much water and electrolytes we keep in our system.</li>
<li>Balance of carbohydrates, ketones, fats, etc. on our body.</li>
<li>And hormones that guide their regulation, including insulin, progesterone, etc.</li>
<li>The balance of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5830102/" target="_blank">how cells specialize on different functions</a> within our liver, pancreas, etc.</li>
<li>The amount of muscle mass kept.</li>
<li>The amount of fat mass kept.</li>
<li>Distribution of capillaries, veins and blood through the body.</li>
<li>Cardiac system, how well blood is pumped, how much effort the heart does, how the other systems support it, etc.</li>
<li>Our circadian cycles.</li>
<li>Other issues affecting our schedule, such as reflux, etc.</li>
<li>Body temperature</li>
<li>Amount of skin</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are things that both are affected by our weight, and in turn affect our ability to keep a specific weight.</p>
<p>The body tries to keep homeostasis were all the systems are within their &quot;functional&quot; range. That is most (if not all) of these systems will try to change (slowly) until everything is &quot;in balance&quot;. Sometimes this will take a system out of range, for example high-weight, eating sugar in huge amounts at points and not doing a lot of exercise to burn this sugar will make the pancreas move insulin into a &quot;balance&quot; range were it simply doesn't work enough, or the body has become insensitive to it, diabetes type II is when we push the body unto a range where it stops working.</p>
<p>Then we can see that our body has an &quot;optimal range&quot; and a &quot;functional range&quot;. Note that I included things that are not part of the endocrine system, like emotional things. But it all matters.</p>
<p>The way you loose weight is you change the balance of certain things (mostly your habits) to force your body to adapt to a new balance. But the whole has to adapt and change. In this view loosing weight as pushing your body more and more, until things are forced to adapt and change to the new way. Loosing weight too slowly, and the &quot;pull&quot; from the other body systems to keep you underweight will prevent any notable slowdown. Loose weight to quickly, and your body will fight it. If you don't also do a notable effort to keep the target weight for a long enough time the body will try to recover it's balance as much as possible (that is most systems in your body will still push towards gaining weight).</p>
<p>That is what I believe is the answer to OP's question. When your body has been a weight for a long time, it will try to stay that weight (homeostasis) and fight you when you try to change it, slowing the change. When you have had a weight for a very short time, your body still remembers the old weight and seeks to return back to it, which means you recover the weight easily. A similar, but opposite effect happens to <a href="https://www.muscleandperformance.com/training-performance/9-common-training-mistakes-that-ruin-gains-5973" target="_blank">people who gain weight and struggle to keep it</a>.</p>
<p>Which leads to my view of the best way to loose weight. Aim for a gradual slow, not because it is better than faster (there's <a href="https://www.webmd.com/diet/news/20141015/is-slow-and-steady-weight-loss-really-the-best-approach#1" target="_blank">evidence that may not be the case</a>) but because it allows your body more time to adapt and stay. The second step is to overshoot, because as your body adapts it will not work. Say that I am 20lbs over the highest weight I can get without being overweight (according to BMI). So I start modifying my life with <em>permanent</em> habits. I avoid sugary drinks, reduce alcohol, start drinking more water, start improving my diet, I start exercising and gaining muscle mass, etc. etc. With this alone I should loose weight and get a new set point weight were I naturally will end up.</p>
<p>But lets imagine that I am still 5lbs overweight, and I am not loosing weight anymore. I strongly suspect that if I'm stuck at my setpoint and want to move past it. I can diet, but I will bounce back once I want to stabilize my weight (and I do at some point). So I start the diet and other temporal habits to force myself to loose weight. I keep it at about 2lbs per month, but can go higher as long as it's not something like 10lbs a month (the bounceback will be huge) and I keep this going for a long time. Enough that I start reaching the low-end of my BMI, close to underweight but not there. I overreach on purpose because as I try to stop loosing weight, my body's balance will make me gain a few pounds again. At this point because I've been in a lower weight for so long, that many things in my body will already have adapted to a lower weight, and my set point weight will be within the average weight BMI as I wanted. During this process I aim again to modify my permanent habits to ensure that the weight is kept. The longer I spend on that weight the easier it'll be to just keep it.</p>
<p>Another important thing is that permanent habit changes must be permanent. And they must be very very strict at first. Behavior, assuming you've already dealt with psychological aspects that prevent you from doing what you'd like, is the easiest to change in a dramatic fashion, most endocrine systems will drag their feet, for years even. So your weight will be kept by those habits alone at first. As you keep it longer and longer, it'll be easier as the rest of your body starts helping maintain this new balance and it becomes &quot;the new normal&quot;. Suddenly eating too much sweets, or very heavy food makes you feel bad and you don't like that idea. Instead you want to run when feeling stressed. Now your body demands water at a rate necessary to keep the fat burning at a specific rate, and the body is aggressive keeping energy in your blood system available (instead of storing it into fat cells) because you will consume the energy. The higher muscle mass and the fact you need to make more heat to counter the loss of fat also pushes you to burn more calories per day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This definitely checks out in my experience. I had an eating disorder when I was younger and maintained a ‘just on the line’ BMI for about 3 years. Much lower than my natural set point but became my new normal after some time and gaining weight became difficult.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a 6' male. My top weight was 265, up from decades at 170. At 265, I was really sick with the same comorbid issues some people who weigh 400lbs suffer from. I did not look like I weighed 265. I remember going to pool therapy for my back and the therapist was shocked that my weight read 265. But, then I got into the pool and couldn't even tread water.  I sank. I had to wear a life vest. It was the weirdest thing. I've been a swimmer since I was three years old. My fat was super dense  and basically wrapped around my organs (visceral fat). I'd been gaining weight from the inside out. A year ago I quit all sugar and about four months ago started fasting every other day. I now weigh 215 and feel awesome, but it's weird because I don't look like I lost 50lbs. But I know I did because I can feel it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fellow 6' guy here, but I got up to 340 lbs due to major depression bout plus a horrible history of eating habits. Sports kept me healthy-ish in HS around 215-230, but college through that completely out the window. I had a very similar issue with visceral organ fat, and got into the 270s before my long-term ex or I really noticed a big change. By then I was really out of it and kept up til top weight. I remember when I finally started getting help, and the nurse weighing me made me use the backup scale because she was convinced I was mistaken coming in.</p>
<p>Worst part about that, is that is the fat that will kill you too. That, and the same lack of visual results gaining weight come back when you try to lose weight. I did supervised keto and a solid exercise program, but it took 4 months before I saw any significant change besides the scale dropping and some added muscle. In the 250s now and still going, good luck keeping it off man!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also FWIW at the end of the day purely for weight gain/loss you only have to worry about calories in vs calories out. If the guy who first responded is correct, then presumably someone who is re-gaining weight would feel less satiated by a fixed amount of food due to more of it going to storage than to actively fuel bodily functions, resulting in them overeating and consuming more calories.</p></div>		</li>
