			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah but the force is conservative, like a pendulum: In a pendulum gravity always pushes to the center but that doesnâ€™t make it settle to the middle eventually. the thing that does that is air resistance.</p>
<p>Similarly for this to work there needs to be something that damps orbital inclination, this explanation is incomplete without it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The tides and other distortions to the bodies in play IS the damping. Energy is lost to things like that. It can even create a heating effect on/in some bodies.</p>
<p>Editing to say, the heating effect is necessarily universal, but in SOME cases, it's large/significant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I still don't get it  </p>
<p>tides are an effect of the smaller body on the larger one right? I could see how that may cause the rotation of the larger body to change to match the orbit, but I don't see how that would change the orbit to match the rotation (which is where this conversation started)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tidal forces are still conservative forces.  It must be something like internal heating to dissipate energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, the Sun keeps Uranus orbiting from a great distance, but all closer bodies will have a larger (proportionate to mass and distance squared) effect, so whilst we don't know what's gone on in the past 4 billion years of the solar system, I don't see it as odd. Hell, many things we get a good look at in space break our understandings and makes us reconsider. Which is cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is frame dragging caused by rotation noticeable in this case, or is the mass distribution difference strong enough for the frame dragging to not be relevant?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's there, but the actual effect would be absolutely tiny and completely swamped out by the tidal forces at play.</p></div>		</li>
