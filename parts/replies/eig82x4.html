			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, could you explain why it's so pricey?  Is it the cost of installation, the material cost, or just straight business reasons?  </p>
<p>What I'm asking is, why haven't we seen knock-off versions for significantly cheaper like we do with consumer electronics?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would hazard a guess that it is due to a mix of technology required to create these systems, patents filed about these mechanisms, and the fact that it is a relatively recent technology which is (probably) still under some development and innovation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The lamination process is difficult and expensive. The liquid crystal technology has been around for quite a while. They had products similar to this in the 80's but there were very volatile and failed frequently.</p>
<p>The installation, although not extremely difficult, is nuanced and one mistake can cost the installer a lot of money. So we charge accordingly. </p>
<p>There are some cheaper options available you can buy online, to install yourself. It is low quality though and we are frequently called in to fix and/or replace panels that the client did themselves or had their contractor install.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Got it, so the major portion of the cost is the operation of application, moreso than the technology, and the failure of application ruins the whole product rather than just a portion that you can just &quot;add on&quot;</p>
<p>TY for being clear!  Love the honesty. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw on /r/movie_trivia that in Clear and Present Danger (think it was that movie) a secure briefing room had that glass to give it a high tech look, but it was so expensive, especially at the time, they could only afford one side, so had to trick out the set and filming so it wasn't obvious they'd cheaped out. :-)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We did a large install for the CBS reboot of MacGyver. You can see our product in some of the scenes, which is really cool to me. At one point, the actors engage the film for a private conversation while the other actors are outside the room. One of the characters outside the room walks up to the glass, tries to listen in, and replies &quot;Damn, it's soundproof too!&quot; </p>
<p>I can assure you it is not soundproof</p></div>		</li>
