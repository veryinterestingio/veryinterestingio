			<div class="markdown"><p>Also if the car turns you now have an acceleration acting on the car but not the ball. The ball will keep going on the cars original path while the car turns and hits the ball. The only reason why the ball goes straight up then down is because objects at a constant speed feel no acceleration so the ball and the car are going to stay at the same speed unless one of them is suddenly accelerated by either a turn, stopping, or speeding up. This is why if you tossed the ball up outside the car the air would cause the ball to accelerate and would not stay with the car. (Note: when I'm using acceleration it's not the typical speeding up but rather a change in speed or angle as it's used in physics so slowing down and turning are still accelerations.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Might be too much for an ELI5, but ideally velocity should replace speed in these discussions. Speed being scaler &amp; velocity being a vector. Just like your &quot;disclaimer&quot; regarding acceleration shouldn't be needed on a first pass. &quot;Typical&quot; should be the correct definitions which can then be further ELI5'd as needed to clear up any questions. Not doing so leads to your first sentence which is incorrect (accelerations don't act upon a body, forces act upon a body which causes them to accelerate), which then breeds misunderstandings further down the road. No pun intended. </p>
<p>Also, my apologies. I'm not railing on your explanation &amp; I'm fairly sure you know everything that I've written above, I just really wish something as simple as this could be explained &quot;properly&quot; with the very basic laws of motion that Newton has given us. Then be able to trust that a person asking the question could be relied upon to do a little leg work &amp; then come back with questions if they don't &quot;get&quot; something in the first explanation. </p>
<p>But like I stated with, probably too much to ask for even a simple &quot;ELI5&quot; though. :-/</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I questioned not using speed but for most people that haven't taken physics it works pretty well. I struggle with trying to find the best way to explain things to people that don't have any previous understanding of what I'm talking about. My family usually are the ones getting to hear everything about what I've learned that I found interesting. I usually get smiles and head nods but I've been working on my explaining skills so they can get a basic understanding. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do in fact do work as they provide a force over the distance which they stretch. This in turn lowers the passengers kinetic energy. So yes they do work. Now in the sense you were meaning they also work as they keep passengers from hitting the dash or a seat in front of them, which protects them from worse injuries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you had a car that was tall enough and could throw throw the ball high enough would it eventually lose enough forward momentum and hit the rear wall? Is it only being moved forward when it's in your hand?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An object will accelerate or decelerate only when a force is applied to it. Gravity is the force which causes objects to fall, such as a ball tossed in the air. While the ball is held, it is subject to the same acceleration as the car and will match its velocity. In the absence of other forces, the ball's only acceleration will be due to gravity.</p>
<p>As long as the car maintains a constant velocity (speed and direction) while the ball is in the air, it will appear to passengers in the car that the ball will fall straight back down into the hand. For the ball to not fall back into the hand, either the ball or the car needs to have a change in velocity (accelerate).</p>
<p>If we assume that both the velocity of the system (in this case, the car) and the acceleration due to gravity are constant and that the throw results in a velocity vector purely opposite the direction of gravity, with nothing else acting on the ball, it can be thrown to any height and will eventually fall to its original position (the hand).</p></div>		</li>
