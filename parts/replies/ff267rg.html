			<div class="markdown"><p>This is so interesting to me and just makes me wonder why our eyes run that way. Like is saccades actually quicker and efficient for getting information, unlike smoothly moving our eyes everywhere? I get tracking, it makes sense for prey or anything singular focus, but why did saccades develop instead of smoothly parsing everything. Maybe it's bandwidth?</p>
<p>Just using my eyes i notice tracking helps with spatial awareness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Saccades are much quicker. The limitation is visual latency. Let’s say you’re looking to your left and suddenly you hear a lion coming at your from your right. You want to look at the lion which means shifting your gaze, let’s say, 90 degrees. The fastest way to do that is to jump directly to where you think the lion is, then probably make a couple more smaller saccades to fixate on the lion. In order to do that though, you need to make the eye movement, then process the new visual scene, create a new motor plan to move your eyes to a new spot, and so on. </p>
<p>I guess an analogy might be trying to get a small ball into a small hole 400 yards away. Would you roll the ball to the hole, constantly making fine adjustments as you go to get the perfect trajectory straight towards the hole? Or would you pull out your driver from your golf bag and hit that thing as close as you could get it and then maybe a wedge and then a putter to finish the job. </p>
<p>It’s just faster to make a ballistic eye movement to your best guess and then follow up with smaller ones until you hit your target.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>but that alone does not explain why the brain shuts off input from the eyes while making such a rapid response. Leaving what can amount to quite a significant blindness in times where a rapid response would be necessary has it's own downsides.</p>
<p>In your example, leaving yourself blind while making your best guess to where the sound came from could result in your death.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like the golf metaphor, but I was always under the impression that golf was a deliberately inefficient way to get the ball in the hole. If I wanted the ball in the hole asap, I'd dribble it like a football (small, incremental adjustments) rather than hitting it in the wrong direction entirely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the same idea behind looking at a bunch of objects.  You want to look at the individual objects (say, trees/ferns/animals), not the space between them. You scan what you can looking at one spot, then you jump to the next and scan that.  The brain can process multiple aspects of the same picture at a time, so it's more efficient to just  scan from looking at one spot than scanning through the target in question.  From there, it's trivial to apply the same concept to examining spots on an individual object (say, words or phrases in a paragraph).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m just using it as an example of where we use saccadic eye movements even though we feel like we’re making smooth movements along the lines of text. It’s not because it’s advantageous or highly efficient to use saccades instead of smooth movements, it’s because it’s literally not possible to make smooth movements if we’re not tracking something that’s moving (except in very specific circumstance).</p></div>		</li>
