			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Less than 2% of the world's water is bound up in all of the snow &amp; ice present.  There may be enough freshwater injection to disrupt the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermohaline_circulation" target="_blank">thermohaline cycle</a>, which would be bad news for a lot of people, but it's not enough freshwater to significantly alter ocean salinity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imbalance from drinking seawater? You don't get one, you just die of thirst faster as you kidneys use up your reserves to filter out the excess salt. Or you could say the dehydration <em>is</em> the imbalance caused.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes sense. It's limited in intake and so absorbtion speed by the body's reaction to attempts at intake of too great a concentration too quickly... Vomiting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the age and general fitness of the individual. The phrasing around lots of research on this gets unwieldy because the most precise measurements tend to evaluate heart rate changes as a percentage of total body weight throughout a period of observation where everything else is held static.</p>
<p>The general finding is that HR tends to increase by about 10 points in otherwise healthy adults at about 3% body weight loss. The prototype adult we talk about in medicine is 70kg. Total body water varies between 50 and 70%  depending on age and gender, but let's take 60% as the average.</p>
<p>A 70kg person whose body is 60% water has 42 liters of water in their body. To raise their HR by 10 points they need to lose 3% of 70kg, or 2.1kg (which is 2.1L of water, the metric system rules). Which works out to 5% of their total body water.</p>
<p>How tolerant a person is to these HR changes and how elastic their blood pressure is is much harder to ball park because that is incredibly dependent on their fitness state ahead of time. Children tend to have no blood pressure effects until they lose 30+% of their intravascular volume. Adults' blood pressures start to drop after 10-20%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe. There are osmoreceptors in your mouth and throat that can amplify or attenuate the thirst sensation even before any changes to your plasma osmolarity. There is some cross talk between those receptors and the ones in your stomach and in cases of high plasma osmolarity (i.e. dehyration) these receptors work together to make you nauseous or induce vomiting if you ingest things that are very hypertonic. The sensitivity of these mechanisms is widely variable across people though, so some people may rapidly vomit out hypertonic fluids that other people wouldn't.</p></div>		</li>
