			<div class="markdown"><p>It sounds dumb, but I setup one of those parental control apps to cut me off from reddit (and other similar apps/websites). Basically I have an hour for reddit per day, then a screen comes up asking if I want to exit the app or keep scrolling. I honestly recommend it because it reminds myself that Iâ€™ve already spent a while scrolling and it gives a good stopping point.</p></div>		</li>
