			<div class="markdown"><p>Before I messed up my leg, I spent a couple decades as a martial artist. I can tell you that perhaps because of the need for a fast reaction time, even several years later, if I imagine kicking something, I still crunch my abs and will usually at least get a twitch out of my leg. I assume that thereâ€™s some overlap of function?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes!  Often when someone thinks about a large, gross high power movement, there's some tremor or tightening of the muscles that gets through, even if there is no immediate desire to ready for that action.</p>
<p>I don't believe it's perfectly understood, but your cerebellum is involved in the inhibition of bodily movement, and the inhibitory signal it sends may not completely win over the thoughts about moving, instead just &quot;turning down the volume 99%&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you started martial arts when you were young, your maturation process included the movement patterns for crunching your abs and sending that kick. It's like habitual tension. You may also notice this similarly, if you close your eyes, be very still, and dart your eyes to the left or to the right. If you dart your eyes quick enough, you may feel the pull of your neck, cheek, and tongue muscles desiring to head that way, too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even better, &quot;mirror neurons&quot; sounds like BS comic book pseudoscience that a writer would make up.</p>
<p><em>Using the wonder of his brain's mirror neurons, Taskmaster was able to become the world's greatest marksman just by watching YouTube videos about snipers! He sat at home all day browsing SkillShare and Masterclass, his brain perfectly replicating at the molecular level every muscle impulse of every martial artist, ever flourish of every musician, and every thought of a chess grandmaster.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder how the connections work in people who canâ€™t seem to copy movement despite seeing how itâ€™s done. For example, I can play tennis, golf, snowboard, skate, but have no idea how to dribble drive and lay it up smoothly in basketball despite me loving the sport!</p></div>		</li>
