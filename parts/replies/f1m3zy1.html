			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on this question, what is your stance on this in terms of a patient with dementia? In the places that have allowed PAS, the law requires the patient to be of sound mind, but with a diagnosis of dementia, the patient is no longer legally competent, and, if the patient hasn't previously documented their wish to end their life peacefully instead of suffering with this specific disease, cannot request PAS. </p>
<p>Should next of kin be allowed to make this decision? How should this particular situation be handled to best help the patient and the caregivers?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny you mention this but my wife and I recently got into a discussion about such a topic after an article was shared on FB about one such case in The Netherlands.</p>
<p>A woman had dementia but while still of sound mind she did in fact state she wanted to go through PAS. It was all legally documented, etc. When it came time for it, she was no longer of sound mind and body. She actually resisted, and after being sedated and held down by family, the PAS doctor administered the treatment, relieving her.</p>
<p>There was  a huge debate on whether or not the doctor did the right thing with many believing that it should have been stopped. </p>
<p>Here's an article talking about the doctor being cleared.  <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/doctor-netherlands-lethal-injection-dementia-euthanasia-a7564061.html" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/doctor-netherlands-lethal-injection-dementia-euthanasia-a7564061.html" target="_blank">https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/doctor-netherlands-lethal-injection-dementia-euthanasia-a7564061.html</a></a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the reminder to fill out an advanced care directive. There seem to be some free ones online for my state (which does allow PAS thank goodness). Hopefully they're good enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did a paper about this topic in my first semester of college, and I too would like to know what your opinion about this is. Dr. Kevorkian was a strong advocate for AS and helped facilitate it with a cocktail of meditations, but I've always wondered about oxygen deprivation. Do you think a person with a nitrogen breathing apparatus would feel comfortable during the process, or would the oxygen deprivation cause any unnecessary stress?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oxygen deprivation makes you feel pretty good when it’s happening. </p>
<p>I’ve taken safety courses that deal with lack of O2 in confined spaces. It’s one of the reasons it’s so dangerous. You feel euphoric, then you die.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've experienced nitrogen narcosis while scuba diving below ~130'. It definitely felt good, like a warm (despite the very low water  temperature) and cozy buzz. It's called &quot;rapture of the deeps&quot; for good reason. </p>
<p>It really bothers me that so many people have to die from dehydration in hospitals where euthanasia is not allowed when they could be asphyxiated with nitrogen gas or given an opiate overdose. It seems so inhumane by comparison.</p></div>		</li>
