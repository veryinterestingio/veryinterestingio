<p>“Northern European” is still pretty broad though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is likely a best-case scenario for this sort of test. </p>
<p>If you had just one or a few genetic markers linked to another region, it would be hard to have much certainty about how those got into your genome. Especially since DNA is passed on in groups (chromosomes). If you have one chromosome with genetic markers of another region, that could be passed from generation to generation from an incredibly long way back... or by some <em>extreme</em> event of luck, that could be the only chromosome you received from one of your own grandparents. There are a wide range of more likely events between those 2 cases, but no complete certainty.</p>
<p>On the other hand there’s little ambiguity if your DNA matches <em>all</em> known markers from a single region. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is incorrect. They are inaccurate for poorly profiled groups. For those of European ancestry they are actually incredibly precise. The number of sites these websites use is several times higher than the number of sites required for accurate ancestry in well profiled groups.</p></div>		</li>
