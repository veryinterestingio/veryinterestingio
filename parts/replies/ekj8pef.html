			<div class="markdown"><p>So once in a while I'd see comments about people's dicks touching the toilet water which sounded like ridiculous bragging, &quot;you'd have to have a 15 inch dick to reach the water&quot; I thought. I never realized how close the US toilet water is to your genitals</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also some people just use too God damned much toilet paper, oh took a huge shit better wipe with the whole roll, then flush, watch it fail, then flush a few more times... See it begins to rise, well time to go, they may or may not wash their hands, it seems to vary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm an American, and the only time I've ever seen a toilet clog was after someone gorged themselves on opiate painkillers and bound themselves up like a hibernating bear for over 2 weeks. That was a helluva thing to have to figure how to address, it's like he shat a fat rock</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe the full-bowl flush thing they have going on over there? Always seemed weird to me.</p>
<p>The sewer line can clog from tree roots, making the toilet appear to be clogged, but yeah, toilet s bends themselves don't clog unless you do something utterly moronic.</p></div>		</li>
