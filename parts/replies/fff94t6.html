			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of the problem is that people don't realise that, in a healthy microbiome, the substantial majority of bacteria are good.</p>
<p>Antibiotics are really terrible for our body in many ways but, similar to chemotherapy, sometimes we need the treatment to save our lives.</p>
<p>You might find that you have long term digestive problems after using antibiotics, and antibiotics treatment in very young infants (and the resulting decrease in gut microbiome diversity) is strongly associated with increased risk of asthma and other disorders.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A broad statement like that is bad reasoning. It maybe be situationally applicable but definitely not in all cases. I know of at least one study that has taken place and has moved on to a second round of trials where they are using azithromycin (an antibiotic) in infants who have RSV (a virus) because it is showing signs that it decreases the likelihood of the child to develop asthma. Because there is a correlation between infant RSV and asthma.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dude, didn't you read his comment? He's saying that antibiotics ISNT like chemotherapy. They are mostly preventative measure and they DONT kill indiscriminately.</p>
<p>The post contains misinformation; the OP had mistakenly compared  the side effects of chemotherapy (which treats cancer), with the side effects of antibiotics (which treats infection), two very different things.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They are very much like chemotherapy in the sense that they are often used in situations in which we would die without them.</p>
<p>Antibiotics do kill our microbiota fairly indiscriminately (highly dependent on the antibiotic used), and the point I made about asthma is well researched <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28423467" target="_blank">1</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6252788/" target="_blank">2</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6082825/" target="_blank">3</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31149702" target="_blank">4</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6808991/" target="_blank">5</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734960" target="_blank">6</a></p></div>		</li>
