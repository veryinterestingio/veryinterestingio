			<div class="markdown"><p>While I might dispute the phrase &quot;almost entirely&quot;, I agree with your overall point - much of the damage done on a cellular level is done by the body's own immune response.
But a lot of damage is done by the virus itself replicating until the cell is ruptured to release hundreds - and perhaps thousands of copies of the virus.  This is not insignificant - though I'm not comfortable trying to quantize it in comparison to your valid point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Respiratory infections rarely do significant damage to the lungs before they are totally flooded by mucus. Death from fever is almost always caused by the body trying to overheat the virus and damaging the brain in the process. Most deaths from E Coli, Cholera, and dysentery are because the body dumped so much water out of the bowels that you die of dehydration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Biology prof here. While what you said is largely correct, to assume that by becoming avirulent (causing less harm to the host) a virus will always increase lifetime reproductive output is erroneous. There is often a trade-off between virulence (causing harm to the host) and transmission. For example, viruses replicate by hijacking host cells. This is bad for the host but increases the transmission of the virus. </p>
<p>We often see parasites and pathogens evolving to an intermediate level of virulence and there are a number of small changes to the environment of the parasite or pathogen that can influence how virulent the PP is. For example, if a pathogen is spread through the bite of a tsetse fly, it may make evolutionary &quot;sense&quot; to incapacitate the host in some way which makes them less likely to swat or resist the fly. We see this with African trypanosomes which cause sleeping sickness. </p>
<p>The classic example of an intermediate virulence level is seen with myoma virus in European rabbits. Initially, the virus killed 99% of rabbits infected. Within just a few years the lethality dropped because dead rabbits cant transmit viruses. However, the lethality stayed relatively constant over time after the initial drop. Basically the virus keeps its host alive just long enough to be transmitted.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I may be confusing viruses with bacteria, but I heard somewhere that they sometimes share and swap genes when they come into contact with each other.</p>
<p>Given that the overall consensus of the thread is that we're stuffed to the gills with relatively harmless viruses, does that specific gene swapping mechanism itself put a massive pressure on really deadly viruses (or bacteria, if I've gotten it mixed up) to become less deadly? As in, they're so surrounded by less harmful pathogens, in number and variety, that it's just statistically likely they'll replace genes that are really bad for the host, to ones less bad (independently of other factors, like a dead host not spreading it).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The consensus is correct and we are full of harmless viruses. Selection pressure is focused on increasing lifetime reproductive output. Sometimes this means being innocuous, other times the PP can get away with being more virulent. </p>
<p>Bacteria are famous for swapping genes (this is called horizontal gene transfer) but viruses can as well (rarer) if two viruses infect the same cell. </p>
<p>You mentioned coinfection which is a fascinating topic! Theory dictates that if two parasites coinfect the same host at the same time, evolution favors increased virulence (what good is keeping a host alive if the other parasite is just going to harm them anyway). Escalating virulence appears to be the only solution to &quot;within-host selection&quot;. On the other hand, if the two different parasite species rarely infect the same host, and the host is long-lived, then lower levels of virulence are selected for (as /u/jdlech mentioned total reproductive output depends in part on keeping the host alive longer so that you can get more out of them). The &quot;optimal&quot; virulence of a PP can rise or fall over time depending on the relative frequency of each parasite or pathogen.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Let's just say, &quot;not too terribly bad for a layman&quot;.  As I am, in fact, no expert.  Thank you for the corrections.  I like to learn something every day.
I see every pandemic as an <del>act of</del> attempt of co-evolution, as both invader and host both change and are changed over time.  Sometimes this takes millenia, as is the case of chicken pox.  And maybe never; HIV is another one of those cases - while it's simian cousin SIV evolved to be largely un-harmful to it's natural host, a single bite to an ape from another clan might kill it.  It has evolved to have such a highly specialized host that even a small change from one family of ape to another can cause death.  And indeed, biological warfare between chimpanzee clans has been documented.  Chimps have been known to &quot;sneak up&quot; on others, bite them and swiftly run away.  Only later to find the bitten chimp dies of AIDS, leading researchers to believe chimps use the virus as a weapon without knowing anything about viruses.</p>
<p>Right now, the internet is overrun by COVID-19 conspiracy theories, so it's hard to find any link to this.  My apologies.
But I did find one article that barely touches on the subject.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I don't know much about SIV but it looks like the lineage is only a few hundred years old in chimps (Wertheim and Worobey 2009). Simian foamy viruses are much older and has been coevolving with their primate lineages for as much as 30 million years making them the oldest known vertebrate RNA viruses (Switzer et al. 2005). There is no known pathology associated with SFV. </p>
<p>BTW the line between expert and non-expert is thinner than you might imagine. I think it is better to have imperfect knowledge than no knowledge at all. The desire to learn something new every day is a trait I wish more of my students had.</p></div>		</li>
