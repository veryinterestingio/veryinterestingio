			<div class="markdown"><p>You do a great job breaking things down according to how easy your explanation is to understand, but I'm afraid I don't understand what a &quot;mean arterial pressure&quot; is. Is it a fraction created by the two numbers? Or, I guess a better way of putting it is that I don't understand how the two numbers interact and how the MAP relates to it. Would you mind explaining (as simply as you can, as I have very little math know-how). Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mean arterial pressure /MAP= average of pressure in one cycle (from pumping the blood from heart to full relaxation of heart+filling back the blood for next pump). Since Diastolic BP/DBP(relaxation time) is twice longer than Systolic BP/SBP (pumping time), so MAP = (2xDBP+SBP)/3</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The pulse pressure is the difference between the systolic and diastolic values, in other words the range in pressure from it's highest to lowest readings.  For blood to adequately circulate it needs a sufficient pressure gradient to drive it through the blood vessels.  The narrow pulse pressure of 100/90 only provides 10mmHg which is not strong enough to properly perfuse the end organs.  A wide pulse pressure of 180/60 produces too much impact on the vessels with each beat and causes damage (or rupture).</p></div>		</li>
