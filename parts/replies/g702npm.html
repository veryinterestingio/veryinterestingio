			<div class="markdown"><p>Going on the story this guy told, the dr said that there was a small possibility you may sweat more from other places but downplayed it. This was 20 years ago so a lots changed, like being able to google side effects. But this guy wasnt the brightest bulb on the line so...</p></div>		</li>

<p>Like that the operation could cause nerve damage in my left leg which ended up causing more pain than the operation stopped.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My doctor didn't tell me before my eye surgery that in some unlucky patients like me the eye pressure could shoot up a few hours after the operation pretty badly and wouldn't go down without medical help.  </p>
<p>I thought it was normal to feel that much pain first day. Then I couldn't sleep the whole night. My blood pressure went very low. I thought just the bandages were awfully tight. I didn't know it was a drug specific hypersensitivity problem.</p>
<p>6 months after still my one eye looks a bit like a snake eye even though not very noticeable. I wish they told me about the possible side effects I should've watched out. Even medicines have a piece of paper inside them that explains the possible side effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In all fairness I think hand and head sweat is somehow more socially acceptable, when you look at someone with sweaty pits it's quite gross and you immediately think they don't make an effort to keep clean (often an unfair judgement) where as head often synonymous with exercise and hand nerves or just a sweaty person but not dirty in the same way out stains are sometimes viewed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Giving a shoutout to r/hyperhidrosis. I had a similar thing happen to me but the sweating moved down to my back and legs rather than my head. My doctor said it typically moves down your body, so it’s interesting that it went to your bud’s head.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn’t recommend surgery for hyperhidrosis. I talked to a surgeon for my hands and feet and scheduled a date for the surgery but luckily backed out and didn’t do it. He definitely downplayed the side effects and it seems most people get compensatory sweating, sometimes immediately and sometimes after a couple of years and a lot of people say the compensatory sweating is worse. If you sweat in your hands, feet, or armpits I’d recommend iontophoresis. It can help for some people if your sweating gets in the way of everyday life</p></div>		</li>
