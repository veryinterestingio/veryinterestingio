			<div class="markdown"><p>You did a great job at an undergraduate physics level in explaining it to a layman. Be proud of yourself. And for you, if you'd like to delve into WHY we can't both do position and momentum simultaneously, I have a neat video for you on Fourier Analysis:</p>

<p>I don't know how much math you are interested in as  a CS major, but I promise that Fourier analysis and the Fourier transform is worth learning. All integral transforms (ie. Laplace transform) are super interesting in their own way.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When I found these in EE, I was awed and amazed. Insoluble problems became easy! I am in awe of people like Fourier, Laplace, and of course JC Maxwell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! And yeah, I've studied Fourier transform and Laplace transform in my classes, but I've not seen their application in physics and the video seems very good, I'll watch it fully, thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>thank you! although when you were talking about the location of matter and how it relates to wavelengths/energy was a bit muddy to me</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that part is actually very math heavy. I'd studied it in high school, but I don't remember it well enough to explain it better, sorry.</p></div>		</li>
