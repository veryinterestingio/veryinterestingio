			<div class="markdown"><p>Cant say I’m a topology expert by any stretch of the imagination, but they are clearly different to me. I don’t have the right terminology here but a donut has a hole while a mug does not.</p>
<p>You can continuously deform a sheet into a half closed cylinder like a mug but there is no way to do this with a donut without a join.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a hole in the mug handle, which might be the confusion here. Possible that OP was referring to a mug without a handle?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That really depends on whether the mug has a handle to hold it or not. I meant a mug that has no handle so even though it has an ‘opening’ it doesn’t puncture it entirely. If the mug has a handle then it is actually holomorphic to a donut so the point raised is not without merit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would a good summary be something like this:
Crystal structure can change the topology of the electron wave function of a material.
If this topology is different from vacuum, things happen at the edge between vacuum and material. This results in there only being an electron  state moving one way, which effectively breaks time symmetry because an electron literally has no state to get into with a reverse velocity.
I guess the magic is then in how crystal structure effects topology, and how the transition of topology of the wave function actually results in the addition of a one-way conducting state.</p>
<p>Topological insulators were mentioned only very briefly in my Condensed Matter course, just stating they're a thing,  and I should definitely read up on the details.</p>
<p>Then, if i understand correctly, in this crystal anomolous Hall effect you have a situation where there are actually both a forward and backward moving state, but instead the backscattering is suppressed by some other means.</p>
<p>Thanks for this comment. I learned something today, and I hope I learned it correctly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty accurate! I’d only add that in nearly all cases the time reversal symmetry is broken due to an external magnetic field applied on the material. OP discusses a situation where the time reversal symmetry is broken by the material itself by internal magnetic fields due to how its spins are oriented but that is a pretty esoteric case in the field of topological insulators. When put this way the breaking of time reversal symmetry is the cause of the unidirectional dispersion of the edge modes and not the other way around (i.e. unidirectional dispersion causes time reversal symmetry breaking). </p>
<p>The magic is indeed in how spatial and global symmetries change the topology and there is a lot of work still being done on that front (people nailed down all the global symmetries but the combination of spatial + global symmetry has not been classified fully yet for all possible space groups and global symmetries). Even then there is a practical challenge of finding physical systems that faithfully represent the simplified theoretical models. </p>
<p>The existence of the one directional edge state is given by a very complicated mathematical proof that is called the bulk edge correspondence principle. It basically says 3 related things. 1. for a topological insulator a bulk topological invariant (say, genus) exists. 2. There is an edge invariant at the termination of said topological insulator.  3.  The invariants of 1.  and 2. must agree with each other (by math, not some happenstance).  If you establish all 3 then you have a proper topological insulator. Most works don’t deal with explicitly establishing those properties because mapping to a known system where the proof has been established is sufficient.</p></div>		</li>
