<p>Until you have things like governments trying to subsidize critical industries to drive competitors in other countries out of business, forced technology transfers, or even incentives for CEOs to sacrifice long term prospects for short term gains. </p>
<p>Any time that you have actors with different incentives than the organization they are working for things become more complex. Companies have been known to do things like channel stuffing (forcing distributors to buy extra inventory before a year end) to ensure executive bonuses, which at best is a zero sum trade if the manufacturer just takes the inventory back in the next period but can damage both the supplier and the distributor.</p>
<p>Monopolies or small groups of companies that control large market share can make transactions that are non-zero sum. Even non-zero sum trades can be detrimental to society.  A large pharmaceutical manufacturer that pays another manufacturer to delay a generic version of its drug (something that used to be legal) is making a trade that is detrimental to society but rational. In fact, the trade potentially has a net negative value to society.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The entire point of governments is that they are <em>not</em> voluntary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One classic example of how trade is non-zero-sum is &quot;the candy game.&quot;</p>
<p>Get a variety of candy and pass it out randomly. Have everyone rate how happy they are with the candy they have on a scale from 1 to 10 (10 being &quot;it's my favorite candy in the world&quot;).</p>
<p>Now allow everyone to trade candy. No organizing, no rounds, no real rules. Just five minutes to trade candy.</p>
<p>After trading, have everyone rate how happy they are with their candy again.</p>
<p>The sum of everyone's happiness will have gone up. Often dramatically. Some people will be only about as happy as they were before, but most will be much happier.</p>
<p>This demonstrates a few interesting things about trade:</p>
<ol>
<li>Trade is almost always win-win.</li>
<li>People value things differently and trade allows goods to seek their best use.</li>
<li>Trade is a discovery process. You COULD design a rating poll and centrally plan a redistribution. Trade rewards people for finding ways to discover what other people value - frequently discovering new ways that were hard to predict.</li>
