			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had this happen, wish I would have known about it I would have protected myself better. I had an epic upset stomach. One minute I was on the toilet next I was picking myself up off the floor. Two stitches in my lip. Quiet embarrassing, doctor said it's common....in the elderly. I was 28 at the time.   No, I didn't Shit myself.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can relate, I've pass out twice because of it.</p>
<p>One time I was watching a movie while laying on my couch, with my laptop on my legs. Had to pee so I jumped up, next thing I knew I was on the floor, with my lava lamp (they are awesome, shutup) broken beside me.</p>
<p>Next time was, like you, on the toilet. Stood up after doing my business and next thing I knew I was on the floor, with a broken toilet and floor, and a very sore hip.</p>
<p>Hasn't happened in about 10 years, mainly because since those i've been more careful about quickly getting up. </p></div>		</li>

<p>They are awesome. Fun fact: they were also historically used for true random number generation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I usually avoid any situation in which it may trigger it. No concerts for me unless it's VIP area with somewhere to sit (I know how douchey that sounds?), no standing for long periods of time, no excercise without proper hydration, and avoid crowds at all costs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We always just called it &quot;head rush&quot; when I was younger.  I managed to pass out, fall forward, and give myself a nasty concussion at 4 am in the middle of the summer that way. </p>
<p>Stood up, vision receded, thought &quot;head rush, no biggee&quot;  And then my vision popped out entirely and I had time to think &quot;Oh shit&quot; and try to get my arms up to protect my head as I went down.   Instead hit my arms with my chest and WHIPPED my head into the floor viciously.  Was only out long enough to fall - the pain jarred me back instantly.</p>
<p>Had months of skull splitting headaches after that.  Felt like someone driving a nail slowly into my head at the point of impact, and once it was all the way through, the pain would spread and lessen, eventually going all the way around my head, then &quot;out the back&quot; .</p>
<p>Being 14 at the time, never did tell mom what happened.</p>
<p>SO stupid.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I've passed out like twice from it. When father calls, you DO NOT get up slowly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>6'4&quot; and this happens several times per day. Passed out a ton of times, most often when I get blood drawn at the doctor's. It won't even matter if I stand up slowly, I always pass out. Not even afraid of needles/blood. </p></div>		</li>
