<p>Furthermore, buy rechargeable batteries. Not for any green reason, but because they save you a crap ton of money over the years, ESPECIALLY if you have kids. Eneloop is a great brand. ProjectFarm does a decent review on youtube. </p>
<p>Batteries are expensive as heck. Good rechargeables are only ~3-5x the price of a normal battery, but you can recharge them hundreds or THOUSANDS of times. A basic charger can be purchased for $20. You break even after using only a few batteries. Modern rechargeables are wonderful (much better than they were in the 90s and 2000s.)</p>
<p>I've had the same dozen or so eneloop AAs and AAAs for ~7 years now and they still work great.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was surprised to find this, but I’ve had a set of Eneloops for years and they still rock. Wii remotes just eat batteries, so it’s nice to have a cost effective supply of power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are other rechargeable batteries that are good, it's just eneloops were one of the first, best, low self discharge batteries and they're still among the best.</p>
<p>They're tried and true. </p>
<p>I think duracell rechargeables are up there now in terms of performance. I've heard good things about amazon basics. </p>
<p>The point is, all of us eneloop evangelists bought eneloops near a decade ago and have never had to buy batteries since, so we don't have a ton of experience with other brands.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My headphones came with 1.2V rechargeables which went bad, so I stuck some 1.5V regular batteries in there, and they worked fine. Your comment makes me think I should've researched this first. I even accidentally put them on the charging station a few times.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Carbon zinc... You usually do not want these</p>

<p>To my surprise, Kidde sells carbon zinc as a &quot;smoke alarm battery&quot;. Seems like they're supposed to be more stable over time. The detector is hardwired so the battery is a backup. Does that sound right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Smoke detectors draw very, very little power compared to other devices; they’re called “low-drain devices” for a reason. This just means you can put super crappy batteries in them and it’s not likely to be a problem.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's totally wrong here in Europe. The cheap one from Lidl supermarked is the best and Duracell the worst.</p></div>		</li>
