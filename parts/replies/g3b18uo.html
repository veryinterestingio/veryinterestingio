			<div class="markdown"><p>ICU nurse here. It's decently complex in the sense that you want multiple verifiers to be absolutely sure. Where I practice it involves MRI, reflex testing such as corneals, pupillary, cough/gag, and pain reflexes. Also involves an apnea test on the ventilator. It's been a few years since I've been a part of pronouncing brain death but that pretty much involves stopping the vent from breathing for them and measuring both end tidal and ABG CO2 for a certain amount of rise over a few minutes.  I believe you need several MDs to confirm the findings as well. It might involve a few days of EEG too I can't remember.</p>
<p>Essentially you are declared dead on confirmation of brain death. At that point it's a short time until care is withdrawn. Sadly there are situations where a young persons body can look perfect but the brain is dead.  I have a significant amount of drugs and machines that can keep your blood pressure up, lungs breathing, provide nutrition, even act as kidneys or lungs if needed. </p>
<p>Brain death declaration allows a legal way to withdraw care. Without it a family could say do all care measures including CPR if needed and to do it forever. With unlimited resources I could keep a young healthy brain dead body alive pretty much forever on endless rotating bags of pressors and machines. My guess is without brain death declaration over the years probably every ICU bed in the country would be endlessly occupied by young healthy bodies with destroyed brains. </p>
<p>It's sad, but just like with COVID you should listen to the medical professionals. We don't expect the public to know everything just like I don't know everything about tax law or setting up complex networks for corporations or something.  Brain death declaration allows us to show families that this person has already died, we are just keeping every other organ functioning. Start the grieving and healing process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where are you located that declaration of brain death requires the absence of brain stem reflexes, an MRI, an apnea test, AND an EEG?</p>
<p>Most places I’ve been at, you just need an apnea test and absence of brainstem reflexes off sedation, &gt;36C, and SBP &gt;100.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know of other countries protocols. But al least in mine, you have to have an EEG (other than aaaall the clinical signs) with very specific characteristics, that it’s done twice, and at least 6hs apart. There are pathologies that cause fixed pupils, and no necessarily mean that you are dead (brain herniation for eg, because of an hemorrhage, you can certainly reverse that if treatment is done in time), etc for other clinical signs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding in the US (Haven't read up on this in awhile) you only need an apnea test and a couple of other clinical tests to test nerve function (pain response, pupillary reflexes, etc.) after that you can simply pronounce them. Many places will have policies to do ancillary tests with things like MRI or EEG but it is not a requirement for diagnoses</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a paramedic, I'm always thinking of street medicine. In the hospital it is probably not difficult to measure brain death accurately. In the field however, pupillary light reflex, while being a good indicator of poor brain perfusion or possible brain damage is not a reliable indicator of brain death.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for saying this. I've read people going nuts when they discover the delay between cardio loss and brain cells dying, and assume you are fully conscious in that delay.</p>

<p>'Alive' in what way?  I think the point is the severed head's brain may be just as 'alive' as the brain of someone whose heart stopped and was later restarted, and the person returned to life (which certainly happens, though not nearly as often as seen on television)</p></div>		</li>
