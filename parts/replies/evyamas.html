			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure tbh. I once worked in a research lab that studied scarring after eye surgery, which is why I know about this. Acid isn't used to treat eye scars (it's mostly lasers), so I'm not as familiar. Lactic acid is quite a weak acid, but maybe that's enough. Or maybe it works in another way. Salycilic acid, for example, is a fairly weak acid, but sends a signal to skin to shed faster, so is helpful for a lot of dermatology stuff.</p></div>		</li>
