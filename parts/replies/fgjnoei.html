			<div class="markdown"><p>Very nice answer.  On the east coast of N America,  Canada and Maine will have much longer to prepare for sea level rise because of glacial rebound while folks in Florida are dealing with it now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Florida is TOTALLY isostatically rebounding, just for a different reason from what /u/theprofessoro described.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2017GC006934" target="_blank">this paper</a> for example. Some of the highest points in central Florida are former coastal dunes, higher than the ocean ever got at the time they were made. How did they get there?</p>
<p>Basically, Florida is almost entirely made of limestone. Rainwater erodes limestone into caves and sinkholes, taking that mass out to sea. Without that mass, Florida weighs less on the mantle, and rebounds for the same reason that formerly glaciated states are rebounding.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this rise is slower than glacial rebound, on the order of 0.05 cm/yr. Sea level is rising much faster than that, and lots of Florida is still fucked. (Also I'm not sure if coastal Florida near Miami is rising at all.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nothing, glaciers did not make it this far south. There are places in Florida where land is slowly sinking.  S Florida is dealing with sea level rise now during  King Tide events. Places with significant glacial rebound will not feel the effects of the global sea level rise while at the same time other places will be going underwater.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who lives in Finland. I can tell you that the effect can be quite drastic. In my region it is about +5mm an year.</p>
<p>Example. In my town there is an area called Koroinen. In early 1200's it used to be the central hub and housed the church of the area. It was accessible by even the bigger ships with the Aura river. But in 1290, it lost it's position due to the ground raising, and big trade ships being unable to reach it. So the bishop's seat was move to Turku, 1.5 kilometres in to the cathedral where it remains now.</p>
<p>So this rebound has had such a significant effect, it moved a bishop's seat. It turned a small trade town Turku in to a major city. We have historical things like this scattered all around this country, things which used to be by a river, no longer are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also a surprising effect caused by gravitational attraction of water by large ice masses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gravity has a very strong effect. So what happens when an ice sheet melts is sea level falls in the vicinity of the melting ice sheet. That is counterintuitive. The question is, how far from the ice sheet do you have to go before the effects of diminished gravity and uplifting crust are small enough that you start to raise sea level? That’s also counterintuitive. It’s 2,000 kilometers away from the ice sheet. So if the Greenland ice sheet were to catastrophically collapse tomorrow, the sea level in Iceland, Newfoundland, Sweden, Norway—all within this 2,000 kilometer radius of the Greenland ice sheet—would fall. It might have a 30 to 50 meter drop at the shore of Greenland. But the farther you get away from Greenland, the greater the price you pay. If the Greenland ice sheet melts, sea level in most of the Southern Hemisphere will increase about 30 percent more than the global average. So this is no small effect.</p>
