<p>It just wasn't worth it. What value is there in trying to occupy Switzerland? They aren't going to attack you, they don't provide access to any front, they don't have critical resources or infrastructure, and the only thing bordering them you don't directly control is Italy. They aren't even adjacent to an ocean.  </p>
<p>There was just no incentive at all to do it, and it's hard to see how it would be worth the cost. The international backlash alone could have been devastating prior to their campaign against Russia, and after they engaged Russia they just didn't have the resources.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Bombers can't hold ground, and bombing in WW2 was wildly inaccurate in practice. The Germans could have dropped every bomb on Earth on the Swiss and never managed to root them out of their mountain forts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also the Swiss &quot;military machine&quot; was designed expressly for defense. For one example: they made antitank vehicles that had dual drive systems for going forwards and backwards. They focused solely on defense and we're very well suited to and equipped for it by design.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The Germans would have had all the major cities for free.</p></div>		</li>
