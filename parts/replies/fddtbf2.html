			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah itâ€™s like 6 lane roads and 4 lane roads for the veins and arteries, 2-3 lane roads for arterioles and veinoles and 1 lane/one way roads for capillaries. If a 6 lane or 4 lane road is broken then they would go through 2 or 3 lane roads and some 1 way roads</p></div>		</li>
