			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to be clear, the choice to have inflation was very deliberate and was in response to precisely those cyclical downturns. If you look at the United States in the 1800s, when we did not have a central bank and consistent inflation was not a thing, depressions were frequent and long-lived, largely because of the inability to manage deflation. </p>
<p>Most people don't know that the Great Depression wasn't even the first thing we called the Great Depression - that honor goes to what's now called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Depression" target="_blank">Long Depression</a> that lasted (by some metrics) from 1873 to 1896. It was deeper and longer-lasting than what we now call the Great Depression. </p>
<p>Furthermore, Milton Friedman and other famous economists have argued that the 1930s Great Depression would never have been as severe as it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression#Monetarist_View" target="_blank">if the Fed had taken aggressive action</a> against the massive deflation that occurred in 1929. </p>
<p>Is consistent inflation necessary to, like, human existence? No. But it's definitely key to long-term economic stability. The 2000 dot-com crash and even the Great Recession were tiny next to the kind of routine contractions that we had in the 1800s.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Isn't that what they're doing now? It seemed like this year the government did some weird stuff to keep the economy grom crashing.</p></div>		</li>

I could certainly see that the value of goods was much more tightly coupled to labor prior to the industrial revolution.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It still is. Price and value are not the same thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, not really. Because it simply isn't true. There is a long historical record of economies experiencing long-term inflation.  </p>
<p>The guy you're replying to is pushing propaganda by Anwar Shaikh, which is an inch shy of being fake news.</p>
<p>I'd recommend <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691116358/the-big-problem-of-small-change" target="_blank">&quot;The Big Problem of Small Change&quot;</a> by  Sargent and Velde, which documents much of the economic history of Europe.  The book is not light reading, and it's not specifically about inflation (it's mostly about a historical problem that economies had, which is that small coins kept disappearing).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn’t this because of the end of the gold standard and a transition to the new gold standard? If a country is the best exporter of high demand goods, gold will flow directly to it. As gold is a limited resource, let’s say country A, is an economy that can hoard gold until it’s forced to start spending/“redistributing” it once its own resources can no longer sustain the price (because other economies can’t afford the exports of country A). Then the price is lowered, now other countries can compete with the export at the same price and economics happens all over again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This happens with fiat currencies too. What can China do with US dollars? Nothing, except buy US assets or US goods. A trade deficit
is a self-correcting problem because it raises the value of the selling country's currency and lowers the value of the buying country's currency until the deficit is eliminated. </p>
<p>This is why China bought trillions worth of US Treasury bonds over years - they wanted to keep the value of the dollar high despite the deficit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They can do a whole lot more than that since so many countries prefer USD and many markets are entirely or mostly denominated in USD.</p></div>		</li>
