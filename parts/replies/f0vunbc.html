<p>Exactly what can be recycled in a paper facility has always been a mystery to me. Our council insists we can recycle giftwrap but I'm pretty dubious...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cardboard is what we mainly want to recycle, and the kind of paper we produce is one of the parts of cardboard.</p>
<p>Of course, people throw all kinds of paper (and non paper) materials in the recycling.</p>
<p>Glossy stuff doesn't dissolve in water, and mostly goes out with the plastic. Not sure about gift wrap actually, but I know newspaper is bad for our systems, because the ink they use is hard to remove, and will cause small black dots in our finished paper (doesn't really matter except the customer, and their customer, goes &quot;waah it's dirty&quot;).</p>
<p>Don't stress recycling every last bit of paper, just do it right.</p></div>		</li>
