If you try to &quot;feel&quot; of bleach with gloves it is not slippery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As long as you don't have any open wounds on your hands and take extra precautions in cleaning it afterwards liquid mercury is actually not that dangerous to touch.</p>
<p>Edit: *Elemental mercury. Mercury poisoning occurs when ingested or introduced to the bloodstream (intravenous or inhalation). Your skin won't absorb enough mercury to be dangerous through liquid metallic mercury but of course any handling will increase risk of mercury poisoning. The most dangerous part would be the vapors if the mercury has just been opened for  its container. </p>
<p>There are many mercury compounds that would indeed absorb enough such as dimethylmercury which will cause you to die pretty horribly and would only require contact from a fraction of a droplet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also it's worth pointing out that water is actually pretty special. </p>
<p>It dissolves most things, but not us. We have a special relationship with water that we don't share with other chemicals. Alcohol is probably more normal on the grand scale, we just don't interact with much aside from water. </p>
<p>Go us. Fidelity.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Well, living beings are mostly water. And when not water, particles that can be transported by water. Since primordial seas we've been related to it, so I think that's why our cells became so used to it. Which is great, because it's indeed a &quot;dangerous&quot; liquid for many objects in nature (looking at you, erosion).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alcohol is actually very special because it can dissolve nearly everything. It is partly polar and partly nonpolar, so it can dissolve polar and nonpolar things. Water is very polar and can only dissolve other polar things (for example salts).
Nonpolar liquids can only dissolve nonpolar things (for example oils).</p>
<p>You can dissolve oils and salts in alcohol.</p></div>		</li>
