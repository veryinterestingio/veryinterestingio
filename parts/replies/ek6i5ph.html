			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but with 1/80000G surface gravity those 2 m/s will make a shockingly large alteration to an orbit. But yes with such a small reaction mass the actual DV will be small </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The real problem is that the shaped charge is going to send debris in every direction. They don't have a proper cannon that can contain the blast, because cannons are heavy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Recoilless weaponry is a thing. Projectile goes in one direction, counterbalancing mass goes the opposite, and the weapon stays where it is, mostly undisturbed but carrying less weight than before. But with the projectile itself still a threat to the spacecraft, they had to go detachable.</p>
<p>Of course, carrying extra weight and only getting real work out of one half might not be the best use of weight.</p></div>		</li>
