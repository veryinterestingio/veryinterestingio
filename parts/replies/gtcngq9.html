			<div class="markdown"><p>Myoglobin like haemoglobin is an iron based protein which binds oxygen to itself. However myoglobin is found in the skeletal muscles and acts as an oxygen store in times of need. The presence of myoglobin in urine can be a cause for concern as it indicates serious muscle damage. - <a href="https://youtu.be/t6kQhilO04c" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/t6kQhilO04c</a></p></div>		</li>

This was very helpful, thank you so much!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn’t think the volume would change.  Unless pressure went up because it was diffused.  If anything I would think diffusing it through the blood would raise its temperature which would increase the volume.  </p>
<p>Take a bunch of ping pong balls, trap them in a pillow case.   Take the same number of ping pong balls and put them in a pillow case but sew the case together in rows so the balls are separated out from each other.  Hold them both under water and they should have the same buoyancy.  Volume taken up by balls hasn’t really changed at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In humans, and, I assume in whales, as the pressure pushes your soft tissues and the air in your lungs into a smaller space, condensing anything condensable. In humans this means a lot of technical problems to overcome when scuba diving (the bends, needing to breathe out when ascending etc. etc. etc.), but it also means that past a certain depth, your natural buoyancy actually disappears, since the human body and human tissues are more condensable than water. Thus, the water around you becomes less dense than you are, and you actually start to sink. Freedivers use that property to achieve great depths without doing a lot of swimming, but then they have to work against gravity as they ascend. So yes, your net volume, as a fleshy being actually does change, and enough to flip your buoyancy from positive to negative.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more like the pillowcase is the whale and ping pong balls are the hemoglobin and filling the balls with sand is like the oxygen.<br />
So adding more oxygen doesn't occupy more volume as its stored within something that already has a set volume.</p></div>		</li>
