			<div class="markdown"><p>Smoking and whiskey, baby. Nah but really any liquor drying on your vocal folds will do enough damage over time. There's the stereotype of manly men hacking through a pack and a half of marbs a day and chasing it with a fifth of Jack but it's prolly just biased in favor of older males being the main heavy consumers of that diet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely both, but it does change with age. </p>
<p>I have a friend who is an opera singer and after she entered her 40â€™s her vocal range changed and it was becoming a challenge for her to maintain her soprano range. </p>
<p>She had so put in a far greater effort just to maintain the same vocal range - and it created quite a bit of stress in her vocal cords.</p></div>		</li>
