			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the derivative theories based on this is the one where a super-universe without entropy (or the flow of time) is bubbling off universes that become like ours. They're either so vastly removed that they'll never meet, or they're able to overlap but without being able to be seen (as in multiple universes in a manifold.)</p>
<p>It's all sci-fi level speculation, but neat nonetheless.</p>
<p>The basis for &quot;each universe having its own laws of physics&quot; is that our definition of the edge of the universe would be where our physical laws and constants break down. Might still be infinitely large, at the same time it might still have boundaries.</p>
<p>Chances are though, if there's other universes out there separated by voids of different physical constants (or nothing at all, not even physical laws) then the assumption is that they're going to be running on the same physical laws as ours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is not to be compared to the fictional ‘multiverse’ theory which is mainly discussed in movies. There isn’t a universe where earth is duplicated where everyone is three inches shorter or have evil doppelgängers. </p>
<p>But it is definetly from interpretations from the scientific ‘multiverse theory’! There are universes that are outside of our scope of visibility that more or less act the same, and do fall under the actual ‘multiverse’ theory, however there is still an argument of how to define such a theory accurately. </p>
<p>We hypothesize that there is a seemingly infinite universe, beyond the visible universe (14 billion light years from us), we know it continues to some extent, then most likely tappers off into a massive void separating other universes, or is connected at some point to a neighboring universe. When I refer to ‘timelines’ I mean different universes that are on a different age of development compared to our own. Much like how many solar systems are on a different progressive stage in the life cycle of a star. </p>
<p>There are universes that are younger, older, and even stranger than ours, however they most likely do not have their own laws of physics that we know of. Physics is a law which cannot be broken, but our understanding of it grows when current ‘laws’ are disproven. Gravity might work differently in a universe which has a vastly higher caliber magnetic fields in the works, or to one that is surrounded by super massive blackholes, but the physics wouldn’t allow for anything to crazy from our own hypotheses (hopefully, anyways).</p>
<p>These other universes are sadly, only hypothetical since we cannot currently see them or observe their affects on our own visible universe. Let alone within any foreseeable timeline. </p>
<p>There currently isn’t a working, or rather jointly agreed upon theory, that describes what lies beyond our universe, but with previous theories like the cyclical model and the multiverse theory we can only guess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After a few hours thinking about the vast voids between universes, I came to a few conclusions.</p>
<p>First, if there are such other universes, they have never interacted with our own and so light from them would not reach us in a purely temporal sense. So we wouldn't be able to see them even if we were able to magically travel to the edge of our Universe and look out with telescope.</p>
<p>Second, our Universe is expanding and pushing space out when it does. So there probably is no space in the gap between universes, making travel between them impossible. At least within the constrains that our own physical laws bind us.</p>
<p>Third, given that each universe quite possibly has their own fundamental forces, even if you could travel between the universes to a new one, you probably won't survive physically. The very atoms that hold your body together are bound by the strong nuclear force and outside of our own Universe there is no reason to expect this force to either exist or, at the least, to exist in a singular state.</p>
<p>Fourth, even if we could magically create a way to duplicate the forces that allow life in our universe in order to travel to another, chances are pretty good that another universe would be composed of anti-matter and traveling to them would result in immediate destruction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let me see if I understand you correctly... There may have been more than one big bang in the same physical space our observable universe occupies?</p>
<p>So if you were to say... condense the universe as it is to the size of a galaxy, there might be a &quot;nearby&quot; universe to us like Andromeda is to the Milky Way? If so, I am sure they are so distant that heat death will occur long before we could travel to them, but... Wow, if that's right... Wow!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the same space in the past yes. Our universe is always moving. Big bangs could even be occurring in far distant universes that are beyond our observational capabilities. </p>
<p>When I refer to other universes, I don’t intend to compare it to the multiverse theory in science fiction of parallel or alternate dimensions, I mean universes that uniquely exist at the same time far beyond our grasp. The term “Super Clusters” have been trending in science denoting large arrays of stars and systems, however even beyond our superclusters there are more stars and constellations. But even beyond that there is a hypothesized ‘end’ where our local super clusters  begin to grow exponentially further and further apart. And beyond that semi-infinite void may lie other universes that we may never see, and less likely we will be able to travel to.</p>
<p>There are speculative ways to travel beyond the ‘end’ of our universe, however few variables have yet to be realistically achieved, and might never be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. I believe I've heard Brian Greene talk about the idea that it's possible we're on this massive plain of existence, where in multiple points big bangs could've happened where a universe with its own distinctive rules would be made and then started expanding incredibly fast in all directions.</p>
<p>I've always wondered what, if that was the case, would happen if these universes collided.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If they collided, it would be fairly similar to when Solar Systems collide. Sometimes it wouldn’t be too disruptive, and other times i could cause complete chaos. Especially if an active quasar universe collides with a non-active universe. Plus there is the bonus that many stars, planets, and debris would be flung from both parent universes into the cold dark void and be lost on their own unique journeys towards death.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have asked the question before but it never got answered:</p>
<p>In M-Theory the Big Bang happened when two membranes collided or one single membrane decayed into string loops that collided (oversimplified of course). What's to say this couldn't happen again, assuming those membranes or string loops still exist? Or what might happen if there was another Big Bang in the middle of our Universe? Would it be possible, and if so, could we survive if the initial explosion was far enough away?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Second follow up, when you say different rules, do you mean as in different fundamental forces, or possibly different strengths in those forces? Like, a universe where gravity was stronger than the unified forces, or maybe where EM was the strongest force... Or entropy was a force rather than an artifact of a thermodynamic system...</p></div>		</li>
