			<div class="markdown"><p>I know! I practice yoga and <a href="https://youtu.be/E-jJJyPMVMM" target="_blank">functional range conditioning</a> regularly, so I hear my body snap, crackle, and pop as my range has increased. I’ve created more space for my joints to operate in with much, much better alignment to maximize bio-mechanical control and function of my body. And every time I hear those pops, I think of bubbles forming in my joint capsules from cavitation. Our bodies are pretty cool!</p></div>		</li>
