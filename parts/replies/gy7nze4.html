			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to add that people can hide money in FATCA non-compliant countries like China. China’s banking system does not strictly comply to FATCA. They’ll make you fill out your SSN when opening an account but never verify if it’s valid so you can put in a fake one. They also haven’t sent over that info to the US. This will probably continue as US-China relation is strained. The downside is you can’t get your money out of China as easily as China heavily restricts outflow of USD. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know people do that because I read the US attorney press releases when they get caught.  Penalties are severe.  The US will fine you 50% of any undeclared foreign account per year.  (Not 50% of earnings, 50% of the account value.)</p>
<p>So if you park $10 million in an account in China for 3 years and then get caught, you owe $5 million + $2.5 million + $1.25 million = $8.75 million.</p>
<p>I think people generally get caught when they transfer some of their money to the US to buy something and the government sees it's coming from some foreign account.  So the only way this really works is if you keep your money in China and only buy things in China.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought the elites like bezos would have a second shell company in a tax haven that owns the ip of their original company (like amazon) that would charge themselves whatever profits they made, so their shell company rakes in all the profits of the original company so their original company would pay zero taxes while their shell company holds the profits, or something like that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely not. If a US person or a US corporation owns a “controlled foreign corporation”, the company is essentially ignored and all income passes directly through it at the highest tax rate to the US owners. Prior to 2017 there were some opportunities to “defer” paying US income taxes using a strategy like this, where the money wasn’t taxed until it was brought back to the US, but that’s no longer the case in most circumstances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. This is actually a problem for people who are USAnian in name only. People who happened to be born in the USA, to parents of a different nationality (expats, for instance). </p>
<p>They need to provide a TIN or SSN to their (non-US) bank, which the bank needs to provide to the US government. Getting a TIN may lead to getting taxed, even though the person in question left the USA when they were one year old and having no ties to the USA.</p>
<p>Not providing a TIN or SSN leads to your account being closed, since most banks don't want to run afoul of the US government.</p>
<p>Even if people are able to renounce their US citizenship, they still may be taxed for the past 5 years. I know about a Dutch group called <a href="https://accidentalamericans.nl/" target="_blank">Accidental Americans</a> fighting against this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is all true except there’s no concept of “the last 5 years.” They’re taxed in the US for all of eternity until they formally relinquish citizenship or a green card. Which itself requires certifying under penalties of perjury that you’ve been tax compliant in the US for at least the past 5 years. And then there’s the possibility of a massive exit tax if you expatriate from the US. But if you don’t formerly and properly “expatriate” for tax purposes, you continue to be subject to tax in the US for all of eternity. And, if you expatriate, and even if you pay the exit tax, if you ever make a gift or leave even $1 of assets when you die to anyone who is a US person, there’s a flat 40% inheritance tax on all of it.</p></div>		</li>
