			<div class="markdown"><p>They have a cheek swab that shows how your body metabolizes different chemicals and, therefore, which medications may work better. But that is still a shot in the dark. My psych clinician looked at my results and they showed that several of the meds I had had unsuccessful trials on in the past should have been really good fits and the one that I'm on currently that helped really well is, according to the results, only moderately helpful. So the science isn't there yet. Brains are very complex and literally every single person's is different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It looks like it is, to the best of our knowledge. But we also recognize that our knowledge on the brain is extremely limited. We know that we can treat depression by changing the balance of certain chemicals. At the same time though, if it is a chemical imbalance, what causes the imbalance? Are not enough neurotransmitters released? Or not enough bound at the target? Something else we might not know about yet?</p></div>		</li>
