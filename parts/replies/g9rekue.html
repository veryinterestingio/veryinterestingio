			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to this, if a man has a healthy and robust pair of balls, if said balls were to fall onto the bike frame, the bike frame should bend or shatter from the weight and power of the balls.   If it is the balls that break, then these balls are inferior and perhaps better if the man does not reproduce.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I own a <a href="https://www.bikefriday.com/folding-bikes/" target="_blank">Bike Friday</a>, which like many folding bikes has no top tube.  It is strong enough, but the lack of a top tube makes it more flexible than a &quot;normal&quot; bike.</p>
<p>When you ride it the result is that the distance between the seat and the handlebars can vary as you pedal hard -- and if you are unlucky you hit the resonant frequency of the bike and it feels like you are going bouncing down the road.  I've been tempted to create a detachable top tube to put between the seat post and handlebars to fix this.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I am not a bike guy, but I thought with road bikes you are meant to have your legs fully extended when the pedals is at the bottom most point of its rotation, and because of that the bar's usually right on your nuts if you're not on the seat and your feet are on the ground</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't want your legs fully extended at the bottommost point. You actually want a very slight bend in the knee. If your legs are fully extended you lose a lot of power. </p>
<p>Sitting in the saddle you should be able to touch the ground with your toes on both sides. You rarely have your saddle less than 2 inches above the top bar. Often nd it's a little bit more, so you're nuts should not be on the top bar if you're standing over a well sized bike.</p></div>		</li>
