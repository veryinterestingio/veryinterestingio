			<div class="markdown"><p>I toured a wastewater facility in California where the discharge was cleaner than the river it was being discharged into. It was so close to drinkng quality that all you needed was some chlorine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I toured a wastewater facility in Washington. They said the water in the final container was safe enough to drink but there were also a lot of condoms floating in it. I asked about that and the guide said, yeah, they have a way of getting through.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I reported on our water treatment plant and they claimed that water treated there was treated to cleaner-than-drinking water standards before being released into the river. The upstream drinking water treatment facility would take river water out and treat it, but not use the waste water directly because people would think itâ€™s gross.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the US every state has their own rules and every discharge has its own permit (which describes the exact water quality required). Some plants or municipalities want to do a little better or prepare for future regulations before they hit. So there is a lot of variation in the quality of the water being discharged.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's exactly correct. The receiving water's quality and any associated goals to improve it determine the discharge quality, along with some set standards that a wastewater treatment system should be capable of achieving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That may very well have been the case. If they were only treating household waste-bathroom, shower, kitchen waste, etc. it can be readily cleaned up. However, tour guides shall we say,can sometimes be enthusiastic.  One industrial facility I worked at, was limited on and discharged copper at a level several orders of magnitude lower than drinking water standards-about 10 parts per Billion vs 1.3 ppm for drinking water.  However it wouldn't have met the entire battery of tests/limits drinking water is subject to.  Can a wastewater plant's discharge be of high quality? Yes. Is it necessarily suitable to hook directly into a drinking water system? Not so much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely true in Cincinnati.  The rain system and the sewer system are shared systems, so in a big rainfall, the treatment plant is overloaded and discharges directly into the river.  This is common.</p></div>		</li>
