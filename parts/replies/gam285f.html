<p>You say that the immune system has multiple different ways of activating, could please elaborate on this in context with type 1 diabetes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have the innate and adaptive immune systems. Within these systems are several different cell types that work in concert to protect you. And even within that each different cell type usually has several different ways that it deals with threats. </p>
<p>This drug targets 1 specific mechanism that 1 specific cell type uses. The other cells and their mechanisms are unaffected. This generalization really doesn't have anything to do with type 1 diabetes. However in type 1 diabetes, this particular cell and its defense mechanism seem to play a role with the destruction of beta cells, so targeting it in this way is intended to help prevent the destruction of the cells with limited trade-off in suppression of the immune system</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, thanks for a great explanation, as someone who has taken biological for almost 20 years, its nice to understand why these new therapies are targeted.<br />
BTW, maybe you can help.  I thought I got one of the first wave, before Remicade (if I recall it was partial (or wholly mouse genetics. Remicade was the first monoclonal all human genetics I believe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because there's many different ways of activating the immune system and going through them would probably require explaining a whole basic immunology course with technical terms and different cell type plus all the pathways that are interwoven into each and it could get complicated real quick if you're not keeping tabs. Also, the complement system is part of the innate immune but it is not always the first step in activating the immune system. The more common pathway of activating the immune system is when Antigen Presenting Cells (APC) like dendritic cells identify a foreign organism or object, swallow it and break it down, then presenting a part of the foreign invader to other cells to start the immune response.</p></div>		</li>
