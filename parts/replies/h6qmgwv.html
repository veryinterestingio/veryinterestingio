			<div class="markdown"><p>The Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis is the popular name for several different theories all concerning different degrees of linguistic relativism.</p>
<p>The only one that you could remotely consider 'disproven' is true, complete, linguistic determinism.</p>
<p>Which hasn't been relevant for about a century.</p>
<p>Weak linguistic relativism, which is what virtually any discussion of modern linguistic relativism will be referring to, is very broadly supported by empirical evidence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What empirical evidence supports any meaningful Sapir-Whorf effect? Yes, there are weak effects for color and gender (people's sense of colors being 'the same' is associated with whether their language groups those hues under one word, and speakers of gendered languages are more likely to think of inanimate objects as having the gender their name does: think 'la mesa' vs 'der Tisch') but these are really only visible under controlled laboratory conditions and not always then. Is there a single study showing a Sapir-Whorf effect that would measurably affect everyday life?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't expect a causal relation. But maybe the cultural views informed the way the language formed, and how the person reflects on (especially the cultural norms) of their gender.</p></div>		</li>
