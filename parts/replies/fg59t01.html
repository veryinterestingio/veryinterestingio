			<div class="markdown"><p>The other reply seems to have misunderstood your question. I would say that, we do not know if this strain, if it becomes pandemic, will eventually die off.</p>
<p>A few of the viruses that cause the common cold every year are also coronaviruses, so it is possible. </p>
<p>The flu does not die off every year because it continues to spread at lower levels to the tropics and then the opposite hemisphere, recombining (essentially mixing through co-infection) with other flu viruses and evolving all the time.</p>
<p>Coronaviruses are known to recombine as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of small differences which increase transmission of viruses like the flu and common cold during winter. </p>
<p>Climate:
Its commonly cited that UV can &quot;kill&quot; viruses, so less UV in winter means that the particles can survive on surfaces for longer. There is also evidence to suggest flu viruses can form gel-like coats in cold Winter temperatures which aid survival - theres obviously no evidence yet whether nCoV does this since its so recent. </p>
<p>Our nasal mucous, a first line of defence against pathogens, is also cleared less efficiently in cold temperatures, meaning viral particles have a better opportunity to start an infection.</p>
<p>Social:
People generally spend more time closer together in the Winter, think from the level of snuggling up to keep warm to having extended family and/or friends together during Winter celebrations (Xmas, New Year, Diwali to name a few). Theres debate how much these impact viral transmission since we are around people all year round, but perhaps it has a small part to play and is worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Theres also changes such as the University/school year starting around September/October, which mixes a lot of new students together who can spread viruses VERY quickly and also then transmit to parents etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a hypothesis with limited evidence that, in winter, people tend to have lower Vitamin D levels, which is theorized to contribute to a less vigorous immune system. There are some reports that people who are clinically deficient in Vit D tend to have more respiratory infections. There's dispute about whether you need &quot;deficiency&quot; levels to be more susceptible, and whether winter really results in &quot;deficiency&quot; levels, but docs do not often test for Vit D deficiency (certainly not unless they're running a blood panel for some reason) and the RDA values for Vit D supplementation from most countries' health authorities are way too low to cure a deficiency if you have one. So some believe that the phenomenon of winter flu could be associated with lower production of Vitamin D in winter because you're outdoors less, with mostly covered skin, with shorter days that tend to be considerably overcast. Some people utterly reject this theory. </p>
<p>Some argue that UV light tends to kill viruses on surfaces, and there's more of that UV light available in summer, entirely independent of whatever might be going on with the population's Vitamin D levels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi nogord,</p>
<p>&quot;Recombination&quot; does not describe the rapid evolution of flu virus, the word you're looking for is &quot;reassortment&quot; - the exchange of entire genomic segments, of which influenza has 8. This is a much different mechanism than coninfective recombination seen in non-segmented RNA viruses such as corona.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because lethality is measured as a proportion of the number infected. If only two hundred people get infected with a 50% lethal virus, you'd only get 100 dead. Absolute number of dead does not indicate lethality.</p></div>		</li>
