			<div class="markdown"><p>This may not be what you're looking for, but I have something from experience. My memory is mostly visual, so remembering images and figures is really easy. Social interactions were difficult for me when I was younger, so I did a lot of reading and watching videos to pick up on people's subtle cues. Sense I have imagery and explanations to go along with what I see, pattern recognition takes over and I can infer what someone meant based on what I know that patterned behavior meant, not necessarily because I knew what they were hinting at. In that case social ineptitude was mended by visual memory and pattern recognition.</p>
<p>That may be a corollary with what the original comment said - if your memory skill is working overtime, it's going to get a lot stronger. On the other hand, unused social skills get really weak.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Additionally autism is now basically a catch-all diagnosis. Every new edition of the DSM adds symptoms and imho it's being massively over diagnosed at the moment.</p>

<p>Yeah, I was professionally diagnosed with Aspergers when I was younger, but...really, as far as I can tell, I'm just introverted. I don't have trouble reading peoples' expressions or tones, I can pick up on social cues, I don't have trouble relating to people, no trouble with speaking or reading or writing, I'm just shy and quiet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The over diagnosis is annoying because it makes it hard for those of us who actually have the problems to be taken seriously. hyper-sensitivity to touch (physical, not emotional sensitivity).. If neighbors play loud music for a couple hours ill have panic attacks for days, and couldn't tell you why.</p>
<p>And it took forever for me to convince my boyfriend that I wasnt upset that he came home early because I didn't want him around, i was upset because he came home early. Instead of the time he said he would.  And all sorts of other fun things... And I'm like 30 years old, Ive been trying to deal with this for a long time.</p>
<p>Im better at everything than I was because I constantly work at it, but its still really hard to do. But I'm rambling at this point, probably. I tend to go on and on and on, long after I've forgotten what the point I was trying to make was. Its in there somewhere though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Going on and on is another sign. One day while I was doing it, I had a mental image of a tarantula crawling around a dodgeball, obsessively needing to touch every square inch of its surface, not realizing how similar each part is to the previous.  Spider, once you've described the pump-hole, the seam, the writing, and the uniform texture and color, nothing else is needed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can I just say how reassuring it is to hear that you are 30 and living your life, no matter what the struggle may be. My daughter is 7 and has aspergers, and I worry about what being an adult might be for her, but these kinds of stories give me hope. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The DSM 5 (current edition) <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4041577/" target="_blank">controversially <em>narrowed</em> the diagnosis</a> from the DSM-IV criteria (previous edition), potentially cutting off edge cases from appropriate services.  It did, however, group four similar diagnoses under one revised diagnosis because it turned out there was no clinical significance to the apparent differences between the four diagnoses.</p>
<p>Everything else here is pretty accurate.  Appropriate social behavior is the pinnacle of human social interactions, and those of us with computer-like brains and no social instincts are unlikely to hit that peak in our lifetimes without dedicated study, philosophizing, and practice.  Toastmasters helps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://www.toastmasters.org/" target="_blank">Toastmasters</a> is an international organization promoting public speaking and leadership. Primarily, it's made up of thousands of local clubs, usually 10-25 members, usually an hour to an hour and a half. Each weekly or biweekly meeting is a workshop where members practice speaking and leading in a variety of ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>5-7 minute speeches, crafted by the speakers, based on outlines and presentation skills described in how-to manuals. Think of TED Talks.</li>
<li>2-3 minute evaluations by assigned evaluators, who work from checklists in the manuals.</li>
<li>1-2 minute impromptu &quot;Table Topics&quot; in response to prompts from the week's &quot;Table Topicmaster.&quot; Think of /r/askreddit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Guests are always welcome for free, though clubs that meet at restaurants may expect you to pay for your own meal, if you eat.  Find a club near you, and have a fun time!</p></div>		</li>
