<p>They just see it asymptotically approach the horizon, and redshift until it's no longer visible.</p>

<p>What order of time would this take to someone looking in from well outside the inner gravity well?  Like if I were camped outside a blackhole in a spaceship far enough to not be dangerous, what would this look like to me watching it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It gets redder and darker quickly. For stellar black holes this happens in less than a millisecond (from the time where you start noticing effects), for the most massive black holes you might keep seeing the object for a day or something like that. The typical timescale is the Schwarzschild radius divided by the speed of light, or ~10 microseconds per solar mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But since relative time does extend as matter reaches the event horizon and everything on the other side is essentially indistinguishable from light... from an external observer’s perspective, isn’t it possible that the black hole would invariably collapse before any observed object passed the event horizon?</p>
<p>And this despite the fact that we can measure the loss of entangled particles such that we know stuff DOES pass the event horizon?</p></div>		</li>
