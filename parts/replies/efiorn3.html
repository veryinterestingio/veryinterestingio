			<div class="markdown"><p>Good answer.  Molar extinction coefficients should also be added to the story when comparing propensities of different compounds to absorbing radiant energy.  Unfortunately I wasn't able to find data on methane's coefficient at its peak absorption wavelength but someone else might have more luck or patience.
For those who don't know, a higher value indicates lower required concentrations to achieve a given fraction of absorption, so very high values for any GHG are concerning as they suggest very low concentrations will still have substantial activity.</p></div>		</li>
