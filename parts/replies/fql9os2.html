			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the actual explanation. I wrote some more analogies for more ELI5. </p>
<p><strong>Its like if you were popping ten balloons in a line. It's easier to walk over them one by one (force is roughly half body weight) rather than lay on them five at a time (might need more force than whole body weight).</strong></p>
<p>The part of the angled blade contacting the neck starts at one side moving across the surface as the cut is made. The goal is to minimize the area of &quot;active cutting&quot; because what you try to cut will resist so you minimize that battle. </p>
<p>Also similar to &quot;pulling&quot;  a piece of paper in half. Difficult to do if you evenly pull from each side. If you &quot;tear&quot; the paper you are really just focusing the force to minimize the amount of fibers resisting. You start at one end (like an angled knife or guillotine) of the intended &quot;cut&quot; and also pull across the fibers so you can tear a piece of paper effortlessly. If you pull evenly allowing all of the resistance to work together it will be very difficult to make the same tear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes a lot of sense. However what about kitchen knives where the full length of the blade is in contact with say a tomato, but still going in a slicing motion goes through it? You're not concentrating the force into one point like the tip of a guillotine blade yet it still works the same way, why is this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's always about putting that &quot;battle&quot; in favor of the implement (blade)...</p>
<p>Of course it's always helpful if it's any amount sharper than another, but &quot;Gliding&quot; the blade, to most effectively slice, also minimizes this resistance. Same what it Hurts less to graze someone than tackle them head on.</p>
<p>It is another level of graceful application of a very fine edge. Skin surface obviously brings in the finer level of this question.</p>
<p>To the cellular and material, and atomical interactions that ultimately explain eveey moment.</p>
<p>Edit: basically this physical principle of leverage is probably helping you whether you know it or not</p></div>		</li>
