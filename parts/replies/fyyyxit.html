<p>This is a real cool questions indeed!</p>
<p>Simulating the actual  Enceladus plumes is nearly impossible. In addition, there are not good terrestrial analogs for the plume to be used as test beds to test technologies for future missions. The same is true for possible plumes erupting from Europa.</p>
<p>The best we can do is to simulate some aspect of its physics (temperature \~-190 deg C) under near space vacuum conditions achievable in impact chambers. We can also simulate ice particle composition, speed and size, based on Cassini's CDA data.<a href="https://science.nasa.gov/toolkits/enceladus-final-flybys" target="_blank"><a href="https://science.nasa.gov/toolkits/enceladus-final-flybys" target="_blank">https://science.nasa.gov/toolkits/enceladus-final-flybys</a></a>Simulating the chemical environment (salty water, non ice particles), and even basic biology (ocean water is a good analog) is actually easier than simulating  ice particles at hyperspeeds.  We are simulating hyperspeed of ice particles \~ &lt;2 km per second up to 6 km per second for various testing purposes in preparation for flyby life detection missions to the plumes. This has been done in a very creative way by repurposing the hypervelocity impact testing facility we have at NASA Ames. There are several groups competing for this in the arena, but I am sure that sooner or later some lucky one of us will be able to send a mission to Enceladus, or Europa, hopefully building up on our seminal work. Flying by has been successfully done by Cassini, and it is actually the easier way to get &quot;free samples&quot; from the Enceladus plumes!!!</p></div>		</li>
