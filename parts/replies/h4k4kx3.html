<p>Also, it requires no headgear or controllers of any kind.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Note the distinctive and colourful pigment
around their face and buttocks.</p>
<p>Mandrills are the heaviest of all monkeys.</p>
<p>Even heavier than baboons,
with which they are often confused.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Years ago I got to go inside a forest fire for my job. We were with firefighting teams. I was standing on a dirt access trail and although the forest was on fire on both sides, on one side it was burning much more. </p>
<p>There was a mass exodus of every kind of creature and critter imaginable, all walking in the same direction across the fire trail ans away from the blaze. Spiders, bugs, snakes, squirrels, crickets, all kinds of shit. </p>
<p>It was like a truce had been signed and nobody was trying to eat anybody, they were all just headed in the same direction to get away. It was amazing.</p></div>		</li>
