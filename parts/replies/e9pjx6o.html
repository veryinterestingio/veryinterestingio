<p>The human color gamut is big, and to pick good base color all you have to do is pick them far apart. You can then form any color in the middle of those, but not outside. Three color form a triangle with already a decent area, ideally you have as many color as the entire spectrum.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm very interested in color theory. Why can we only form colors within this triangle using those three points? What constitutes a triangle within the gamut (will the sides of the triangle be ordinary straight lines or something else)?</p>
<p>I'd be glad for a response :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, if you use three base color, and form color by adding a portion of each of those 3 colors, what you do is pick a point using barycentric coordinates. This is fun and all, but that force you to be in the convex hull of those 3 points, which is the triangle which has those points as vertices.</p>
<p>If you pick 4 points you could explore a quadrilateron (also you would have different ways of having the same color). You see that 2 points is a line segment only, so you lose the dimensionality of the color space, that's too little.</p>
<p>The true interesting question is how do we came up with that gamut space in the first place?</p></div>		</li>
