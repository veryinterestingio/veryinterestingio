			<div class="markdown"><p>So I just clicked the video link and ended on a video called 'Operation Teapot - Tesla 28618' on the playlist 'LLNL Atmospheric Nuclear Tests'. There are 416 videos on that playlist, all showing slomo video of nuclear blasts.</p>
<p>The numbering of got me thinking - how many test nukes have US blown off though history? 28k just seem like so many that I can't believe it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It may be that not all of 28618 experiments reached &quot;boom&quot; state. Pretty sure that first thousands of bomb design just couldn't work)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, 'fizzles' were relatively rare.</p>
<p>Most likely that is film number x from that collection. </p>
<p>Every test will have had a <em>lot</em> of cameras pointed at it, of different types and from different directions and distances, as well as pointed at things that they were testing (how does a nuke affect a house/office/barn/power line/forest/car from various distances?).</p>
<p>Tesla was the third test of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Teapot" target="_blank">Operation Teapot</a>; videos 8 through 26 in that playlist are from that one test.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It may be number of different construction bases. Every time you find some problem, you fix it and now it's X+1.<br />
So out of 28618 versions only hundred could reach working bomb state, and only ten of them was exploded.</p></div>		</li>
