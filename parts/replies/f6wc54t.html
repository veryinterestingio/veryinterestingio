			<div class="markdown"><p>Cynthia: For dietary supplements, which are regulated through the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, there are very specific labeling rules:</p>
<p>Relevant section from DSHEA: </p>
<h4>§6. Statements of Nutritional Support.</h4>
<p>Section 403(r) (21 U.S.C. 343(r)) is amended by adding at the end the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>“(6) For purposes of paragraph (r)(1)(B), a statement for a dietary supplement may be made if -
<ul>
<li>“(A) the statement claims a benefit related to a classical nutrient deficiency disease and discloses the prevalence of such disease in the United States, describes the role of a nutrient or dietary ingredient intended to affect the structure or function in humans, characterizes the documented mechanism by which a nutrient or dietary ingredient acts to maintain such structure or function, or describes general well-being from consumption of a nutrient or dietary ingredient,</li>
<li>“(B) the manufacturer of the dietary supplement has substantiation that such statement is truthful and not misleading, and</li>
<li>“(C) the statement contains, prominently displayed and in boldface type, the following: “This statement has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.”.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>A statement under this subparagraph may not claim to diagnose, mitigate, treat, cure, or prevent a specific disease or class of diseases. If the manufacturer of a dietary supplement proposes to make a statement described in the first sentence of this subparagraph in the labeling of the dietary supplement, the manufacturer shall notify the Secretary no later than 30 days after the first marketing of the dietary supplement with such statement that such a statement is being made.” </p>
<p>Craig: There have been numerous enforcement actions taken against companies that have violated these rules by making illegal claims.  These enforcements have resulted in products being removed from the market.</p></div>		</li>
