			<div class="markdown"><p>You do realize ELI5 says, literally in the sidebar, that it's not meant as a description to a literal 5 year old, right? All that's asked is the descriptions are easily understood by a layperson who has no deep knowledge in the subject area.</p>
<p>Although I like this answer above, I feel like the analogy to a play is a bit misleading, only insofar as the two different roles typically behave differently, have different parts, different lines, different scenes. Calling something an A# or a Bb does not change the frequency of the note in any way/shape/manner, whereas an actor playing two different roles very literally will play those roles differently; they will usually sound different, represent different characters with different stories, etc. I get the intention, but I feel like the analogy is a tiny bit off.</p>
<p>Maybe it would be slightly better to say that it's like two different actors playing the <strong>same</strong> role, maybe because one actor had to go on a vacation? The actors might look different (because it's two different folks), but it's the same lines/script, same makeup, and so forth. That maintains the concept of different appearance (flat vs. sharp) while respecting the same &quot;experience&quot; (frequency)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, flats and sharps tend to be preferred by different sorts of instrumentalists.   </p>
<p>Pushing a button on a trumpet lowers the note, so they like reading keys with flats.  </p>
<p>Putting down a finger on a violin raises the note, so they like reading sharps.</p></div>		</li>
