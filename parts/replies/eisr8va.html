			<div class="markdown"><p>The light from the sun at sunset travels through so much atmosphere at such an angle that it actually bends the light. By the time the sun &quot;touches&quot; the horizon to our eyes, it is actually already below the horizon! </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, due to this effect the earth actually appears flatter than it really is. So if you measure the distance to the horizon and naively calculate the curvature of the Earth from this, you will get a somewhat larger than correct value.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct answer, but the TV analogy is nothing like the sun on the horizon.</p>
<p>A better analogy is that by having more atmosphere between you and the sun, the light gets filtered out more, much like a pair of sunglasses places more light filtering between your eyes and a light source</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More of the energetic visible light on the spectrum is filtered out due to the particles in our atmosphere scattering them the most. Also is why sunsets and sunrises appear red with the opposite side of the sky appearing blue/violet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. The TV display being dimmer from the side has more do with it simply emitting less light intensity in those directions, which does not happen with the Sun. The scattering between the display and your eye is completely negligible.</p></div>		</li>
