			<div class="markdown"><p>I grew medical marijuana for a while. Everything was legal and set up correctly with licensing, locked facilities in my basement, etc. </p>
<p>The cops raided me on suspicion that it was not legal. They seized my car, my computer, my TVs, any possessions that they deemed valuable. They put me in jail for three days while they tried to figure out how to charge me. They didn’t even formally “book me” when they took me to jail. After 3 days (the amount of time legally allowed for them to hold you without charges) they released me without a single charge. </p>
<p>The crazy part is that the seizure portion is a separate (civil) case. Criminal charges have no bearing on it. So, they kept all my shit back, as I would have had to sue them to get it. The only thing I got back was my car, after agreeing to pay the cops $6000. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was sentenced to 10 days in jail because a guest at my house didn't pull all the way into my driveway, thereby causing a &quot;traffic hazard.&quot;  There is no hyperbole in that sentence at all.  What's missing is the back story.  I was <em>really</em> convicted of 1st degree Pissed off Cop.  I served 7 of 10 days for that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was pulled over and given a charge after passing my sobriety test and he wouldn’t let me know what the breathalyzer said (I’d bet my life it said 0.0 unless it was rigged). Neither cop showed up to any of the court dates, but apparently the cop doesn’t need to be there?? The state will still prosecute you. Which to my understanding is super illegal and according to my lawyer it’s something that “really shouldn’t  be allowed.” About $10,000 later and all I had it downgraded to a DWI and a year of probation. Ya know, for driving completely sober. At 10 in the morning.</p>

<p>Which is why you weren't facing a possession charge or a distribution charge. Just a &quot;he wanted to distribute&quot; charge</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cause to go to trial would of cost him more money and risk going to jail for a longer time? There is a lot of pressure from your defense attorney and the prosecutor to take plea deals. 90% of criminal cases in the US are plead out. </p></div>		</li>
