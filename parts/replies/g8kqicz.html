<p>Opioids work in the brain by changing the pathways which process the sensation of pain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this right? I thought they acted on opioid receptors, which aren't just found in the brain. Maybe that causes these changes in the brain?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, opioids act on receptors in the spinal cord. This prevents the pain signal from reaching the brain via the spinothalamic tract.</p>
<p>A better description is that opioids act on the central nervous system, while lidocaine act on the peripheral nervous system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neat, thanks for the clarification. I knew opioids could cause constipation so it seemed like they were having some sort of effect on parts of the body other than the brain. Not that it's impossible for something that acts in the brain to not have effects on other parts of the body, or rather, I wouldn't know even if it were impossible, it just seemed odd.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Opiod receptors can be found in multiple places: multiple brain areas, the spinal cord, intestines and even way in the periphery where the 'pain' neurons act/ receive their signals. The pain killer effect of them mostly stem from their effects of the receptors within the spinal cord, but they do also act in the periphery and in the brain. This is obviously also part of the problem, their mind altering side effects because of altered and sensitised brain circuits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Local anesthetics (usually injected or applied topically to the area) work by blocking the nerve conduction, usually via stopping sodium channels, so pain and light touch sensation are the first nerve conductions to be blocked, as they are the smallest ones. </p>
<p>If you've ever had EMLA cream put onto your skin before having a blood test taken (we use it in paediatrics in the UK), if you poke the area you can often still feel it, but you can't feel sharp things e.g. needles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's types of nerves that sense different things like some sensory nerves detect a stretch sensation, some temperature, some pressure, etc
Fun fact: the nerves for detecting temperature send signals more slowly to the brain than touch sensors which is why when u stick your hand in cold or hot water, u feel the sensation of the water before registering what the temperature is</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>its not because of the size, but because of the size of the myelin sheet. This is a fatty sheet that circles nerves, and cannot be penetrated that well by lidocain, so the nerves with the thinnest myelin sheets (which are the 'pain' nerves) become blocked, but nerves with a thicker sheet, like those relaying touch and also motor nerves are spared (at least to an extend). (the thickness of the myelin sheet correlates to the speed of the nerve, and as already stated by other, pain nerves are the slowest of all and thus with the thinnest myelin sheets)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your body cannot be in pain. Pain is only a sensation. If your brain doesnâ€™t get the signal, you donâ€™t feel it, you arenâ€™t in pain. Your body may still be being <em>damaged</em>, but thatâ€™s like something being blue canâ€™t affect you if you donâ€™t see it.</p></div>		</li>
