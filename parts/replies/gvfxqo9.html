			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the California coast is literally a Mediterranean climate. The PNW is a bit of a modified Med., with the characteristic dry summers but much more precip in the winters. (Seriously though, Seattle might have the best summers in the country contrary to the common belief that it always rains)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I vacationed in WA a few years ago in July and the day went from hot and dry 98° to 62° and raining after crossing the cascades and at first I was worried about the lost sightseeing opportunities but when I checked my weather app it read 113° heat index... well,  Suddenly I did not care that it was cool and rainy. It beat wading in ball soup back home!</p>
<p>The weather did clear after a day or two and I got to visit several nice places. I wanted to go back at some point.... but then 2020 happened lol.</p></div>		</li>
