			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I thought it sounded like a bit of a myth.  Fat stores are burnt off before muscle wasting occurs.  It doesn't make sense for the body to use muscle instead of fat.  Why is this a commonly held belief?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think protein can be converted to sugar, which the brain needs. So while the body tries to use as much fat as possible, it also has to catabolize muscle to fuel a certain level of gluconeogenesis. Fat can't supply 100% of needed glucose, but it can be used to offset glucose consumption as much as possible</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the word &quot;starving&quot; is being used ambiguously. Without eating anything for three days, the body should go through the glycogen stores and then enter ketosis.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But he might be referring to having 500 calories of soda is more fattening than 500 calories of vegetables.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure about that claim either, <a href="https://i.redd.it/n4fkv1gvcm311.jpg" target="_blank">here is whats in writing at least</a>. He shows up from time to time on /r/fatlogic thats for sure.</p>
<p>A calorie is a calorie. Its like arguing a ton of bricks weighs more than a ton of feathers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great video, and dispels a bunch of common myths and assumptions with studies and simple logic. The trouble with weight loss is that <em>everyone</em> has anecdotal evidence, and that sometimes with weight loss, what seems logical isn’t necessarily how it works. </p>
<p>This video cleared a lot up for me. </p></div>		</li>
