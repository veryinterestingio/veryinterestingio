			<div class="markdown"><p>The laser bouncing tunnel is called LIGO, each arm is 4km in length and there's 2 arms (at a 90 degree angle)</p>
<p>There's also 2 LIGO locations, the first one (whichever happens encounter it first) detects gravitational waves and the second verifies that it wasn't an anomaly. </p>
<p>Sorry I fuckin love ligo it's so cool</p>
<p>Edit: the two I'm referring to are in Livingston, LA, USA and and Hanford, WA, USA , however I believe that there are two in Europe and all of them share data, which is wonderful. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>LIGO is the most precise device ever constructed. The disturbances caused by gravitational waves are so small the change in distance they’re attempting to measure is roughly 1/10,000th the width of a PROTON. </p>
<p>That’s the equivalent of measuring the distance between earth and Alpha Centauri with an accuracy less than the width of a human hair.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I know that's why I love it so much. I read it was 1/1000th, but that's even more amazing if it's 1/10000th. </p>
<p>It's craZy, that much distance is still like 100s of thousands (or millions, or more) of units of Planck's length , meaning that's not even close to the smallest measurement physically possible , in theory. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I wonder if it is feasible to build a device that can be that accurate at such a scale, or if we can only achieve such precision at small scales.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah gravitational waves move at the speed of light so that's either a huge coincidence, divine intervention, it occurs much more common tha we think, or it happens continuously allowing for consessive gravitational waves over time (maybe a long period of time to us, a year or two even, but that's seconds in the lifecycle of a black hole)</p>
<p>Also, I know the UC Berkeley (or maybe it was UCLA) small scale LIGO also detected waves almost right after it was turned on, which stunned the physics professor conducting the experiment as he thought it might take years for his device to detect them, even after years of developing the device himself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, LIGO was completed it 2002 and looked for gravitational waves until 2010, not finding any. Then it was upgraded to Advanced LIGO, which came online in September 2015 and two days later found a gravitational wave signal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love this information. I had not considered research facilities. I'm sitting here thinking about enormous warehouses and indoor football fields  and crap. </p>
<p>However, I'm not sure they sculpted the building's structure specifically to the curvature of the earth for the precision required. That seems like more a &quot;we have this really cool laser that has the most stable legs, and most motion dampening arms, so we know exactly where it's supposed to go.&quot;</p>
<p>Just seems like if the moon's gravity DID shifte one side more than the other, an alarm should go off, and the collider should not fire, until the correction has been made (either mechanically, or manually). I imagine it probably runs this safety check every time it asked to fire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with something like the LHC is that it's not firing in short bursts, it's running for an extended period, during which conditions might change. It has to be automatically corrected for or have that built into the spec, or you'd never get any data out of your massive supercollider</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is pure speculation - simply shutting off the laser when the moon passes over would cost them serious money due to down time, nevermind the fact that they wouldn't be able to run any long term experiments. It's one of the most advanced technological feats of mankind &amp; they certainly overcame something as simple as &quot;the moon passing overhead&quot;: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2012/06/full-moon-affects-large-hadron-collider-operations/" target="_blank">https://arstechnica.com/science/2012/06/full-moon-affects-large-hadron-collider-operations/</a></p></div>		</li>
