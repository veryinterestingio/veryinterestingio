			<div class="markdown"><p>An old youtuber who was known for never blinking during his videos, maybe I'm just getting old. You can see the pupil phenomenon in <a href="https://youtu.be/QNnS24qfMSs" target="_blank">this video</a> if you pay close enough attention, though it is subtle. He may address it explicitly in another video but I'm unable to find it at the moment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think 'Youtuber' doesn't really do him justice. He was a real trail blazer.</p>
<p>He got started in 2006 with 'The Show', where he uploaded a 5-10 minute video every day for a year straight. Pretty standard stuff today, but this was when youtube had been around for less than a year (and 'The Show' wasn't on youtube, he hosted it himself) and 'vlogging' wasn't really a thing yet.</p>
<p>I suppose you could call him one of the first vloggers, but I wouldn't exactly call what he did a Vlog. Music, art, comedy, philosophy, political and social commentary.</p>
<p>I can legitimately say that his episode on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sHCQWjTrJ8" target="_blank">brain crack</a> legitimately changed my life.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Except he made videos before YouTube was all that big, so they only went on his website originally. I watched that show religiously back then.</p></div>		</li>
