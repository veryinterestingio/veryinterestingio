			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the answer! Bears sleep a lot in the winter, but it is not a true hibernation as they will wake up and stretch and move about a bit and then go back to sleep. They also will wake up to give birth during the winter. They will not, however, defecate. That waits til spring. </p></div>		</li>

<p>-I'm a biologist. I study bears. </p>
<p>-Wow, cool, what did you find out about them?</p>
<p>-I spent entire weeks of my life to watch them during hibernation. I found out they don't poop during that phase.</p>
<p>-No shit?! </p></div>		</li>
