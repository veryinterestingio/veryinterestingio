			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the right answer. I'm working with military thermal EO's, for ground and air usage. The cooling of these sensors it paramount to achieve a smooth picture clean of artifacts.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Fun bonus fact: Because thermal imaging cameras are valuable in military operations, they are restricted to 9 Hz refresh rate (9 frames per second) for consumer applications. This is ostensibly intended to stop people using them for combat operations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is so that they can be exported without a license.  Higher rate sensors and cameras are readily available for domestic commercial applications (with no license) and for export with a license.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Additional bonus fun fact: FLIR makes the most thermal imaging sensors and holds a patent on a thermal imager with more than 14 thermal imaging sensors in a row. To work around this patent, a competitor, Raytheon, deliberately disables every 13th thermal imaging pixel on their thermal imaging array. The missing pixels are replaced with estimates from the adjacent area.</p>

<p>I've never run into this.  I've never seen the raw data from <em>Raytheon</em> sensors, but have from sensor of dozens of other manufacturers and it's not a thing with those.  Can you cite this patent, by chance?</p>

<p>I was mistaken - it's every 15th pixel.</p>
<p>Seek Thermal use a Raytheon sensor.  The patent licencing issue may be a cost thing - the Seek device is very cheap (&lt;$200).</p></div>		</li>
