			<div class="markdown"><p>I had understood that the issue of crystal formation (at least principally) in distal joints was related to the lower temperature at those joints, and that understanding seems supported by the common treatment of gout pain by warming the affected joints to beyond the crystallization point of sodium urate.</p>
<p>Is that not the case?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's one theory, but it's not clear by any means whether the improvement in symptoms with heat is due to reduced crystals or moderation of inflammatory pathways. One argument against it is that the crystals commonly remain in joints and tissues between episodes, ie. while asymptomatic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>I would have thought that this issue would be relatively easily addressed through animal or biomechanical models.</p>
<p>I suffered from gout for a few months years ago, and I got near-immediate relief from immersing my feet in hot water immediately when I got out of bed. That, allopurinol and a diet change, eliminated the issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reaching the boiling point of the crystals would probably result in the loss of the foot if you were boiling the foot in water. Warming and cooling the joint is a superficial treatment for the comfort of the irritated skin and joint. This is why it's a common home treatment that applies to all arthritis conditions.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It’s not that it’s insoluble, it’s that it reaches the saturation point and starts precipitating out crystals.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;Less soluble&quot; or &quot;relatively insoluble&quot; would have been more precise; I'm trying to simplify and explain something that some folks have based their entire research career on, in a couple paragraphs.... :)</p>
<p>Just to make it clear as mud, the actual mechanics of crystal formation are likely very different <em>in vivo</em> than <em>in vitro</em>, and the relative solubility of uric acid vs. monosodium urate (MSU) may not explain what's going on; recent research is looking at things like antibodies against MSU crystals promoting crystal formation, and some x-ray crystallography studies suggesting that the crystals formed <em>in vivo</em> don't have the same structure as <em>in vitro</em> MSU crystals. </p>
<p>It's a bit of a rabbit hole, once you get into it....</p></div>		</li>
