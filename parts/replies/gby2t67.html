			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to clarify, the flu vaccine is less effective because the flu changes so much year to year. If we waited until flu season to tailor the vaccine to that particular strain, it would be too late to produce and distribute enough vaccine. So the vaccines need to be made in advance based on educated guesses about what the next strain will be like. If the flu didn’t change year to year the vaccine’s efficacy would be &gt;90%</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also takes some time for your system to produce antibodies. NA has historically used the eastern hemisphere to determine the likely candidates to anticipate and protect against. There’s also a stigma surrounding the flu shot: “I’ve never been sicker in my life! I got the shot, then I got the flu!” People don’t understand it’s possible to have the virus in your system prior to vaccination which could make it seem suspicious. Truthfully, some vaccines DO elicit a noticeable reaction because it’s actually working. Your body has identified and has started to make antibodies. Everyone is different and up until the pandemic, the flu was the leading virus in mortality among patients. So the whole rationale of “it’s just a little flu” is so asinine because even during the good ole’ days, it was taking many lives behind the scenes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not sure how that study corrected for selection bias, tho. People who are most at risk of going to the ICU for flu (ie, old people) are also a lot more likely to get a flu shot. But it does seem to offer some protection even to those who get infected.</p></div>		</li>
