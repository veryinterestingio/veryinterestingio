			<div class="markdown"><p>That's different.</p>
<p>You faint from change in blood pressure pretty quickly. Just the second of going from lying down to standing up is enough for some people. So I imagine that the rapid change in blood pressure from that sort of neck injury causes immediate unconsciousness, though it would still be a minute or so to actually die.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually not ridiculous to think that one could process a thought or two after your head is separated from your body </p>
<p>Tbh I think about what it's like to die a lot, probably more than I should, and I think it's a lot scarier than most people think. There's very few scenarios where I think your conscious mind does not recognize you are dying or going to die.</p>
<p>Dying in your sleep is probably legit the best way to go man</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But this is just a matter of seconds. If you've ever seen a mma fight, you know that as soon as a choke is applied, you tap or is out in a few seconds. Because, unlike when holding your breath, a blood choke restricts blood flow to the brain. And your brain consumes the oxygen <em>really</em> fast.
And if your heart stops, blood flow to the brain stops as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like it's worth mentioning that many doctors only consider a person truly dead when the person experiences &quot;brain death&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Brain death is a legal definition of death. It is the complete stopping of all brain function and cannot be reversed. It means that, because of extreme and serious trauma or injury to the brain, the body's blood supply to the brain is blocked, and the brain dies.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>People do not go unconscious during the effects of the injection but they will always feel absolutely awful until the heart starts again.</p>

<p>Small world, I actually got to experience the heart-stopping effects of adenosine first-hand a few months ago. It wasn't actually all that unpleasant, especially compared to having a 200+ heart rate. I had a sudden SVT episode that wouldn't go away with the usual maneuvers.</p>
<p>The adenosine felt like a mix of getting the wind knocked out of you, plus a stomach drop feeling, coupled with a huge wave of relief. I was conscious the whole time, but extremely exhausted from everything that had happened. It immediately dropped my heart down to 120 and it slowly came down from there back to the 60-80 range after a few hours of rest.</p>
<p>Still not sure what triggered the SVT, I'm a relatively healthy dude. I had an echocardiogram and everything looked normalish. Keeping tabs on it with my doctor and still doing cardio 5 days a week.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it’s so interesting to hear how other people describe adenosine! To me it felt like a wave of toxic sludge being pumped from my heart to all my extremities. So heavy and gross. But the relief from 200+ BPM was real.</p>
<p>(I had a corrective procedure after it happened twice and it hasn’t bothered me since.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's wild! I didn't notice the sludge feeling, but overall I was feeling very wiped out so maybe that was part of it.</p>
<p>I'm guessing you went with the ablation procedure? Would love to hear about your experience with that since it's one of the options on the table with my doc right now. </p>
<p>When he described it to me it sounded pretty intense (at least if you go without general anesthesia like he recommended) and that definitely turned me off from it a little.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>how was the procedure? I'm expecting a call this week for mine as I've had 3 SVT episodes in the last month after not having any since I was an infant. Hoping or a short recovery time with little to no setbacks in my lifestyle. Any input would be appreciated!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im curious what procedure? Ive been having pains around my heart for the better part of a month and im told by my doc its stress. I feel like i need a new doc because no EKG, no nothing was done. Im only 30, around 180 6'2, never drank or smoked really. So just trying to get ideas for stuff to bring up to the doc(s).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a similar experience. SVT out of the blue about a decade ago. Never recurred.<br />
The injection to stop it and get back into a normal rhythm was one of the weirdest feelings I've ever had. My heart was going 220 at the time and nearly instantly dropped back down into the 80-90 range. Not something I hope to ever experience again.  </p>
<p>Hope it stays gone for you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had the same thing. I was experiencing atrial tachycardia and they decided to chemically cardiovert me. </p>
<p>The experience was interesting. The doctor first warned me with “you’ll have an uncomfortable feeling” then “you’ll have a sense of discomfort” and finally, right before, “you’ll have a sense of doom”. Then they injected the chems and I got some extreme tunnel vision that quickly went away. Overall I didn’t find it uncomfortable or “doom-ish”. I said “that was interesting” or something. </p>
<p>The chems didn’t work so they knocked my out and zapped me. When that didn’t work they checked me into the hospital. </p>
<p>That was 20 some-odd years ago. Fun times.</p></div>		</li>
