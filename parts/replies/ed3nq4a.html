<p>Sort of like how the UK refers to Europe as &quot;the Continent&quot; or Austrailia is referred to as &quot;Oz&quot;. They aren't formal names or official translated names, they are just casual nicknames.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Another wrinkle is when the country's name itself contains words that are not proper names per se, for example The United States of America. In those cases many other languages will still translate however they would say the words &quot;The United States of&quot; even if they leave &quot;America&quot; intact.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then why do maps and such use the name <em>Côte d'Ivoire</em> instead of &quot;Ivory Coast&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Super short version: The Government of Côte d'Ivoire decided it should be called by its untranslated name in official dealings for clarity, a request often ignored in english translation.</p>
<p>Longer version, as per its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory_Coast#Names" target="_blank">Wikipedia Article</a>:</p>
<p>&quot;...It retained the name through French rule and independence in 1960.[19] The name had long since been translated literally into other languages,[d] which the post-independence government considered increasingly troublesome whenever its international dealings extended beyond the Francophone sphere. Therefore, in April 1986, the government declared that Côte d'Ivoire (or, more fully, République de Côte d'Ivoire[21]) would be its formal name for the purposes of diplomatic protocol, and since then officially refuses to recognize or accept any translation from French to another language in its international dealings.[20][22][23]</p>
<p>Despite the Ivorian government's request, the English translation &quot;Ivory Coast&quot; (often &quot;the Ivory Coast&quot;) is still frequently used in English by various media outlets and publications.[e][f]&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a stupid request once there is a translation already available and everyone is familiar with. It would be absurd at this point for Spain to demand to be called only 'España' or 'Sverige' for Sweden or 'Suomi' for Finland. And so on.</p></div>		</li>
