			<div class="markdown"><p>Because you said you had trouble understanding that AskScience post I've distilled the response for you:</p>
<p>They all come, basically, from the same species <del>cultivar</del> (Capsicum chinense) so that's why they all share similar wrinkly appearance. </p>
<p>The reason why they're thin? Well, when growing a pepper is like a builder. It's got a certain amount of building material it can use. Growing cell walls (getting thicker) requires the same material as developing the spice. Because we grow chilis and protect them (as does their immense heat), they don't have a very big need for thick, resilient flesh. That reduction in need combined with selection for the hottest over time has contributed to the reduction of cell wall mass. That reduction in cell thickness translates back to exceptional heat - since all their energy went into developing capsaicin instead.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To explain in gamer terms - Chilies only have X amount of points to spec into defence (stronger skin), or attack (more spice). The hotter the chili, the weaker the fruit and the more wrinkled it looks.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr Hotter chilies are glass cannon builds.</strong></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It makes me wonder, given a sample pepper, is it possible to analytically determine what fraction of the total energy available to the plant went into producing the various compounds involved? Not just the capsaicin, but, like, the cellulose and lignin that form the walls of the fruit, and so on?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So would ghost peppers and the insanely hot ones exist without humans cultivating them? If I am reading it right they are basically like &quot;eh, this human has got my back so rather then spend my resources growing a thick wall like a bell pepper.. im gonna put all my growth efforts towards getting Spicer&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My best shot at an ELI5 of the askscience post:</p>
<p>The hottest peppers are wrinkly because they are derived from a strain of pepper that is wrinkly. That pepper was wrinkly because the cell walls of the fruit were weak; they were weak because the same raw materials for making stronger cell walls are needed to make the &quot;spicy&quot; chemicals in the fruit. The plant didn't have enough raw materials to make strong cell walls <em>and</em> have as much &quot;spice&quot; in it, so the walls of some cells collapse, creating a wrinkle in the pepper's skin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I could be entirely off base here, but there might also be a sociological issue with the extreme nature of the peppers. Fewer people cultivate the crazy hot peppers because the demand is less, meaning fewer people finding things that make peppers look nicer and breeding for that. If the demand suddenly increased you'd probably start seeing a swing towards certain traits that make it more appealing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good point. It could also end up being that people will prefer the extreme looking peppers cause they look dangerous to accompany the hotness of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the answer from the link:</p>
<p>Hey I worked solanaceaous plants so I can provide some of the answer for this.</p>
<p>There are really only a couple of main species of chilli from which nearly all our cultivars are derived.</p>
<p>•   ⁠Capsicum annuum; which are (mostly) shaped like the classic chilli and range from mild to moderately hot and the fruit wall is thick and &quot;plump&quot;
•   ⁠Capsicum frutescens; these tend to be a bit narrower and hotter, the fruit wall is often thinner than the annum strains. These are closer in appearance to wild strains
•   ⁠Capsicum chinense; these are your habaneros, bhut jolokia's and Trinidad scorpions these are often squat or rounded in shape, wrinkly and with thin and sometimes &quot;paper-y&quot; fruit wall.</p>
<p>So in a very broad simplistic sense the hottest chillies are wrinkly because they are all strains of the same species so they have all inherited these characterisitics.</p>
<p>What is known is that hotter chilli plants produce weaker cells walls and have an extracellular matrix which contains less &quot;scaffolding&quot; material. I would assume this almost certainly accounts for the different textures of the fruits and likely contributes minorly to the plumpness/thickness of the fruit flesh.</p>
<p>The reason for this is the the biosynthetic pathways for the cell wall components or the capsaicinoids chemicals rely on the same starting materials/chemicals. The plant can use that material for one use or the other which means that a given strain can't be both very hot and also have very robust cell walls (or vice versa).</p>
<p>Less stable cell walls are not especially important in cultivated chillies as we look after them and protect them from predation and disease. So we can breed out strains which are exceptionally hot.</p>
<p>I'm not sure to what extent water content plays a role here, very little I'd assume as if you pick chillies fresh off the plant the cells are turgid and the fruits are &quot;crisp&quot; and not soft/limp in all three species.</p></div>		</li>
