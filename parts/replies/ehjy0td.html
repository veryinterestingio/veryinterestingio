			<div class="markdown"><p>With at least one exception to the camouflage idea being the panther chameleon, given that the majority of locales of this species are some combination of all the colors of the rainbow and minimal green!</p>

<p>ETA: these photos are all one individual chameleon, he was my pet panther chameleon named Picasso. He was captive bred but nearly all of the wild types and actual wild panther chameleons are just as brightly colored depending on their locale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both are definitely fake. Changing colors based on what they are standing on is hardly intentional and it works way slower than that, sorry to bring that to you :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first one definitely is, the second I’m not sure about. It’s definitely realistic color changing, although it might be sped up. I don’t know how true the “change color to whatever they step on” part is though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's fake, they don't change colour to match backgrounds. Their natural resting colour tends to blend in well with their environment, colour changes are displays of some kind, e.g. mating, defence. So it's actually the opposite, colour change is about standing out not camouflage.</p>
<p>The video looks sped up too, the movement of the chameleon looks wrong, they're quite slow, deliberate movers.</p></div>		</li>
