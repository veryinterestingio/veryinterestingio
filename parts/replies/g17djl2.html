<p>And they got some benefit from the waste steam - the used steam was blown up the chimney in a jet, which drew air along with it, pulling the fire through the boiler and more air into the fire - which meant that the fire would burn more fuel and the boiler produce more steam the harder the engine ran.</p>

On some locos there's an extra steam exhaust in front of the chimney to bring the smoke down in case the loco is rolling but the fireman is shoveling coals into the combustion chamber.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Inventors maybe not. But operators would be a little concerned about lighting mountain sides and towns/outposts/cities on fire after the first couple times it happened. The soot from a steam locomotive is pretty similar to just dumping buckets of lit cigarette butts out your window, which gets riskier the further west of the mississippi river your roll.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes the mass of condensers etc would probably outweigh the benefit.
I mean a system  like that on a power station can be massive and highly efficient as thereâ€™s no real limit to its size etc.
On a moving object like a train it just becomes more mass you need to move everywhere plus more stuff to maintain as well.</p></div>		</li>
