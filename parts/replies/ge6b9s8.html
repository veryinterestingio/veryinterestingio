			<div class="markdown"><p>It would likely be possible to genetically engineer cows to make therapeutic antibodies in their milk. I believe this has been done with goats: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16255037/" target="_blank">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16255037/</a> and <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.05.137463v1.full" target="_blank">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.05.137463v1.full</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Using cows to produce antibodies?  Yep, though the animal of choice seems to be goats.  (Probably smaller and cheaper than cows)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also it's worth noting that you can't cross species. Cow antibodies would be seen by your body and foreign and would be attacked and destroyed. So, even if a lot of the hypotheticals were true here, your body would just attack the antibodies and get rid of them like any other foreign material.</p></div>		</li>
