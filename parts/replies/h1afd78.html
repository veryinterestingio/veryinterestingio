			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it does in some cases. For example, extracting all files from an archive (which is inside the installer) in a specific preallocated position on disk is pretty fast. Then the installation requires you to move a lot of small files one by one in their correct location (different folders maybe even on a different drive), making changes to the registry, checking license information, verifying data integrity and a lot of other stuff that relies on the speed of your drive in random I/O and on the responsiveness of your OS or even internet connection latency. So if the progress bar was made to be 80% unpacking and copying files and 20% &quot;setting things up&quot; (which means a lot of different things), it could very well be that on slower PCs the last 20% is very slow, while on other PCs you could see the inverse being true, so the first part of the installation happens than in an instant the last 20% is done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Decompress data into a temporary staging location, then copy to intended destination, then delete data from staging location. Decompression is CPU-heavy so &quot;90%&quot; and file operations are I/O bound and thus CPU-light &quot;10%&quot;. File operations are also heavily dependent on storage system performance: HDD vs Flash vs NVMe storage which covers the high variability OP is asking about. </p>
<p>It's not a perfect explanation but it is grounded in reality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a bit of that 10% is also validating changes, especially if it's a Windows update. Because nothing sucks more than updating something and a file gets corrupted and breaks the entire thing.</p></div>		</li>
