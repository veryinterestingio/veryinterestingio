			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah muscle memory is definitely a big thing. Recently in a class I'm in someone couldn't get into their phone because it had restarted and they always used face unlock. Later on while talking with someone the guy put in his passcode with muscle memory but still couldn't remember it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Strong passwords are better than fresh passwords, I think. Forcing users to come up with a new password turns into more predictable passwords and you end up with people using hunter3, hunter4, hunter5...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why I started using a password manager. Not only do I only have to remember one password, but say Facebook geta hacked it alerts me and changes my password for me</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A password manager nowadays is a must. I really only need to &quot;remember&quot; one password, with either my brain or muscle.  It holds about 200 other, very strong passwords along with usernames, URL, and even all my frequent flyer numbers and SSN. I use KeePass because it's free and has loads of extensions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But how is that secure? Can't someone get all your accounts just by getting one password?
Not trying to argue, I just don't understand</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>changing your password regularly has few benefits. It is more important to use a long and unique password for each service/website. Which can be done easily with a password manager.</p></div>		</li>
