			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes 100%. Thank you for bringing this up. Your ego is your main supporter and your key to autonomy. Anyone who wants you to diminish your ego is likely trying to replace it with their control.</p>
<p>Do not abandon it or fight it or try to destroy it. Ego death actually revealed to me how important my ego function is. But also that it is not me, more like a slightly dimwitted but extremely loyal bodyguard with mad skills of self preservation and promotion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m glad someone else is keen to the dangers of ego annihilation. It is most certainly a control tactic as you point out. And I like the way you phrased it, “loyal bodyguard with mad skills of self preservation and promotion.”</p></div>		</li>
