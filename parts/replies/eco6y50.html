			<div class="markdown"><p>Structure-wise there's the problem with shockwaves, and the stresses generated. In this case, although not designed for it, the mill can probably withstand, for short periods of time.</p>
<p>The problem is that from near supersonic speeds (also called <em>transonic</em> speeds) upwards generates shockwaves that push air away from the cone region, which is really undesirable, since it creates more drag (thus slowing down the generator) and it pushes air <em>away</em> from the blades. If the whole blade is supersonic, then more air is pushed away.</p>
<p>Since the generators work by converting speed from the air into rotational energy, the more area of contact is better. So while structurally the windmill might not be destroyed, it won't help with it's purpose of generating energy at all</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read through the article. I'm feeling inspired to do a little more research later when I have the time. I think the main issue here I think is specifics. I suppose once you start looking at all wind turbines, across all the entire world some could reach high speeds in certain situations. </p>
<p>The only thing that still gives me pause is that the article you linked gives ranges in general, although the way that it's worded, at least in the translated version I read would seem to imply wind turbines can reach reach the speed of sound. The main thing I'd be interested in, is what are these numbers representing? Normal operational speeds, or point of failure? </p>
<p>If these numbers represent the operational limits, then any wind turbine approaching these speeds would be on the verge of literally tearing itself apart. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the example given in the article, you get a design TSR of a bit over 9 assuming 10 m/s average wind speed (IEC class 1). If you go by the windiest place in the world (<a href="https://www.earth.com/news/10-windiest-places-earth/" target="_blank">https://www.earth.com/news/10-windiest-places-earth/</a>) which is ~22 m/s. Assuming a generous TSR of 10, you get a 220 m/s tip speed or ~0.64 Mach, still well below transonic (0.8) let alone supersonic speeds.</p>
<p>TL,DR: Yes, /u/Totttie is indeed talking out their ass. The math is correct, but the inputs are not.</p></div>		</li>
