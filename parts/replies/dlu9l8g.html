			<div class="markdown"><p>I see students do this all the time... I've attributed it to their motor system not being completely mature and with task that require lots of cognitive effort they revert to infantile motor actions (sticking tongue out).  </p>
<p>I don't think its communicative because students with severe communication deficits do this too. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was thinking communicative in an unconscious sort of way, like the way we read body language indicating arousal even if we're not taught to do that or taught to use the body language, like crossing your legs towards the person you're talking to--- you don't think about doing that, but when someone does it to you, you recognize what it means unconsciously as well. But I'm not any kind of expert.</p>
<p>I have this hilarious (studio photographer) photo of me as a baby doing the concentration tongue thing while holding a ball to throw, but actually, there are more than a few pics like this because I kind of have a Gene Simmons tongue. I'm probably deformed... </p></div>		</li>
