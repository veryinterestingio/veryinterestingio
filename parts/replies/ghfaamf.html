			<div class="markdown"><p>One of my nieces have this. She's a lawyer. It's pretty cool because when I asked her what it was like to remember everything like that while she was studying once she chuckled and said it didn't work exactly like that. She said if she needed to recall something she once read she'd have to recall the memory of the book, then re-read the page from memory. I'm guessing it's different for different people, but it's still pretty cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not that I have ever heard.</p>
<p>While I do not have an Eidetic memory, it is really good, and when I was able to perform feats that those with an Eidetic memory can pull off.  Like I could redraw maps that I had seen once.  But it took some conscious effort on my part for me to be able to remember something with amazing recall.  The only trick I have found to remembering dreams is to go over the details right when you wake up.</p></div>		</li>
