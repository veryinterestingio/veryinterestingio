			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the real answer. Another way to look at it is that the battery % you see on your phone is not the effective capacity of the battery, it's an estimate of its absolute capacity. The phone has a database of estimated charge %'s but the battery has to draw more charge to maintain the same power output, so the effective capacity decreases much faster despite the voltage's prediction of the absolute capacity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Was about to post similar graphs.  They explain a lot.</p>
<p>The charge curve is like an &quot;S&quot; or &quot;Z&quot; or &quot;N&quot; shape depending on how you look at it.  When it is drained it quickly charges into that middle section, then there is a long slow transition through the middle, then a top-off.</p>
<p>Battery levels typically measure the voltage, so it's easy to come up with numbers on the high and low end. The stuff in the middle during main battery discharge seems to last longer because it's just somewhere along the middle of the long nearly-flat line.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most modern non bargain-bin devices use coulomb counters, which are perfectly capable of predicting battery life below 10%. </p>
<p>The challenge with phones in particular is that the radio transmissions are composed of a lot of high-power transients much greater than the average power draw. If it's not a robust design these transients have the potential to brown out a phone.</p></div>		</li>
