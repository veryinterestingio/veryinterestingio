			<div class="markdown"><p>I've actually seen the emergency response plan to counteract LSD contamination.  So I calculated it for our system, it was a surprisingly small amount, in the order of tens of pounds, since LSD takes such a small dose to work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love preparedness guidelines.</p>
<p>Worked at a fast food restaurant and it said that, in case of civil unrest / rioting, the GM was to take all the cash out of the safe and deposit it in the bank, leaving the safe open.</p>
<p>Lemme just grab $5k and wander through the LA riots.</p>
<p>Also in case of robbery, we must offer them breadsticks.  Though one thing that made sense: the safe is located right up at the front counter.  You'd think it'd be hidden in the back,  but having it up front means the robber holding us hostage is surrounded by windows from the dining room and drive-thru, giving the police good visibility.</p></div>		</li>
