			<div class="markdown"><p>There are <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/treatment/whatyoushould.htm" target="_blank">antiviral drug treatments</a> that can help kill the flu itself (generally with side-effects), none of which have been observed to be effective against COVID-19 so far.</p>
<p>Edit: But for most people, when the symptoms are tolerable and non-dangerous, the prescribed or recommended treatment will be very much symptom mitigation and letting the body deal with it, yes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought antivirals don't &quot;kill&quot; but instead keep more from replicating. Which is why you can't take the medications for flu over 48 hours after symptoms. Not sure though</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially you are waiting out the storm, think of it in that regard. A storm wont kill you, but a tree branch thrown by a powerful wind might kill you. COVID 19 attacks aggressively and your bodies responses are aggressive as well. Your body still needs time to respond, a vent gives time and better pressures to support your respiratory system. Alveolar recruitment and PEEP are essential to fight these sort of attacks. You hafta let the body catch up and build up resources. Its a surprise attack and a vent gives you a chance to get reinforcements!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the best explanations of our immune system that explains how this works went something like this. We basically have two types of soldiers in our bodies, we have our ground troops (massive numbers but not very skilled) and we have our Seal Team (small numbers but quick and lethal if they know exactly what to kill).</p>
<p>So, when you get sick with something you never had before the Seals are useless. You don’t even know what you are trying to kill. So your body sends in the ground troops and they start looking for an enemy to fight. They aren’t really good at it, so a war rages inside you and you feel like crap. Eventually, mostly through trial and error, they figure out who the enemy is and, depending on how strong that enemy is, they eventually overwhelm them. As the virus gets killed your body essentially “learns” who this enemy is and how to kill it. That is when the Seals spring into action. Once they can take over they are just mowing down the bad guys and it’s over pretty quick.</p>
<p>From that day forward, the seals know what it is and how to kill it so the next time that virus shows up you don’t even bother with the ground troops. The Seals immediately take it out which is why you don’t get sick again. This is why vaccines are so important. You are essentially taking an enemy, shooting it in the leg and taking its gun away then sending it into battle so that the ground troops can quickly take it out and hand the profile on how to kill that enemy to the Seals. This is why antivaxxers are considered complete idiots by scientists, it’s a basic misunderstanding of how the body works. They are denying themselves an easy victory against something possibly deadly.</p>
<p>This is also why they are looking to do plasma transplants. At a basic level you are sending the Seals from someone who knows how to kill this bug over to another person. They will then teach their Seals how to fight it and the battle is over. </p>
<p>Note: this example is very basic and generalized. It’s not meant to be a completely accurate representation. Just an easy example of a very complex process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also you have far less troops. So their ability to gang-up is diminished. In some cases people have no troops at all, which puts that at huge risk of any invader. This is why herd immunity is so important. Preventing the jumps through society is all that protects those people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the plasma transplants in reference to Covid-19, what's actually happening there? Does the plasma from a previously infected person contain Covid-19-specific antibodies (which the recipient immune system would presumably kill itself since it's foreign?) or does it contain traces of Covid-19 which the body can use (like a vaccine) to build immunity?</p>
<p>Edit: From a <a href="https://www.globalhealthnow.org/2020-03/covid-19s-stop-gap-solution-until-vaccines-and-antivirals-are-ready" target="_blank">link</a> downstream in the thread, looks like it's the former option, antibodies. But I'm still not clear on why the recipient's immune system doesn't attack the donor antibodies?</p></div>		</li>
