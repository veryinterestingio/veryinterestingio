			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha that reminds me of the shower scene in Starship Troopers where most of the cast was naked, they insisted that they'd only do it if the director was also naked. I mean it was Paul Verhoeven so of course he did but still a funny story.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to try to pause the tv (on demand) on a topless scene. The lag between remote press and tv pause was about 4 seconds and the tits would only be up for a few frames. So I'd be there rewinding and trying to time the pause just right to get the tits. I could never get it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Its like the opposite of Margot Robbie insistenting she went nude for Wolf of Wallstreet. She looked the scene and realized lingerie just wouldn't have the same impact that the director and her character in the movie was going for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also work in the industry and this is a very good and accurate description. One thing to add: an actor cannot be compelled to do a sex scene, and cannot be denied a role based on that refusal; there must be an option to have a ‚Äúbody double‚Äù do the intimate closeups in place of the actor. This is part of the SAG-AFTRA contract, which governs the vast majority of actors in the US.</p>
<p>There are also very strict rules regarding nudity in auditions as well, to protect the actors.</p>
<p>No photography is allowed except for what is absolutely essential to capture the scene, to protect the actors from having nude photos of them all over the internet.  </p>
<p>There are even strict rules on who can be at the monitor watching on set, who is allowed to view the footage, and once editing is done they must destroy any nude footage not used in the movie.</p>
<p>A number of years ago a director demanded at the last minute that the actors have actual, penetrative sex in a scene in a film I was working on. I shut that down real fast as there had been no such contractual negotiations in advance; in addition, in the state I was working in, it was completely illegal anyway. The director was angry with me but we proceeded the way the scene was scripted, and no, there was no actual sex on set. I was the First Assistant Director on that film and I had to threaten to call the day and release everyone before the director backed down. There‚Äôs a reason directors are bound by contracts which protect the actors from this happening. Otherwise actors could be cajoled into doing things they really don‚Äôt want to do under immense pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget the pad. Usually, even when the actors are totally nude, there is a little foam pad between them. When you see the guy grinding away, he's usually pushing into the square chunk of foam padding that is stuck between the two of them. Also, they use a lot of practical effects to obscure you from actually seeing their private bits, even when you think you are. Prosthetic penises are used all of the time to obscure male genitalia, and merkins are used to obscure your view of view of female genitalia. Also, if you don't see the talent's face and nude parts of their body in the same shot, its a body double 100% of the time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Oddly enough, digital techniques and CGI advancement are at a point now where you can CGI a body double onto an actress and it's impossible to tell if it's done right. Lena Headey in GoT in the March of Shame episode is a good example. Her head on a nude actresses' body (that she even helped cast). Another one is Jessica Alba in that shower scene. All digital.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Finally the answer I have always wondered at! No amount of sock on my cock is keeping from getting erect at some point during a day of play grinding on someone like Jessica Biel. The padding and merkins have laid my mind to rest. I can die now.</p></div>		</li>

Directors are by design one-sided: they only think about the creative. The AD worries about all the implications of that creativity to make sure it is sane in its execution.</p></div>		</li>

We make such pretty shit for everybody to play with, move everything out from behind camera and reset everything exactly as it was every time the camera moves, remove everybody's garbage all day and at the end of the shoot day props gets the thanks ;_;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked on a show where there was a lesbian sex scene, disregarding the awkwardness of sitting outside a closed set listening to fake sex sounds for 14+ hours, the entire stage was tense as the scene took a day and a half to shoot and the actresses almost walked off because the director was being inconsiderate with his reshoots of each angle. It's not &quot;exciting&quot; in the least as everyone is still exhausted from 16 hour shoot days</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How &quot;uncouth&quot; or taboo is it for a male actor to get an erection during a scene? I imagine it's pretty fucking awkward. Pun intended.</p>
<p>Also, with all the strict rules and laws and contracts in place, is it ever possible for two actors who are maybe dating to get a &quot;little more into it&quot; in a scene? Of course within R-rating guidelines, but you can always tell when a kiss is a wet fucking tongue kiss or a simulated lip movement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Erections happen, they just deal with it. There was a famous actor, whose name escapes me, that told his scene partner something to the effect: &quot;Don't get offended if I get an erection, or if I don't get an erection.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not entirely sure, this was one of my first shows so I dont have the most knowledge but from what I've heard it makes the scene easy easier when you know/are comfortable with the person you are performing with.
