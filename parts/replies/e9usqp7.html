			<div class="markdown"><p>In the video-game Elite: Dangerous, <a href="https://youtu.be/iSkR2vyMhCA?t=48" target="_blank">stations are constantly spinning to produce artificial gravity</a>. Residential and commercial structures are built on the outer wall of a hollow sphere, while ship berths line the interior cavity, resulting in much lower gravity when loading and unloading cargo.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve always loved this design. It‚Äôs a great way to utilize the ‚Äúwasted space‚Äù where the reduced centrifugal force wouldn‚Äôt be sufficient for normal life, but would be useful when trying to shuffle heavy cargo around!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something really interesting to think about is the conservation of angular momentum as mass moves towards or away from the center of the spinning object. If an object is spinning and it moves mass away from its center it spins more slowly, and the opposite is true as well. A real world example of this phenomenon is how figure skaters pull their arms close in when spinning to increase the rate at which they spin. So moving heavy cargo outwards from the center of a station could end up impacting the speed of the spin. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the game, stations are around 2 km in diameter, so I imagine they‚Äôre massive enough that the inertia would render the momentum change from a few hundred tones of cargo negligible. Still, it‚Äôs an interesting thought! </p>
<p>I‚Äôll have to go check if the fiction mentions how they compensate for it, or if they just ignore it for convenience. üòÖ</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only problem with ships and stations is that relative velocities are so destructive.  It makes no sense for a habitable station to let a ship anywhere near its habitable infrastructure.  Car crashes into a building at 50mph are destructive enough, but energy goes up with the square of the velocity.  Imagine a thousand mph, easy enough to achieve.</p>
<p>The only real practical thing is to surround habitable areas with large amounts of mass, like in an asteroid, then allow ships to a more fragile access point some distance away, with maybe a transport tube or some such between them.  Anything on an approach vector for the habitable area, you destroy with prejudice, no exceptions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Spindle&quot; or &quot;Axle&quot; stations. </p>
<p>The living mass is spinning outside wheel while from the center is a large spindle or axle that doesn't rotate with the wheel.  Ships dock at the end of the Spindle and are kept away from the living mass, also don't need to match rotation to dock.</p>
<p>Traveling down the spindle is a coupler that rotates and orients the people/cargo to the rotation (but obviously at negligible Gs because you are at the axel).  They then travel outwards across the Wheel to the living mass, increasing in &quot;gravity&quot; as they move outwards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You would need something like this I believe.  You would have to have a counter mass in order to be most efficient.  </p>
<p>Not having a counter mass would have the ship and the pendulum sharing orbits, with the nodal point somewhere between them.  Thus decreasing the effectiveness of the pendulum and needing a longer tether.</p>
<p>Counter mass would keep the ship centered of the orbits (allowing acceleration) and allow for the most artificial gravity with the shortest possible tether.</p></div>		</li>
