			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny, I've always been the exact opposite. I'm always fighting with the camera to angle it down more so I can get some sense of depth perception when driving only to have the game automatically pop it back up a few seconds later. I don't care how pretty the sky is, and I certainly don't need it taking up half my screen when I'm driving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gran Turismo Sport does this well during gameplay with chase cam, but poops the bed when showing a replay. For some reason, chase gam during replays is &quot;stuck&quot; to the car, which looks really stiff and makes the car look like it's spinning around on the spot. It's very difficult to achieve a balance between a natural, fluid movement and motion-sickness fest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! Oh man!! You described something that always drove me insane about GT Sport Replay and couldn't ever put my finger on. It looks like the car is stationary, with spinning wheels, rotating on its center axis and it looks super unnatural and it always made me wonder if it was just me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can change this in the settings. I believe it’s Chase View Camera Sensitivity and Chase View Rotation Center Offset. It can be very fluid and a bit “detached” from the car.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Check out donut media, there was actually a video made about it. They had a mega selfie stick mounted to a car, with a camera that connected to a VR headset. Giving the driver a 3rd person view of the car. </p>
<p>It was very rudimentary, and admittedly, could be done better, but the end result was a decent amount of nausea, very slow driving, and some decent maneuvers all things considered. </p>
<p>It's something I would like to try.</p></div>		</li>
