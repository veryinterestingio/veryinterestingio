<p>In a freely falling reference frame in a gravitational field, the laws of physics are the same as in empty space (according to GR), therefore no experiment can determine whether you are in an elevator falling down or an elevator outside the Milky Way. Suppose that you could drop a ball with negative mass, if you were outside the Milky Way in absence of a gravitational field, the anti-mass ball would not move. If you were in free fall on Earth, the anti-mass ball would fall up. Therefore the existence of anti-mass would break Einstein's equivalence principle and therefore General Relativity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course! It is not impossible, it just means it breaks one of the most successful theories in physics (one that made many predictions that have all held up to all experimental evidence for the last 100 years) not just in a small way so that it needs minor corrections, but completely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You need to make a distinction between inertial mass and gravitational mass. Inertial mass is what is referred to in Newton's laws of motion whereas gravitational mass is what determines force due to gravity. While experimentally the two have been shown to be equal, there is no reason that they must be. If we were to find some exotic material with negative gravitational mass, we may very well discover that inertial mass is better described as the magnitude of the gravitational mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree of course,  but there currently is no distinction.</p>
<p>There used to relativistic equations stating that &quot;mass&quot; did lorentz transform and could appear 'larger'  in a moving IRF,  but those have rightly fallen out of favor.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we do discover negative mass, there's nothing to say that our energy equations will remain consistent. It could very well be that the <em>real</em> energy equation deals with the absolute value of the mass, and automatically removes the sign if there is negative mass. </p>
<p>The real difference between the two is just is that we haven't observed negative mass, but have observed negative charge. Sometimes our laws of physics let us predict the existance of particles (such as the Higgs Boson) and other times we can observe something suspicious without being able to thoroughly investigate it (such as dark matter). As far as I'm aware, we don't have anything like those to give us reason to suspect negative masses exist, so we just assume they don't for now.</p></div>		</li>
