			<div class="markdown"><p>Tbh this is still my reaction as an adult, I’m not sure why because I’m a heterosexual man but it’s a thing (and no not one I’d say to someone Irl I’m not body shaming here just stating an automatic response.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. I had a “higher consciousness” moment after looking at a nude, like “why does this turn me on? It’s just a body part.” It took me a while to even formulate this question, because I couldn’t even articulate my confusion haha.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Likely because by 13 you had very much learned about private parts and keeping them private. And everyone is dressed all the time. You only know what you look like unclothed. You also likely learned what those parts are for, so there a lot of subconscious thought going on. And being 13, you likely had already gone through puberty, so with your brain seeing the &quot;forbidden fruit&quot; and your hormones being able to respond, that triggered arousal. And if it was the first time, you may not have fully processed being aroused, and could only muster the thought, &quot;Wow!!!!&quot;</p></div>		</li>
