			<div class="markdown"><p>The statement that “Cancer is a disease of the genome” is only partially true.  Certainly it applies to situations where a DNA-level mutation is oncogenic, but not all cancers are that simple.  More broadly, cancer is a dysregulation of normal cellular processes. It can be due to incorrect timing of cellular signals, or inappropriate levels of signals ... both of which can be driven by exogenous factors rather than DNA coding.  </p>
<p>“Cancer” is a blanket term for hundreds of distinct conditions.  There will never be a single “universal” cure because cancer is so many different diseases.  There has been good progress made in some of these cancers: HER2+ breast, prostate, certain leukemias , and melanoma have all seen remarkable increases in Survival rates over the past 20-30 years.</p></div>		</li>
