			<div class="markdown"><p>The main problem with jitter is that your average ping times can be deceptively low but if you sometimes have packets which take 500ms or even a whole second it can ruin the experience.</p>
<p>Same for frames per second. An average of 30fps (a frame ever 33ms) can be quite okay, but if some frames take much longer (e.g. &gt;100ms) it’s very noticeable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly my current situation. I have (AT&amp;T) fiber, so my bandwidth is great. My ping to most of the places I care about (gaming servers) is fairly good (&lt;100 ms) but my jitter is all over the place.  What I'm finding is that while I can play most games fairly well conventionally, I can't use any of the remote gaming service (like Shadow) because the audio skips so badly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>100ms seems crazy high for fiber it should be in the 5-20 range if you are responsible close to the server (like same country).</p></div>		</li>

<p>OP, if you're on windows you can launch command prompt, and play with the ping command</p>
<p>start &gt; cmd.exe <enter></p>
<pre><code>ping -t www.google.com </code></pre>
<p>this will ping conTinuously,  google, or any other location that responds to pings. You can hit cloudflare dns servers at 1.1.1.1 for example.</p>
<p>You'll notice it tries about once per second, so and you can see how long each one takes. If you don't use the -t flag, it will default to 4 pings, then tell you the stats at the end. Jitter isn't explicitly shown or calculated, but you can infer if most of them are for example 25ms, and one is 100ms, your jitter is 75ms.</p>
<p>Think of it like karaoke - you can be off somewhat key and still sound okay, so long as you're consistently flat or sharp. If you are wobbling all over the place, you sound extra terrible.</p></div>		</li>
