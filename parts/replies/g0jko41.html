			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you stand on your plate when you eat dinner?</p>
<p>A spider will pull the sticky bit towards them, encase, liquefy and sip at their prey.</p>
<p>Also, like... If you belly flop onto a glue trap you'll have a very difficult and unpleasant time getting it off if you. If you poke your finger onto a glue trap, it is not ideal but you can get free pretty easy.</p>
<p>Similarly, a spider who is walking on the sticky part of their web with their tippytoes that they know the layout of is able to mostly ignore the stickiness, whereas a fly who runs wing or face first into a sticky strand of web gets stuck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it's like zones. It's more like say the spokes are sticky and the rings are not (or the other way around, not entirely sure). It's like roads in city blocks. Can't walk through the building lots but can walk over the roads just fine.</p></div>		</li>
