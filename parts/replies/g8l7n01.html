			<div class="markdown"><p>Similar tip - a true &quot;pinched nerve&quot; doesn't actually typically hurt in your back itself. If there's something compressing one of the spinal nerves, usually the pain shows up in an arm or leg or in your groin. If your *back* hurts, then the problem is usually either muscular, disk, or joint pain. Sometimes you can get both (a bulging disk pushing on a spinal nerve, or a spondylolisthesis where the disk and facet joints dislocate). </p>
<p>And, if you *do* have nerve pain coming from your back, generally the rule of thumb is to not get surgery until either you absolutely can't stand it, or the pain is associated with weakness or some other loss of function. You might be able to get rid of your nerve pain or weakness with back surgery, but you *will* have back pain after surgery.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I didn't have health insurance and there was no way I was racking up a few grand in bills for my mom. </p>
<p>Pinched nerves are no joke.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who had to have surgery on a ruptured and herniated disk at 18 years old, I felt this comment deep in my L5S1. It was hell convincing any doctor to do that surgery and permanently mess up my back at that age but it worked! And makes me so grateful to be alive when I am because if it had happened a century or two ago when that surgery wasn’t an option, I don’t think I could have survived to 20 with that pain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m going on month 5 with my bad disc but the pain is now manageable, about 50% gone from the start. I can’t decide if I should get surgery at the 1 year mark. I’m only 33 and have two young kids , so I’d like this sorted, but hear so many bad stories about surgery ?!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sciatica is in 90% cases caused by a spinal disc herniation. Which is exactly a &quot;pinched nerve&quot;. If you have this issue, poor sleep is not the root cause and you should read about proper exercise or talk to a physical therapist.</p>
<p>Muscle spasms are primarily linked to stress, which can in turn be caused by sleep deprivation, but can also have other causes.</p>
<p>People please read about these things on proper sources and ignore bozos making shit up on the internet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. I have sciatica, it varys from case to case but for me it is very much a pain in my lower right back. Some days its more my leg or both, but definitely primarily my back and is caused by the nerve being compressed or 'pinched'. Its really serious stuff and i deal with the pain everyday.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What he's saying is that people feel like it's a pinched nerve and say that without knowing.</p>
<p>Most back pain starts as muscular. Get on it early before the spinal column is involved and you're in good shape.</p>
<p>If you're injured in and accident etc yeah different story. You won't stretch it away, seek medical help</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What OP is saying though is that back pain is caused by poor sleep and that the bain sends the wrong signal to some muscle because it's sleep deprived, which clearly is BS. </p>
<p>A real professional wouldn't tell you that &quot;most back pain start as muscular&quot; but would rather call it &quot;non-specific&quot;, which means that its cause is unknown and can originate from the joint, bones or the soft tissue around the spinal column. Commonly, exercise is the solution. Also, a good mattress can help to keep your spinal column straight during sleep.</p>
<p>Also, you don't have to be in an accident to get for instance sciatica, which you seem to imply. This is one of four &quot;medical&quot; causes of back pain and can develop over time due to many different reasons.</p>
<p>So pretty much everything you say is wrong to some degree and thus perfectly highlights my point: Get your information from proper sources rather than reddit. Back pain is no joke!</p></div>		</li>
