			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't matter that you or even that most people won't call back. They just need a small percentage of hits, since they are working with volume. A small percentage of a very large number is still a large number.<br />
Same way scam emails work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if it's a family/friend who doesn't have their phone on them?  What if it's a delivery driver that can't find your address?  What if you run a business and it's a potential customer?  What if it's a dude who is trying to return your frisbee?</p>
<p>There are lots of reasons to answer unknown numbers and call them back.  All those examples I listed happened to me this year alone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>how to communicate with an unknown individual:  </p>
<ol>
<li>call twice in a row - the second call means you're almost certainly a human. I will never answer an unfamiliar number on the first call unless i'm expecting it. I will always answer the second if I can.</li>
<li>leave a message after the second call, and i will call you back later. If you don't leave a message I will assume that whatever issue you had was either resolved or required immediate attention, and either way I will no longer be useful.</li>
<li>Send a text as well as leaving the message - a simple text saying who you are and what you want is excellent. Additionally a lot of people have their texts synced to services, for instance my texts get forwarded to facebook messenger if i don't read them on my phone in less than 1 minute, and i will get pinged even if my phone is out of batteries or far away.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't care about the majority. They only care about those dumb enough to call an out of country number back.</p>
<p>Just like the Nigerian Prince scam: The bad writing helps preselect only idiots to even reply. Everyone who's smart enough to notice the scam won't reply in the first place.</p></div>		</li>
