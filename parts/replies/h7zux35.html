			<div class="markdown"><p>The shape of the pupils shouldn't matter though, should it? If it did, then that would imply that in bright light, when the pupil is smaller, your field of view would shrink all around, which is clearly not the case in practice, at least not to any discernible degree.</p>
<p>Field of vision is mostly determined by the placement of the eyes. Horses for example, having their eyes on the sides of the head, pretty much have 360 degree vision. They can look in front of and behind them at the same time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From a physics point of view it does matter. The maximum resolution of a simple telescope depends on the aperture diameter. The smaller the aperture the smaller the resolution. So in bright light your vision should be less sharp.
But our eyes don't even come close to maximum resolution, so we don't notice this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't it the other way around: smaller pupil/aperture, sharper vision? You need more light the smaller the aperture is, but with a smaller aperture the projection on your retina becomes automatically sharper (looking through a pinhole can help out in a pinch if you've forgotten your glasses)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Resolution has nothing to do with field of view. The way OP has formulated the question is indeed rather ambiguous to weather they meant resolution as in &quot;ability to resolve details&quot; or &quot;aspect ratio/FoV&quot;.</p>
<p>The shape of the aperture affects the &quot;blur shape&quot; so to speak, so an aperture that's larger across some dimension should have less resolution along that same direction.</p></div>		</li>
