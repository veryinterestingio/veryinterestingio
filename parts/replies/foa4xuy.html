			<div class="markdown"><p>500kph isn't very fast, depending on where you are in space you could get &quot;caught&quot; in the gravity field of a celestial body. It is admittedly unlikely, but it really depends on where one starts...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Things are so ridiculously spread out (on the order of tens of billions of “miles” apart) in space that it’d have to be sheer luck that you get remotely close to experiencing the effects of any of those lol. </p>
<p>Even things like the “asteroid belt” are are clustered as they seem. You’re talking about debris and ice that are spaced millions of miles apart in most cases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because, AU is used when measuring the vastness of space, but isn’t easily grasped by someone outside of this field. It’s an old habit from grad work under my astronomy professor. </p>
<p>My apologies if that made you upset.</p></div>		</li>
