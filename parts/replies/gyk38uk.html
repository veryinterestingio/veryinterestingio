<p>There is also other way for plants to multiply.<br />
Some plants send out rhizome underground that start growing a new plans, a example we eat is Ginger Other grow out stolon above ground that form a new plant, a common example is strawberries.</p>
<p>You can also create a cutting, of a piece of the stem or root of a plane and put in for example moist soil and it start to grow into a new plant.<br />
Plants with large root can be cut in two and you create two plants.</p>
<p>This all create offspring that have practicality identical DNA.</p>
<p>So the gardenia bushes might be genetically identical. I would not be surprised if they was created with cutting from a larger plants in a plant nursery to create plants that look the same. If I am not mistaken the time it take to get a plant you can sell is faster this way.</p></div>		</li>
