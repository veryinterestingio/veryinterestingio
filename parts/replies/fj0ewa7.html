If the grain is spoiled by an organism and it turns into gross poisonous mush, that's bad, but if it's spoiled by a organism that produces <em>the right kind of poison</em> (ethanol) we love it and help it produce as much as it can.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When you ferment something (from pickles to beer), you first sanitize everything and then add the &quot;good&quot; organisms that you want to ferment (and not spoil) your food.</p>

<p>That's not really the case. Lacto-fetmented foods, like sauerkraut and traditional will pickles, don't undergo sanitization. They rely on a salt solution and fermentation via lactobacillus and other &quot;safe&quot; microorganisms to keep harmful microorganisms in check. Yes, some fermentations involve a sanitization step (beer is sanitized by boiling the ingredients beforehand, milk is usually pasteurized while making yogurt, etc.), but that's rarely the case with lacto-fetmented foods.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But yeah, the salt will do a good job at keeping lots of things away.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Then the people teaching you don't know what they're talking about. For a start, it sounds like you're using &quot;sanitize&quot; and &quot;sterilize&quot; interchangeably, which is not correct. Sterilization is the complete killing of essentially all microorganisms. The only way to do that with, say, cucumbers in the average kitchen is to pressure cook them, and I've literally never heard of anyone even suggesting that vegetables should be pressure cooked prior to fermentation. It certainly wouldn't be authentic; lacto-fermentation has existed for much, much longer than pressure cooking.</p></div>		</li>
