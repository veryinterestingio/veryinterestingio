			<div class="markdown"><p>Well if you accept the theory of evolution as fact then you would know that the chicken and egg is settled science.</p>
<p>There was an almost chicken that laid a chicken egg. So the egg came first from something that was really close to being a chicken.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does the egg describe what's in it, or what laid it? I would think the egg was an &quot;almost chicken&quot; egg that hatched a chicken, no? Since its development is controlled by the parent's genetics?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the egg contains the genetic information that creates the first chicken, which the almost chicken that laid it did not have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The name of the egg is defined to be the name of the creature whose genetics are inside the egg. NOT the creature who laid the egg. I think most people agree with that definition. It seems more intuitive that way to me as a native English speaker.</p>
<p>However, there is no reason we have to define it this way. We could define it to be the other way that you suggested. Like any definition, it's arbitrary. But I think most people would agree that my way is the &quot;correct&quot; way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>random mutation in the egg made the first chicken, that egg being the first &quot;chicken egg&quot; as it contained a chicken, which the chick that hatched ALSO laid, hopefully without random mutations this time.</p></div>		</li>
