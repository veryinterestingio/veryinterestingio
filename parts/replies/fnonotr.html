			<div class="markdown"><p>The iLet bionic pancreas is designed to require only the user’s body weight to initialize the system. The system will not require the setting of basal insulin rates, insulin correction factors, carbohydrate-to-insulin ratios, or carbohydrate counting.  Instead, it uses its autonomous, self-learning, decision-making capability to determine a user’s dose every five minutes (see my response to u/NotSeveralBadgers for further details).  Consequently, it will not require (or allow) patients or physicians to set or adjust insulin therapy. Our goal with this design has always been to make it easier to use the bionic pancreas by more people and by more physicians than current therapies.
Although it is not required, the iLet bionic pancreas does allow users to announce meals containing carbohydrates. Meal announcements do not require the user to count carbohydrates. Instead, users are asked to categorize the amount of carbohydrates in their meal into general “buckets” (e.g. “usual for me”, “more than usual”, “less than usual”, etc.). From there, the adaptive meal-dose controller of the bionic pancreas makes automatic adjustments based on dosing history from similar past meal announcements.  Over time, the bionic pancreas will adapt and customize these insulin doses to each individual.</p>
<p>The bihormonal configuration of the iLet bionic pancreas will use analog insulin to automatically lower blood-sugar levels and analog glucagon to automatically raise blood-sugar levels.  I liken this two-hormone approach to the accelerator (insulin) and brake (glucagon) of an automobile.  Whereas the insulin-only configuration of the iLet bionic pancreas (and other insulin-only therapies) turn insulin off if blood sugar levels are falling fast or are already low (which is slow to respond because insulin takes a long time to clear, and cannot be taken back, after it is injected), the bihormonal configuration of the iLet can proactively and autonomously raise blood sugar levels by delivering analog glucagon.  As a result of the rapid absorption and rapid action of glucagon, the bionic pancreas is able to rebound blood-sugar levels quickly </p>
<p>We have seen from results of our phase 2 clinical studies that there is less hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) with the bihormonal configuration of both the iPhone bionic pancreas and iLet bionic pancreas than is observed with the insulin-only configuration of the device.</p></div>		</li>
