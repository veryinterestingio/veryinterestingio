			<div class="markdown"><p>I read that all the alternatives bring problems with them, like not feeling when you have to pee, sometimes leaking, or not draining enough. So I thought is it not easier to transplant a new bladder, but I do believe the drugs you would have to take are worse than any of these complications. </p>
<p>Thanks for the info</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a great question. I've told my husband that if he dies first, I'd like to have his bladder. I can't even stay asleep if I have to pee, whereas he wakes up after a full night's sleep and pees for like ten minutes straight (so it seems!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only that, but basically all transplanted organs won't last as long as a non-transplanted organ. For example, I think the statistics is like only 50% of lung transplant patients will still have that functioning lung after 5 years. So a bladder transplant carries a lot of risks and complications for something not as life threatening.</p></div>		</li>
