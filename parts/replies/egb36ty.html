			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the update. This is what I was trying to get at with the blurring of lines part and keeping it simple. I actually interned at a dial up ISP in the late 90s and thought that T3 connection was something awesome then. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Internet use has exploded, even in the last few years.  I got into it here about 6 years ago, and were running about the same number of customers on a 500Mbps fiber.  Now I need 30Gbps of WAN connectivity to allow service if one connection goes down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So all your traffic to Netflix, Google, Amazon are essentially free aside from the lease of the dark fiber? Can you send me the specs/cost of the dark fiber lease via PM? Thanks</p></div>		</li>

Plus they probably wouldn't even make an agreement unless you were bringing thousands of customers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. They're paying for the tens of thousands  of routers (which are tens of thousands of dollars a pop) and the electricity to run them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s free. It’s how the Internet was started and how it continues to operate. You only pay for transit, crossing someone else’s network to reach a destination. If you peer with someone, it’s like joining both of your networks.</p></div>		</li>
