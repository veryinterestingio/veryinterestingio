			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what the paper we subscribed to for 35 years did (before USA Today bought it and it went to crap). An annual comics survey, starting in one Sunday paper, and continuing for several weeks. Results could be mailed in or, in more recent years, the poll completed online. The results were tallied and comics were added or removed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did people actually reply and tell you, &quot;OMG please keep Cathy/Garfield/Family Circus/etc&quot; ?</p>
<p>I can't imagine who could read that canned hash for amusement.  Yes, Garfield is fat. Cathy likes shopping. Mutant dwarves say &quot;Mommy&quot;.  Those not actually premises for a comic strip that anyone could enjoy for a week, let alone years.</p>
<p>I know tastes vary, but suppose you DID think the above ideas were the most brilliant and funny ones ever. Now imagine your comic is produced by a committee whose job is to never change it or attempt a new joke. For 50 years. Now is is still funny?  Really???</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who has had to field those calls, absolutely. Every time the paper removed a strip, the phones would light up. and yes, some people canceled because of it. We're in the process of reevaluating our comic section in an effort to save money. What we're doing is looking at our comics selection per paper and trying to make sure the comics in the entire chain are consistent. One paper had a strip nobody else did? that one is hitting the dumpster and will be replaced by something that's already running somewhere else. I will say that many of the comics you see in the papers are old-timers because you get the best deal on them financially.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what does it cost to run a &quot;Marmaduke&quot; or a &quot;Garfield&quot; in a local paper?  How about the most expensive one, whatever that may be?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm almost your dad's age...  I used to love newspapers too, but times moved on and so did I.</p>
<p>I never loved syndicated comics,  though. I wanted to, but they made it so very hard. (Bil Keane, I'm looking at you here.)</p>
<p>Now that the web is a thing, I do love comics. There's a lot of great stuff out there, and so much of it! I bet most people can now agree that comics are great, even if they don't agree on what makes them great.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, don't tell your dad, but Family Circus WAS briefly extremely funny in the '90s.</p>
<p>..Somebody started crowdsourcing new captions for the old comics.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the characters instantly gained self-awareness and noticed that they were eternal eggheaded midget mutants, they lamented the eternal cutesy hell that they were forced to endure, and (the internet being the internet), some comments went X-rated pretty fast, which was often hilarious. (It's not that mutant eggheaded midget sex clubs are inherently funny, it's that these characters were so rigidly flat and dead for decades, and suddenly they were rebelling against their long torment in every way possible.)</p>
<p>More than that, the characters gained narratives and personal insights that persisted and evolved from strip to strip, even though the originals were presented out of chronological order.  It was as if they suddenly became characters for the first time.</p>
<p>And it was HILARIOUS if you'd grown up reading the same old tinned spam for decades.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I liked them when I was a little kid (pre-internet days, btw).  Of course times change, and I've changed.  Haven't seen a newspaper in at least a decade.  But I can understand old people liking something familiar and comforting from their childhood.</p>
<p>Not all comics need to be or are trying to be 'the most brilliant and funny ever'.  Some are just aiming for a 'sensible chuckle', or invoking a feeling (several of Calvin &amp; Hobbes) or something relatable or telling a serial story, or making a point, or just being weird (much of the Far Side).</p></div>		</li>
