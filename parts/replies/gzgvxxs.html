			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, its weird. The second most common thing i'm seeing is it is definitely regional, so I don't think it was ever a Federally mandated system (in the USA at least) . But i'd say 80+% of the replies so far are just guesses and conjecture. I was hoping a historian would be able to legitimize my curiosity, but I think I posted to the wrong Sub. Maybe a history subreddit? IDK.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think your choice of subreddit is the issue. The issue is that there is no known answer to your question</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely regional, because coming from southwest Michigan, I grew up thinking that F was only used in movies and shows to specify failure. Throughout my entire school experience (graduated '12) it was A through E for grading.
Just now learning that people actually have used it in real life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that's like the grading system in Germany. They have 1 2 3 4 as positive grades and 5 and 6 as negative ones. I always thought that's weird. Here in Austria it's like in most of the US. 1 2 3 4 is positive, 5 is negative.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The US tends to use a GPA where 4 and 3 and considered positive, 2 can be neutral to bad, and 1 and 0 are essentially failing grades. This is a decimal system, not a category system like the ABCDF system.</p></div>		</li>
