			<div class="markdown"><p>The story of the first sea-worthy clock is pretty interesting. The inventor's name was John Harrison, and it ended up being his life's work. There's a good book about the entire saga called <em>Longitude</em>, documenting the drama between clock makers and astronomers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually took a course in college about the History of Science and it definitely was my favorite course. Just look for anything in that vein and you can just get lost in it.</p>
<p>Even in that blurb I glossed over &quot;how do you find the sin of an angle in ancient times&quot; which you don't even think about until it gets brought up. The full story behind Gallileo (or was it copernicus? I get the two confused after all this time) and the catholic church gets juicy and the spark notes of the matter never reach the good stuff.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's sad that I can't immediately assume that's a joke in this day and age. I'm still going to assume it's a joke for my own sanity.  </p>
<p>It boggles my mind that in ancient times they can get a number close to what we had in modern time, that you could replicate that same test, and get the same result... but even with cameras and a man on the moon there are people who think it's flat...</p></div>		</li>
