			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I was listening to a podcast (99% Invisible) the other day about the history of luxury brand knockoffs. Someone asked this exact question and the industry person they had on said that for many of those brands, it's basically 3D billboard space. They don't really think they'll sell very much, and they aren't usually staffed or stocked too much, either. The stores are more there to advertise that this is a High Profile Brand that has Expensive Luxury Things. It's hard to think of a physical space you could advertise where a single thing (store, billboard, magazine page, etc) could get such an enormous and constantly-changing audience.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Plus, customers who touch a product are more likely to buy it, and an airport provides potential customers an opportunity to touch a product they might not otherwise encounter in their normal lives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve bought an Hermes scarf out of boredom on a long layover at Heathrow. That’s why I don’t window shop anymore (well pre-Covid) in the airports...just go straight to the Admiral’s club and wait for my flight. Long flights, plus a little booze, makes for poor choices.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems like it wouldn't work well. The poor people have nothing better to do, will wander in, finger the merch, and never buy it. The rich people will be in the lounge with a free drink, where Jesus intended.</p>
<p>But I guess they wouldn't do it if they didn't get a return on it somewhere. Or at least believe they do.</p></div>		</li>

Munich airport has a full supermarket inside.</p></div>		</li>
