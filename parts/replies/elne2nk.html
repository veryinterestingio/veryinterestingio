			<div class="markdown"><p>For now, there is no comprehensive theory of molecular aging, and i think it would be the first step to take to have any chances at immortality, if such a thing is possible anyway. Right now, we can modify some discrete molecular pathways to extend the lifespan of some simple organisms such as worm or mice, far from immortality. Aging is the failure of many processes, coordinated in the whole body, understanding how aging is also so synchronized would be very interesting. Disclaimer: i am molecular biologist working in brain aging.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is not unreasonable to think that the rate of discovery over our current lives will at least equal that of previous generations. If you accept that assumption, look back in time to when major scientific revolutions occurred. A lot of them are more recent than it feels... just 100 years ago we were remarkably clueless about how life worked at a molecular level at all. A relevant example: DNA was discovered less than 100 years ago.</p>
<p>Of course it's easy to run away with optimism, as folks like Ray Kurzweil and Craig Venter have done. In reality, I suspect that while the rate of discoveries may be rapid, they will not come without their own problems, and attempts to translate discoveries into practical treatments will be slowed by technological limitations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a lot of progress, but the complexity is only increasing exponentially, would be on the theoretical level and technical. Knowledge only makes things more complicated, which is quite paradoxical.... Another thing to consider, is that science have to be more and more public, so the discovery rate is tied to public interests (and political). The reason being that science cost more and more, the cost of one nature paper (top journal) can easily rate in million dollars, so to have funding you have to justify and you have stay within the boundaries of what is ethically tolerated (especially in biology, for obvious reasons). I personally doubt that in my lifetime, the world would change as much as from 1900 to 2000.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting. Thanks for answering. However, there is a immortal jellyfish, which is from a biological point of view technically immortal. Couldn't we use them as examples and extract certain DNA pathways to study how it works and thus use the knowledge to edit human DNA?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is multiple things to be considered. First, aging in human (or complex eucaryotes such as mammals) differ from jellyfish and the like. Why ? Because human keep a very low amount of stem cells at the adult age, and very high amount of highly differentiated cells, that the price to pay for tissue formation and complexity : specialization. Simple organisms don't need such a high range of differentiation and keep what we call 'primordial' stem cells that divide almost infinitly. So there is a problematic balance : if you divide, you don't specialize, if you specialize, you stop dividing (so cannot replace). Human stem cells are very potent during embryonic stages and then stop (they are dormant). So it is really hard to simply say 'lets take what happen to jellyfish and transpose to human' because of fundamentally different systems. Still, there knowledge to be gathered in the study of these species for sure!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Based on their reply (specifically, the example of the pigs) I think they might have misunderstood the question. &quot;Biological immortality&quot; is a phrase I've heard uttered mostly by futurists. The question would have been better had it asked about treatments for medical conditions related to senescence - cancers, dementia, immune system decline, etc.</p>
<p>Treat those things effectively enough, and let the cosmetics industry to the rest, and what is that if not anti-aging? Maybe not immortality, but it's a good start.</p></div>		</li>
