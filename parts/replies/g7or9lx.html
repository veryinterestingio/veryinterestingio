(The air molecules would be much less denser, however, + I don't really know about the effects of gravity on air molecules.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you are correct.  See density gradient for further reading about gravity vs air.  While it is based on a larger scale (i.e. ground surface to atmosphere) I do believe the principle remains the same.    In our example, it would be a minimal amount of force, but it would still exists.
I’m not going to lie, physics of gases are out of my wheel house but I’ll share what I know, anyone else feel free to correct me.   We try super duper hard to keep gases out of pipes, it makes for bad days.</p></div>		</li>
