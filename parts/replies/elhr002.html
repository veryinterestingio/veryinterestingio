			<div class="markdown"><p>Many tidal devices under development are scaled for low flow tidal environments (\~1m/sec, or less than 2m of tidal range). In addition to matching the tidal resource, consideration is being given to providing power for smaller end uses, for example, instead of providing large amounts of electricity to the national power grid, tidal (and wave) devices could provide power to small remote coastal communities and islands, or for ocean observation sensors. These end uses would also use smaller machines, suited to the environment. </p>
