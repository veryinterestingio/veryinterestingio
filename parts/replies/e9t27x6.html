			<div class="markdown"><p>I kinda not like that video, he uses the digital representation of a song to calculate number of possible different songs, and the number he calculates is wrong because 1. He's considering a lot of songs that are literally the same to be completely different songs. 2. He considers songs that are not really songs.. and so on. The problem is basically he didn't took a musical approach to it, but a physical one. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is the difference between an artist and a mathematician.  </p>
<p>An artist would say it is the same, but a mathematician would argue the movie is different because of the one pixel.  </p>
<p>This also raises the question, what is a melody.  Google says, &quot;a sequence of single notes that is musically satisfying.&quot;  </p>
<p>So, to argue which is: vsauce calculated amount is incorect because he did not  differentiate by more than a single note or come up with melodies which are pleasing.  This is the wrong argument to make to disprove his count.  The first part is supported by google and the second is subjective and dependent on the listener.</p>
<p>Yes, there are meldies which could be removed by similarity, but you have to define more rigous rules to apply then what vsauce did.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That a good point. It seems we would have to first figure out an average baseline for the minimum of what people see as different</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's just the start of the video though, he's putting an upper bound on the number of different 5 min audio tracks. It's mainly to make the point that the number of possible audio tracks is essentially finite (though huge).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, hiatus would be more accurate. Michael and Co. are still posting on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClq42foiSgl7sSpLupnugGA" target="_blank">DONG</a>, and likely working on the next season of Mind Field. Earlier this year he was doing the Brain Candy tour with Adam Savage but the tour was abruptly canceled in April without any sort of explanation. </p>
<p>Vsauce 2 and Vsauce 3 are still posting content. Hopefully it's just that, a hiatus until he can get room on his plate. I don't think its purposely not being updated.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Vsauce3 is about all that’s left, but even his output seems to have declined over the last two years</p></div>		</li>
