			<div class="markdown"><p>EASA has similar rules, but the FAA mandates a maximum duty period of 14 hours with a maximum flight time of 8 hours for commercial pilots per day.  Sure people are upset when their flight is delayed, but half the time it happens is because the crew is (or could become) “over clocked” and a relief crew has to come in. If a pilot exceeds the 8 hours flight time by one second, they have to be off duty to rest for an extended amount of time and likely can’t even fly the next day. There is zero tolerance for exceeding a 14 hour “duty day” which is simply the time a pilot has to be present and available to do a flight, even if all they end up doing is sleeping in the nap room at the airport. </p>
<p>Just to further your point, fatigue kills an enormous amount of people. Sleep deprivation can inhibit alertness and decision making worse than drunkenness at times. The only reason we have these rules is because one mistake is considered a national tragedy while doctors presumably only kill one person at a time. I wish there was protection and support for physicians.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Perfect example is the Libby Zion Law. Named after Libby Zion who died due to overworked doctors. </p>
<p>In Denmark the max shifts are 17 hours and you always have the day after (the morning you wake up) off to sleep. So you have a right to have something along the lines of 24 hours without work afterwards. Usually you have the day after that off as well, but not always.</p>
<p>Also I might add that AFAIK we used to have weekend shifts and 24 hour shifts here as well, but we went away from it, probably to avoid overworked doctors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, as a patient I can confirm it's systemic after what you said.
After many patient visits, especially with my father (who had vascular issues) the US system has systemic issues...
Patients are in holding in ER (ED) after stabilized just waiting for other departments to do their job...sometimes discharge can take hour(s).
Admission... Been more than one occasion that patient was holding for 3-6 hours waiting for a wars to ok transportation because nurses are too busy with patient load, understaffed, or just damn lazy and don't want to have to add a patient before shift change in a few hours so the patient ties up an emergency dept bed.</p>
<p>Seen this at multiple large hospitals. It's infuriating to the ER staff, patients and patient family but it persists. Thia was before the now pronounced nursing and doctor shortage we are living through too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes we are extremely busy. Such is the nature of acute medicine.</p>
<p>It does happen that it can take a few hours to get discharged, due to other patients piling up. It's pretty rare though, since we need the beds.</p></div>		</li>
