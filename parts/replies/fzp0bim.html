			<div class="markdown"><p>I came here to say this. </p>
<p>For an example, Finland was very underdeveloped for a very long time. Officials wanted to teach people, but parents didn't want to send their children to school since thet were needed at home, to work on the fields. So Finland had a brilliant idea: free food for all pupils! A lot of poor parents would senf their kids to school just to receive that free meal! To this day, it's one of the foundations of Finnish education.</p>
<p>Also, specialization is a key feature. Millenials (at least in US) are often bashed for not knowing generic crafting skills (woodworking etc.), but all that is quite obsolete already. Today there's a cheap, convenient and commercial solution to every problem. You can just focus on doing your own special thing. And thanks to the internet, you can still have a stupidly large customer/fan base.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think it's still a valuable skill to have if you're able to fix things around your house or even build new things, build new furniture for example. I think there's lots of value in the DIY ethic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course. Poor choice of words on my part. What I meant is that what was once considered basic life skills, are no longer necessary. They maybe economical and ecological, but not necessary. I don't need to craft, cook, clean, repair, and yet I can provide a safe and healthy life for my family doing the one thing I'm very good at (at a global market level).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard of people who call someone to change their lightbulbs, a fucking lightbulb, it's one of the simplest things ever, as a kid my parents didn't want me to try to change them (for obvious reasons), they taught me once, and once is enough, in fact it might have been actually overkill, all you need to do is turn the fucking thing, I could figure that out on my own</p></div>		</li>

<p>The Second Industrial Revolution. The Industrial Revolution is usually classified as starting in the 1760s-1770s. Think water wheels and textile mills vs coal and steel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's what makes me more and more irritated at the current state of labor in the US. Working 40 hours a week or more with little to no vacation time until you're so old you might just die in a few years isn't promotive of ingenuity. People didn't used to work this long or as hard and with a fear of not retiring in a timely manner. Hence the US having so many groundbreaking innovations. How does it expect to continue being an industry leader when it's turning it's public into labor drones and sucking up all their free time. How are people supposed to think and innovate when you bleed them dry?</p>
<p>Right now the US wants innovation and it wants jobs and new industry leaders to make those jobs. But at the same time it wants to exploit the working class so much it hardly gives them a chance to enjoy life, let alone actually think. Talk about wanting to have your cake and eat it too. &quot;I want geniuses and mindless drones all at the same time, coming from the same place&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with your irritation. A point about the horrors of capitalism.  I like to say capitalism has zero morality.  So despite the massive acceleration in innovation starting in 1700, it has been horrible. It is interesting to me to consider that it's government cooperation with the wage workers that must drive the morality. I don't expect capitalists to have ANY morality. But I do see a living wage that supports a strong middle class as the harbinger of moral treatment of people. Unfortunately that living wage has eroded since 1980 and conmesurate with that erosion has come a crisis for capitalism. But I am optimistic we will solve this crisis - we invented consumerism to get out of the great depression.  Innovate!</p>
<p>What set England apart is geography on water as the clearinghouse of all the best ideas and discoveries from the newly unified world, among Europe's stable small competitive states that uniquely encouraged capitalism, as a threshold of people OFF the farms crossed halfway. </p>
<p>Entrepreneurs are encouraged by the government. People HAVE to enhance their resumes. And entrepreneurs find ways to use these people. That dynamic has most people very concerned about their own productivity, and unlocks innovation in an unprecedented acceleration EVER SINCE, taking over the world faster than any previous human invention.</p>
<p>This isn't my idea - I love it though. Made sense of the whole world for me after Trump 2016 shook the foundation.</p>
<p>Detail:
Why 1700, why not earlier?  Entrepreneurs innovated a thousand years ago in the burst of progress in China - when it was split in three. </p>
<p>But the state suppressed entrepreneurs when China was consolidated again.
States suppress or encourage entrepreneurs  - Europe's durable pattern. Why they do is fascinating. China encouraged commercial activity as a way to survive that era of competition and vastly diminished resources due to the split. </p>
<p>The enclosure movement is very cool - getting to 50% of the people working for wages allowed the breakthru in massive acceleration of innovation. </p>
<p>The year 1700 threshold in England is somewhat arbitrary and coincides with 50% people who didn't have land, so depended on wages.  I think the statistic is 43% in 1683, per David Christian lecture.</p></div>		</li>
