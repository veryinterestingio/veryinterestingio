			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol I mean both hardwood and carpet! Because I have kids and pets, most of the soil left on my floors AFTER I VACUUM is protein based - food drips, pee, etc. Vacuuming takes care of the dirt particles, 1T of POWDERED Tide + 1/4C bleach in 1 gal. boiling water is what I mop my floors with. I use 1T powdered Tide in water in the tank of my carpet shampooer machine for the same reason.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Just want to add: people should be careful about mixing household cleaners. You could create poison gas if you don't know what you are doing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow that’s interesting, I never really thought about the different soaps until this whole thread. We have tile and polyvinyl flooring in different parts, we usually used white vinegar for the tile and essential oil in water for the pvf, since even though it’s water safe I don’t want to hurt the finish or make a slip n slide in the back half of the house.</p>
<p>I love the smell of tide, so if it wouldn’t be a problem for our kind of flirting I would BFF interested in trying it out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Except dish soap or any high suds soap into a dishwasher, unless you like filling your house with bubbles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to this, there’s differences between shampoo/soap used for your hair and body wash/soap used for the rest. The differences really do lie in what it’s intended to lift and how intensely it does that.</p>
<p>My question is: why the difference in suds? Why does that matter and why can’t it all be low suds?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve heard that. I have a shampoo that does not lather and does not have SLS since I’ve learned that bubbles don’t mean clean, but...</p>
<p>Is it more trouble to add the suds or ensure they don’t suds up (dishwasher), if detergent has a medium suds?</p></div>		</li>
