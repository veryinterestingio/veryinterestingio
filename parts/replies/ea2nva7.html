			<div class="markdown"><p>This right here. OP if you want to do some beyond ELI5 reading check out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle#Variants" target="_blank">Weak Anthropic Principle</a>. Basically we often underestimate the role of pure chance because we are the beneficiaries. </p>
<p>Think of the lottery. The person who wins the jackpot often attributes their luck to extraordinary reasons - divine intervention (&quot;I prayed to win and I did it's a miracle!&quot;), some pseudo-scientific faux system (&quot;I've been trying different numbers for years I knew I'd crack it&quot;), or some other supernatural connection (&quot;I knew my daughters birthday was a lucky number&quot;). </p>
<p>But the rest of us who lost are able to objectively see the real reason - chance. Plain and simple. Hundreds of millions of tickets sold, one person was gonna win and millions were gonna lose. There was nothing special about it. It just seems that way when you're the winner. </p>
<p>The weak anthropic principle extends this concept. We think a lot of the various attributes of our planet and universe are somehow crafted for our benefit (it's this line of thinking that leads to people believing in Intelligent Design). But really we are just the evolutionary &quot;winners&quot;. Most of these attributes are just the result of random interactions of different materials on our planet and in space. But we evolved to benefit from them, so they seem &quot;special&quot; when they are not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dont remember the exact quote, but Douglas Adams once compared the idea that this world was created perfectly for us to a puddle marveling at how perfect the dent in the ground was for it. The puddle surmises that a hole that captures it's shape so perfectly could not have happened by chance, and that both its water and the hole must have been created for each other.</p>
<p>Of course, we know that water simply adapts and changes shape to fill whatever container it's in.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also almost all of our Oxygen comes from phytoplankton, tiny plants that live on the surface of the ocean, not trees.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wait, what? This is the first I've heard about this! And I'm almost 40! Everything I've ever known has been a lie...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly true. Which is why we should be SO concerned about polluting our oceans. If the phytoplankton die ...so do we.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and to be more specific for Lurker, that pollution includes greenhouse gases, since higher temperatures in the oceans affect the phytoplankton.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>/u/Middledr 's not actually right about this.  In total, land plants cause about twice as much &quot;Net primary production&quot; of organic carbon and oxygen as ocean plants.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In ecology, primary production is the synthesis of organic compounds from atmospheric or aqueous carbon dioxide. It principally occurs through the process of photosynthesis, which uses light as its source of energy, but it also occurs through chemosynthesis, which uses the oxidation or reduction of inorganic chemical compounds as its source of energy. Almost all life on Earth relies directly or indirectly on primary production. The organisms responsible for primary production are known as primary producers or autotrophs, and form the base of the food chain. In terrestrial ecoregions, these are mainly plants, while in aquatic ecoregions algae predominate in this role. Ecologists distinguish primary production as either net or gross, the former accounting for losses to processes such as cellular respiration, the latter not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And your claim is NPP translates directly to net oxygen produced?</p>
<p>I don't see that statement backed up by your link. You seem to have substituted &quot;oxygen&quot; in place of organic compounds.</p></div>		</li>
