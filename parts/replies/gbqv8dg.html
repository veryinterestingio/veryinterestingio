<p>Very good news either way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/11/09/vaccine-efficacy-data" target="_blank">“What does this mean for the pandemic vaccine effort in general? The first big take-away is that coronavirus vaccines can work. I have already said many times (here and in interviews) that I thought that this would be the case, but now we finally have proof. The worst “oh-God-no-vaccine” case is now disposed of. And since all of the vaccines are targeting the same Spike protein, it is highly likely that they are all going to work. There may well be differences between them, in safety, level of efficacy across different patient groups, and duration, but since all of them have shown robust antibody responses in Phase I trials, I think we can now connect those dots and say that we can expect positive data from all of them.”</a></p>

<p>If the remaining trials are successful we could get billions more doses for 2021.</p>
<p>Looking good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So assuming this gives you immunity for a limited period, is it possible to inoculate enough people to make the virus go extinct in humans? Or will this be a seasonal vaccine like the flu, but maybe 3x/yr instead of winter?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't this also mean we are really putting all of our eggs into one basket if they all target the same spike protein? What happens with a mutation like they are seeing among the cluster 5 mink population in Denmark? Can we just tailor our vaccine to the new mutation or is it starting over from scratch?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hopping on this to ask:    Is 2 months safety typical for a vaccine?   Most of the drugs I work on need ~9 months safety on one of our phase 3 studies before submission.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just as an aside to that: vaccine studys are not usually conducted amongst such a widespread outbreak. Earlier Phase 3 data is more reliable in the current circumstances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really depends on the vaccine, and the extent of the public health crisis.</p>
<p>Polio, for instance: was not statistically significant at the regular level (0.05). Modern vaccines and medical treatments go after 0.001 statistical reliability levels, polio went ahead with 0.10 (there's a 1:10 chance the polio vaccine wouldn't actually work, and we were just seeing an anomoly) </p>
<p>There's not really a 'normal range' for combatting a threat that is grinding economies to the bone and killing millions of people.</p>
<p>What did happen in this case, is governments pre-bought vaccine doses for their populations.  This enabled Pfizer, GSK, and others to start mass production of the vaccines once they finished Phase 1 (already bought and paid for, so no risk to them)</p>
<p>The drug development timelines are always suggestions, and are typically so drawn out to minimize the potential investment loss on the product.  (why rush into phase 3 until you're sure you have a viable candidate?).</p>
<p>These timelines are compressed, but that doesn't mean they're short-circuiting the statistical rigor, mostly just crashing the investment costs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vaccines get one or two doses, a drug for lets say hypertension is taken every day.  Once the vaccine produces an immune response, the safety risk diminishes by day.  Also you have an objective measure here (antibody titer), vs. a more subjective evaluation for most drugs ala &quot;how do you feel today&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
