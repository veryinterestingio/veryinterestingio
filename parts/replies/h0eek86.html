			<div class="markdown"><p>Covid research also took most of our resources - so where a lab would have to wait to order things in or were limited in funding, covid labs were pushed to the top of the queue and everyone else had to wait.</p>
<p>Our lab has finally recieved an order for PCR reagents that we ordered 9 months ago, because all the manufacturers ran out of the <em>raw</em> materials to make them, since all of it went to covid labs. </p>
<p>A lot of our research time is waiting for grants and approvals.</p>
<p>If everyone was always at the top of the queue for approvals,  equipment etc. and if people were just throwing money at us without us having to spend months asking, we'd have things done in no time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I used to work for a medical device company and the rule was that the FDA was supposed to review our paperwork within 90 days of submitting. For one submission (a new version of one of our products, nothing complicated), they rejected it on day 89. I don't remember the reason, so it must not have been something major.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Usually those 'typographical errors' aren't cause for rejection FWIW.</p>
<p>The big thing is just getting to the front of the line. Every non-COVID review got pushed to the side or from another point of view - the vaccines/therapeutics were able to jump to the front of the line using a fast pass.</p></div>		</li>
