			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve always wondered why mid-winter is worse.  If anything people are spending less time outside coming in contact with each other.  Except the holidays of course.  Maybe that’s the problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most transmitted communal disseases actually are airborne pathogens, generally a single germ is not enough to infect you, so it is going to be more prolific in places where people are more closely packed together and ventilation is poor, so winter indoors is where it spreads best, as people spend more time indoors and ventilate less because of it being cold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve heard that the vaccine is most capable for about 3 months. I wonder if this is related to the fact that they push so hard to have vaccinations done in October that by the time you’ve made it to Jan or Feb it’s not as effective?? I’m not saying don’t get vaccinated in October because if we all pushed it off til December the map might turn brown much sooner??</p></div>		</li>

<p>Word on the street is that this year will be the worst in a decade.</p></div>		</li>
