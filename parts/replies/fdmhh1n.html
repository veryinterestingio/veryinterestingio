			<div class="markdown"><p>You're very welcome, lovely human. I saw the post, knew where to find someone who had similar curiosity, and shared their recorded thoughts. I didn't do much but see someone smarter than I think and talk about this exact phenomenon. No point in knowing something if you keep it to yourself, especially when you didn't do any of the work ;)</p></div>		</li>
