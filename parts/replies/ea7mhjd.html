			<div class="markdown"><p>You sound kind of like an expert...idk. I have depression and I struggle a lot with it...especially in the last year or so.</p>
<p>One of the things my therapist talked about (he didn't KNOW...he was just speculating cuz I asked) was that technology/communication might be part of it. </p>
<p>I'm not saying technology itself, but the effects of it. With social media, television, radio...the internet in general...we constantly see ads for things we can't afford, people we wish we could switch places with, bad things happening on the other side of the world...things like this are thrown at us constantly. </p>
<p>And, in my example, there are a lot of days where, maybe my depression isn't BAD BAD, but I'm kind of just trying to get by, hold it together. I imagine that would be easier to do when the world was a smaller place, but more information getting thrown your way....well eventually SOMETHING will bring your mood down, and very rarely does any new information from the outside world HELP.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So...it was probably just as common in the past...maybe a little more or less. However, it might have been a little easier for people with it to get by without a serious trigger. So, it had less of an impact on people's lives.</p></div>		</li>

Also advertisers are the scum of the earth and way worse off than you could ever be in ways you may not realize. Watch Mad Men if you want an idea of this, although it should be clear in principle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. Better understanding creates a system for better reporting and documentation.
The only reason things seem more prevalent is because we weren't observing the issues that were being swept under the rug years ago. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You seem to discount the possibility that they are more prevalent today, which is quite reasonable.</p>
<p>Just because issues used to be ignored, doesn't mean they don't occur more often today. This is an invalid logical jump.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree that it is illogical. I tend to attempt intuition versus purely logical applications in life due to being a creative dickhead with a decreased want to logic my face off.
In saying that...
I could argue that the possible increase in prevalence is due to an increased population size, which in turn skews the data we observe.
But
This is a open ended debate based on personal observation versus scientific stuffs. If people were to read this and take it as gospel I would worry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a theory that requires evidence. Anyone claiming that depression is actually more common now would have to demonstrating that it isn't just increased reporting of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That idea makes a lot of sense, but if you narrow the time frame down - prevalence does seem to be increasing. This is based mostly on surveys that have been going  back many decades (at least the last 80 years or so).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The increase in mental health issues is most consistent between the 1930s and the early 1990s. There is little doubt that anxiety and depression increased between these decades. After that, trend shows an inconsistent pattern, with some measures leveling off at historically high levels, some continuing to increase, and others declining.Â </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now this does contrast with suicide rates, which have fallen.  But the counter argument is that we are treating those with the most severe depression better. (also suicide doesn't necessarily line up well with depression rates - Japan for example has fairly high suicide rates but low depression rates).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aye!
You can also cite the terms and application of diagnoses as being a way to spread out the umbrella that previously captured all single diagnoses (like mania), but now applies the catagoization which, in turn, can put those diagnoses outside the previously catagorized diagnosis.
If that makes any sense?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the biblical apocalypse has always apparently been looming, not to mention a much lower scientific understanding that likely lead to misapprehensions of apocalyptic possibilities, as well as lower medical standards drastically increasing the possibility of epidemic disease.</p>
<p>I think depression and anxiety is more prevalent thanks to nihilistic ideologies, social interconnectedness, career pressures, political climate, drug use (legal and illegal), medical malpractice, negligence of health, and the list goes on and on. None of which predominantly applied to previous societies.</p></div>		</li>
