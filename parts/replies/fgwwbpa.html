			<div class="markdown"><p>I am by no means an authority (so there could be exceptions to the general things I know/factors I forget)  on this but I would imagine, generally with any receptor, genetics could sure play a factor in any of the mechanisms of binding to the receptor to any of the downstream pathways triggered, development could play a factor (penetrance in a sense - I.e is the gene expressed fully) and of course how you live your life and interact with that receptor. Again, I’m not an expert but, similarly to drugs, I would imagine you could build a tolerance to spicy food by continuously exposing yourself to spicier and spicier foods and the receptors would respond and react appropriately to continued stimulus/binding leading to more long term changes.</p>
<p>Edit -tldr: essentially the same idea as nature plus nurture-  a combination of genetics and how you live your life</p></div>		</li>

<p>I will now be conditioning myself to withstand spicier and spicer hot sauces.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You definitely build and can lose tolerance. I went on a multi-month hot sauce kick and by the end I could eat (what most people would consider) extremely hot sauces without much of an issue. I stopped eating it and like 6 months later I ordered the mango habanero sauce wings(not the hottest they offer but it's up there) at buffalo wild wings and I couldn't eat more than 2 because my mouth was on fire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In one study they only found minor differences in how sensitive people are to hot food. The difference was simply that people who enjoy spicy things enjoy the burn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's strange. I have a higher spice tolerance than average and I'll be surprised when ppl say some things are spicy because I truly don't feel the sensation on foods that are only a little spicy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Partially genetics (some people have more or less of these receptors) but also other factors. You definitely can gain a tolerance and get desensitized. Also fun fact testosterone is an antagonist of Trpv1 so it blocks the sensation</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To put it in a different way: TRPV1 was evolved to tell our bodies something is dangerous or noxious. It responds to acid and heat, producing a pain response to tell the body &quot;this is dangerous&quot; (it does not regulate temperature, just says that something is too hot). Some plants have developed chemicals that target TRPV1 to deter mammals from eating them (e.g. capsaicin from chili peppers). These chemicals essentially lower the threshold that TRPV1 responds to heat, making body temperature seem hot and making us overall hypersensitive to heat. In a similar way, spicy foods combined with acid foods (like lemons) also produce a greater pain response.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The latter part of this is how I've always explained spicy to my kids. Spicy makes you feel your own body heat, hot foods would increase local heat of that area making them more hot. Why cold left overs the next day may not be nearly as spicy or cold water may provide temporary relief by reducing local temp of body, and finally using something fat based like milk might help more by moving the capsaicin out of the mouth (though i dont find it helps that much anyway).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh cool - I did not know how capsaicin specifically interacts with TRPV1.  As I mentioned in my comment - definitely not something I'm super familiar with so it's nice to have a more nuanced/comprehensive response like yours!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TRPV1 was actually named for the fact capsaicin binds it. The V stands for vanilloid,  which is the chemical portion of capsaicin (and many other molecules that activate TRPV1) that is most important for activating TRPV1</p></div>		</li>
