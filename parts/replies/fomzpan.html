<p>When it is set, screenshots cannot be taken (it'll simply say &quot;Can't take a screenshot now.&quot;) and if the screen recorder is running the App will just look like a black screen on the video.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This only tells you that a screenshot was already taken, it can’t prevent it. </p>
<p>What Apple does have baked in is the ability for the app to tell iOS that the video being played is protected by DRM and then the operating system won’t allow a screenshot to work. There are some crafty libraries that work on top of this feature by creating their own UI controls which present to the OS as DRM-protected video and thus won’t allow a screenshot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This reminds me of an incredible workaround I did a while ago that I still can't believe actually worked.</p>
<p>In the UK you can buy this thing called a railcard, which gives you 33% off all train tickets for a year. Well mine was about to expire, so instead of buying a new one, I decided to cheat the system. </p>
<p>The railcard was an app, which simply showed an orange screen, an ID photo, an expiry date, and a logo that faded through a few different colours over time, presumably to make it harder to fake.</p>
<p>I tried to screen record the railcard (with the intention that I could photoshop the expiry date), but the app flagged it, and just gave me a black screen.</p>
<p>After many hours, I came up with a plan. I created a virtual machine on my phone, within which I was able to turn off, system-wide, the flag that told apps the screen was being recorded. Then from the virtual machine I cast the screen to my PC, and used a screen recorder to record a video of my phone's screen onto my PC. From there I spent far, far too long in a video editor changing the expiry date and trying to keep it looking as legit as possible. After all this, I had a video of what the railcard app looks like, but with the expiry date pushed back a year, which I could pull up on my phone when anyone asked to see my railcard.</p>
<p>It worked perfectly, and I used it several times, with nobody ever suspecting a thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alternatively of you're on iOS you can plug your phone into a computer and then pull up the your phone screen using the default Quicktime player and then record that screen with a different recording software OBS for example. if you were to record with the quicktime player it would throw the notification but if you record the quicktime player window with another program it doesn't throw the same notification to your phone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think these apps also come with a scanner device, along with a QR code that changes with time. Without knowing the seed (?) that the pattern is started with, you'd be unable to fake the QR codes, and you'd be detected.</p>
<p>*This is a hypothesis on how the QR codes are generated, I have never actually tried digging into it deeply</p></div>		</li>
