<p>It's hard to answer your question without knowing the child's age. The answer is very different, say, at 2 years old, at 5 or at 10.</p>
<p>This being said, generally speaking, children who end up harming themselves to get what they want learned that behavior somewhere, which leads me to think that their parents need to seriously revise their strategies.  So the first step into steering your cousin away from that behavior is for their parents to change their own behavior.  Negative and positive reinforcement is really, really not an effective method to raise children, because (amongst other reasons) it promotes the development of extrinsic motivators rather than <a href="http://www.psychologyconcepts.com/drive-the-surprising-truth-about-what-motivates-us-daniel-pink/" target="_blank">intrinsic motivators</a>. </p>
<p>Also, children never act out without a reason for it stemming from an unmet <a href="http://www.psychologyconcepts.com/maslows-hierarchy-of-needs/" target="_blank">need</a>. So one needs to identify what fundamental need is currently lacking; for instance if their parents are not providing enough high quality attention to meet his need for love and belonging, he may have developed this way to get the attention he desperately needs.</p>
<p>Beside age, can you give me a bit more information about their types of dynamics? in which situation does he act that way? Are parents together or separated? Both working or at home? Many other kids? All of theses factors will help me help further.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the detailed reply. I think she started back at around age 5. Both parents used to work but her mother stopped once she moved to Canada. Her dad still works in Asia and visits 3-4 times a year. They are married with her as the only child. From my interactions and observations with her, she's more isolated in her own world now that she's more grown up and have access to the internet. (Example, she's always on earphones even during a family dinner - except when food is served).</p></div>		</li>

<p>If positive punishment damages a child's attachment to the parent (from your first post here), and then the quoted statement that pos/neg reinforcement is not effective due to its affect on motivators, it sounds like you're saying the only healthy intervention is negative punishment.  Would you be willing to elaborate on this or what I'm missing?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. This needs to be much higher up in the comments. I learned about this in a brochure from Noodle Soup where it talked about how a child doesn't understand...etc. I wish you could spend some time with our family and help us along the way. Thank you for what you do and for helping educate parentd.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think it is raising steadily now; but i was frustrated too when I saw the current post at the top of this thread... it's all about behaviorism and it assumes that the only way to replace spanking is to use less invasive behavior-control methods :-/</p>

<p>My pleasure. I think the world can be a better place if we learn to be better parents! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, this sounds like possible evidence for the notion of </p>
<p>being spanked in childhood---&gt; being into BDSM as an adult. </p>
<p>What do you think?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's unlikely as we can find both people who were and weren't spanked into bdsm.</p>
<p>What <em>is</em> strongly correlated however is that almost 100% of convicted criminals of violent crimes were spanked in their youth. (to be clear: spanking does not mean you will turn out to be a criminal, but almost every criminal were spanked)</p>
<p>Bdsm, at least <em>healthy</em> bdsm, on the flip side, is a game that is both consensual and safe. </p></div>		</li>
