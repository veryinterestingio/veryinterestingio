<p>If we find life in a methane ocean, it will be very hard to discern since we have no idea what biomarkers we're looking for, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even more so, we know how to look for indirect signs that there are doctors.</p>
<p>You could stand far away with a pair of binoculars and still see things like ambulances pulling up to the hospital or pickup electrical signals like blips that you know come from an MRI machine running, whereas it would be hard to do the same for doctors in a library.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;But that's nothing like any life form on Earth&quot; </p>
<p>Exactly. That's what would make it so weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We are carbon-based life forms that are composed mostly of water. </p>
<p>The top three <a href="https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/70931/why-are-some-elements-more-abundant-than-others-in-the-universe" target="_blank">most abundant non-noble-gas elements in the Milky Way</a> are hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon... hey, just like what we’re made of! We’re bargain-bin life forms made from what was lying around. </p>
<p>Statistically, if we want to look for life in the galaxy, it’s also going to be carbon-based and living off of water (since those combinations of molecules are most stable).</p>
<p>It’s also possible for life to exist in an ammonium environment instead of water, or maybe be completely sulfur-based instead of carbon, but they’d be less common. </p>
<p>So we might as well look for life in the Universe that is similar to us, since we have no reason to believe that we’re <em>that</em> chemically unique (aside from the whole, you know, being alive thing).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>isn't it also true that non-carbon based life forms might have to exist in extreme heat or cold or something? so even if we did find them it would be difficult for us to cohabitate &amp; learn from each other?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but we would have a harder time recognizing that. Resources are limited and we have to start with what we have observed before and that is life needs water. We could be the exception which means we are looking in the wrong place but it's a staying point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really, we don't base our search for life on the fact that Earth life needs water but on the way chemistry works and what we know about the availability of elements in the universe.</p>
