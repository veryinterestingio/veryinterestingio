			<div class="markdown"><p>This is more confusion between hedging strategies and how what we call “hedge funds” typically operate now.  The modern hedge fund is really just a managed investment with far fewer rules and regulations on their activities than your typical fund.  They have less regulation because only SEC accredited investors (read: high net worth individuals) are allowed to invest.  In theory, that keeps your average Joe from losing his life savings when some fund’s crazy investment strategy goes sideways.  In practice, hedge funds have attracted some extremely bright people who have developed novel (well, maybe not quite so novel by now) ways to generate profits that far outperform the market and only the wealthy are allowed to participate.</p>
<p>Sure, these funds might employ some hedging strategies but they’re far more likely to be working with strategies like high frequency trading using quantitative analysis, exotic derivatives, non-traditional assets, etc... often while highly leveraged.  What started as a hedge has become rich people shoving money at smart people to make them richer through whatever means possible and, if not clearly legal, at least difficult to take enforcement action on.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Part of the reason GME was so highly shorted, is because a lot of other retailers are viewed as very good investments as we approach a Covid vaccine and economic reopening. Melvin and others owned a lot of these other stocks, and needed something on the other side of the trade. There were just not a lot of good options for what can be shorted, so all the short dollars got concentrated in a smaller group of stocks, including GME.</p></div>		</li>
