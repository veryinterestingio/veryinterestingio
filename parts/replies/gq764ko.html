			<div class="markdown"><p>Electrician here, that wire is called &quot;stranded&quot; and has applications that are more beneficial than &quot;solid&quot; wire.  You mention it's easier to bend, but sometimes it is more useful to have solid wire, where it will stay where you bend it.  It has more memory, which is what we call that.  There are other factors to consider but I thought I'd mention that!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that why Romex is typically solid conductor? That would make a lot of sense. I've always wondered about that, but I just realized that stuff would be a pain to route if it was stranded.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Solid wire is easier to connect to wiring devices with screw terminals, switches and receptacles etc.  Bend a loop in the wire , hook it under screw and tighten.  Stranded wire unwravels and spreads out, doesn't stay under screw neatly.  Now connection are often &quot;quick connect&quot;, strip wire stick it in hole.  These are usually designed for solid wire only.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Solid core is useful in buildings due to ease of use in terminating (hooking up) most parts.  There is also very little movement in the wiring so stiffer, less flexible wire is acceptable as opposed to say a vehicle where solid core is verboten as it would vibrate and fracture relatively quickly. </p>
<p>The last one is actually pretty interesting, in AC (as well as high frequency DC), a phenomenon called skin effect occurs where the electrons start flowing only on the outer circumference of the conductor.  Because of this effect, solid core has more uninterupted area around the outside of the wire and handles the high frequency transmission more efficiently and over longer distances than stranded wire.</p>
<p>To add regarding skin effect and to explain it simply, the magnetic flux caused by rapidly changing voltage levels (this is the frequency talked about such as 60hz for US mains) forms around the outside of the wire and acts to draw the moving electrons out toward it. It was first explained to me that the wire is like a merry go round, the electrons are the riders and the frequency and resulting flux is the speed the merry go round spins. At no or low frequencies, the electrons just sit where they want but as it goes faster, it will start throwing the riders to the outside and if you go fast enough; youll fly right off. The flying off part is EMI or electromagnetic interference where the electrons can be pulled out of one wire and land in another unless they are shielded which would be akin to a wall around the merry go round.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the wire is supporting itself (like in romex this can be true, but it’s typically no more or less hassle to be solid or stranded when routing, the pulling it through conduit part can be different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So solid wire would be best for like a mains connection to your house where it will stay in place forever.</p>
<p>But something like a normal power cord that will get bent a lot would be braided?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The larger sizes that are used to bring the service into your house are also stranded. Its just the strands are a lot larger. I've forgotten the specifics but something like 2/0 wire will have like 19 strands of #12 solid conductors inside it.</p></div>		</li>

<li>Solid wire is cheaper to produce. The main advantage of stranded is that it's more flexible. Most home wiring is concealed behind walls and/or by design, not meant to be regularly moved or tampered with.</li>
<li>On a similar note, the rigidity of solid is actually particularly advantageous when trying to fish new wires during remodels where walls/ceilings aren't open.</li>
<li>This might be a somewhat biased assessment, but more rigid, solid wires are simply easier to work with when making the types of connections you typically make in home electrical work (splicing together with wire nuts or getting a good connection to an outlet conductor, in particular, are giant pains in the ass with stranded wire compared to solid).</li>
<li>It conserves space. At a given gauge, solid wire will be smaller than an equivalent stranded wire. This is beneficial if you're working in small spaces like outlet boxes where space can be a premium.</li>
</ul>
<p>The exception in home electrical is actually something like what you just listed, where the wire becomes thick enough that you <em>need</em> the flexibility that stranded provides. 200A home service requires 2/0 wire, which is like - as another poster said - basically like a bunch of solid wires of smaller gauges all bundled together, and a single solid 12 gauge wire is already relatively hard to bend on its own. </p>
<p>You will also see some stranded wire in some DIY applications like light fixtures or smart outlets where I suppose the assumption is it's easier for someone who's never done electrical to work with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Network cable is similar. The solid core is inside walls and data closets. The stranded is the shorter runs and to user's devices.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just for further information:  Solid wires will also break faster if you bend them repeatedly.  So inside your walls, you'll find solid wires, as they're cheaper to construct and you don't repeatedly bend them.  Line cords for your appliances, though, will bend frequently and you want them flexible, so they're stranded instead of solid.</p>
<p>You'll see similar things for other situations: telephone station wire is solid as you build it into your installation, but the phone line plugging into your telephone (if you still have a wire-tethered phone) will have stranded or &quot;tinseled&quot; wire to let it flex without breaking as easily.  I've even seen stranded ethernet wires for connecting some devices into your network, but they don't seem to be as common, as I still see most people using solid wires to go to their ethernet outlets.  (OK, I guess for a lot of purposes, as you probably don't move your printer around all that much...)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Terminated patch cables are stranded for the reasons you said, flexibility, etc... In wall network cable is solid for several reasons with the main one being you can't punchdown stranded cable.  I think there is also a fire rating difference between solid and stranded but I'm not sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stranded wires don't carry as much current though. There is air between the wires. The solid core can fit more electrons in a cross section.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know it’s probably implied, but worth mentioning, heating in wires is due to resistance, and thinner wires offer more resistance, but broken strands only cause a higher resistance for a very short distance before their side contact with other wires causes them to be current carrying again - a broken strand isn’t a broken path for the length of the wire. </p>
<p>Where a few broken strands might seem like a problem, most of it is mitigated by the “thinner wire” effect lasting only a very few mm and any excess heat getting wicked away by the large amounts of copper.</p></div>		</li>
