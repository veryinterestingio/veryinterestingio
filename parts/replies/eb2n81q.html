<p>First, this is wrong because the areas A of a human and water drop are totally different (and the coefficients C_A of drag are probably different as well).  Rather, their area A is going to be (very roughly) proportional to their mass to the 2/3rd power since their volume is proportional to mass.  That means the terminal velocity is proportional to the <em>sixth</em> root of mass, not the square root.  Indeed, sources seem to put the mass of raindrop in the vicinity of 5mg, which would mean that we should expect a 160-lbs human's terminal velocity to be almost 4000 times faster (!) than the rain drop using the square root scaling, but only 15 times faster using the sixth-root scaling.  That differs from the true ratio 60/9 ~ 7 by a factor of two, which is about as good as we could expect from this method.</p>
<p>Of course, the actual empirical values for terminal velocity quoted by SpeakeasyImprov are substantially more believable than anything we'd try to derive from this formula, which is only a crude approximation.  (Indeed, it's very likely the case that any value for the drag coefficient that you saw quoted for a rain drop or a human are <em>inferred</em> from their empirical terminal velocities under the assumption that that formula held.)</p></div>		</li>
