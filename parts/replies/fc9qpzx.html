			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a medical doctor or a clinician, so I can't offer you practical advice;  without knowing your situation much better, it's hard to say what this is. It's possible that what you're describing is a pretty normal annoyance with distracting sounds. However, I can direct you to a few relevant topics. </p>
<p>First, what you describe sounds like what scientists would call a problem with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_gating" target="_blank">sensory gating</a> - you have trouble using selective attention to 'gate' out unnecessary information, so everything mixes together. [Note: although reading on the topic will tell you that sensory gating issues are often associated with schizophrenia and/or autism spectrum disorders, I wouldn't make too much of that. Sensory gating deficits don't mean you likely have these conditions, they just tend to be worse in those populations].</p>
<p>Second, difficulty hearing in noisy environments has recently been associated with <a href="https://www.hear-it.org/hidden-hearing-loss" target="_blank">hidden hearing loss</a>, and often leads to exactly the difficulty you describe. This type of hearing loss is called hidden because it doesn't impair the ability to hear quiet sounds - what's usually tested at an audiologist or doctor's office - but still impairs your ability to hear in the real world. </p>
<p>If you're having serious problems with this, I'd strongly recommend you go to your primary care doctor or an audiologist and describe your problems. Hearing difficulties are exceedingly common and many people wait years after experiencing them to seek help, exacerbating their problems down the line. Hope you find the help you need!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I went through all the steps this summer. My audiograms always show that I’m ‘normal’ hearing but on the lower end of the scale. I have a lot of difficulty separating or isolating sounds in real world situations but not with the audiologists tests. </p>
<p>AuD told me to go to my PCP who then referred me to a ENT. They ran all the same tests and verified all the results and found no physical issues and referred me to a APD (Audio Processing Disorder) specialist, whom didn’t take any insurance and I didn’t go through with their tests which were $2500. </p>
<p>After lots of reading/research I found that hearing aids could be of help. Found another AuD that would actually fit me with hearing aids (this was actually not that easy) and started my 45-day trial with the hearing aids. </p>
<p>Outside of realizing there was a fair amount of sounds I wasn’t hearing, focusing in social settings improved a lot and I require less effort to stay part of conversations. It’s not perfect and there was definitely an adjustment period but I kept them after the trial, my insurance covered 90% of the cost. I’ve been wearing them for about 6 months now and no way I would give them back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now I don’t know how much this ventures out of your field, but what about your “mental voice” of “the voice inside your head”. Only being able to focus on one object at once, and I’ve found that I have trouble listening to a podcast when I’m focused on my own voice. Obviously studies here are probably difficult, but I’m wondering if you have any insights or terms that I should search to send me down a rabbit hole. I’m curious if imagined sounds, trigger similar responses in the brain as a true sound even. Thanks:)!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Armchair philosopher warning - my opinion is that the same effect would be observed with internal monologue. Not only have I myself experienced a loss of focus on external stimuli (i.e. reading or music) when caught in introspection, but studies have shown that many of the same brain regions active in vision and hearing are also active when visualizing objects or engaging with internal monologue.</p></div>		</li>
