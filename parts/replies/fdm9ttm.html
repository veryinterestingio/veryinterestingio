			<div class="markdown"><p>The only divers using 100% O2 for rebreathing are naval SPEC-ops forces AFAIK. As a normal tech diver you'd be diving with a variety of Nitrox or Trimix gas with a rebreather. At 100% O2 you are limited to <em>really</em> shallow dives to avoid O2 induced epileptic fits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, rebreathers are used primarily by combat divers, but are also used by recreational divers exploring sensitive biomes as the off gas may disrupt ecosystems.</p>
<p>And O2 diving is limited to 6-9 meters due to oxygen toxicity, but OP was talking about the duration of dive.</p>
<p>I’ve never heard of lungs or alveoli collapsing though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the main points of a rebreather is it maintains a relatively surface normal ppO2. There’s oxygen, an inert gas, and the residual CO2 from the diver.</p></div>		</li>

<p>One of the reasons you don't want to breathe pure O2 is that you can collapse your lungs doing this. </p>

<p>No, that's not true, at all. First, the blood has a limited capacity how much oxygen it can absorb, second, during normal breathing your body absorbs around 4-7% of the oxygen from each breath: you are not exhaling oxygen-free air.   </p>
<p>Above this, the absorbed oxygen get replaced by CO2 (otherwise your blood would just keep collecting mass, and you would turn into a black hole sooner or later....).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what if you had a constant stream of oxygen to keep your alveoli pressurised until blood saturation? Oxygen toxicity? Either way how does oxygen become toxic to your cells?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oxygen is toxic to us because of oxidization. Just like oxygen causes rust on iron, it also damages our cells. At a normal rate our cells can replace themselves, but taking on huge amounts of oxygen kills the cells too fast - our organs diminish in capability until they can't work anymore to being too dead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So even if there's a constant stream of oxygen, all of it is still oxygen, so pretty much all of it is going to be absorbed into the blood stream. There is a concept where there's a &quot;constant stream that keep the alveoli pressurized&quot; called PEEP (Positive End Expiratory Pressure) that is used during mechanical ventilation, but the greatest benefit of that is to keep healthy alveoli open. Plus it usually isn't used with 100% oxygen since hospitals try to keep use of concentrations that high for less than 24 hours.</p>
<p>As for the toxicity to your cells. It's believed to be because of free radicals. They're atoms with an unpaired valence electron that can pull electrons from molecules, which destabilize them. Continue that and you start to get cell damage.</p>
<p>Type I alveolar cells are responsible for gas exchange, but they don't readily replicate or replenish. So as those are damaged, they get replaced by type II alveolar cells, which don't participate in gas exchange but do replicate readily. So now not only are your alveoli collapsing (as above) but now there's also fewer cells to facilitate gas exchange. </p>

<p>You seem to imply that the blood is a black hole that can endlessly absorb oxygen. It goes to equilibrium eventually du scias.</p></div>		</li>
