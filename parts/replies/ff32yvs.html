			<div class="markdown"><p>You can get power strips these days that can help with that.  One socket is the master.  When that device is on (pulling more current than whatever threshold), the it'll allow the other sockets to be powered.  When that device is off, the other sockets turn off.  Typically there will be one or two that aren't switched too.</p>
<p>So, plug in your TV to the master socket, and things like speakers or game systems that don't benefit from being plugged in all the time.</p></div>		</li>
