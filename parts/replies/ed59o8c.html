<p>Put your palms firmly on top of your ears so that the tips of your middle fingers touch behind your head. While doing it, with your index fingers tap on  your middle fingers for a couple of seconds.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It... certainly quietened it. Huh.<br />
I s<a href="https://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/800/023/5ca.jpg" target="_blank">uspect this is a lie</a>, and I'm under some kind of placebo effect. But hey, this goes down with one of those weird literal life-hacks.
Like looking through a crack in your fingers (like if you have your fingers lightly together, the aim is to create a pinhole/slit), you can read fine print/distant text if you're missing your glasses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has always worked for me, placebo effect or not.</p>
<p>Also your example doesn't really seem like a placebo effect. It seems more to be related to how light bends around corners, which I would assume is also why squinting helps</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I tried that and was unsure if it worked, and a bit later now it's... different, and not in a good way. Before, it was a relatively ignorable single tone, and now it feels more... wobbly? Dunno, hard to describe, but as i'm writing this it's already going back to normal again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. I didn't know until I was out for a walk and kept hearing a clicking noise as my jaw wiggled slightly every few steps. Did some research and found out there was a word for &quot;the sound of air&quot;. hahaha...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. People don't realize you can ignore it. I listen to a lot of music and forget about it until I go to bed really. I only know it's there now because I'm reading about it tbh </p></div>		</li>
