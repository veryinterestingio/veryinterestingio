			<div class="markdown"><p>The goggles, they would do nothing! Because you'd be crushed by the immense pressure down to the size of, say, a marble. Also there's no solid land to land on anyway.</p>
<p>But yeah, no, you wouldn't want carbon glitter in your eyes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That doesn't sound right. Am I slightly larger than a marble under normal pressure?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know there's no hard &quot;surface&quot;, but assuming there's a maximum depth where the pressure is such that the diamond glitter can &quot;float&quot;, is there a layer of diamond that can coalesce and become heavier and denser as more diamond falls into it? Or does it &quot;re-evaporate&quot; into the air like a weird diamond evaporation cycle?</p></div>		</li>
