			<div class="markdown"><p>That's backwards!</p>
<p>&quot;Friction&quot; isn't the best word here, but that sort of dissipative process will get rid of energy, but <em>won't</em> get rid of angular momentum! What happens is that the gas in a galaxy loses its energy but keeps its angular momentum, so it ends up in the flattest configuration possible with that angular momentum - a disc. This disc then fragments into clouds that form stars, and the stars keep the disc shape.</p>
<p>Energy, in the form of random motions and pressure, can &quot;puff up&quot; a disc into a more spherical shape. So, in a sense, planets and stars have more internal &quot;per&quot; angular momentum than disc galaxies do.</p></div>		</li>

All friction can do is transfer angular momentum between different parts of that system, and ensure that angular momentum is spread out more evenly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand how planetary disks and also galaxies are disk-shaped due to conservation of angular momentum.</p>
<p>So why are the assume DM halos spherical and not disk-shaped? Does DM not follow the law regarding theconservation of angular momentum?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is the defining property of (proven, ie. baryonic) <em>matter</em> which does not allow it to pass through itself ghost-like its electromagnetic charge? How does that work with neutral particles, which are the majority in most physical bodies?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I understand it to be due to the dark matter's not interacting via any forces but gravity. This means it doesn't collide with anything in the galaxy: it just passes through material objects. Thus out-of-plane orbits aren't weeded out like they are for objects made of regular matter (the reason for the disc shape of galaxies and our solar system). According to Wikipedia, they may be ellipsoidal, as they form with different amounts of angular momentum along different axes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it &quot;passes through&quot; everything &quot;material&quot;, both ordinary matter and dark matter, does it even make sense to speak of DM particles? Localization of individual particles ought to be impossible. ^(Also, if it passes through anyting &quot;material&quot;, does it even make sense to call it dark <em>matter</em>?)</p></div>		</li>
