			<div class="markdown"><p>How does one keep the inside of those things clean? Can they be washed easily?</p>
<p>Also, who is responsible for doing this? The person wearing the costume, or someone else?</p>
<p>Edit: the deleted post this is in response to was talking about being a costumed entertainer at a theme park. They said it can get real hot in there, but it’s managed by fluid intake and scheduled breaks (albeit still uncomfortable).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>lots and lots of alcohol spray. 1 part water 1 part rubbing alcohol. Drench the inside with that stuff after you're done with your shift, and hope it's all evaporated before your next set so that you aren't inhaling alcohol with every breath.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably lots of hydration and small amounts of time outside. There's a reason they only have characters come out at certain times to take autographs, and I'm sure there are plenty of breaks in between.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can confirm, I was a character at a theme park for 7+ years. We alternated between break room and costume every 30 minutes. So about half of our day was a break, and we kept that break room real cold. When it got really hot though we would do 50 minutes in the break room and 10 minutes in the costume.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't acclimate that day. It's a period of weeks in the costume (around 2 weeks for me) before your body starts to get used to the heat and limited breathing. It helps to stay out of direct sunlight and not expend too much energy. Occasionally someone will pass out or fall ill.</p></div>		</li>
