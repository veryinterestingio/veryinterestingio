			<div class="markdown"><p>It should be noted that 1.5^12 = ~129.75 not 128 which is 2^7. Each half step is a good fractional (harmonic) approximation of the next frequncy ratio of sqrt(12) and the 12th note, or octave, is a perfect 2:1 frequency ratio.</p>
<p>I found this out in high school programming beep frequencies in Turbo Pascal... the sqrt(12) frequencies sound terrible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is because if you tuned a piano perfectly harmonically based on C instead of 12 even half step intervals it would be perfectly in tune so long as you play in C. As soon as you switch key signatures the error in harmonic frequencies to the intervals will become further than what they would be with 12 even half step intervals and it would be noticeable. The 12 even half step interval approach to music theory cuts the difference. This is why nonfretted string instruments and wind instruments are so cool! They do micro adjustments to be perfectly in tune to the key in a harmonic frequency sense. Also went to a prestigous college of music. Still perusing but also a server</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You will also sometimes see instruments tuned to keys. There's a red hot chili peppers song (which I cannot remember for the life of me) where the B string on the guitar is slightly tuned down so it matches the true ratio. It's fun to play around on keyboards with tuning options to hear the difference. Playing in key sounds amazing and the moment you go out of key it's clear why pianos aren't tuned that way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed.  The modern (tempered) scale has been equalized so it sound proper in all octaves.  That said, it's ELI5, so I chose to omit this portion.  But yes, you're absolutely right.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Didn't Pythagoras get the idea from anvils or something like that? Maybe my brain is misremembering and/or I was lied to, lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A fifth is the fifth note in a scale. In the scale of C that note is G.</p>
<p>In the scale of G, it's D.</p>
<p>In the scale of D it's A etc.</p>
<p>The circle of fifths is what happens if you keep following that formula, it will go through every note once before bringing you back to C, where you started.</p>
<p>The root note and fifth note of a scale sound really good when played together. It's the basis for power chords, if you're into rock and metal.</p>
<p>Apparently a string that vibrates at the tone of C will vibrate at G if you cut a third of it off. (That's news to me and is actually super cool)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ok, but what is the significance of that? Why pick the 5th note in a scale? </p>
<p>What does that mean, scale of G, scale of D? Why does it matter where you start if it loops? </p>

<p>How do you go from B to f#? wouldn't you go from B to F? Where do the sharps come from?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A fifth is also the interval between two notes that are five steps apart (such as C and G), which I think is the more relevant meaning here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The perfect fifth is the two notes you will hear as stated in the example.  String one will be the root, String two (the shorter) will be a fifth above it.  </p>
<p>If your root is a C, the fifth will be a G.</p>
<p>As for why it does?  The frequencies will sound like that.  It will be a pleasing sound.  I don't have the capacity to draw in Reddit, but it's best to draw it as two sinusoidal waves.  Sine wave root will complete two cycles in the same time that Sine wave Fifth will complete three cycles.  </p>
<p>The more &quot;pretty&quot; or in a predictable pattern these sine waves line up, the more pleasing to the ear it will be (called consonance).  The more unpredictable or difficult to discern (such as a 17:18 cycle), the more crunchy it will sound (called dissonance).</p></div>		</li>
