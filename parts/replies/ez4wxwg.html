			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;The Salivary glands - Your mouth suddenly begins producing extra saliva. This is slightly alkaline and forms a buffer to protect your mouth and teeth from incoming stomach acid.&quot;</p>
<p>I cannot stress how much saliva your mouth produces. </p>
<p>I hadn't thrown up in about 14 years, so any memories of the last time where long gone, and one particular weekend of heavy drinking on a stag, I was sat in a corner of a club waiting for death in my drunken state, when suddenly it was Niagara falls in my mouth. I previously knew this fact, and for some reason in that moment my brain recalled this specific bit of information, and I realized what was about to happen, and knew i had to get to the bathroom. Unfortunately the copious amount of alcohol in my system prevented me from moving further than a simple lean forward before puking my guts out all over the floor. </p>
<p>if you're ever wondering what the saliva part will feel like after reading this, you will know when it happens, believe me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was something I noticed a couple of years ago, which was around the last time I've vomited. I noticed my mouth watering something fierce and then I felt super sick and needed to throw up. </p>
<p>We have one cat prone to vomiting due to his pancreatitis (being treated with a special food, but he still vomits occasionally) and when I see him doing weird stuff with his tongue like he's licking up extra saliva I can tell he's about to vomit even before he starts the characteristic cat throwing up noises and motions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, I was wondering how/why your body knows to throw up or if you pooped it out why didn't you throw it up if it was bad
Though, interesting to see what all happens in your body for in the few minutes before you throw up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've discovered over the years that if I'm going to vomit shortly, i lose the ability to yawn. Like my mouth will open and and I need to yawn but it just won't &quot;kick in&quot; to a full yawn. Could this be related to the movement of the diaphragm or glottis do you think?</p></div>		</li>
