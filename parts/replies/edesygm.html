			<div class="markdown"><p>The average person can't name any Apollo astronaut other than Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. The other two they might get are Alan Shepard, but because he was the first American in space, not because of his golf-on-the-moon antics, and Jim Lovell, because Ron Howard is good at making movies. </p>
<p>Michael Collins? Alan Bean? Gene Cernan? John Young? In all likelihood, you're going to get blank stares, even from people who were alive at the time. </p></div>		</li>

Farquhar advocated using spacecraft in a halo orbit on the far side of the Moon (Earth–Moon L2) as a communications relay station for an Apollo mission to the far side of the Moon.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
