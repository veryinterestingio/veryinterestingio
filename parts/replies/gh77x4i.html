			<div class="markdown"><p>Yah, but your available bandwidth is so incredibly low on satellite vs fiber that you'd bring things to a standstill anyway.  Nothing that is transmitted through freespace will EVER be able to compete with terrestrial fiber in terms of bandwidth.  It's a limit by physics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's already stored in a very distributed fashion, and you'd have to go through and modify the satellite links to only allow critical infrastructure traffic, as simply allowing everyone to attempt to use it would mean nobody, including critical traffic, would get through.  There's no Quality of Service inherent to the Internet today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, it's mostly the latency thats garbage. The bandwidth can be quite high with the right setup (Keep in mind satellite TV can broadcast 100s of channels simultaneously) but that signal has to make it from a ground station, all the way up into &quot;space&quot;, get processed slightly, maybe even travel across space to another satellite, then travel all the way back down to earth. That can take a while. But once the data stream is going, it can push through a lot of stuff.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not really.  Firstly physics dictate that free space medium (especially current RF) will NEVER reach what a guided medium like fiber can reach when overlayed on any current or reasonably future looking technology we have.  While theoretically you could send a super coherent laser through space at the same wavelengths we use for fiber, in practice you're always going to have substantially more loss.</p>
<p>That said, Starlink has frequently stated 6-20Gbps per satellite node (a few places mentioned maybe 100Gbps), with only one shortest path existing between two points (e.g. NYC and London), and most traffic taking similar/same paths (e.g. Chicago and Brussels).  Current the MAREA transatlantic fiber cables alone has a system bandwidth of 200 Tbps.  Even with 10 alternative paths at 100Gbps each, Starlink is still sucking hind tit compared to just ONE transatlantic cable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That system loss in an open system (e.g. transmitting through air or through a vacuum) is always going to be greater than in a ducted system like fiber.  While you can try to beam a 1550nm link from one satellite to the other, you're pretty much always going to run in to more issues doing it than if you had a fiber run of the same length.  You'll do better in terms of speed, but far worse in terms of signal strength, and you'll still end up with problems like chromatic dispersion (probably equally relative to the speed of light change, but I'd have to dig in to the math on that specific one to be sure).</p></div>		</li>
