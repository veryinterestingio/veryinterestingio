<p>I actually really liked the show, even knowing what he did was essentially Sherlock Holmes-style magic. I recently rematched it and it held up really well for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really like the show as well. Tim Roth does a great job as Lightman, and I wish there were more seasons.</p>
<p>Also, it's been a while since I've watched it last, but I believe in several episodes he &quot;got it wrong&quot;&mdash;before, of course, eventually getting it right&mdash;showing that his reading or even the micro-expressions themselves, was not flawless or magic or a silver bullet.</p>
<p>I have close relationships with people in the security and investigations business, and know that reading people is possible, but it's not an exact science, it's not always reliable, and it's definitely a combination of multiple things (expressions, micro-expressions, general body language, what they're saying, how they're saying it, what they've said, their attitude, etc., etc.)</p>
<p>For the sake of theatrics, <em>Lie To Me</em> picked out micro-expressions and hypes it up a bit more unrealistically, but it doesn't make the show any less enjoyable IMO.</p></div>		</li>
