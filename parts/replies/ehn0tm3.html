<p>When you roll something you get the same effect as folding.  One layer of the roll is in compression, and the other is in tension.  A roll is just a fold that is distributed across the entire garment.  That is not where the volume savings come from.</p>
<p>Garments are made of fabrics; textiles that are woven or knitted.  They have lots of air gaps and spaces between the various fibers that make up the textile.  By rolling, you wind up squeezing the entire garment, pressing the fibers together and eliminating or reducing the air gaps between them.  You can get the same effect by folding your garments and then placing a heavy weight on them.  Rolling merely replaces the heavy weight with the force of tension within the fabric.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Got any other theories?</p></div>		</li>
