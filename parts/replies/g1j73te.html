			<div class="markdown"><p>More not five:</p>
<p>It's cheaper. The cost of producing tires is not linear with size. You have to shrink tolerances as you increase height or width to control runout and balance,  and you have to strengthen the core so the tire won't overheat and will still support the load, which means more material,  more weight.</p>
<p>It's more efficient. Tires want to be round. To make them not round (wider) requires strength, which adds weight and reduces core flex, both of which consume more gas. When carrying heavy loads (buses, semis, even towing that 38ft travel trailer), you are looking for efficiency. </p>
<p>It's redundant. When you lose a tire,  it's typically just one. Safer for moving those heavy loads. It's also cheaper when you lose one tire.</p></div>		</li>

The double pair of tires are the trailer tandems and they also slide forward and rear to distribute weight legally and evenly .</p></div>		</li>
