			<div class="markdown"><p>You just described partial derivatives and the reason they were invented: specifically to explain the 100% independent contribution of gravity to motion in the vertical dimension vs the horizontal one!</p>
<p>Blew my mind when I learned that.</p>
<p>Oh and you’re not weightless in space (in orbit). You’re falling down at the same speed you’re falling sideways! Same math! r/mathisbeautiful</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can also model this problem with the kinematic equation for position, oriented in the -z direction. d=x0+v0*t+1/2at^2. If the initial conditions are the same for each bullet, and both bullets exist in an environment where acceleration is the same, the equation has no consideration for horizontal conditions. A bullet traveling at its maximum horizontal velocity will hit the ground at the same time as a bullet with 0 horizontal velocity according to the kinematic equation.</p></div>		</li>

That's basically what weightless means. I think what you mean to say is that there still is gravity working on you</p>
