			<div class="markdown"><p>Many different reasons really. Birds in general use bird calls to communicate things like territorial claims, mating calls, warnings to other birds about predators and so on.</p>
<p>Some bird species take this ability to extremes. Many lyre bird species for instance boast about their vocal range, mimicking ability and memory by perfectly imitating forest sounds. Naturally those are sounds of other wild animals and environmental sounds. But with human encroachment they're we've also heard them imitate chainsaws, phone ringtones and so on. The birds are basically advertising their mating fitness by showing just how good they are with their voice and memory.</p>
<p>Parrots are extremely social species that live very long lives. They have to learn complex communication that varies depending on whether they're communicating with other parrots, with their own community or another one, with their lifelong partner, trying to find a mate while they're single and so on. And another parrot needs to be able to hear the difference from a distance.</p>
<p>In order to do that they need an enormous vocal range for an animal and a brain suited for learning and imitating sounds. Parrots learning to imitate sounds from their environment is really no different than a human toddler playing kitchen with pots and pans. They evolved brains that hunger to do what they're good at, learning through imitation so they can become part of their peers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IMO the only reason pet birds imitate humans is because they have a special relationship with humans. In the wild, the birds would be imitating their family or flock because those are the beings they have a special relationship with.</p>
<p>There is one type bird I've seen video of which I think does imitate EVERYTHING it hears (can't remember the type of bird - not a parrot). And I believe that bird is a wild bird. It will imitate everything from people to chain saws (cutting down trees).</p>
<p>But no, I've never heard of a bird in the wild imitating something as a strategy like that.</p></div>		</li>
