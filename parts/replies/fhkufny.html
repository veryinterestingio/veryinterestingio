<p>Wow.  Good thing we use freedom fuel instead of petrol here in the US.  I couldn't afford to drive at almost $6/gallon.  That's almost three time what I am paying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why most european-market cars are smaller and more fuel efficient than US-market cars.  A 1.4l VW polo at $6 a gallon isn't going to cost much more or less to fuel than a V8 F-150 at $2 a gallon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point.  I do have a V8 F-150(good guess) and it probably is the same cost.  But we use our more fuel efficient vehicle rather than the truck when we can. It might not be as fuel efficient as a Polo, but it gets 30+.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that cars in the EU are much more fuel efficient usually. So you see a ton of cars with a 1.0-litre gasoline engine or something like a 1.2 turbo diesel, these engines really squeeze all the horsepowers from a drop of gas. But the road taxes and insurance however, that is what keeps most people from buying a car.</p></div>		</li>
