<p>Considering that burning coal was basically considered cutting-edge energy generation in that era, it would have been incredibly humbling to realize that there was a yet undiscovered form of energy source that was thousands/millions of times more efficient :D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sun's nuclear fusion process is actually <em>horribly</em> inefficient. The power density in the core is comparable to the heat generated by a compost heap. The proton-proton chain begins by simply fusing together protons which the vast vast vast vast vast majority of time just separate again. An incredibly tiny percentage of these reactions is followed by an immediate beta plus decay of one of the protons, resulting in a hydrogen-2 nucleus. Only then can the reaction chain actually proceed.</p>
<p>Edit: Just adding a missing word.</p>
<p>Edit: hydrogen-2, not helium-2</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The coal thing had to be tossed aside once enough people figured out how spectrography worked. Not enough carbon to support that at all. Also wasn't helium found that way, before the element itself was isolated?</p></div>		</li>
