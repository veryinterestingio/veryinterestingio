			<div class="markdown"><p>When you think of non vascular plants like liverworts, they stay pretty tied to the aquatic environment. Vascularization (Iâ€™m not a botanist) is probably an essential adaptation to xeric (dry) habitats.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in Central North Carolina. Prickly pear cactus is native here, but rarely seen except in plantings, or rocky outcrops.  However, there was a serious drought a few years ago (2008?) and as the dominant brush species died back, it revealed that there was actually quite a bit of prickly pear on roadsides and edges of fields, it had been growing for years, getting minimal sunlight because of faster growing species, but it was able to gain the advantage during severe drought.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Florida's sandy soil is often the limiting factor rather than moisture in this situation. A competition for mineral nutrition. Lots of dry grasses thrive in FL for this reason. The spiky thorny kind.</p></div>		</li>
