<p>It's a touch more complex than that, or it once was, because the IRS &amp; SEC operate an extensive financial surveillance apparatus in every major bank &amp; clearance network that interacts with the Western world, under the heading &quot;Know Your Customer&quot; &amp; &quot;Anti-Money-Laundering&quot; (KYC &amp; AML regulations).</p>
<p>It has in the past decade or two become simpler, because Republicans decided that the IRS should not pursue high-net-worth targets any more, and Democrats failed to fix what they broke by re-funding / re-creating those sections of those agencies.  As a result, the rate of audits of high-net-worth individuals, never great in the first place, has fallen off a cliff. With aggressive enforcement of existing financial regulations, people like Donald Trump would have been in prison a long time ago.</p></div>		</li>
