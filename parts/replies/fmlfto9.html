It is the future that is more problematic since many hotels are sitting empty or are ordered closed, money for the destinations come from taxes collected from occupancies in the accommodation sector. If the occupancies are low or zero, there is less tax to fund marketing, promotion and tourism development.</p></div>		</li>

<p>why are not such places being used as safe havens for people who are most endangered?There are millions of hotel rooms being empty for the duration of this emergency. It would be beneficial for all parties if isolated hotels become safe heavens for people with preconditions while the system adapts.</p>
<p>benefits are multiple...</p>
<p>there would be less critical patients exposed to virus</p>
<p>hotels would get paid by the insurance agencies</p>
<p>insurance agencies would have lower costs paying a vacant hotel than a hospital room + treatment.</p>
<p>it would reduce pressure on hospitals, since the number of possible critical patients would halve, making doctors work on patients who are less demanding, making the positive outcome of treatment that much more likely</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually currently manage a hotel in the LA market that had to temporarily close due to COVID-19. We were approached by the county about using our property to house the homeless, however we found out that most of the properties that agreed to this ended up having their housekeepers refuse to work in possibly hazardous conditions. We ended up declining as it doesn’t actually benefit the hotel to house people at a price that for many properties including my own, is below operating cost per night. That loss+potentially losing many well trained and valuable employees/having to pay to rehire and retrain/potential damage to rooms all leads to a lose lose for the property and so it makes more economic sense just to close than to even try to help- which unfortunately only goes to exacerbate the overall issue</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in a place like this. Ski mountain shut down March 20th and most restaurants closed or are doing take out only with limited hours. In some ways, we're actually better off than your normal economy. The ski mountain was going to shut down April 12th and that was going to throw us into the off season until early/mid June. There are several businesses that just straight up close during this time and the employees go on unemployment. Most service related jobs have reduced hours and staffing.</p>
<p>The tourism industry where I am is basically entirely dependent on winter and summer. Losing the better part of a month obviously didn't help at all.</p>
<p>The big issue we see moving forward is if the current measures stay in place into June. There's also fear that the hit to economy will mean people will do far less traveling this summer. The summer crowd tends to have a lot more campers, hikers, bikers, fishermen,  etc. whereas the winter crowd is almost all skiers. The summer crowd is stereotypically more middle class and the winter crowd is more well off.</p>
<p>Edit: that being said, that's only for the tourist part of the county. There are still a lot of businesses that don't see the highs and lows with the tourism market since they primarily serve locals. Most locals who aren't young and single live about 12 miles from the tourist center.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our town lost all the big events for the summer. We were fully booked for most of June &amp; July but the groups cancelled since the conferences &amp; food/wine fests cancelled. I don’t see how all the restaurants &amp; small lodges can survive.
Ski co has spent a lot of $ on Mt Bike features. The shops were ready to gear up on bike rentals upon closing after Easter.  Property values will go down &amp; that sucks for homeowners.  </p>
<p>It’ll be a rough summer for ski resorts after a winter that ended so abruptly on March 15.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vegas resident here - mass job loss and people struggling to get through unemployment offices due to a severe overload. Other than all the entertainment businesses and supporting industries being shut down, it's not terribly different. Lots of locals very worried though, expecting the local economy to get hurt very bad and not just temporarily.</p></div>		</li>
