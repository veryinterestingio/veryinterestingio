			<div class="markdown"><p>Hoo. I can <em>try.</em> We're getting into really weird science, though, so bear with me.</p>
<p>So, four (really, three) quantum numbers define an individual electron's position around the atom, right?</p>
<p>The first number, written as <em>n</em>, is called the <em>principal quantum number</em> (not related to the p shell), and it denotes, very roughly, how big the orbital is -- its average radius.</p>
<p>The second number, our old friend ℓ, is only <em>sort of</em> related to angular momentum. Electrons can't really be said to &quot;have&quot; momentum in a truly classical sense, but we do the best we can to get a word that's &quot;close enough.&quot; Suffice it to say that ℓ relates to how fast the electron is moving around the nucleus, and that changes the shape of the subshell.</p>
<p>The third number, mℓ, is the <em>magnetic quantum number,</em> and fortunately it's a little easier to swallow. It defines the <em>orientation</em> of the orbital: which way it's pointing in space, roughly.</p>
<p>So we've got the shell, the subshell, and the orbital as our three numbers. There <em>is</em> a fourth, and that's the <em>spin</em> of the electron. Don't make the mistake of thinking the electron is spinning like a top; it gets very confusing. If you were to paint a tiny dot on an electron, you would have to turn the electron all the way around <strong><em>twice</em></strong> to see the dot again.</p>
<p>I told you it was weird.</p>
<p>You can either have the spin &quot;pointing&quot; up or down in each orbital.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll shoot a bit more ELI5:</p>
<ul>
<li>n (&quot;principal&quot;) number indicates how many interesting things the orbital can do.  More energy == more interesting.  n&gt;0.</li>
<li>l (&quot;angular&quot;) number indicates how bumpy it is.  0 is round.  1 has two bumps on opposite sides.  2 has four bumps.  3 and higher gets a bit weirder.  There is a restriction that 0&lt; l &lt; n, because bumps are interesting features, and you're limited by n.</li>
<li>m (&quot;magnetic&quot;) number indicates what direction the bumps point.  -l &lt;= m &lt;= l.  More bumps, more different ways of arranging them.</li>
</ul>
<p>The specific details can be worked out with some fairly exciting math, but you can kinda get a feel for how that relates via a diagram <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Atomic-orbital-clouds_spdf_m0.png" target="_blank">like this</a>. N is on the right; notice how the l=0 case gains more complexity as you go to higher n.  However, as you move right to l=1 (p), l=2(d), etc. that complexity is &quot;spent&quot; on having more &quot;points&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought f was a thin, &quot;f&quot;ine line.<br />
After f the letters will be alphabetical from my understanding.</p>
<p>It is nice that the s is also spherical in shape, so it is easy to remember at least for speakers of the English language.  </p>
<p>Also did the letters have a meaning in the German language first and then translated to English? Given who was doing this work I doubt it was being though of with English words first.</p></div>		</li>
