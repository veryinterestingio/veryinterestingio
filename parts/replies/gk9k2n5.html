			<div class="markdown"><p>If you just energised the stator and armature with static fields, you could break up to whatever force you would like to achieve. Of course the design of the motor and it’s coils would be directly responsible for the maximum torque it could resist and the current it would dissipate.</p>
<p>So the answer is yes, you absolutely could but it would consume energy while parked to do so, on any non flat surface.</p>
<p>Otherwise you can brake using a computer controlled synchronous motor and even recover energy in doing so. We call it the generating region, but if you wanted to go further you could brake harder by reducing its efficiency and energising the stator.</p>
<p>When parked I don’t see why just a hand brake style system wouldn’t suffice. A pin through the shaft for example. I guess that’s not electrical at that point? But so aren’t magnetic circuits like those of motors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I mentioned in my previous comment, relying on the same computer for all braking power and motion means that a computer failure while the car is in motion will leave you with no control of the vehicle whatsoever while your car continues to move. You need at least a backup system that will allow you to halt your car's motion even if its computer, power system, or stator windings have failed.</p>
<p>A shaft pin handbrake might solve the problem of a vehicle needing power to remain stationary while parked, but the other function of a handbrake is to be able to stop a vehicle in the event that the primary brakes fail; using a shaft pin while the vehicle is in motion is likely to damage the shaft and cause the vehicle to drift, spin, or even flip.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you’re going to be anal about the fact that you need a “computer” then you need to be aware that it’s entirely possible to design this thing to fail safe. Also automotive computers and code have very strict requirements (worked in this industry before) and we could also use high temperature RISC and just up the cost a bit.</p></div>		</li>
