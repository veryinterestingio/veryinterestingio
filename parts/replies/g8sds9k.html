			<div class="markdown"><p>I LOVE DESMOSTYLIANS! These were the first group of animals I ever researched as a paleontologist. They are these extinct group of marine mammals that look like a giant hippo with a stretched face (sort of like Jar Jar Binks) that lived all along the North Pacific Coasts during the Miocene (about 30-10 million years ago). I love them because they are such a mystery to us still even though their fossil teeth are pretty common. They look like a bunch of sushi rolls all stuck together. To have such a large marine mammal that we know very little about, plus I think they are derpy cute, really intrigued me and got me to want to learn more about these crazy looking things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope! We still arenâ€™t quite sure, but the running hypothesis is distant cousins of rhinos and horses. Some think they might be related to elephants though.</p></div>		</li>
