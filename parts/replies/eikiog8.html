<p>How did we get to a point where we can “apply models”? Trial and error? Idk... at some points it feels to me that whatever we try to calculate.. we are calculating “man-made or human invented” things. But I guess physics is something man proved is accordance with reality?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A model is a bunch of math describing how physics work - gravity, nuclear forces etc. Apply that to a data set like a certain distribution of matter.</p>
<p>Run the simulation of forces for a number of iterations, eg simulate 13 billion years, and you end up with a new data set. This set can be interpreted as a certain distribution of matter, eg where are the stars and galaxies at. Check if it fits the night sky, if it does you are probably right.</p>
<p>This is very simplified, quantum mechanics for one is very important, but a bit out of my scope right now.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fascinating  stuff. I’m as impressed with how we got to the point to even put these models into use and prove that we’re right over and over again.... and it took centuries of human ingenuity. Science! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One example: what's the value of g, the free fall acceleration at the surface of the Earth?</p>
<p>Well, once you have the model (Newton's laws of motion, or in other words the idea that a free fall is a parabolic movement) you can just measure how fast things fall, and that gives you the proper value for g.</p>
<p>And if you keep observing free falls in different places, you can deduce the gravitational constant G, as well as, for example, the mass of the Earth.</p>
<p>Also, if you model is bad, then when you try to apply it in different contexts it breaks apart. That's how you know your model is good enough. At astronomical scales Newtonian physics don't work anymore, and relativity is needed. At smaller scales Newtonian physics work well enough</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>calculations refer to mathematics. Numbers and units are man made symbols true, however the vaules and the measurements of those symbols in our universe are constant and correct, regardless of our existence. Therefore it is possible to map and model theories and perform repeated trial and error. Mathematics is just a  language that describes the relationships between objects, matter and any physical change that occurs in time and space. It is the ultimate language for studying existence and occurance of matters and events concerning such matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also  most of what we see when we peer into the vast universe is radiation. We know radiation has a decay rate. From that rate we determine how old something is. Also what we use to measure stuff is constants. We find things in the universe that we believe to be constant across the universe. This is like gravity the speed of light.
However we are constantly proposing new and proving old theories. That constantly changes our view of the universe's age, shape, and the way it behaves.
I would recommend Neil Degrasse Tyson's book &quot;Astrophysics For People That Are In a Hurry&quot;.  It explains a lot about the universe and our theories about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, although I don't think decay rate in particular is used to date the universe. The radiation we see is mostly photons, which don't decay and mostly, in the universe, don't originate from a decay.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe not from a telescope standpoint. I believe that what the OP discussed. I may have been a little misleading when I didn't say that by taking samples from both planets and  things like comets and meteorites we can in fact date them from the decay in the isotopes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like the one take away from quantum mechanics is that you never do that... *Never assume that things &quot;constant&quot; across the universe.*  Sure it works in a classroom, or macro scale/classical level, but always: The smaller you go, the more significant the numbers get. Example: Gravity is promotional to mass, mass is interchangeable with energy. Energy.. Well we're only getting started on identifying just how much/what forms/etc.  96% of the energy of the universe, scientists can't even measure. (calculate decay rates, etc). (<a href="https://www.space.com/11642-dark-matter-dark-energy-4-percent-universe-panek.html" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.space.com/11642-dark-matter-dark-energy-4-percent-universe-panek.html" target="_blank">https://www.space.com/11642-dark-matter-dark-energy-4-percent-universe-panek.html</a></a>) </p>
<p>So when you have these starts launching energy at the speed of light, you have to ask: &quot;What are we not seeing?&quot;</p>
<p>So, I would not be surprised if that number continues to change. I', not discouraging, just trying to give perspective. Because one of the best ways to learn is to observe. </p>
