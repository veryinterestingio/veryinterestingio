			<div class="markdown"><p>Or, imagine the entire United States contains all the computers in the world. Those computers need to be connected somehow, this is where Tier 1 or the backbone comes in, Tier 1 is like the interstate that connects all of them. The tier 2 are like exits from those interstate and the tier 3 are the roads in your neighbourhood that actually goes to your house.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I pay $320 a month for my internet. It gets me a fiber run directly from my house to comcast's data center. This is just connected directly via an SFP+.</p>
<p>It's provisioned pretty strangely though, they provided me two static IP's that are each considered their own circuit (they plug into different ports on a Juniper ACX2100 they provided). One is a 1 gigabit circuit over provisioned to 1.1gigabits (but out of a 1gb copper port so the over provision is useless). The other circuit is 2gigabit circuit over provisioned to 2.2 gigabits coming out of a 10g SFP+ port (so I can take advantage of the .2 gigabits^1 ). They also provisioned me two unusually large IPv6 ranges, like unusually large even by IPv6 standards (basically I got what would normally be given to an ISP). I asked if they could re-provision the device to just give me a 3.3gigabit link but they said no. But seeing how incredibly hard it is to saturate a 2.2gigabit line I guess it's not that big a deal. Oh yeah, the speed is fully symmetrical and very low latency.</p>
<p>Previously I had comcast cable service but it was so unreliable that I couldn't even do things like stream netflix. I upgraded mostly for the more reliable service than the speed (and this service is extremely reliable and has no data caps; although few people at comcast's support even knows what the service is).</p>
<p>As a side note, I use to rent my basement out and I advertised that it came with full gigabit internet (gigabit internet is not something you can get here). I thought people would be excited, but when I've offered to run the ethernet line everybody said just being on the wifi was fine.</p>
<p>^1 : I find it hilarious that I started back in the 9600 baud era of the internet and would have murdered people for .2 gigabits as a kid. And now that's basically a rounding error in the bandwidth that I have. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a decent analogy. The one to keep in mind with this question is that the Internet is EVERYWHERE. So some of those computers are in your neighborhood. Your ISP might be host to websites for Local Companies.</p>
<p>So sometimes you are talking to a computer on the otherside of the country(or world) and sometimes it's just down the street.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I work at an ISP.  We also have Peering with large websites, like Netflix that gives us direct access to them. </p>
<p>There are Peering hubs where providers and hosts of every tier come together and can connect as Transit or Peers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wikipedia has lists of tier 1 and tier 2 providers in their articles.  I had fond memories of CWIX (Cable and Wireless) because it was one of our big uplinks back in the day when I was in support.   &quot;CWIX is down&quot;, easy answer to the customer's problem.  I found out that CWIX is actually Tier 2 and is now Vodafone.  &quot;MAE East is down&quot;, was also common back in the mid-90s.  I'm not sure what that is now...</p></div>		</li>
