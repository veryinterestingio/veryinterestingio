			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. I spent weeks perfecting/ trying to understand how to make clear ice. Distilled water. Boiling distilled water. Boiling, filtering water. Boiling, filtering, boiling again, filtering again. All of it does squat for clarity. Filtering and such might affect taste, but freezing in a cooler with no lid (directional), will give you clear ice out of well water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Starting with hot water in an insulated cooler seems to yield the best results. The insulated container retains heat and amplifies the top-down directional freezing effects. That it takes longer for the ice to form may be benefit as well, but I'm not sure what science magic is actually happening there. Something, something, ice crystal formation, etc. In any case, most of the stuff I've read recommends not having your freezer cranked to the max, but rather that slower freeze times are better for forming strong, clear, solid ice. But boiling is 100% pointless. Hot tap is fine. All the impurities (i.e. things that are not water molecules) get pushed down into the water at the bottom, which you discard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you not made ice cubes in your freezer before? If you have, and it tastes like freezer burn, you might need to clean your freezer. If it's an older model, probably needs a defrost. Or if you leave it in the freezer for way too long.</p>
<p>I don't have money to buy ice, and am super sensitive to freezer/fridge burn flavor. I also go through ice like air. (I need my water cold as fug, water tastes like it's temperature and I enjoy the flavor of COLD water, haha) using a shitty dying fridge, but it tastes fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I strongly recommend <a href="https://letyshops.com/r/aliexpress-m9intuatd9wc8" target="_blank">cheap ozone generators</a> from China for getting rid of bad smell from freezer (and even from old cars!) Just lock it inside and let it run for half an hour - ozone will kill all bacteria and fungi, even ones that live deep inside the vents.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually less likely to have any flavor, because if the water freezes from one side it pushes anything that isn't pure water out as it freezes.  Any minerals and trapped gasses get pushed out and will form a cloudy section at the very last part to freeze if you don't remove it before the whole block is frozen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, industrial ice makers flow water constantly over cooling plates. Because of Freezing Point Depression, only the purest fraction freezes first. The water that doesn't freeze is actually discharged out the machine.</p></div>		</li>
