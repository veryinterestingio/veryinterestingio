<p>As religious tolerance wasn't huge back then, it didn't take long for Rome to start persecuting &quot;old gods&quot; instead</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is kind of misleading. It took a really <em>long</em> time for Christian Roman Empire to stop the worship of old gods. Constantine did convert to Christianity, but it was Theodosius who enforced Edict of Thessalonica that made Christianity state religion, at least 50 years after the end of Constantine's rule. Even with the edict, paganism didn't just die like that. In 6th century - more than 100 years after the edict - Emperor Justinian had to close the Academy at Athens, as it was still a seat of Neo-Platonist Pagan authority within the city.</p>
<p>This sounds like a story of state-enforced religion, but that story is only partially true. Roman Empire wasn't a centralized government built on efficient bureaucracy like a modern state is. Conversion to Christianity that happens &quot;naturally&quot; is also common. In Britain during 9th century, a vernacular translation of the bible helped shape the idea of unified Anglo-Saxon during King Alfred's ruling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But that is not how the Roman Empire worked. You pretty much got to worship your own wolf deity, just also worship the Emperor as well. Oh, and pay your taxes.</p>
<p>The issue arose when Christianity came along and said &quot;Nah, there is only one god, God, and everyone who says otherwise is a bad, bad man&quot;. That's a problem. Not either Romans kill the Christians because they do not worship the Emperor, or the Christians kill/convert the Romans and everybody else they see. Both kinda happened, but then the Christians won over and the rest is history.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well said. </p>
<p>It should also be noted that gradually over time to make the transition easier to those still holding on to their pagan traditions, Christian rites and traditions were being integrated during pagan holidays to make it easier to fully transition. Hence the outright pagan traditions imbedded in to Christmas as an example. The tree, gifts, holly, garland all of the classic iconography stems from pagan traditions, superimposed on to the Jesus figure. </p>
<p>Even his origin story has been told by various deities which predate Christianity by thousands of years. </p>
<p>If it’s the same story being told but with just a different narrative it’s easier to remember and fall in line with - add in eventual threats of various types of persecution for not conforming to the new status quo of a monotheistic deity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The very word <em>pagan</em> comes from <em>paganus</em>, a Roman term for a rural country-dweller, what we might call today a &quot;hick from the sticks.&quot; The implication being that those  back-country folks were still clinging to their outdated folk beliefs, and not getting with the new, <em>au courant</em> religious beliefs professed by the more educated and sophisticated city folk.</p></div>		</li>

The saga Njal saga is fascinating in that it starts as a classic norse revenge story and ends a Christian forgiveness and redemption story, likely being written down and finished during the christianization of Iceland</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I know in Finland, while not nearly as remote as Iceland, it also was only after early 1000 when Christianity arrived. And even then it took some time, but unfortunately we have close to zero (reliable) information from that period and especially from time before. I am no historian so might be I just don't know / have read / found the information. Would be fascinating to know.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Generally speaking, Christian influence is to blame</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This, from what I understand.</p>
<p>Christian depiction of Lucifer with goat's eyes and similar animal features was meant to discourage people who used to worship older, pagan, animal-style Gods.</p>
<p>Also (on a lighter note), April Fool's Day is thought to have roots in medieval times among Christians who celebrated a post-Christmas New Year's Day on January 1 ridiculing those who historically celebrated New Year's with week-long celebrations from March 25 ending on April 1.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While it’s true romans did persecute early Christians, it wasn’t because they were religiously intolerant. Whenever they’d conquer a place they’d include their new conquests gods into their pantheon and find them Roman equivalents. The difference with Christians and Jews is that they believe in one god with utter supremacy that isn’t under Roman authority. They couldn’t have these groups running around all autonomous like when all other religion was more or less run by the state.
Christianity is what replaced old religions. People where pretty much forced into it once it took hold. Convert or die!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: they’d usually <em>steal</em> the statue of the god from the conquered peoples to take it back to Rome. When Pompey conquered Judea, he walked into the Holiest of Holies in the temple, &amp; there was nothing for him to steal. Monotheism fucked with their heads, hard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking of &quot;belief structure&quot; in Roman era is anachronistic. The Roman state didn't care about what people believed in. Faith (<em>fidei</em>) in a religion <em>is</em> a Christian concept (or post-Reformation concept). Roman Empire only cared about rites (<em>pietas</em>): the practicing of ritual. Norms and social orders. As long as you make sure the Roman order is in check, you're free to believe whatever you want.</p>
<p>Bacchanalia was forbidden because it fundamentally shattered crucial distinctions of class and gender. The poor and the elites, male and female, all can participate in their hedonistic ritual. The Druids often became loci of provincial revolt and was suspected to engage in practices of human sacrifices. Those practices were considered to disturb the Roman order. Hence they are forbidden.</p>
