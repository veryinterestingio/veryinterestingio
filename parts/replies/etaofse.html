			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, to melt ice that's about -0.1° C you could raise the temperature of an equal mass of 0.1° C water to roughly 83° C, assuming perfect efficiency. Wrap your head around that</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This opens up a whole new way of thinking about heat.</p>
<p>Your iced tea is exactly 0°C all the way until the ice fully melts (assuming its well stirred and you're at sea level).</p>
<p>Yoir boiling water is exactly 100°C all the way until the last drop evaporates.</p>
<p>A drop of sweat steals an enormous amount of heat from your skin when it evaporates.</p>
<p>You can get liquids that change phase at almost any temperature you want. This means you could create a thermos that is optimized to keep your drink at any temperature you want.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And people forget that ice is often well below zero. Domestic freezers are about -18, so the ice is often cold enough to chill a drink without even melting. Then you have all that latent heat to keep your drink cold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The temperature of the ice is pretty much negligible in the scenario.</p>
<p>SHC of ice is about half that of water. Combined with the fact that you generally add less ice than beverage (except maybe in America) the ice will most likely reach melting point way before the beverage reaches freezing point.</p>
<p>Turning a single ice cube from 0°C ice into 0°C water still cools about 9 times as much as turning the same ice cube from -18°C ice to 0°C ice.</p>
<p>You would have to use -163°C (-261 F) ice cubes just for the effect of the temperature difference to be equal to the effect of melting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what you're saying is that if I want to keep my hot tea hotter longer, I need to somehow vaporize it and get it all into my thermal flask, somehow deal with the pressure, and somehow prevent it all from escaping each time I take a drink! Genius!</p>
<p>(did I do this right:</p>
<p>if it's 1L of fluid, assuming 1g/mL, that's 1kg, at 18.02g/mol, that's 55.5 mol of H2O. PV=nRT, V = 1L (started with 1L of fluid, assuming a 1L flask), T = 373.15K, n = 55.5... 1699 atmospheres of pressure? That's totally doable.)</p></div>		</li>
