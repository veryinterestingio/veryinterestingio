			<div class="markdown"><p>You did not explain it concisely or clearly. That is the purpose of this subreddit. If you <em>really</em> don’t understand why people find this confusing, you don’t need to use the whole long names for every single thing. You also don’t need to use “characterized” and “furthermore” like you’re writing a research paper. It turns people off and sure as hell would confuse a five year old to tears. I HAVE a five year old who is super interested in science and medicine and even she would have had a meltdown if I tried to explain it to her like this. </p>
<p>If I were going to paraphrase what you said to my actual five year old, I would say “the part of the brain that lets you see is connected to something called the hypothalamus. When it’s darker because you closed your eyes, your brain tells the hypothalamus to make something called melatonin that makes you feel sleepy. Also when you close your eyes, the muscles in your face relax, which also makes you feel more relaxed, and that’s why it feels good to close your eyes”. </p>
<p>Except that’s not really even the main reason it feels good to close your eyes. One of the biggest reasons is sort of what a commenter mentioned above: when you’re working really hard (especially at a computer screen) you blink less which makes your eyes dried out. When you close them, they get wet again and that feels better.</p>
<p>I do not want to be rude if you were truly doing your best to answer the question. But your comment (at least to me) came across as arrogant, and I’m generally in agreement with Einstein that “if you can’t explain something simply, you don’t understand it well enough”. Not everything needs big fancy words to get the gist across, especially on a subreddit called “explain like I’m five”</p></div>		</li>
