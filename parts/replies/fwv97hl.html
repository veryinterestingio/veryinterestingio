			<div class="markdown"><p>Right.... And OP's question was whether anyone has done a competitive analysis of the covid models from the first few months of this thing to see how they compare to what we now know as &quot;ground truth&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The mathematics of a S-I-R model (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) is quite simple.  The magic comes in adjusting the drivers ... in this case rate of infection ... for events such as changes in policy or behavior.  Models cannot predict that stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good explanation. Whilst this is a bit of an oversimplification, I am curious as to which models have averaged/correctly guessed the amount of covid countermeasures in a large enough dataset so that we are able to somewhat accurately predict the spread even with these policy changes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a small clarification, but meteorologists do in fact use recent projections to fine tune future ones, both subjectively and objectively. Bias correction is a very real and automated thing in new modeling systems, which typically use a decaying average of recent errors to bias correct future forecasts. Meteorology is a cool blend of physical and statistical forecasting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good points! My intention was only to say they don’t routinely include any reports on prior forecast’s accuracy. I know that commercial weather forecasts sold to farmers and such do, in fact, compete on accuracy.</p></div>		</li>
