			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this reply. Could I just ask a quick follow up question, if time itself is powerless to resist the pull of the centre of a large black hole, it is possible that there are areas of space that are billions of years older/younger than others and in the same vein, could have experienced orders of magnitude more ‘time’ and therefore potentially life of some kind?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not time that's powerless, it's light. Time is relative but I suppose you could be right. What's even wilder is that there are regions of space that are so far away that we haven't even been able to observe it yet. Even wilder, some regions of space are expanding away from us at a faster rate than the speed of light, meaning we will never ever be able to see these regions. Who knows what could be out there. And who knows how old these places can be</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on this a bit further, there are regions of space that have already moved out of observable space, but their light from billions of years ago is still reaching us. They've already moved farther out than we'll ever be able to reach or interact with, and once the light they emit catches up with that, they'll fade out of the night sky forever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, not really.  The change in time is relative to outside observers, so while someone watches your clock slow as you approach the event horizon, you experience no slow down.  It’s hard to convey how weird it gets, but inside the event horizon the roles of space and time swap.  The space is so curved that all directions (up/down, left/right, forward/back) now point to the center of the black hole.  It’s like going over a waterfall: technically you could try to swim back up, but you can’t delay the inevitable collision at the bottom.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You can actually delay it by a little bit vs. just free falling toward the singularity, but it's true that all paths point to the singularity, so you have to be clever about it (there's no <em>out</em> to point to and just turn your engines to full throttle).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would suppose so! However, as I understand it, around a black hole, time is *slower.* It's the same in any gravity well, like, here on Earth time is a fraction of a second slower than on satellites or on the moon. It's just much more extreme around a black hole.</p>
<p>Which brings up a question for me that I think I know the answer to but wanna confirm:</p>
<p>Ship travels near black hole and orbits close-by. Above, (so I've heard) they see the future of the Universe, (galaxies merging and receding, supernovas blow, all that's left is red dwarfs that are fading to white and then cooling off).</p>
<p>Have I *actually* watched the Universe age, and if I come out of orbit, I'm there in a very very very old universe? If so, damn, avoid black holes. Or don't if you want to live forever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm also just an interested person, so don't take my answer as the truth.
But as far as I know yes, time passes slower for you if you are near a black hole. However you wouldn't really notice something's different, instead for you everything but you moves quicker through time (You described this as seeing the future of the universe, i think).
If you leave the gravitational field of that black hole, time passing will get closer to &quot;normal&quot;, but everything you saw happening has happened. You effectively travelled into the future.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There is a minimum distance where you can stably orbit a black hole (called, uncreatively, the innermost stable circular orbit). But if you're in free fall near an event horizon, which is unaccelerated motion in general relativity like orbit is, you don't see the end of the universe. However, if you fire your rocket engines near the event horizon to keep yourself from falling in so that you stay at a fixed radius outside the event horizon, you <em>will</em> notice time speed up above you at that point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a physicist so take with a grain of salt, just wanting to continue the convo here. My understanding is that if you are near the black hole, you are relatively moving through time much much faster than someone further away, and this result is not reversed when moving away from the black hole, so yes when you come away from the black hole you'd find that the universe has &quot;aged more&quot; than you. For example if you were to instantaneously compare your age to that of someone on earth, you'd find the earthbound person would've aged significantly more than you.</p></div>		</li>
