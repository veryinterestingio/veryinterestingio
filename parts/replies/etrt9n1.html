			<div class="markdown"><p>You might find argentina interesting then! I'm argentinian, and one thing that makes our accent (let's call it the rioplatense accent, as it originated in cities along the R√≠o de la Plata) unique, is that we pretty much speak Spanish with an Italian pronounciation. </p>
<p>During the world wars, we had some heavy Italian immigration, so we lost the more Spanish sounding accent due to the mixing of Italian and Spanish (called lunfardo). Our half Italian, half Spanish way of speaking ended up sticking, and we now have a drastically different pronounciation for pretty much the entirety of Spanish than most neighbouring countries do, with Uruguay being the exception, as that country is also located on the R√≠o de la Plata, and went through the same process. </p>
<p>Common things that stick out when listening to the rioplatense accent, when compared to other accents, is stuff like using &quot;vos&quot; instead of &quot;t√∫&quot;, having a harsh pronounciation of the &quot;LL&quot;, which we pronounce like the &quot;sh&quot; sound in the word &quot;show, shower, shard&quot; while most other Spanish speakers pronounce it softly, closer to the &quot;y&quot; sound you'd see on words like &quot;you, yolk, yarrow&quot;. Also, our verb tenses. While most other countries would say &quot;tienes, sabes, corres&quot;, we say &quot;ten√©s, sab√©s, corr√©s&quot; </p>
<p>One last thing. Our slang is pretty much Italian. Words like &quot;laburo&quot; are Italian.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It never takes more than 10 minutes for an Argentinian to tell you they‚Äôre European. This is why, when I hear this, I always pretend to ask how far down Argentina is in Mexico. For some strange reason this always elicits a unique form of contempt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yeah, I'm a big fan of Argentinian Spanish! It also helps that I'm a huge soccer fan, and a few of my favorite MLS team's players are Argentinian. Leandro Gonz√°lez Pirez has the most Italian sounding Spanish I've ever heard!</p></div>		</li>
