			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually a calorie is the amount of energy that is required to raise the temperature of one millilitre of water by one degree Celsius. We cant measure calories by the energy extraction of the human body because everyone is different and also some foods are not as easily digested and humans dont absorb all of the bioavailable calories from them. Prime example is sweetcorn which humans tend to be bad at digesting and therefore will pass alot of it whole. So eating 100g sweetcorn might not result in the caloric intake of 100g worth of sweetcorn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes, but calorie values are assigned based on some unit quantity of substance (more substance will provide more heat, so the value is meaningless except in some fixed base unit of reference).  With food, it is generally a &quot;serving&quot; size.  A small serving will have a small calorie value associated with it unless it is a very high caloric substance. It isn't actually truly ZERO, no energy whatsoever, but instead &quot;0 calories per serving&quot; means barely measurable energy from that amount (zero as far as we can measure using this device).  decimal-level energy, or apparently, less than 5 calories according to the regulations, if that other answer is true.  I don't know the regulations so cannot confirm its truth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right but this isnt the point i was making.</p>
<p>A Calorie is not the measure of how much your body can extract from the food. It is the measure as i stated above. I wasnt refuting the points about zero calorie foods which are just nonsense for the most part and are also in my opinion terrible for promoting good dietary habits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is two types of calories: calories and (food/kilo)Calories. The first type of calories is the energy needed to heat 1 gram of water (pretty much the same as 1 millilitre) of water by 1 degree C. The other type is what you usually see on food packaging or in diet discussions and is 1000*the first type of calorie.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A calorie is just a calorie. The second &quot;type&quot; you're referring to is a kilocalorie which is shortened on food packages the same way anything is.</p>
<p>The confusion comes from people using the word &quot;calorie&quot; to colloquially describe a kilocalorie for ease of use. Rest assured there's only one &quot;type&quot; of calorie and then the kilo equivalent, the same way there's a gram and a kilogram.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true, but caloric counts on food actually do account for the your ability to access the energy - not by way of absorbtion, but on whether you can metabolize it at all.</p>
<p>Today, caloric counts are generally done by the Atwater system, adding up the expected calories of various macros. Dietary fiber is a big one - it has the same energy as other carbs, but you can't metabolize it, so it doesn't add to the caloric count. Same with some artificial sweeteners.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With the sweetcorn analogy its nothing to do with absorption and more than its a food that often passes whole through the body in significant quantities.</p>
<p>The specific unit of measurement of a calorie has no function to account for how well a human can metabolise especially given every person metabolises and digests differently but also because it is simply a scientific unit of energy described by thermal change (and also widely refuted by scientists for the past four decades). The function comes from listing dietary fiber as a separate count. But it still doesnt account for the fact that even if something is bioavailable, not every person will metabolise 100% of the available calories from it.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough the way we establish the calorie counts of some macronutrients is also flawed because its based on historic false assumptions.</p>
<p>We measure protein for example, by measuring nitrogen. But the problem is nitrogen doesn't only come from protein. Fat is quite easily measured and as you say carbs are a little complicated. A better terminology would be 'available carbs' if we are looking to use food labelling as a way of informing consumers because it represents that fraction of carbohydrate that can be digested by human enzymes.</p>
<p>Dietary fibre can be metabolised when fermented by gut bacteria and broken down into short chain fatty acids but not in significant quantities.</p>

<p>Downvote all you want but the source is a United Nations agreed standard of food energy measurement.</p></div>		</li>
