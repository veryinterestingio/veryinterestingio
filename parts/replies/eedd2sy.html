			<div class="markdown"><p>No, this is actually a <em>very</em> good rule of thumb. Most plant, fungal, protist, and bacterial viruses only infect a single species. Arboviruses, and arthropod viruses are the exception, not the rule.</p>
<p>Edit: I only mentioned arboviruses and arthropod viruses, as they are commonly studied viruses with large host ranges.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You sure about that? Many plant viruses even jump kingdoms into insects. And, <a href="https://jgv.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/jgv/10.1099/jgv.0.000742#tab2" target="_blank">this paper</a> says otherwise.</p>
<p>Quote: &quot;, host species jumps are certainly not infrequent among plant viruses, given the extreme contrasts of their host range breadth (HRB), from a single species to more than 1000, and the incongruence between the phylogeny of most plant viruses and that of their host species (but see [ 10, 11 ])&quot;</p>
<p>And</p>
<p>&quot;Viruses with a single-stranded (ss) genome (either composed of RNA or DNA) had a broader host range (16.7 and 12.6 plant species on average, respectively) than viruses with a double-stranded (ds) genome (3.6 and 3.9 species on average for dsRNA and dsDNA viruses, respectively). In contrast, there was no significant difference in the absHRB of positive- and negative-sense (or ambisense) RNA viruses ( P=0.097; Kruskal–Wallis test). Viruses with three genome segments had a significantly broader host range (28.3 species on average) than other groups (10.5–15.7 species on average).&quot;</p>
<p>In fact, having a wide host range is characteristic of plant viruses.</p>
<p>As for fungal viruses, very little is known about fungal viruses. But, I do see some literature suggesting they're limited by the crazy vegetative compatibility groups fungi have.</p>
<p>As for bacteriophage, most infect 2 or more bacterial species - and the host range gets broader if you consider serotypes or strains of bacteria. And, their host range is very plastic across time.</p>
<p>Please provide a reference for your claim on protist viruses. Because as far as I can tell the literature are scarce at best and your claim is just baseless.</p>
<p>So, no it really isn't a good rule of thumb. And, host range needs to be considered on a case by case basis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was a good read, but you’re citing a paper with very few citations that flies in the face of <em>consensus</em>. Just because host jumps “are not infrequent” doesn’t mean <em>most</em> viruses have broad host ranges. Based on what we know, <em>most</em> of them infect a species and sometimes species in a genus, and exceptional cases have wide host ranges. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure. Just because you said it, I’m going to write the authors of the books I’ve read, dozens of researchers and taxonomists in virology I’ve conversed with and authors of papers I’ve read and tell them they’re wrong.</p>
<p>Look, I’ve seen that <em>some</em> are pushing the idea we’ve been mislead because we culture wild type viruses in a single, compatible cell type, and we shouldn’t do that, but until I see more (and I’ll be right there to apologize to you), I’m sticking to it as a <em>rule of thumb</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Notice that many of the viruses you listed are zoonoses in humans? They get the most press because they cause the most dramatic diseases, but the fact of the matter is the vast vast majority of viruses have very limited host range. When a virus makes a jump into a new species it is often more virulent so we notice it more. I would argue that those sorts of zoonotic infections are undergoing more of an evolutionary transition between hosts rather than stably existing with a broad host range. If we're just listing viruses what about polio, measles, rubella, hep A and C, most of the herpes viruses, HPV, smallpox, mumps, HIV, etc. These only infect humans. Viruses need specific receptors to enter cells and they are often different between species. Even in viruses like flu with a broad host range, generally there are avian adapted strains that are quite bad at infecting humans and human adapted strains that are quite bad at infecting birds. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s a good rule of thumb for anyone (according to my textbooks, at least). There are many distinct species of virus, so there are many exceptions. But, by and large, of the ones we’ve catalogued, most species infect a singular species or closely related species.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's <em>every</em> rule of thumb. None of them take into account edge cases, because if they did it would not be a rule of thumb, it would be a textbook.</p></div>		</li>
