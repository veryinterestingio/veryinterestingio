			<div class="markdown"><p>If they are circular, how can they have direction? I mean, if the magnetic field is an orbit or sphere around, how/why does it point in one direction? Does it &quot;hula-hoop&quot;? How can it be circular if only one side is magnetic and the other not/or even repels? I have a good level of understanding on Physics but I never understood the model of representation of magnetic fields, like everything is arrows in and out like it makes sense at all.</p>
<p>Then you see a representation of Earth magnetic field  and see they are like hairs or something. Some go from north pole to south pole like a C and other arrows get lost in space. Every representation of magnetism seems too different.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In short, it matters if they're going clockwise or counter-clockwise</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats the best analogy we have for spin, but they really don't &quot;spin&quot;. I mean its a good answer but I still can't quite visualize a magnetic field and the current representations don't seem to be really consistent and/or intuitive. If they could physically spin, magnetism would always be an atractive force and never a repulsive one, no? The &quot;vortices&quot; would either sum or cancel but never invert outwards.</p>
<p>It's the repulsive part which is more interesting and obscure to me really, I can imagine atractive magnetism with spin analogies but repel is another thing.</p></div>		</li>
