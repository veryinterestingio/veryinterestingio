			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve always heard this and wondered why - because it’s not true for me. After a good cry I often feel drained and emotionless. If I got to sleep after a good cry I wake up in the morning feeling hungover - throbbing headache, heavy eyes, achy all over. </p>
<p>I suppose mentally/emotionally it feels good to get it all out, but damn it if I feel like I got hit by a truck the next day physically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t necessarily thinking crying (tears) means you need help. It just means you’re feeling an emotion. Crying out (shouting, yelling, or the big cry boo hoos) cover that part I think.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, do babies cry tears when they cry? Or are they just crying out? Not sure, never raised a baby.</p>
<p>I would have to guess that crying to attract attention came first, and only later became entangled in emotion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>sure some people ignore tears and assume a person’s just really whiny.</p>
<p>but I think a far greater number of people will see tears and instinctively want to help, comfort, or support the cryer. even if actively arguing with that person. it signals “I’m wounded, this is not a game anymore”</p>
<p>however I’m not a trained medical professional nor a shrink, just another opinionated redditor.</p></div>		</li>
