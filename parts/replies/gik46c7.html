			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be more appropriate to say that wood is not a chemical compound. It's a complex mixture of compounds organized into very specific structures.</p>
<p>Large, complex molecules tend to be less likely to survive large amounts of heat. There are just too many chemical bonds for there not to be some that are weak enough to break under sufficient heating, well before the substance itself could melt or evaporate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think better word would be that heated wood degrades into other substances that are not wood. I think it also applies to many polymers. They degrade and turn into other substances before they could melt while heated.</p></div>		</li>
