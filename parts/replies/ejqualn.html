			<div class="markdown"><p>I think itâ€™s important to remember not just Stanford, but Berkeley is in the area, which runs Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, while Lawrence Livermore National Lab is in the area as well. During the 20th century, these labs carried out significant work in physics and engineering, such as orchestrating the Manhattan Project. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, I grew up in Pleasanton CA, which was the first Silicon Valley before it got too expensive and everyone left for Palo Alto.</p>
<p>Pleasanton was actually an agricultural town and a federal prison town (which changed form FCI Pleasanton to FCI Dublin) we moved there because my dad got a job with the county ag department.</p>
<p>Essentially, there was cheap land. A bunch of farmers sold their land and got it zoned for businesses, but it literally sat vacant for probably 10-15 years. I'm not sure who was the first, but PeopleSoft moved in, followed by Cisco and Oracle and then the boom happened. Pleasanton got greedy and charged too high of rent and everyone moved to Palo Alto, which was much cheaper. It was a lot easier when BART moved into everywhere.</p>
<p>I remember when Livermore was kind of a dump, and the Dublin wanted to be part of Blackhawk, but it was too poor and forced them to make their own city. </p>
<p>I haven't been back in years, although my parents made out on the house. Their 130k house sold for 1.4 million.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hard to imagine Palo Alto being cheaper. It's one of the most expensive places in the area. They basically require a Tesla to get in. That or a bicycle so there's more room for the Telsas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to live in Palo Alto in the 1990s and it was already crazy expensive back then, but the old timers I met from there told me it used to be just a bunch of fruit orchards back in the day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The rise of Silicon Valley predates Cisco, Peoplesoft, and Oracle by decades. Palo Alto was the semiconductor (the <em>silicon</em> in Silicon Valley) capital of the world well before any of these companies existed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People are often unaware of the amount of the involvement of University, Business, and Government funded research that goes into consumer technology. I highly recommend &quot;The State Behind the iPhone&quot; by Mazzucato to get an idea of just how innovative something like the iPhone was really built on government funded research.</p></div>		</li>
