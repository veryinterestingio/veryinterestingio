			<div class="markdown"><p>Your spatial sense is adaptive; if you make changes to your ears you relearn. I don’t have the clip handy, but Smarter Everyday did a segment in this. </p>
<p>That said, it’s a bit corse; minor modifications are not going to have a drastic difference. You can verify this for yourself by putting on a pair of in ear headphones and listen to a binaural recording (specifically a demonstration one where they call out where they are speaking from) and you should notice you perceive it in approximately the correct location. These recordings are done using a rough bust, including a modeled ear. So, unless you’ve got exceptionally shaped ears (which match the model) you’ve proven the concept that minor variations don’t disrupt the mechanism too much.</p></div>		</li>
