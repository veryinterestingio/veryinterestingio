			<div class="markdown"><p>Pollen is a good way to describe the particles.  Also, think talcum powder or smoke particles.  They're simply not heavy enough to have the kinetic energy to damage rock, or even hard dried mud/clay to any significant degree.  The teeny tiny particle size is why the Martian dust storms last so very long -- the Brownian motion of what air there is keeps the dust motes aloft.  Further, those particles are small enough to block sunlight through Mie and Rayleigh scattering which redirects the sunlight, rather than blocking it directly such as in a Earth style sandstorm.</p>
<p>Consider - at 6mb surface pressure (vs 1000mb for Earth), a Martian 100mph wind would just be enough to rustle your hair.  On Earth, a 100mph wind hits you with about 50 lb/sq ft.  On Mars, it would be about  4 ounces / square foot.  </p>
<p>Let me give you some physical scale.  A 500 sheet ream of copy paper is about 5 pounds.  25 sheets would be 4 ounces.  </p>
<p>Enjoy the breeze in your hair as you watch the blue sunset and your blood boils!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s the red dust in the atmosphere scattering light when the sun shines through it. Basically the opposite of what happens on earth, where the sky is normally blue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The giant dust cloud later on in the book (not in the movie), is the far more realistic depiction of weather on Mars.</p>
<p>But hey, the author needed a way for one person to be stuck on Mars when the others left , and the rest of the story is pretty solid, so I’m kinda fine with the unrealistic storm at the start.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's pretty much the one big inaccuracy in the story, at least in the book.  Most everything else holds up or needs only a little bit a tweaking to make it work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well in order to feel it you would have to be exposed without a space suit and at those pressures that means any liquids on or in you will vaporize.</p>
<p>So picture blood vessels bursting and your eyes boiling while your lungs get freeze dried. Oh and you would feel a cryogenically cold layer of powdery dust accumulating on your skin and in your hair.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought the whole &quot;blood boiling in your veins&quot; thing had been debunked? I know you lose the moisture from exposed areas, and i beleive your lungs forcibly deflate, but as i understand it our body is sufficiently well contained that it won't internally depressurise due to low external pressure.</p></div>		</li>
