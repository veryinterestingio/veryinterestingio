			<div class="markdown"><p>On top of this, the paint that B-2s are painted in is specially-designed to absorb radar signal and dampen it.</p>
<p>Back then this paint only came in black, but nowadays can also be shaded into the greys that jets like the F-35 are painted in. Coloured stealth coatings still aren't around though, which is why modern stealth jets don't have the big flashy squadron markings older jets like the F-14 and 15 had.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny little fact about the paint. </p>
<p>When they were developing the f117 stealth plane the pigment they found to have the best radar absorption was a pinkish purple color. </p>
<p>The Air Force said nah. Itâ€™s gonna be black.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a bit more to it; notice there's no surface that's perpendicular to the ground to reflect radar. No tail, no inside corners. Engine intakes and exhaust hidden from view. Add radar absorbent materials and paint and the radar signature is equivalent to that of a bird. If your radar is really good, you might spot that bird going 600mph at 25,000ft, so the pilots still plan missions to stay as far away from radar installations as possible. Finally, engine exhaust is mixed with air as it leaves the aircraft, reducing heat signature and noise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. The nose on a normally shaped plane will reflect radar at just about any angle as well as engine cowls, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In earlier planes it had been less of a concern (excluding the F117 of course) But for this plane all the surfaces have been computer calculated to generate the least amount of reflection back to the source to make it stealthier.</p></div>		</li>
