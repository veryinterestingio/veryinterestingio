			<div class="markdown"><p>there are probably terms you’ve heard like piston and cylinder which is actually a rod with a cap on the end (piston) sliding within a hollow tube (cylinder) now these have very narrow gaps between them to allow the piston to slide within the cylinder without releasing the pressure as this is essentially how the engine generates power. (Explosion causes piston to slide down cylinder).</p>
<p>When the engine runs without oil or coolant it overheats from the explosions happening, this causes the pistons or cylinders to warp and not fit properly, not allowing them to slide and some cases it can get so hot that the piston or cylinder partially melts and fuses with the other. Since there are many cylinders and pistons connected together, one failure causes them all to stop working, and this sudden stop can cause even more damage to other parts due to the momentum of the moving parts.</p>
<p>It essentially destroys the engine and is very hard to repair.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In fact, Citroën workers in occupied France sabotaged vehicles being made for Germany’s war effort by deliberately moving the marker on the oil dipstick to the wrong location. The engine would still run because it was getting some lubrication, but not enough, causing premature engine failure in the field.</p></div>		</li>

<p>one failure causes them all to stop working</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I seized an engine in a 92 Toyota Camry. (I'd hit something and busted the oil pan earlier that day without realizing.)</p>
<p>In most cases, when you seize an engine, it's only one of the cylinders which is seized. The others are usually still free but linked due to the piston journals and crankshaft.</p>
<p>On my engine, though, if you seize one of the cylinders, the output of the other three is enough to break the piston journal of the seized cylinder. It didn't even stall the engine. I just had significantly less engine power and it ran like shit. It would start, idle, and even drive. I only used this to get up an off ramp and to a safe area and had it towed to the shop from there. The second cylinder from the left was completely welded and there was metal bits on the bit of remaining oil in the pan.</p>
<p>10 years ago, a junkyard engine for this car, installed and with a new radiator and oil pan was $1100.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have managed to get small lawnmower engines going, again after they sized, it took a lot of torque on the crank loads of oil in the engine and the cylinder and they smoke like a bastard after. They worked though, obviously nothing broke inside when they were running without oil in the fuel mix.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work in a junkyard and one day we got a &quot;runner&quot; in.  Smoked a little, but we decided to play a little.  Found a big funnel about the size of the carburetor and mounted it.  Then we started the car and put a brick on the pedal.  While it revved at max RPM, I dumped 5 gal of water down the funnel.  Engine block looked looked a porcupine with all the rods sticking out.  This was way before YouTube.</p></div>		</li>
