			<div class="markdown"><p>Adrenaline also blunts the pain response.  So when in an activated state, you might push your muscles well beyond what you would usually tolerate.  I totally agree that it does not &quot;make muscles stronger&quot;.  But it does remove inhibitions to using muscles up to and past the point of doing damage to tissue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct about the pain. It’s actually mediated by endogenous opioids (endorphins), and it’s also correct that you could damage the muscle by pushing it beyond the limit, but that doesn’t seem to apply to OP’s scenarios. If you don’t have the potential to lift a car, adrenaline won’t give you the strength to do so.</p></div>		</li>
