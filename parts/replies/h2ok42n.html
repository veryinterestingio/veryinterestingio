			<div class="markdown"><p>Heat of fusion does hit that way.  It's part of why phase change cooling is so effective.  You can sink a ton of heat into the phase change (called heat of vaporization when going from liquid to gas or back).</p>
<p>In case anyone misunderstands, there's an extra &quot;jolt&quot; or &quot;step&quot; of energy required to get ice at ~0°C to water at ~0°C and vice versa beyond just &quot;heating it up&quot; which is called &quot;heat of fusion&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also the reason why fridges, deepfreezer and air conditioner are one of the most effficient devices humans ever invented.</p>
<p>The phase change of the refridgerant carries so much heat energy with so little work that some devices achieve above 95% energy efficiency.</p></div>		</li>
