			<div class="markdown"><p>Not yet as I know. We do know that vaccine-induced immunity is stronger, more protective from COVID-19 disease than immunity after natural virus infection. So people who have had COVID are recommended to get a vaccine to increase immunity for however long.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because those who had had covid do have <em>some</em> immunity, would you recommend they defer getting a vaccine until those who have not had covid have had the chance to get it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of places that are struggling to get people to come in and vaccinate. Appointments are being missed and doses squandered. At this point I think anyone with the opportunity to get vaccinated should just take it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well in Brazil we have seen people who have had verified covid and have been reinfected with one of the newer strands. So yes these people should get the vaccine</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those studies are underway. Countless labs are working on it. Unfortunately our knowledge of the virus is just over a year old and our knowledge of immunity from infection or  vaccination is less. There are two parts, how long you sustain a level of protective immunity (which declines with time) and whether the virus changes over that time. I will also say immunity can prevent you from getting the virus but it can also prevent severe illness if you do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It just doesn’t seem like enough is known right now to arbitrarily recommend a vaccine. We do know that people can get re/infected with Covid. We DO NOT KNOW how long a vaccine will provide immunity. We don’t know if one will need a booster shot every six months, for ever. We DO NOT KNOW if the present vaccines work against mutations of the original strain. One strategy is to simply wait for better vaccines to come into the market. Maybe a third generation vaccine would: 1) not require a second shot, 2) is more effective against mutations and 3) will provide immunity for several years. We also do not know if it wise to have a person take several different vaccines.</p></div>		</li>
