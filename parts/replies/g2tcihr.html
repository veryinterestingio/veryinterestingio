			<div class="markdown"><p>I sneeze between 0 and 6 times.</p>
<p>Its never the same, but always in that range.</p>
<p>I envy people that know how many times they sneeze each time. Its just so unpredictable and especially the 0 one fucks me up.</p>
<p>One awful day i knew i needed to sneeze more than once... three times in a row i almost sneezed and then it was gone... i hate that day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>FuQ guys. Sets of 5-6 min(or that itch just isn't  satisfied), and incredibly violent, spine-popping, full-body sneezes. My wife thought I was dying the 1st time she heard it, and still does half the time. </p>
<p>Spring time in AZ <em>suuuuuuuucks</em>.</p>
<p>Edit: I also often get pretty lightheaded, like I'm about to pass out.</p></div>		</li>
