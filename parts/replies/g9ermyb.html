			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because a lot of people are taking the term quenching your thirst to mean hydrating your body. It doesn't. </p>
<p>Thirst quenching is a sensation in your mouth and throat. It's like scratching an itch and besides stopping the itch, it also feels good.</p>
<p>The best was to quench your thirst is cold bubbly thin water. This stimulates your throat the most.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As Ive gotten older, I find cold water is the best thirst quencher.  After that the light Gatorade’s are also good. The stickier and sweeter a liquid is, and certainly any alcohols - the less quenching. If you put your hand in a bucket of the liquid and your hand feels sticky, you could only imagine what that same liquid would do to the surfaces of your mouth and throat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure what people mean exactly by thirst quencher. If I exercised and I'm sweaty and my mouth is dry, yeah I want cold or at least not-warm water, I want something as neutral as possible. </p>
<p>If it was only mild physical activity, like doing some outside work on a nice spring day, then something like a cold beer might feel very good too. The beer feels more delicious enjoyed that way so it's also about the experience.</p>
<p>But if I'm sitting at my desk all day and feel a bit thirsty? Then coffee is quenching my thirst perfectly fine.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But I agree with you</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if people were conflating the two (thirst quenching and hydrating) and saying coffee does not, they would be wrong. Coffee is mostly water, and does hydrate you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it is a mild diuretic for like the first cup of the day. After that, the effect lessens, and even the initial effect is offset by the water you're taking in. If you took straight caffeine powder, you would still pee a bit more, just not enough to make a significant difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It isn't a mild diuretic. It isnt a diuretic at all. Caffeine is not a diuretic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No it's not. It's not a mild diuretic. It's not a diuretic at all. Not even the first cup. Powder will not make you pee more. </p>
<p>Unless you have a new scientific source for that, it's been thoroughly debunked.</p></div>		</li>
