			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, and a death certificate would reflect this.  Something to the effect of: manner of “homicide”, cause “multiple stab wounds”.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>absolutely correct. I haven't ever had to sign a death certificate for trauma. However, if I did sign one, this ambiguity in which wound was actually fatal is why the actual cause of death would be &quot;exsanguination&quot; with mention of the wounds that led to the bleeding</p></div>		</li>
