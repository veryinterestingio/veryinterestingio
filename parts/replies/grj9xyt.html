			<div class="markdown"><p>With allergens desensitisation injections you are retraining the immune system to switch from producing IgE antibody, which uses T2 helper cells to T1 helper cells that produce IgG. IgE binds to 3D structures and IgG binds to 2D amino acid sequences, so with breaking down the allergen by allergoidation (adding a chemical that alters it's 3D structure but leave it 2D amino acid sequences in tack) allowed greater doses of the allergen, with less chance of a negative allergic reaction. My response doesn't really answer the question but it gives a little background.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IgE and IgG both bind to the same 3D target. It's just IgE is attached to a different signal end of the antibody in the constant region. IgG4 antibodies only neutralise the thing they bind to, they don't trigger inflammation. IgE antibodies activate mast cells and produce a huge immune response.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if tolerance results in the same B cells switching from IgE to IgG4, or if it results in a change in the numbers of different B Cell lineages though.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahh. That explains why when I got scabies (an unimaginable hell), I didn’t have a reaction right away. I’ve been told if I ever get them again I’ll know much more quickly, because I’ll get a reaction immediately. I wonder if it also contributed to the sarcoidosis I got just months later. Luckily both of these were 4 years ago and I haven’t had an issue since.</p></div>		</li>
