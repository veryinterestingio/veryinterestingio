			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but those only happens on more massive stars. The less massive stars doesn't have enough mass to have these reactions, as the more massive the star is the more heavier elements it can produce.</p>
<p>Our Sun for example will only have Helium fusion in it's late age, so you might get lithium and carbon max. The Sun will not go into nova either, the core will collapse into a white dwarf, while it's outer shell will scatter as a planetary nebula.</p>
<p>More massive stars will gradually ignite multiple times as more heavier element start to ignite with each time the star output will spike, then gradually stabilize.</p>
<p>Lower mass stars than our Sun will only fuse Helium when it collapse as white dwarf, no red giant phase. So it's the end of life thing.
Even lower mass stars like red dwarf will gradually get slower fusion rate as it's going out of fuel, and will not even collapse into a white dwarf as it doesn't have enough mass, the fusion rate will keep dropping till it stops as there's no longer enough Hydrogen there. Then the star will start to cool off, requiring tens of billions of years. And yes there no already cooled off dwarf stars as they require much more longer time as the current age of universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is worth to mention that the process is also due to quantum tunnelling. </p>
<p>Even our own star isn't hot enough to sustain nuclear reactions without quantum tunnelling. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes both Quantum tunnelling and pressure plays a role here, pressure brings nucleus closer together to the point that quantum tunnelling will take over.</p>
<p>Our Sun core is 15~17MK while on Earth for a fusion reactor to work we need temperatures at the 100MK range, the pressure on the other hand is a major difference, before 2 years, about 2atm pressure was achieved in one of the experimental fusion reactors, in the Sun core however it's estimated to have 261.5 billion atm of pressure, this major pressure is what makes QT more common in the core of stars.</p>
<p>BTW, QT as a reason is still theoretical. But it's the best explanation on why stars can sustain fusion even if the temperature in the core is much less than what is theoretically required. Adding the QT to the mix makes a lot of sense in the numbers scientists see.</p></div>		</li>
