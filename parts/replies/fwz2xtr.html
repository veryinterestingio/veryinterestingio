			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine drawing on a flashlight and the image appears colored on the wall when you light the flashlight.</p>
<p>Now imagine instead of light/photons being thrown on the wall, it's paintballs and instead of light a balloon.</p>
<p>Now instead of paintballs mini-fireworks and instead of balloon an explosion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let me try: you have an explosive duck. When it blows up, feathers go POOF! in all directions. Now imagine you shave one side of the duck with a set of Wahl^(TM) clippers.</p>
<p>Only the feathers are paintballs and the paintballs are fireworks and the clippers are a balloon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine having gnomes throwing even smaller gnomes that carry tiny paint balls. Those smaller gnomes have tiny watches, and smash their paintballs exactly two seconds after being thrown. Then the whole paint makes a big splat on the floor, and make a picture of a sorry face... If my calculations are correct...</p></div>		</li>
