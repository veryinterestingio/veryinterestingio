			<div class="markdown"><p>This is one thing that I wonder about when it comes to new battery powered devices e.g.cars. people don't realize the potential danger in releasing that much chemical energy suddenly in the case of failure. So we're definitely reaching a safety limit in terms of capacity, which means that to further improve usability we can only really work on improving charging speed and charging infrastructure.</p>
<p>I wonder if there's a similar theoretical limit on how fast we can charge li-ion batteries?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as charging, we're good. Charging super fast is more of a infrastructure than a safety issue. To charge a Tesla in minutes at your house, you would likely need a 3 phase megawatt connection to your house. Average US home can only supply 200 amps at 120v. Average US house can do at most, 24kW. This is nowhere near enough to fast charge a car battery, which is why the infrastructure is the limitation and not the technology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having that much power flowing to residential buildings has its own risk with regards to safety. Try to transfer too much power through a conductor and you get an arc flash which is effectively an explosion as the conductor vaporizes. Before that there is the risk of fire and elocution. Getting hit with 120v is dangerous, but is usually painful rather than fatal. 440v, 3 phase power at the 10s to 100s of amps needed for megawatt charging can blow you across a room while burning holes in your body. This is just the retail end and doesn’t include the commercial infrastructure to supply those levels of power. </p>
<p>Not disagreeing that expanded charging infrastructure isn’t key to increasing the utility of EVs, just saying that it also contains risks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chemist here,
There is absolutely a limit to the charging rate of Li+ batteries. It's actually a fairly simple (as far as chemical kinetics go anyway) calculation. The charging occurs because of some redox reaction where lithium ions gain electrons, so the kinetic limit of that reaction would be the rate limiting step of the charging. Depending on the other materials involved, this could change, but there will always be a limit.</p></div>		</li>
