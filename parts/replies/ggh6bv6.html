			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly because the source code can be reviewed by anyone. If the code is open source, anyone can look at it and find exploitable bugs. Those bugs can then be patched before they're exploited in the wild. Closed source generally means there's only the people who wrote the code doing the reviewing, so these bugs often get missed.</p>
<p>This also protects against actively malicious programs. The nasty code would be on display for anyone to see and noticed very quickly. People would then not use the program or patch the malicious code out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Theoretically, that’s how it would work. Realistically, code is complicated and flaws can be subtly or accidentally introduced, as in the Heartbleed bug.</p></div>		</li>

<p>One huge issue that was recently was discovered was that around 17% of open source bugs are planted for malicious purposes according to github.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/open-source-software-how-many-bugs-are-hidden-there-on-purpose" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
<p>So even if you have people reviewing the code and open for everyone to view it, it still can slip through the cracks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The source code is available for anyone to view, dissect, and compile themselves, and then check bit by bit against the pre-compiled version offered by the author to insure nothing has changed.</p>
<p>Even if you're an average Joe and don't know how to write a single line of code, a popular piece of software on GitHub will have thousands of nerds way smarter than you or I pouring over the code to fix bugs. Any malicious  blocks of code would theoretically be weeded out very quickly.</p>
<p>So really, unless you're willing and able to check the code yourself, it's just shifting the burden of trust away from a large profit-motivated company to a large faceless group of internet strangers. Inarguably better, but cold comfort.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The claim that open-source software is being checked by third parties is lovely.  However, unfortunately for that idyllic view of the world, reality turns out to be very different.</p>
<p>OpenSSL has a random number generator.  Changes were made, purportedly innocently, which absolutely crippled the RNG.   Debian is one of the &quot;strictest&quot; Linux distributions, which has a very hard policy on absolutely compiling everything from source.  No-one noticed for eighteen months that all of the cryptographic keys it generated were guessable in milliseconds.  Since then, I have regarded to &quot;oh, open source&quot; claim as a fairytale told to console children.   There is no invisible hand of audit, and many eyes do not make bugs shallow if no-one realises it's a bug.  Who knows what else is broken in the Linux cryptographic hinterland?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You cannot really hide malicious things with open source. Bad coding practices that make tradeoffs that user of that software would not want are easy to hide with closed source software, with there being virtually no way to ever be held accountable for anything. From sloppy code, to laziness and to plain malicious intent, it is exceedingly difficult for user of said software to do anything about it.</p>
<p>With open source, you have not only the option of seeing the trouble, and if you don't want to work on it, you can wait for someone else to do so, or even pay someone to fix it for you. This means the original project is under pressure to fix their flaws as they are open and exposed to users, and even further, refusing to do so can mean someone can just take your code, fix the problems and then you are competing against your own code, but better. So both you have people voluntarily working on your software to improve it, and you have various ways in which you're pressured to improve it.</p>
<p>Many open source projects which went under and stopped accepting user contributions had new projects just pop up using the same code as a base.</p>
<p>Compare this to closed source, where developer stopping maintenance means that at best, users can start a whole new project from scratch.</p>
<p>Basically, every step of the way, open source adds both tools for developers to maintain high quality code, and pressure to keep their code quality high. With closed source, it is much easier to end up in a situation where bad or malicious code is either undetected, or people can't do anything about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, cars go through a lot of testing and auditing just to be allowed to be driven on public roads, and many people do have understanding of their vehicle going way beyond that.</p>
<p>If the car being sold to you is black unmarked box with no observable features, and when you ask how it works you get &quot;it just does, now hop in&quot;, I'm pretty sure great many people would be uncomfortable and would go to great lengths to figure out what's going on.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind, you don't need to read the code yourself. Just make sure that multiple people have, and they haven't found any issues.</p>
<p>And yes, sometimes you end up in a situation where benefits of jumping into the black box outweight the risk. But you want to be continuously trying to minimize the number of black boxes you have to trust, and how much you trust them. Maybe some app is necessary and there are no workarounds today. But check tomorrow and maybe there is something new.</p></div>		</li>
