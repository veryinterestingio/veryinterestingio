			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea,  it there is still a lot of restructuring that goes on. When I lost my leg blood and fluids would pool in the base. Took about 6 months for the veins to reroute everything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, as I recall, during the amputation surgery the tie off the larger arteries and veins. It is very true that the blood goes into the stump and sits there.
You have to keep it elevated for weeks as not to swell up all bulbous. You also have to wear compression socks to keep the size down.
As you do this a funny thing starts to happen. Your veins, arteries, and capillaries start to change seemingly of thief own accord. They constrict and expand relative to one another until blood and blood pressure is normalized.
I'm a year on and only increased a little when not in compression.
In short, fuckin magic bro.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have any data other than fundamental fluid dynamics.</p>
<p>One has to assume that the body develops to match impedances between your arms.  That way both arms get roughly the same amount of flow for each beat of the heart.  Same goes for each leg, each nut, and each thumb.</p>
<p>If an entire arm is cut off, there is a change in the parallel/series resistor network (so to speak) that can be drawn out using the impedances of our arteries, capillaries, and veins.  Suddenly limbs would get a mismatch in blood flows, I would think.  The body would have to slowly correct for that to ensure each part of our body is getting the correct amount of flow and one part isn't being robbed of flow.</p>
<p>Am I over-thinking this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are control systems in place to balance things out, I believe primarily working by dilating and constricting blood vessels to adjust resistance.</p>
<p>In an intact body, the circulatory system already does a lot of routing around.  Right arm doing something, left arm isn't?  The right arm needs and gets more blood.</p></div>		</li>
