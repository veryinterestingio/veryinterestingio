			<div class="markdown"><p>An important sidenote</p>
<p>Just like a plastic cups buttons can pop back up over time because of... reasons... so can the SD card's switches. Storing data long term (multiple years) on flash storage, especially cheap flash storage like a micro SD card is <em>not</em> recommended. Over time the data can be lost.</p>
<p>I know a lot of people who have tried to use SD cards and flash drives as archival storage so PSA: Don't do that.</p>
<hr />
<p>EDIT: Some questions on what to do for backup:</p>
<p>There's lots and lots of ways to do this and there's no right answer... but here's some ideas</p>
<p><strong>Good Backup Habits</strong></p>
<p>The Number 1 Rule is to <strong>keep multiple copies of your data.</strong> Have <em>on site</em> and <em>off site</em> copies of your data. </p>
<p>Off-site storage can be as simple as copying to another drive and taking it to work or giving it to a trusted friend. That way if a fire/thief/alien/meteor destroys your home drive, you can still go to your friend and get a copy. </p>
<p>There's tons of cloud storage services that specialize in backups as well <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/" target="_blank">like Backblaze</a>. Or just chuck it on Google Cloud, OneDrive, Dropbox, Amazon etc. It's a monthly cost but the larger services are unlikely to disappear unless something huge happens. Cloud storage can get very expensive when you get into larger multi-terabyte archives. </p>
<p>If you have a huge collection of data and want to organize it better I recommend getting a NAS (Network Attached Storage). A NAS lets you store all your data in one spot and access it over your home network anywhere in the house. You can also set it up with redundancy so if one drive fails, your data won't be lost. You should still keep backups, but this keeps the headaches farther away. <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Synology-bay-DiskStation-DS218-Diskless/dp/B075N1BYWX/ref=sxin_1_ac_d_pm?ac_md=4-0-VW5kZXIgJDUwMA%3D%3D-ac_d_pm&amp;cv_ct_cx=synology&amp;keywords=synology&amp;pd_rd_i=B075N1BYWX&amp;pd_rd_r=d3449a63-2489-4643-a25d-1efc3757d8ee&amp;pd_rd_w=NWjWz&amp;pd_rd_wg=wtMgB&amp;pf_rd_p=0e223c60-bcf8-4663-98f3-da892fbd4372&amp;pf_rd_r=DAGFKT0A3ZEPWXA9EQMZ&amp;psc=1&amp;qid=1581118343&amp;sr=1-1-22d05c05-1231-4126-b7c4-3e7a9c0027d0" target="_blank">Synology</a> makes many easy to use models for every skill level and there's a bunch more manufacturers too. You can also build your own with your own computer parts using software like <a href="https://www.freenas.org/" target="_blank">FreeNAS</a>, <a href="https://www.openmediavault.org/" target="_blank">OpenMediaVault</a>, <a href="https://unraid.net/" target="_blank">UnRaid</a>, etc. </p>
<p><strong>What to store data on?</strong></p>
<p>Hard drives are a happy medium. They're cheap, usually reliable if you treat them nicely, and you can leave them safely for 5-10 years (but you should definitely spin them up on occasion). If you're on a budget then buy external drives, even if you want naked drives, for odd reasons manufacturers price them significantly cheaper. </p>
<p>If you're into ultimate longevity then use Blu-Ray discs. They're moderately more expensive $\TB and far more time consuming but most brand name discs will last decades no problem. They make them <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Verbatim-100GB-White-Inkjet-Printable/dp/B00POY826G/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=100gb+blu+ray&amp;qid=1581118072&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">up to 100gb</a> now (more if you're in Japan but I digress). </p>
<p>There's also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_Tape-Open" target="_blank">LTO tape storage</a> that's good for 30 years but we're in ELI5 and that's usually pretty $$$ lol.</p>

Afaik this isn’t actually what is occurring whatsoever (it seems that electrons are trapped in various configurations when electricity isn’t being supplied, based on other comments), so I actually find it more confusing because it implies there is actually a physical button being pressed inside the card (is there??)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While it's a close enough analogy, it's not really explaining what's actually happening. It's probably a better analogy for other memory technologies, but not really flash.</p>
<p>Flash memory cells aren't switches. They're more like little containers that can store a bit of energy. How much energy is put inside each one represents the data it contains. So you're pretty much on point with how it works.</p>
<p>A more realistic analogy would be a banks and banks of capacitors that keep getting charged up and discharged as the data is changed.</p>
<p>In particular, modern Flash memory *definitely* isn't like on/off switches because the cells have way more than two possible states. Originally we used to store a single representation of a &quot;0&quot; or a &quot;1&quot; in each cell (one bit of data per cell) based on whether the cell was charged or discharged, but these days, a cell may contain as many as four bits of data each, all represented by varying levels of charge, and higher levels are in development. 4-bit per cell QLC memory has 16 different charge levels for each cell to represent that data. That's less like a &quot;switch&quot; and more like a rotary dial with 16 different settings, if you really wanted to strain the switch analogy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Computers work using binary, 1 or 0, on or off. Flash memory is just millions of microscopic 'switches'. The position of the electrons determines if the switch is on or off. There's no moving parts as such, it's just electron positions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But just to be clear, on an SD card, the data isn't stored as a &quot;physical&quot; change like something in the card being up or down like those soda 'buttons'.</p>
<p>With no disrespect intended, this analogy explains how the bits and bytes are stored in binary (0/1) increments, doesn't explain the mechanism of how a flash drive records whether the &quot;button&quot; is up or down, particularly without power.</p>
<p>The very simple answer is that the media in an SD card is designed to hold an electric charge without an electrical connection. To use <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/f0d1fq/eli5_how_are_micro_sd_cards_able_to_store_entire/fgt1lkb/" target="_blank">/u/shokalion's analogy</a>, the medium on an SD card has layers that are designed to trap electrons and keep them in the &quot;tank&quot; even when the electric voltage is gone. The voltage (the water flow) is needed to get electrons to pass in or out of the &quot;tank&quot;, but the tank will retain what is in it when the voltage is gone.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Just wanna clarify here - nothing is a perfect insulator. The voltage in the tank will eventually drain over the span of about a decade. It's important to periodically power on solid state storage media to maintain the voltage, or else the voltage will drop to a point where bits will be interpreted as 0's, corrupting the data.</p></div>		</li>

A lot of the water will evaporate, but because of the rule, you know &quot;hey, even though this glass isn't full, it has water in it, so it was full, and I can top it off.&quot; And so you do periodically.

			<div class="markdown"><p>No.</p>
<p>You can corrupt floppy disks and HDDs with magnets, but not SD cards, because the former don't use electrons to store the data, they use magnetism. The disks are coated with a magnetic material (to simplify, tiny bits of iron). Data is stored by polarizing (aligning) the magnetic material for each bit.</p>
<p>Think of a bunch of tiny iron rods - where there is a one, a big magnet hits the spot and all the stick rotate to point at the magnet. Where there's a zero, the magnet makes them point a different direction (or randomizes them)</p>
<p>SD cards are different. They don't use magnets. They used electrical charge - so not little metal bits, but electrons.</p>
<p>Normal strength magnets won't harm an SD card.</p></div>		</li>
