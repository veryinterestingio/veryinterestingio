			<div class="markdown"><p>I assume you mean if you took your router from your house to a friend's house one town over and you both have the same ISP.</p>
<p>Technically yes, the ISP &quot;knows&quot; your router and will see it on a different part of their network. As far as I'm aware this is done by logging the MAC address of the router which acts as a device identifier. MAC addresses can be spoofed so it could be possible to change the MAC to avoid your ISP from recognising it as the same device.</p>
<p>Does that answer your question?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I was doing was traveling from place to place across several districts in my campervan. I'd been told using a VPN would mean the ISP couldn't tell I was shifting around but they could and insisted I go to mobile data. I wasn't sure whether I'd done the VPN wrong or it doesn't actually do what I was told it would do.</p></div>		</li>
