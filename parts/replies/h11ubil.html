			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine two types of fish: one aggressively attacks other members of its species and the other warns them before attacking so that most fights are avoided by the smaller fish backing down.</p>
<p>Which species will likely perform better according to evolution?</p>
<p>In general, most animals do not fight their own species to the death but instead taunt/intimidate/threaten/etc. It has many benefits such as reducing injury/death to both animals which is better for the species overall.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The aggressor wants them to have time to react.  This is because usually they won't make an aggressive display at an opponent they don't think they can beat.  What they want is for the other animal to notice and react...by running away.  </p>
<p>This is actually usually what happens and it results in fewer actual fights, which is good because fights are dangerous.</p></div>		</li>
