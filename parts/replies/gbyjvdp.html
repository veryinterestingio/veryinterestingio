			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't. Let's say you put two wires on a light bulb and then put a battery between the wires. The bulb is gonna light up, not because it &quot;knows&quot; to do so but that's just what happens when there's electricity flowing through the wires and the bulb.</p>
<p>I'm simplifying here, but it's similar to the chromatophores (or any similar cellular response). Maybe your own eye is a better example. When it's really bright, the iris contracts. You don't (and can't) control that. The iris' muscles don't know they need to contract. When a lot of light hits your eye, it sends an electrical signal to your brain, like a battery, and your brain sends a signal to the muscles.<br />
Electricity goes from battery to bulb, bulb lights up.<br />
Electricity goes from eyes to iris (via brain), muscles contract.</p>
<p>Of course, that &quot;wire&quot; from the eye to the iris had to be &quot;built&quot; at some point. That's where natural selection comes in. Before that, animals couldn't change the brightness inside their eyes. Then, randomly, one developed the &quot;wire&quot; and the iris (this is a massive simplification). When it stared at the sun, it could actually see the predator stalking it. The other animals could not and got eaten. The animal who survived had children and passed down its &quot;wire-genes&quot; to them. </p>
<p>Same idea with a cuttlefish, for example. The cells &quot;know&quot; to change color because they receive <em>some</em> signal from the brain. They react to that signal in the right way because all cuttlefish whose cells <em>didn't</em> react correctly got eaten.</p></div>		</li>
