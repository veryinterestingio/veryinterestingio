			<div class="markdown"><p>Best answer. Although I'd add that your point is still valid even if the shop remembered every component.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every single component experiences the sudden deceleration equally. Doesn't matter whether it's inches away from the impact zone, or 15 feet away. So every moving part is subjected to shock forces that they simply are not designed to withstand. </p>
<p>How to you inspect inside of every assembly to ensure that nothing was warped? Take your side windows example; there's a lot of moving parts in there, and any one of them being a millimeter or so out of true can mean early failure. Power mirrors, seats, sunroofs, windshield wipers, AC, etc. The repairs will only consist of replacing what is flat out not functioning. That window mechanism, that's working now but is slightly warped, will only be detected when it stops functioning.</p>
<p>And yeah, all those fasteners only get replaced when they literally break off during repair. And from what I can see, they are literally designed to only be used once, during the car's manufacturing. I so hate those little one-use bastards; take your door panel off to fix something, it's <em>never</em> the same again.</p></div>		</li>
