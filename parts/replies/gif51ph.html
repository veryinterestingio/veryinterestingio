<p>you can block all roads leading to one specific city (&quot;Facebook-town&quot;, &quot;Google-city&quot;, whatever), but simply blocking one or two will generally only make that destination a bit harder to reach but not remove it from the map.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And on top of that, you'd have to keep in mind that facebook-town and google-city have multiple mirrors stationed around the world. If google-city was burned to the ground, within a few hours the buses would be rerouted and you may not even notice anything different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For some reason, that analogy is way, way darker than the reality.</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;Where are we?&quot; The bus passenger asks, clutching the small HTML request on his lap.</p>
<p>&quot;Google-city! As beautiful as ever!&quot; The driver replies.</p>
<p>&quot;But, I was just in Google-city, and we passed through 103.104.1.0.3.1098-ville to get there. Now the 'villes don't even start with 103, they start with 582.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Google-city! As beautiful as ever!&quot; The driver says again.</p>
<p>Now the passenger is openly concerned, for they are in Google-city. And yet it is different. There are different road signs, some of the face-filenames are wearing different metadata on the sidewalks.</p>
<p>&quot;There!&quot; The passenger cries, pointing through the window of the bus, &quot;The YouTube gallery! Last time I was here I submitted some work, but it's not there!&quot; In the 'profile' window of the gallery's front, it was as if he had never brought that file. In fact, none of the files his employer had submitted for three days were anywhere in the timeline. There is a gap.</p>
<p>&quot;Google-city! As beautiful as ever!&quot; The driver says again.</p>
<p>&quot;Where are we?!&quot;</p>
<p>The bus stops in front of the massive HTML building. The passenger stands to disembark, but as he is on the step, he turns to see the bus driver staring at him. Dead, primary color eyes staring out from under his pristine white cap. Reflected there, in pupils with no soul of their own, were the souls of a billion, trillion other innocent packets that had ridden this bus to an identical, yet more familiar Google-city just three days ago. The Google-city this passanger had known. The one that, unknown to this packet, for he had not been to Wikipedia-opolis or Twitter-tree in three days, had been burned when the humans nuked the city of Nashville. Those eyes did not move as he spoke.</p>
<p>&quot;Google-city! As beautiful as ever!&quot; The driver says.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They'd lose access to other countries, at least temporarily, but not the internet in general. There's also a lot of cables in and out of countries. Part of why the internet is so stable and why it would be so difficult to 'turn off' is because there's so much redundancy. </p>
<p>And, even with all the cables cut, there's still satellite connections.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The vast majority of whole-internet or major service outages really <strong>do</strong> affect all three, because they're largely issues with either CloudFlare (or other CDNs) or AWS.

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would though be sufficient to shut down all 13 DNS Servers. Those computers translate addresses like www.Reddit.com to IP Adress packages. These will then be further forwarded to the corresponding computers.
You can reach Reddit via it‘s IP number, but it‘s not as comfortable as typing in the name of the page. So few people have them by hand.
If those servers would shut down, you would still be able to visit pages you already have been on, because your PC saves the numbers correlating to the websites www address, so that not every time you visit a website those servers have to be asked.
But you could not visit all of the internet pages and your computer‘s saved translations expire at some point. So it would appear to the user that the internet is completely down if everything expired and the DNS servers are still down.
You can think of it as learning vocabulary:
You of course can look the corresponding word up every time in a dictionary. To save time your brain will remember words and their meaning so you can talk fluently. At some point you might forget words and have to look them back up again.
But all of this is very very unlikely to happen.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>But it's important to note that this wouldn't take the internet down or remove all it's archives. It would simply make it more difficult to access. At least temporarily. It wouldn't take long, since the internet would still exist, for new DNS sites to be set up and browsers to push patches.</p>
<p>I'd WAG with not enough knowledge on the subject, that getting email servers back up and running properly would take longer. Good thing some of us still have our trusty fax machines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well E-Mails are sent through are an Protocol (among others) called SMTP which also bases on IP addresses being translated.
@gmail is translated to the corresponding IP address of Google. </p>
<p>But you are absolutely right, the Internet would still work! You can send emails directly to the IP address as well. </p>
<p>I think those DNS servers a rather complex because of the immense amount of traffic. Surely they would be up and running again within a day, I would imagine they have some smart folks working for them. Most of us would not even feel a big impact. They are Btw not controlled by any company but by the non profit ICANN (Internet cooperation for assigned names and numbers).</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are only 13 root server IPv4 <em>addresses</em>, but traffic to any of those addresses will be routed to the closest* one out of several, and sometimes hundreds, of individual servers that has that address. (Anycast)</p>
