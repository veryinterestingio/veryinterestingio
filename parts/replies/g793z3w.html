			<div class="markdown"><p>I read somewhere that our hesitation, for lack of a better term, to expose children to foods that people are commonly allergic to (like peanuts) are actually the reason allergies to peanuts are on the rise in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, because the gene pool is a spectrum. For example, if you'd only have A people and B people, and B are more likely to die, then yes, B can permanently disappear.</p>
<p>But if you have people of all size, and people too small <em>and</em> too big are more likely to die, and size is driven by dozens of genes, then you'll continuously make new children too small or too big from &quot;normal&quot; sized parents. Basically, reproduction increases the variance in Human populations, and natural selection reduces it. For stable traits, these two effects counteract each other, but both still happen.</p>
<p>This applies to allergies as well. The immune system is very complex, and having a immune system that <em>underreacts</em> would just as well have been pretty bad in prehistoric times. As a result you can still today have children with immune system less or more reactive than each of their parents individually. </p>
<p>That said, allergies are linked to a lack of exposure with germs and pathogens, so they happened much, much less before modern hygiene and cleaning standards, let alone prehistoric times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something else to keep in mind is that before the last 200-300 years, not everyone was exposed to the same kinds of food like they are now.  Before shipping and agricultural technology improved to the point where soy beans, corn and peanuts from the USA could be eaten by literally every person in the world, people in different parts of the world could have very widely different diets that didn't include any of the same species or even types of species.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider is that the same immune cells responsible for allergies are also the ones that respond to parasitic infections like pinworms or hookworms.  It is theorized that the modern problem with food allergies could be related to a lack of exposure to parasites due to the modern emphasis on cleanliness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, I'm allergic to nitrogen bubbles (well, to proteins that form on nitrogen bubbles).  I got decompression sickness (a scuba diving injury) and the dive doctor explained that the way in manifested in me was a kind of allergic reaction.  That also accounts for me being prohibited from diving in the future -- if I get bent again, the reaction will be worse (since the body has built up antibodies) and it would most likely kill me.</p></div>		</li>
