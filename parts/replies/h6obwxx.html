			<div class="markdown"><p>And not only that. It will be easier to optimize a few key points (aka power plants), than optimizing everyone's cars or wait for them to be switches out for a newer model. </p>
<p>This, in turn, also takes all the pollution away from the streets and concentrates it in the few areas where there are power plants. This means fewer people will die of pollution</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>China would like a word. In Manchuria which gets pretty cold they have &quot;centralised&quot; coal burning hot water plants. Hot water isn't easy to transport so the plants are where the people are. I guess they could be converted to natural gas without too much capital expenditure, but China loves coal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the U.S. it is about 6%, though it depends on where your power is coming from, and how dense your town/city is.  Since high-voltage long distance transmission lines are more efficient than low-voltage local distribution lines, higher last-mile population densities cut down on losses.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The main issue is that combustion loses efficiency when running in the wrong operation point. A powerplant will always run at it's optimum RPM</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus, powerplants, being stationary, can recover power from the exhaust, which is still hot enough to convert to more electricity. Combined cycle plants can be ~50% more efficient than a simple cycle (like a car engine). Cars don't do it because it's inconvenient to lug around a bunch of heat exchangers to eek out every last bit of efficiency while adding weight. Not a problem for a power plant. Some boats use combined cycles too. Probably big ones.</p></div>		</li>
