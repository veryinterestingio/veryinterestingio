			<div class="markdown"><p>It's 1 thing if he's a voice actor and its a new game. It's another thing if one day you're playing a competitive game and suddenly you hear your Dad call you a bitch for beating him.</p>
<p>1st Scenario. Multiplayer FPS where your Dad is a salt bag every time he's killed. Calls you a bitch for using the auto sniper and hitting him. He threatens to disown you and divorce your mother when you hit him behind concealment when his gun was sticking out.</p>
<p>2nd Scenario. Playing Mario Kart one day alone, and you make it up front with a red shell. You throw it at the cart in first and overtake them, but instead of the standard sounds a character makes, you hear the voice of your dad insulting you and calling you a bitch for taking first before hitting the finish line. If you weren't about to finish the race the shock would've distracted you from winning and even then you're still not sure what happened.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Under current union rules, this is not allowed (anymore). It is also dicey from a legal perspective. A voice actor needs to sign over the rights to the recordings on a document that lists the title of the game. There are some contractual reasons for this, depending on the country and the extent of the rights that are being transferred, but in general, the company cannot simply take recordings for game A and plug them into game B as well without compensating the voice actor for it. Thus the need for listing the title.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another reason it's  dicey is because in some cases, a voice actor can be paid at a much lower rate than if they knew what they were voicing. i.e. If they agree to be paid for x lines or hours at a standard rate, and walk away when in reality they voiced the main character in a game that's a sequel to a successful game.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That might have been because he’s Tom Holland. Elizabeth Olsen has said they were allowed to read the script, but it was essentially under lock and key and in complete isolation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Their employers keep them in the dark and tell them only what they need to do their jobs. Like how Tom Holland was never allowed to see Avengers scripts. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>not only can they not see scripts till the day of, they filmed a lot of &quot;false scenes&quot; that were intentionally done so that some of the actors couldnt figure out what was going on in the movie.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tom Holland is a notorious blabbermouth, so I wouldn't be surprised if they had people on staff specificly tasked with making sure that Tom Holland only learned what they wanted him to know and/or what was absolutely necessary for his scenes.</p></div>		</li>
