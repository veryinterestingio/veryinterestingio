<p>Machinery and automation (sprinklers, harvesting machines, pesticide distribution.etc) have allowed it to scale up and remain profitable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another way to say that would be, &quot;huge corporations have leveraged economies of scale to drive family farms out of business and destroy the bee populations by eliminating easements.&quot;</p>
<p>I'm all about capitalism and efficiency, but sometimes chasing short-term efficiency risks long-term effectiveness, and rock bottom prices are not in our community's best interest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good luck feeding 11 billion people using just mom and pop farms (11 billion is estimated natural human population cap).  The future is some form of large agri sector. Hopefully run much better than it is now but if everyone only ate farmer's market veg, or if everyone only hunted for meat, or if everyone only ate organic grass fed beef, simple fact is we'd collectively starve.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s not “another way to say that.” You’re making an entirely different point.</p>
<p>Corporate farmers are not the only ones who use technology and expensive equipment.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for the reason for the takeover of corporate farming, look no further than the government subsidies disingenuous politicians say are to help small farmers but really make them uncompetitive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is inaccurate. Almost all corporate farms ARE family farms. They’re just families that have incorporated. The median net worth for a farming family in the United States is around a million dollars. The small family farms that people lament the death of were tenant farmers wiped out when their landlords replaced them with mechanization and exploited laborers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes sense thank you! How many units per month are we talking? I searched up how much units retailers get and I can’t find anything. I imagine the units have to be huge to make it profitable</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Remain profitable yes, but farmers barely even break even. Modern machinery is yet another expense to be able to keep up with demand that requires even more investment. Most farmers with huge land and machinery still earn less than min wage. Farming is a 24/7 job and you can have your entire product ruined by random weather patterns overnight. It is amongst the worst jobs in the world to ever have, yet it is probably the single most important for us.</p></div>		</li>
