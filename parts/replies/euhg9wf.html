			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to get these often as a youth, and now extremely rarely. I think I have only had one like twice in the past 10 years. It's so scary though. All of a sudden you're breathing in like normal and it just feels like someone stabbed you in the chest. Then you take tiny little inhales but each tiny inhale is another little stab. You just have to take a deep breath quickly like ripping off a bandaid, and it would go away for me. Really sucks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Holy crap!!! I had this as a teen and never found out what it was until now. Always thought maybe my heart was weak or something due to me being really skinny. Don't get these anymore after 20. Also I always waited it out by taking short breaths, could never be brave enough to do a deep inhale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same, it hasn't happened to me in 10 or more years. I have 2 kids that get them sharp pains as well tho. Even after we took each to the doctor (they're100% healthy btw) it's still hard to convince them that they are going to be ok.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember this happening all the time! it would end after a few seconds. Until one time it kept going. Super scary. We got in the car and rushed to the hospital. when the doctor checked me the only thing i remember him saying was &quot;oh, its not that big of a deal, Michael Jackson had the same issue&quot;. I dont know if he intended that to ease our mind, but it definitely did not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It sucks, but that popping feeling when you breathe deep and the relief of the pain going away is satisfying enough to almost be worth it. Almost.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had this very often as a teen also. So bad I had to get it checked.  The doctor told me it was a form of anxiety &quot;attack &quot; where I felt this pain every time I was stressed or sad. So he told me to just do some calming breathing exercises and to try to think of happy things haha. It worked pretty well</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the link, this is down to the letter exactly what i have sometimes, very informative.<br />
For me, i have it practically only after slouching in a chair or sitting in bed against the wall for some time.<br />
Kinda relieved now cause as mentioned in your link i was worried about my heart at first, even though the pain is not really near the heart.</p></div>		</li>
