			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to consider 2 things. The most frequent liver transplant is using the whole liver from a donor. The liver is usually from a young donor(usually 60yrs or less) so, the amount of damage that liver has is variable. But lets say, the original donated liver is almost in perfect condition. As I stated , im almost certain a donated liver in its new host suffers more damage than a normal liver in any of us, under the same circumstances. The new recipient is also under drugs to control the immune system. Partial liver transplant has risks, first you usually take between 30 to 50% of the liver to transplant to someone else, so that is in itself risk to the donor and recipient. You would have to ensure proper liver function in 2 people, with an already somewhat damaged liver. In my opinion that is too much rist. In theory its plausible but risky. You have another good example of this, when the donating liver is too big, it can be separated into 2, and this is done in some liver transplant for kids , so 2 kids get a liver transplant from 1 donated liver. This works because the amount of liver mass in relation to the kids body weight is enough , but its not the usual case for an adult.  The rule of thumb in hepatic surgery is, you can live with 25 to 30% of your normal liver, but you need more than 40% if its damaged.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good answer, thanks!</p>
<p>If a child were to get half a liver, how would that liver look ~10-20 years later? Would it have grown similar to a normal liver? Does it regenerate the lobular structure with the hepatic veins and ligamentum falciforme?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does organ donorship work? Are organs property? If I donate my liver to you then you have full ownership of it, I assume that's the case right? So if I donate an organ to you, you don't owe me my consent for you to donate the organ again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it depends on organs and in the laws of each country, but in general, you make a selfless donation, and it goes into a pool or list , so its not like you can choose to whom it goes, unless its a living donor. there are lots of laws in place</p></div>		</li>
