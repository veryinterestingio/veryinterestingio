			<div class="markdown"><p>Supply lines are <em>major</em> concepts in warfare. Modern as well, but even more so in older times.</p>
<p>As a soldier, you need a more or less constant supply of provisions. Food, water, weapons (because yours will eventually break), tools and everything.</p>
<p>For practical purposes, your supply lines can't be constantly escorted by troops. They might have some token troops to discourage bandits, but they can't be serious troops to counteract enemy armies, because you need those troops with you on the actual battlefield.</p>
<p>Now imagine that you command an army and you ignore a fort. You are well outside of arrow or cannon range so no immediate danger there. But the fort sends out patrols, and those patrols raid your supply lines, preventing you from getting food to your men. You can scavenge the direct environment, but that will very quickly be depleted in almost every case.</p>
<p>So you have to retreat, because a starved army is a worthless army. In this way, the fortress is essentially preventing you from progressing.</p>
<p>Additionally, enemy troops could raid you during the night and retreat quickly to the safety of the fort. Having well- and safely rested troops from the fort compared to constantly anxious and ill-rested troops in the field becomes an incredibly important factor the longer the situation continues.</p>
<p>This is only in the situation of a 'general' fort not immediately protecting a landmark. When you add that in the mix, the situations can become a lot more difficult. A surprisingly large part of warfare is logistics, and if a fortress physically guards things like bridges or mountain passes, they can effectively block of entire regions because the alternative (like moving an army through a largely unknown mountain region) can be considered impossible. Or blocking of a harbour if the enemy is reinforcing through the sea (which they almost always will prefer over land reinforcements if they have the means to do so).</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I read a book a few years back, How Navies Fight, and you could basically sum up everything a Navy does as either acting as a supply line, protecting a supply line, or disrupting an enemy's supply line.</p>
<p>Even your big battleships are more about moving things like planes and troops to locations to do the actual fighting.</p>
<p>It was a fascinating way of looking at it that I never really thought about before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the true genius of the Roman army, having an entire Corp of your legion devoted entirely to logistics seems illogical, but intact probably led to their massive success, having the ability to make a fort in a day, fully defendable and keeping your soldiers safe in the fort, allows for easy and safe movement in a war, it also allowed for the strategic flexibility. Enemy guarding a bridge, what do you do? Well you are romans build another fucking bridge. Forest hindering a retreat? Cut down the fucking forest. Their legions traveled with the supply lines, and rarely did the Roman legions go far enough beyond an front to leave the supply lines vulnerable, and if they were, send another legion!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm no expert and only heard this on the Hardcore History podcast, but the strategic use of forts essentially came to an end during World War I and the introduction of heavy artillery. The new guns were so destructive that putting your troops in a fort was just keeping all your eggs in one basket for the enemy to destroy. </p>
<p>World War I is an incredible example of technology changing how war was waged. At the beginning of the war Belgium used its forts to devastating effect against Germany. The biggest army ever assembled marching straight into fully automatic guns from a fort. The losses in the battles during World War I are literally mind boggling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's fascinating to see the shift of offense vs defense advantage over the centuries. Some of the defense-advantaged periods are pretty neat, like the fully armored late medieval knights (pre-gunpowder) or the layered WW1 trenches that were pretty much impenetrable. Then at the opposite extreme you have ICBMs or Mongolian horse-archers or whatever that have so much offensive capability nothing can stand up to them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, wasn't the Allies' reliance on forts their downfall at the beginning of WW2? They doubled down on the concept of defence and assumed wars would play out the same as in ww1 where dug in troops had the overwhelming advantage. Whereas the germans said &quot;screw that, we ain't playing that game any longer&quot; and developed maneuver warfare utilizing tanks, mechanized infantry and airpower to punch holes in whatever defensive line that they came upon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you'd be very interested in the fate of the French Fort Douaumont during WWII. Basically, the Germans long range shelled it and bypassed it using fast moving tanks/trucks/horses. They then went back and destroyed the fort (and units in it) after having surrounded them and cut them off from escape or reinforcement.</p>
<p>The fate of the last stand of the French in that fort (and Germans who stormed it) is quite gruesome. The French built makeshift internal walls with gun ports and grenade holes to fight the Germans but it was a losing cause. The French ran out of water and so desperate were the men that they licked condensation off the walls.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the modern military concept of fast moving, overwhelming force at applied points makes forts somewhat useless as forces can simply bypass forts... add parachute troops and bombers with anti-bunker tech and forts kind of don't work anymore. But Douaumont is a good example of the clash of old thinking and new (to their credit, the French knew they should abandon the fort... to the point that they set explosive charges to destroy the fort and abandon it, but instead decided to stay. Unfortunately, they forgot to remove the charges from the main battery, so when the battery was hit, the resulting sympathetic explosion blew the gun right off the mount.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is key. I'm no military historian, but I've always thought of forts as a &quot;base of operations&quot;, not an impassable obstacle. The populace can retreat behind defensive walls if attacked, but the main value is the ability to have local patrols and oversight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll add that you have to remember that there weren't satellite photos, GPS, nor radios. Trying to go around a group of well-trained soldiers who might be anywhere, hiding in (what is to them) very familiar terrain when you're trying to navigate with very limited information suddenly makes it seem that much more difficult.</p></div>		</li>
