			<div class="markdown"><p>That's such a good way of describing it! I made the dumb mistake of taking more for my first time because it &quot;wasn't working&quot; and soon after when I closed my eyes that's exactly what I saw, I thought it would never end. I wasn't sure if that was a normal experience or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like you had a good experience. I wouldn't ever advise anyone to take anything more than a normal dose on their first trip. I would love to understand where all of those images comes from and why people tend to see the same shapes and colors. It's not like your brain is continuing to do what it always does and is reproducing images that you regularly see.  In fact, I'm amazed by them because it doesn't seem like it's coming from my own mind if that makes sense.</p></div>		</li>
