			<div class="markdown"><p>You can do polyphasiac sleep patterns so that you are spending less time in light sleep and more time in REM sleep. When I had bad insomnia when I was a kid I got into polyphasiac sleep so I was getting 3 or 4 hours of core sleep a night with a few 10 to 15 min naps throughout the day. I seemed to feel like I had gotten plenty of sleep but the downside was I would almost instantly go into REM sleep during my naps and I suffer from night terrors so I would be napping at my desk in school and wake up freaking out on everyone.</p></div>		</li>
