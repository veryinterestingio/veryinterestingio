			<div class="markdown"><p>Why must it actually be considered entangled, rather than just being matching states?</p>
<p>Like, let's say I get a coin, split it in half lengthwise, and randomly select which half goes either direction.  The coin-half isn't entangled, yet it is unmeasured.  Since it is unmeasured.  It's the same as saying &quot;i have a coin half, but don't know which half.'</p>
<p>As soon as I <em>do</em> measure it, I know the state of the other one <em>at the time the split occurred</em>.  That is all.</p>
<p>Even if the coins are going the speed of light away from each other, I am not receiving information faster than the speed of light.  I am only learning about the state they were in when they parted - and I got that information at the speed of light.  It is not weird <em>at all</em>.  </p>
<p>So why use a different name?  Is it simply because it's dealing with different components?  I.e., conservation of an informational state rather than momentum?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The classical coin halves have a fixed but unknown (to the observer)  value.  The entangled quantum mechanical particles are in a mixed state, not at all determined until one of them is measured. It's not that you just happen not to know their state yet, it's that it hasn't actually been set yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has a different name because it has a different property- with entangled particles, it's not just that we don't know the state of particle 1 before it's measured, it's that particle 1 and 2 don't have defined states until they are measured. This might seem like splitting hairs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_theorem" target="_blank">but Bell's Theorem</a> is able to statistically show the difference between us just not knowing, and the states not being defined until measured, which leads to things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_cryptography" target="_blank">quantum encryption</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Couldn’t this still allow for information sharing by observing the pattern created by shooting particles through a double slit and creating a prior agreement on what the generated pattern means?</p>
<p>Say we have two people in different galaxies. The man wants to let the woman know in an hour if he won the lottery. They decide a year in advance that if he wins, he will measure his particle, collapsing the wave function; if he loses, he will not measure his particle, preserving the interference pattern. When she checks the pattern produced by her particle an hour after the pre determined time, it should be affected by the man’s measurement or lackthereof and produce different patterns as shown in the quantum eraser experiment. She would then  be able to know whether he won the lottery or not, since if he did the pattern would be discrete, and if he didn’t the pattern would be an interference pattern</p></div>		</li>
