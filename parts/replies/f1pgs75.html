			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question. </p>
<p>I used my Dad and step mum as my ideal audience. An audience of interested, intelligent laypeople with little background in maths. </p>
<p>I decided from the start that there would be no equations in the book. </p>
<p>And I think I got the level right. After reading the book, Ian McEwan (the author of Atonement) wrote   </p>
<p>&quot;Kit Yates shows how our private and social lives are suffused by mathematics. Ignorance may bring tragedy or farce. This is an exquisitely interesting book. It’s a deeply serious one too and, for those like me who have little maths, it’s delightfully readable. &quot; </p>
<p>At the very end of the introduction I write this, which I hope captures the essence of the book:</p>
<p>&quot;  As you’ll hopefully have worked out by now, this is not a maths book. Nor is it a book for mathematicians. You will not find a single equation in these pages. The point of the book is not to bring back memories of the school mathematics lessons you might have given up years ago. Quite the opposite. If you’ve ever been disenfranchised and made to feel that you can’t take part in mathematics or aren’t good at it, consider this book an emancipation.</p>
<p>I genuinely believe that maths is for everyone and that we can all appreciate the beautiful mathematics at the heart of the complicated phenomena we experience daily. As we will see in the following chapters, maths is the false alarms that play on our minds and the false confidence that helps us sleep at night; the stories pushed at us on social media and the memes that spread through it. Maths is the loopholes in the law and the needle that closes them; the technology that saves lives and the mistakes that put them at risk; the outbreak of a deadly disease and the best way to control it. It is the best hope we have of answering the most fundamental questions about the enigmas of the cosmos and the mysteries of our own species. It leads us on the myriad paths of our lives and lies in wait, just beyond the veil, to stare back at us as we draw our final breaths. &quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are interested in mathematics/physics, there are quite a few books that are written in a way that people without mathematical/physical background can understand it.</p>
<p>Often it helps if you just can draw a picture or a diagram instead of crazy formulas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>wasn't it difficult to assume the mathematical background of the average reader for your book?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the question you ask yourself each time you write any article or do a presentation - guesstimate who will be your audience.</p></div>		</li>
