			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought about this, but in your case it's at least real money. There is a difference between the two at the checkout and there is no difference between $9.999 and $10 at the checkout.</p>
<p>But what I really meant is why not make price $9.99 instead of $9.999. Or maybe they need this 1 cent so badly that it can't be sacrificed for maintaining psychological effect?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do that because people pay more attention to the dollars instead of the cents. At a glance, people see $9 VS $10.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well as he said it's painted on there in most cases, how do you propose I make that 9 a 0? I could maybe make it an 8 and change my store to &quot;Discounted Gas.&quot; Otherwise it's staying the same buddy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. Most of that makes sense, but you say they round, up or down, and somone else said they charge accurately.  Which is it? Fight!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They charge accurately, so if you buy 15.00 gallons at $2.449, they will charge 15 x $2.449 = $36.735, which is then rounded to $36.74.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note: one thousandth of a dollar is a real amount of US currency, called a mill. It's only used on the books in practice and not minted. It's mostly used when setting property tax rates. So, yes, prices of tenths of a cent are literal. I wonder if they could break your penny by writing a one mill check.</p></div>		</li>
