<p>You give a chinese person ice cold water in the middle of the summer and they will not be happy haha they want that room temp or warmed up water. Even in the middle of summer :)</p>
<p>I learned this while having a client from china visit me at work. The look on her face when i handed her a  cup of ice water when it  was 104f out. I was so confused. She explained she prefers hot water or room temp water all the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is more than Asia. As an American that has to work in Europe quite often, I get frustrated with the lack of ice offered in drinks in Europe. I grew up drinking iced tea, iced water, iced sodas - yet if you are lucky enough to get water while dining in Europe, it will not be iced and it will most likely not be cold. It has to be a cultural thing.</p>
<p>The lack of preference for iced drinks is understandable - however, one thing I noticed when visiting certain European countries (like Bulgaria) - is that water is rarely offered at restaurants along with your food. This is especially weird during lunch where you are not drinking adult beverages - I feel like I am the only person who needs to wash down their lunch with fluids. All of my Bulgarian co-workers are just like &quot;yeah, we will drink coffee back in the office&quot;. It is just weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How they’re not all majorly dehydrated is beyond me. Imagine going out, eating a whole meal, going back to the office, then getting coffee. I’d have drank an entire bottles worth of water for each of those steps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I moved to Asia about a decade ago (from the States).</p>
<p>I went to my first interview. Rode the train there. Sweltering hot and no ac. Not to mention I was wearing dress pants and a long sleeved button up shirt, and an undershirt. </p>
<p>Walked a couple blocks from the station to the place drenched with sweat, using tissues to soak it up. </p>
<p>Arrived, and the boss there asked if I wanted some water. Thank God, or so I thought. </p>
<p>She brought out a mug of steaming hot water, just boiled. Ugh. </p>
<p>Years later, I prefer room temp water now. Hot water when I'm sick or in winter.</p></div>		</li>
