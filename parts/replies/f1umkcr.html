			<div class="markdown"><p>I drink the sugar free (or reduced sugar) energy drinks on a regular basis. Usually it's one per day, maybe five days a week. Never more than two in a day. My family always comments that energy drinks are terrible for me, but they tend not to make me feel shaky and terrible like coffee does. (I have been dealing with hypersomnia for years and it persists even if I cut out all caffeine, stay hyper-vigilant about my schedule, limit blue light, etc.) My father asserts that energy drinks ruined his father's liver, but my grandpa was drinking a dozen a day and spent a couple decades as an alcoholic.  </p>
<p>I got distracted after typing that much and no longer remember where I was going with it. Sorry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry you're getting downvoted.  Seems the majority in comments of articles like these just hate the market or just are dying to judge strangers online.</p>
<p>I'm in the same boat yet I drink about 1 to 2 zero ultras a day and also one venti coffee Monday thru friday.  2 years in, I have good blood pressure, healthy weight and sleep well.</p>
<p>I think some people stumbled across articles that 'energy drink = bad, no exceptions' and then use that info to berate and parent others online.  This noted, the reply at the top was quite honest and informative, just didnt really specify that there are versions of monster and even red bull or rockstar that are FAR less harmful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You sound like me. I have suffered with hypersomnia since childhood, and I believe that in my case it's related to depression (I developed problems early in life). I think there might be other reasons, including neurological ones, like ME/CFS (chronic fatigue syndrome), but I live in a country where healthcare leaves much to be desired and I haven't been able to find much help with my issues in general. My suspicions of CFS make things worse because it is often seen as a myth. I am declining in health these days and worried. It seems like my brain is shrinking, too. My memory is even worse than it was, I seem to become dumber everyday, my judgement is awful, and focus is almost non-existent. I don't know what is caused by the after effects of my traumatic birth and what is not. </p>
<p>Caffeine also makes me feel bad. I heard that if you have CFS or other conditions related to somnolence you should avoid it. Well, actually, I feel worse when drinking coffee. Tea is better for me. I enjoyed soft drinks but I have barely been consuming them recently.</p>
<p>I'd like to know whether energy drinks help you and if there are other things you do to resolve hypersomnia. Nobody believes in me, they think I'm lazy. I actually hate sleeping because sleeping too much is a curse.</p>
<p>I've never drank energy drinks out of health concerns (and lack of money, they're expensive here), but I've considered the possibility.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, my medical history is kind of a shit-show. Big reason I started seeing specialists is because when I get stressed, I can't speak, can't walk, shake like a leaf, usually wind up collapsing. Because of that, combined with the fatigue, I had a few doctors suggest cataplexy. Even had a multiple sleep latency test done. Established Hypersomnia, but I did not hit REM sleep fast enough for it to be narcolepsy. Was working as a temp for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania at the time. </p>
<p>Dr. suggested I use my half-hour lunch break to catch a bus across town, take a nap at home, then take a bus back. Never met someone so out of touch with reality. Worse, she did not want to treat me because of my &quot;history of anxiety&quot;. Notably, that isn't something I have. She got that idea because I had said my coworker &quot;make me anxious&quot;, because I was trying to downplay how much I hated those assholes. </p>
<p>(I sat between the water cooler/microwave area and the dude that microwaved fish for lunch three times a week. He also ended literally every sentence with &quot;annat s'uff 'ere&quot;. That is, &quot;and that stuff there,&quot; but mangled by his combination accent/speech impediment. He spent all day on the phone. It was hell.)</p>
<p>Undiagnosed tooth infection under a filling made stuff worse. Got bad enough, I was having trouble getting around. Moved back to Alaska, got that sorted. Took a year to get back to just being tired and feeling like shit all the time. Saw a handful more specialists. Had an EEG that shows my cerabellum is being pushed on by my skull, which explains the headaches. I only know this because of my general physician; my neurologist just told me I had fibromialgia and, after I turned down painkillers twice, told me to do Tai Chi twice a day. As in, that was her whole treatment plan.</p>
<p>Eventually, I lost two jobs due to poor health, in less than two weeks' time. (First one fired me because I was shakey, second one I quit because nobody else was doing their fucking jobs and I cannot carry everyone. Especially when I was told I would be handling the Easy stuff.) I've been on disability my whole life because I'm autistic, but Social Security recently decided I was somehow not autistic enough to qualify anymore. I have not been able to secure any assistance with that, so clearly it was not necessary. Or something.</p>
<p>Anyway, with my medical coverage running out and my job prospects bleak, my general practitioner decided to just treat the symptoms. She got me a low dose of Modafinil. Still feel tired while I'm on it, but I no longer feel like I'm going to collapse all the time. A low-to-moderate amount of caffeine perks me up now, helps me think a bit clearer. Probably best not to go overboard when it comes to mixing CNS stimulants, but at least these two don't via the same methods.</p>
<p>I have wicked low vitamin D, so I have to take that every day. I try to regulate my sleep schedule. Wish I could be of more help.</p>
<p>Bonus Points: The only job I've gotten since being medicated was day labor. Worked harder than ever before. Boss was a dick. Eventually, he was yelling at me and I could not deal. Told him I was leaving, that I would not be treated like that. He blocked in my car so I could not leave, threatened to tear my throat out. I got in my car, yanked the door out of his hands. He smashed my windshield with a board and I had to smash my car out through a locked chain link gate to get away. Cops are giving him a slap on the wrist despite him having a history of this kind of shit. Worse, his arraignment's getting pushed back because the cops never bothered to serve him. They had a month.</p>
<p>Also, several family members hospitalized for unrelated shit. Dog's sick, in the &quot;fingers crossed it isn't cancer&quot;- way. Car no longer starts, for no discernable reason. It has been a very, very long year.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Coffee makes me jittery. Energy drinks, slightly less so. Five Hour Energy used to work better for me than energy drinks, but I took one of those without thinking the day after they started me in my new meds and had some weird time shit, so I avoiding them at present. If you don't get much sun, vitamin D is important. (I get a reasonable amount of sun and still have to take a lot. No idea why.) Exercise is supposed to help. I was walking again, but that had to stop because I'm concerned that dude might hit me with his truck.</p>
<p>Anyway, sorry for rambling. If I missed anything, let me know. Good luck, my dude. Being exhausted sucks.</p></div>		</li>
