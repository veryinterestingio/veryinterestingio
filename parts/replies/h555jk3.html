			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work in a refinery many years ago and part of my job was pouring gold bullion bars. Back in those days we were allowed to smoke inside the building so at the end of a pour, while we were waiting for the bar to cool we would often take out a cigarette and light it on the still-glowing ingot. I used to joke that it was the most expensive cigarette lighter in the world.</p></div>		</li>

I say no just to keep my kilns from getting destroyed with grease but I remind them that our clay and glaze formulae include: cobalt, manganese, zinc, copper, titanium, lead, and whatever else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Swedish mining company Boliden used to have a special gold ingot in the visitorâ€™s center that you could try to lit using one hand only. If you succeeded, you could keep it.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the sides where polished with no irregularities or edges to grip around. It looked feasible but was actually impossible given the weight of the ingot and the limited friction coefficient between gold and skin. I donâ€™t know how big it was but as the density of gold is ca 19 kg/L it had probably been quite a challenge to lift one handed even with better conditions.</p>
<p>The challenge stood its test but was removed many years ago, most likely due to the safety required.</p>
<p>A similar challenge is still available <a href="https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2019/04/02/video-of-japanese-museum-attraction-turns-into-fake-viral-story-of-boy-winning-20kg-gold-bar-at-dubai-international-airport/" target="_blank">in Japan</a> if youâ€™re interested (but donâ€™t bother going to Dubai airport).</p></div>		</li>

<p>According to an article Nipponia, visitors who succeed in retrieving the 12.5 kg gold bar will have to give it back to the museum, but they will be given a prize for their efforts.</p>

<p>Sad. Still, a challenge that it's possible to win (600 <del>people.om</del> people in seven years, so about 2 a week) is probably more interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention, trying to pick up a cube from another cube would be quite difficult with no easy way to grip it. Hence the shape they have, much like you see with gold ingots if they were the same same weight in cube form it would be nearly impossible to pick it up, the lip allows for hands or tools to grab it easier. Which is another reason. Most times at least in blacksmith with ingots you already have your furnace blasting at a very high heat, don't want to stick your hand in that to drop a cube into a Crucible gotta use them tongs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was my first thought too. How do you unsure an underside for gripping on a shape east to cast and stack? Not too complicated, but the ingot shape is ideal.</p></div>		</li>
