			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans were about 10cm shorter 100 years ago. Ive visited some really old houses in the countryside and i had to duck so i would not hit my head on the door frame. Average English male was 165cm long. Those houses felt a bit like playhouses as everything seems a bit small.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, a good friend of mine is 6ft 4in. He grew up in a traditional English farmhouse, which would be at least 200yrs old. He spent a lot of time crouching, they were made for people who were more like 5ft 5in. I remember being amazed that he grew up there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My family looked at a 16th century cottage in England back in the 90's. I was short for an 8 year old and even I had to duck through the bedroom doorways upstairs. We did not end up living there</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is heavy economic literature regarding this. Escaping the malthusian trap and the industrial revolution, but poor hygiene and clumped polluted city living with substances that were dangerous but not known to be dangerous was not good for growth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My house in Oregon was built in 1900 but the rooms are modern sized. The weather is much milder here, and large timber was easy to get. All of the siding and flooring is full board length run of the long side wall, which is 24 feet in many cases. There was a sawmill in town so they didn't have to cut it to shipping length.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I figured it was because of the beds too. I live in an older brick home that has a very open floor plan for the time. Bedrooms are still small. Noone knew what a king size was back then.</p></div>		</li>
