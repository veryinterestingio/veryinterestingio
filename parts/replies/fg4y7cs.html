			<div class="markdown"><p>The virus has a larger 'shedding' period in an infected individual, relative to your basic common cold viruses. That means that a person infected is able to infect other people over a longer period of time. There is currently belief that someone infected with the present coronavirus is shedding the virus even before s/he starts having symptoms. As you can imagine, that makes the virus a lot more 'contagious' because someone may not know they are at risk of infecting someone else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shedding is how the virus leaves its host, in order to infect a new host. This is specific to each virus, as each virus has a different 'method of spreading'. Rhinovirus, aka the common cold, has to be aerosolized, meaning that it is released in water particles when the host coughs (and possibly during sneezing, I don't quite remember).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do we have an estimate of how long this period of asymptomatic, contagious period can be? Would that person be as much contagious as a symptomatic person during that time?</p>
<p>It sounds like it's very worrying, because at airports, only thermal imaging was being used.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By definition, an asymptomatic person is not coughing or sneezing, so they're not spraying the disease everywhere. It would be in their sputum and mucus, and stools, so it would come down to how clean they were as an individual.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have read conflicting information on whether or not a person is contagious before having symptoms.    Who makes the final determination on this?</p>
<p>I live in Sweden and we have now our first case.    The official government health organization's stance is that the the virus is NOT contagious before person has symptoms.    So the person who flew from China to Sweden could not have infected people on the plane or other people they came in contact before showing symptoms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The BC CDC sent out a series of tweets that answer the questions many would have. A lot of people commenting here are saying things that are completely inaccurate, including that it's airborne. It's not.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Coronavirus is transmitted via larger droplets that fall quickly out of the air (for example, after a sneeze). This virus is not airborne.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is weasel-word shit and it drives me absolutely nuts. It's a strict technical definition versus a layperson's understanding, and clinging to technical jargon when talking to the public is tantamount to deliberate misdirection. </p>
<p>&quot;If someone sneezes and I walk through the air they just sneezed in, can I get sick?&quot; is the question we really mean when we ask &quot;Is it airborne?&quot;, and the answer to that is a resounding YES. Lots of things (HIV comes to mind, since we were all inundated with information about it in the 90s) can't be transmitted that way, but 2019-nCoV absolutely can. </p>
<p>Saying the virus isn't airborne and then invoking some fine-print definition of the word which is <em>completely at odds</em> with the audience's understanding of the word, is the kind of scumbag behavior I'd expect to see in a courtroom, not a PSA from an agency spokesperson whose literal job is communicating with the public.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are using official medical language, which differentiates between airborne and droplet transmission. airborne refers to diseases that can remain suspended in air for long periods of time while droplets only hang around for brief periods. Airborne diseases also tend to pass through ventilation systems easily while droplets, if they don't just fall, have a very hard time getting through filters. I agree they could have explained this better though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 'scale' is actually the Ro (naught) number. It estimates the number of additional people an infected person will infect. It's an epidemiology tool. The flu has an Ro of about 1.5 I believe so this is a bit higher, but for reference Measles has an Ro in the teens (I think it's around 15-18). </p>
<p>Also keep in mind this is purely a predictive tool. It doesn't mean every person with coronavirus will infect three more, and here are many epidemiological scenarios that can play out with the same Ro.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a measure of how many people one infected person will infect themselves, on average.  Below one indicates that the infection will stop by itself, because it isn't contagious enough to keep going.  Above one, and it will slowly increase.</p>
<p>An R0 of 2 indicates an average of two people infected per already infected person.</p></div>		</li>
