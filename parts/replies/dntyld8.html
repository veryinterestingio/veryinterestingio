			<div class="markdown"><p>Dude canning in the craft beer world is fucking huge. The reason you don't see it too often is that big box stores don't think that they'd sell as well as bottles (which is untrue), so they don't really order them. I work at a locally owned craft beer store in Arizona. We have over 400 different beers. About 2/3 of those craft beers come in cans. We also cater to river guiding companies, so that helps :) </p>
<p>But yeah, the idea that canned beer will have a different flavor is now incorrect and obsolete. Anyone that tells you otherwise is full of it, and couldn't pass a blind taste test.</p>
<p>Edit: The naysayers probably also drink beer on draft. Guess what that beer is stored in? A big metal can.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love that most craft beer is in cans. I live in Albuquerque (<strong>amazing</strong> beer scene BTW) and we have to take our glass recycling to a recycling center. Cans they pick up and are therefore much less work. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many of the breweries in Portland are canning their beer now.  This is great for us, since we spend as much time as we can kayaking, and taking glass bottles is bad for a number of reasons.  Much more portable for hiking, camping, and way easier and lighter to pack back out.  Canned beer has had a bad rep because canned beer used to just be cheap domestic lagers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But there's also the feel of drinking out of any particular vessel that adds or detracts to the process. Just as wine glasses and cocktail glasses are fine tuned to their cargo, one should also expect the same discrimination to apply to beer drinking when done straight from the packaging. If pouring into a glass, then none of this matters but when it comes to drinking beer, I'll take a glass bottle 99% of the time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More and more crafts use cans now. Since it blocks 100% of light it can protect the beer better although generally beer is transported in dark refrigerated trucks and dark bottles keep the beer fine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The primary reason is that bottling was the standard for a long time so everyone has bottling lines. Most of these companies would love to switch to cans, but the canning lines are super expensive and many small breweries simply can't justify switching to cans if you have a perfectly good bottling line.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dude you're not supposed to drink beer from the bottle or the can. You gotta pour it into a glass. That's how you create the head, and get the aromas from the beer. I mean if you're buying cheap beer it doesn't matter, you probably don't want those aromas. But if you're treating yourself to a nice beer, treat the beer to a glass.</p></div>		</li>
