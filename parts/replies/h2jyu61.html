			<div class="markdown"><p>I was surprised to NOT see Prudhoe Bay, Alaska on there.  The one time I got up there (long story, but was part of the support team for research along the highway), we figured we'd get a meal in Prudhoe and then head back south.  Turns out the entire town is behind a security checkpoint, and without an oil company badge, you don't get in.  And it wasn't even clear that there were businesses behind the checkpoint that took cash, as opposed to just swiping your ID.</p>
<p>So now I'm wondering if there is another category out there of towns that aren't explicitly owned by one company, but are de facto owned by a consortium?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah you see this a lot in Appalachian coal counties.  Whole town's owned and manged by the coal company.  They control the mail, the food, the jobs; in Harlan County Kentucky this is all over the place.  This makes people deeply dependant on the company, and thus fiercely loyal to it.</p></div>		</li>
