<p>It's probably just the case that the magnetic compass was invented in Europe, and thus these people were the first to start making accurate maps. They probably put north at the top of the map because they wanted Europe at the top.</p>

<p>Everyone here has focussed on maps, however globes have existed in various forms since the third century BC.  And if you and your primary audience lived in the Northern Hemisphere, putting the known landmasses on the <em>bottom</em> of the globe would have made it very inconvenient to use.  Having Europe on the top face of the globe means you can easily read and use it by looking down upon it from a natural position, as opposed to having to look at it from the bottom (or having to flip it over).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. This isn’t a complicated question. Humanity has known the earth is round for like 2500 years. 90% of humanity is in the northern hemisphere, so if you feel like the earth is below your feet, it makes sense to perceive humans as being on the top of the globe, and not the bottom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow. I thought you were being facetious or ethnocentric or something, but the southern hemisphere really is pretty dang sparse. Besides Antarctica, it's only Africa below the horn, 3/4 of South America, Austraulia, and a bunch of island nations. All of which are pretty low density in general.</p>
<p>It really tips the scales that China and India are in the north.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, not counting Antarctica, about 75% of the world's landmass is north of the equator (assuming the first search results on Google are accurate) and much of that landmass is closer to the north pole than Australia, Indonesia, etc. are to the south pole. For comparison, if you mirrored Australia along the equator to put it in the northern hemisphere, it would be more southerly than Europe and have a similar range of latitude to that of the continental United States. A globe with the south pole at the top would have most of the land at the bottom.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Which is a fact we know <em>now</em>, but something that early globe makers wouldn't have been fully aware of.  They mapped (globed?) what they knew, either from personal experience, reports from travellers, or details from other map/globe makers.</p>
<p>The earliest globes wouldn't have included Australia.  Even in 1492, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erdapfel" target="_blank">Erdapfel</a> (one of the earliest globes still in existence) was missing virtually all of the Southern Hemisphere (no Australia, no Antarctica, no South America (and no North America for that matter)).</p>
<p>So it wouldn't have been a <em>conscious</em> decision based on the actual geography of the earth -- it would have been a decision based on purely what was known to the globe makers of the day, which was primarily Europe, Asia, and Libya (for an interesting read, check out the Wikipedia article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_world_maps" target="_blank">Early World Maps</a>).  And putting that content on the <em>bottom</em> of a globe would have made the globe difficult to use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No one makes globes where South is on top. I had an Australian boss once, and we thought it would be a cool gift to give him a globe that had everything reversed, with Australia on top. But after an extensive search, I didn't find any, and furthermore heard from a believable source in the map industry that no one makes such globes.</p>
<p>I think there might be a (small) market for them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suspect you could just buy a regular globe, remove the globe from its mounting points, and flip it upside-down yourself to get the desired effect.</p>
<p>I doubt much of anyone would care about an inverted globe other than Australians and New Zealanders, making it too small of a market to specifically cater to.  Nobody uses globes for navigational purposes anymore -- their uses these days are primarily educational and decorative.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>China and India are both North of the equator. 90% of the human population lives North of the equator. And the part that lives south of it is mostly pretty close to the equator and their biggest trading partners are North of the equator. There simply aren't very many people that would have wanted south on top in any case.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why Europe? Pretty much every single major civilization was in the northern hemisphere, there's simply more landmass. China, Persia, India, Egypt, Ottomans, Japan, Mongols, Mayans, Carthage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also that almost every major civilization in history has originated in the northern hemisphere, and so-called &quot;sub-equatorial&quot; parts of the planet are almost completely unoccupied. The only major landmasses south of the equator are Australia, South America, and Antarctica, and Antarctica is incapable of supporting human life. Compared to the northern hemisphere where you have the vast majority of humanity which includes China and India, two of the most populous nations in earth. </p>
<p>Couple that with the fact that it adds unnecessary complexity to make maps &quot;upside down&quot;, because then you would need to reorient the map/globe to see the parts of it that are relevant to you (which excludes pretty much everything south of the equator).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 'reorienting the map' theory is an interesting one that I've never really considered. Since most (all?) written language is read from the top down, it would make sense that you'd start with the majority of the globe's landmass at the top. Historic China made maps that are oriented north-up. Hecataeus made a map north-up too. But Pomponius Mela made a now-famous map that is oriented east-up. The old T-in-O maps also have also been oriented east-up. East-up might have made more sense to the Romans who were pushing east into Persia at the height of the empire. Point being these are all arbitrary decisions made by societies with a lot of power in their time. A good case-in-point of this in the modern sense is that, during the Cold War era, polar projections became popular and were meant to illustrate just how close (and therefore dangerous) the USSR was to the US. That's not to say we've converted, the north-up view dominates, but it also just further illustrates the socially-constructed nature of geographic knowledge. Us geographers/cartographers/GIS nerds think about this a lot, and the sub-sub-subfield of critical cartography is getting more attention in the academy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addendum, I’d like to point out that just like Antarctica, Australia is wholly incapable of supporting human life.  To this day, people can only exist in Australia if protected by a climate controlled and radiation shielded structure.</p></div>		</li>
