<p>Have you a example where a single detection of a radio wave include a source distance?</p>
<p>If you have a idea what the source it you could include that but the distance from other observation.</p>
<p>If the process that generate the radio wave have a fixed output power you could just look at the strength to get the distance, I have no knowledge of  radio source like that perhaps a Type Ia supernova emits a burst with constant power in radio waves as in visible light so you can use that.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Except you can, to an extent.</p>
<p>Objects that move away from us are redshifted. Due to the expansion of the universe being uniform, objects twice as far move away from us twice as fast and are therefor twice as redshifted.</p>
<p>For pretty much everything, the base frequencies are known. When certain atoms are excited or destroyed, we know what the emission frequencies are. These are recorded with spectroscopes.</p>
<p>So when you make an analysis of the measured frequencies, most of them should map onto known elements like hydrogen and helium with a fixed offset.</p>
<p>This offset is the redshift, which gives you a ballpark estimate of how far away something is, even for a singular burst of radiation.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>NOTE1: the andromeda galaxy is one of the only blueshifted things in the universe. It's heading straight for us. If a spectroscope measurement is blueshifted, it's probably from andromeda.</p>
<p>NOTE2: due to the immense distances involved, anything within a few thousand lightyears to a million lightyears is often &quot;good enough&quot; as a distance measurement error.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually called the &quot;parallax method&quot; - it's where the &quot;parsec&quot; distance measurement comes from. A parsec is the distance at which an object's position in the sky will change one angular second (1/3600th of a degree) from one side of Earth's orbit to the other. </p>
<p>It's only useful for objects closer than about 1000 light years, however - at larger distances, the parallax is so small as to be undetectable. And, of course, while 1000 light years is a very long distance compared to the distance down the road to the chemist, it's just peanuts to space. So this is definitely not what they use for most distance calculations.</p>
<p><em>edit</em> Reading a bit more, the parallax method is useful at longer distances now than it used to be thanks to improvements in measuring parallax, but it's still only useful for things inside our own galaxy.</p></div>		</li>
