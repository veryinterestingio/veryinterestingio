			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the only informed answer so far. Add to it the fact that displacement doesn’t negatively correlate with brake-specific fuel consumption and we are halfway to the true reasons. Nothing to do with big spaces and not really driven by low gas prices. It’s mostly just that there are multiple viable ways of making an efficient internal combustion engine, and small displacement is not inherently advantaged in this regard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not making sense there.  You are saying it's mostly about the fact that there are different approaches to engine design.  The OP might already know that, given he is asking why different designs were popular in different areas. Your answer missed that question completely.  Anyway, I disagree with you still.  There ARE inherent advantages to different displacements, it depends on your needs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn't answer the engine size, and are American cars more comfy?
No they are not I've lived/worked in the us American cars often have rudimentary suspension generally European cars have much better suspension.
I'd suggest a large German car would be a lot more comfortable on a long drive than a us car.
The Americans are likng Hyundais etc these for days also.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your comment isnt entirely true. Big spaces did matter. 2 reasons. 60s. Families wanted to be comfy. And there weren't all these twisting roads that needed great handling smaller cars. Muscle cars became huge. Big engines, big power. And heavy cars since Americans wanted comfort over handling. Bigger cars=bigger engines</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know if the larger displacement argument stacks up all that well thought. Australia’s cities and towns are probably more spread out and isolated than the US and  the appetite for  big saloons with bigger V6s and v8’s is definitely starting to give way to compact SUVs and diesels. </p>
<p>But fuel prices would go a long way towards explaining that.</p></div>		</li>
