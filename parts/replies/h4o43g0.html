			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to the evolution argument, one of my favorite experiments found that a minnow in a tank with a predator fish almost always gets eaten.</p>
<p>However, a minnow in a tank with two predatory fish escapes more often than not. When attacked by one predator, the minnow releases hormones attracting other predatory fish (yelling), the predators then fight over the minnow giving it a chance to get away in the confusion.</p>
<p>It is evolutionarily beneficial to draw attention to yourself when injured or threatened.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only if the two big jerks feel their competing with each other for the opportunity to kill and eat you. If they both just want you beating up and eating and they don't care who does the eating they'll just team up on you.</p>
<p>You have to make sure that there's conflict on each edge of the graph.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>speaking of evolution. do you know that feeling of being extra tired when you wake up on a rainy/stormy night?
this is because when humans were still in their more primitive states, rain would ward of their natural predators giving them a sense of security so they can relax. evolution is crazy...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry, what? Could you ELI5 that for me?</p>
<p>Cuz to me &quot;a sense of security so they can relax&quot; means that we'd be less tired after rainy/stormy nights, not extra tired...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A much simpler explanation is that it's generally harder to hunt or gather in the rain and moving around makes it more likely to slip and injure yourself.  Also it's cold. Humans prefer to sleep when it's raining for the same reason our predators do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh good. This makes me feel better about all the yelling I did when I was in labor. I am normally a pretty quiet person. But during labor it's as though I had no other option but to yell loudly. My parents came to the hospital and heard me screaming down the hall. It was so unlike me, my dad was scared and turned around and left. The only way I can describe my overall behavior during that experience was &quot;animalistic.&quot; I was all instinct and almost nothing else.</p></div>		</li>
