			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to note, when people talk about Islamic pilgrimages to mecca, they usually mean the Hajj, which is a big thing. Hajj happens during a different month in the Muslim calendar though - which is called Dhul Hajj. There's a sort of mini-version called 'Umrah, which is less intense and can be done any time. It's popular to do Umrah during Ramadan. Umrah is not a requirement, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for sharing. I appreciate the opportunity to learn about your religion. </p>
<p>Christianity has many sub sections: Baptist catholic, etc. and can use which ever version of bible they want. Does this apply to your religion too or is everyone one Muslim, one bible (sorry I can’t remember proper name) ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Muslim here - I often say happy ramadan, that's totally fine. It's cool when people say Ramadan mubarak (mubarak means blessed) though, as that's the standard greeting - especially since ramadan isn't really a celebration, but more of a period of introspection. At the end there's a big festival called Eid Ul-Fitr - basically our equivalent of Christmas - and we definitely say happy Eid then.</p></div>		</li>
