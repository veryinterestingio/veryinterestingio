			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, in cuts of meat that (sometimes) include major veins/arteries(?) you'll sometimes find small amounts of clotted blood in the area. Its very different from the red juice. Always grosses me the hell out, but I guess its natural/safe...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. It really depends on the oxygen demand on the area
So there are slow twitch fibers such as the breast, which really doesnt move and high twitch fibers such as the wings, thighs in chickens</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always thought the main used muscles in birds for flying are the breast muscles. There is very few muscles in the wings. As we use pectoralis muscle for &quot;similar&quot; movements, like bench presses...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is backwards.  The breast is fast-twitch fiber for short flights.  The legs are slow-twich; they run around all day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the same as the difference between white and pink fish.  White meat fish are mostly fast twitch muscle cause their behaviour is mostly hide with occasional quick bursts of motion.  Pink meat fish are more long haul swimmers.  </p>
<p>On birds: the different parts of white and dark meat can also tell you a little about behaviour.  Birds that mostly walk will have dark legs, etc.</p></div>		</li>
