<p>Not so fun fact, there are also probably tiny little liquified corpses of Demodex mites in there!  </p>
<p>Warning: you can't go back after you read.  </p>
<p>A great NPR read about the arachnids that live in the pores of the skin on your face and eat the oil, dead skin, etc.  Then mate, in your face, before they die and decompose in your follicles.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They spend most of their time tucked inside the pores, but while people sleep, they crawl out onto the skin's surface to mate and then head back to lay their eggs.</p>

<p>Mites have sex parties on your face while you sleep.</p></div>		</li>

Beautiful when you think about it, even on a day when you feel all is lost you are the most important thing in the world for a 1000 species and population in the trillions.

			<div class="markdown"><p>See, this is pretty much my reaction now. I've heard about the many face and skin bugs, and the bacteria that help us process things our bodies couldn't without them. After you get over the shock, you kinda start to figure, 'well, I guess they're there for a reason--or at the very least, they're not there to hurt me'. Might as well welcome the inevitable, right?</p>
<p>But then I also make friends with mice and spiders and lizards, so I guess I just tend towards appreciating small lives--or at least the ones that are easy to peacefully coexist with (...lookin' at you, wasps...).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Happened to me once about ten years ago, around that time there was an infectious disease called &quot;red-eye disease&quot; among kids. When I got infected, the next morning when I woke up, I couldn't open my eyes. The &quot;sands&quot; completely &quot;soldered&quot; my eyelids shut, and I had to crawl into bathroom to washed them away. Truly an terrifying experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pink eye, or conjunctivitis - I got it the day of my secondary school graduation, about 6 years ago. My mother had taken me to get my lashes dyed with henna, which I'm allergic to. She didn't believe me when I told her I was, and the next day I couldn't freaking open my eyes, they leaked weird goop all day, and she tried to say it was hayfever.</p>
<p>She's not a bad Mum, but she gets an idea into her head (like getting eye lashes dyed) and if you try to say no she sulks until you do it anyway. She got me eyedrops and everything, which was nice.</p></div>		</li>
