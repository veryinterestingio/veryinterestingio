			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes much more sense. Im always like, sure we are not the only planet that has life in it, but planets are different, so life if exists in that planet, must be adapted to their conditions, not exactly like ours, but according to what you said, makes sense look for life like ours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not so much a matter of adaptation when it comes to water. No other atoms act quite like hydrogen and oxygen, and not other natural substance combines them in such a convenient state as water. It is very possible that there is no replacement for water in the recipe for life. </p>
<p>Additionally, the assumption that there is definitely life on other planets is based on the assumption that Earth isn't that unique a planet, therefore in trillions of earth like planets the same thing that happened on Earth must happen again. Saying that simply because planets unlike earth exist, things which we only know to exist on Earth must also exist on those planets is not logical.</p>
<p>Edit for clarity: We can logically assume that there is another example of life in the universe because there are other planets like earth, which could possibly host life as we know it. We cannot assume the existence of anything that is unprecedented (such as silicon based life, amonnia based life) becuase there is no proof that it can occur naturally. It's not like fermi's paradox, where simply the size of the universe can turn a small % chance into a certainty. There are 0 examples of non-Earthlike life to our knowledge, multiply that by a quintillion stars and it's still 0. If we had hard evidence of alternate forms of life, even under experimental circumstance, it'd be different, but we've never had that frankinstein moment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>H²O is an incredible molecule due to its amazing and extraordinary properties. As we know it, it's the 'universal solvent' due to these properties and its presumed universal abundance and ubiquity.</p>
<p>It is conceivable that it is theoretically possible that there could exist lifeforms that are based on ammonia, hydrogensulfide, hydrogenfluoride, arsenic, boron, silicone, and/or methane, but it is highly likely that nature and the Universe at large will always favour water if readily available and if the conditions are right to utilise this compound in order for life to form and evolve.</p>
<p>Water is simply the good shit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know if I fully understand your last sentence.</p>
<p>Edit: He was saying something was illogical. But he was agreeing with the person above him. On an issue no one seemed to be arguing. Using phrasing really weird phrasing.</p>
<p>It appears he’s saying, it isn’t logical to expect earth-like life on a planet that is nothing like earth. Which I don’t think anyone, specifically the person he responded to, was making that argument.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And it's also very common. Mostly in the form of water ice, but liquid water isn't rare (in a galactic sense, at least). And whenever there's liquid water on Earth, there's life. Even if it's in the bottom of the ocean, or a geothermal pool with high concentrations of heavy metals, there will be signs of life as we understand it.</p>
<p>We apply a similar logic to Carbon. Life on Earth is based on carbon, so when those two things are near each other (carbon and liquid water), you can bet your Reddit karma there will be life somewhere.</p>
<p>That <em>should</em> happen in another planet under similar conditions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A better term is that all life we know, needs water, and we don't see any form of life on earth that can exist without water. Cells cannot work without water to help with its basic functions.</p>
<p>From a theoretical perspective, other fluids could perform the same tasks, but we have no idea what that looks like.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I might also add that water (and life as we know it in general) uses the most abundant elements in universe (except for helium). Hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, etc. Are the most common elements out there., and water is made out of two of those very common elements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had to explain this to physicists at a conference last year. They couldn't understand why we're looking for earth like planets rather than signs of life that we don't know about.  Like...man...how do we look for something that we don't know what it is?!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep at some point you have to focus your efforts. We kinda have to look for what we know. Doesnt mean we arent open to alternatives, just itd mostly be an inefficient use of time and resources if the goal is finding life.</p></div>		</li>
