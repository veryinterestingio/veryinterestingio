			<div class="markdown"><p>Your bank probably asks you to use a pre-generated ID number instead of a username, a number-uppercase-lowercase-special-character-count verified password, and a PIN, has fraud detection software, will straight-up lock your account for anything suspicious, and depending on the bank, possibly also; checks location, checks access behaviour, insists on 2FA, times-out inactive sessions, regularly asks you to confirm account numbers, sends you notifications of any security related actions or financial transactions, and has insurance to refund you in the case of loss due to fraud.<br />
So user-defined question not such a big deal if you fuck it up. I'd still be wary though.</p></div>		</li>
