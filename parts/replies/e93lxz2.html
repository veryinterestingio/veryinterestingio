<p>transmissions also factor heavily, the same engine in two different vehicles may have a different optimal cruising speed depending on the gear ratios (which are designed around the weight and aerodynamics of the car as well)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electrics are a little different. The most efficient cruising speed is very very low, so you give up efficiency if you want to actually go anywhere. For most internal combustion vehicles, the speed is significantly higher, usually in the 40mph range, since engine efficiency is pretty crappy at very low loads.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get about 67mpg on my plug-in hybrid (Ioniq) going 55mph. Slower speeds lowers that, but that's mostly due to losses in stop and go. Not much ability to go at a steady 10mph clip without either having stops or getting stopped by police for being an ass</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should be added that it also heavily depends on tire pressure as well. Optimal gas mileage is best in the cruising speed zone at the proper tire pressure. A deviation in tire pressure can easily throw off the cruise speed range 5-10mph.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just for anyone considering the following, not you specifically because it doesn't sound like you're getting this idea:</p>
<p>Do <strong>NOT</strong> attempt to increase fuel economy by overinflating your tires. You put yourself and others at increased risk of an accident to save a marginal amount on gas, and your insurer may not like that you thought you knew better than the manufacturer.</p>
<p>Always run within the manufacturer specified range, just check periodically that they are properly inflated - especially as the temperature starts dropping into the fall/winter months.</p></div>		</li>
