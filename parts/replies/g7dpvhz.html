			<div class="markdown"><p>In 1266 there was a 6-month siege at the castle in my home town in England, which was then just a small village. The king, his army, the whole of parliament, Archbishop of Canterbury and the papal envoy and all their retinues camped out at the Abbey across the road for the duration of the siege.</p>
<p>Troops were billeted at locals' houses and food was requisitioned from local crops and livestock. By the time the siege was over the local economy was devastated. It took years to recover. The local sheriff was tasked with the job of going into the castle afterwards and clearing up 6 months of excrement and animal carcasses.</p>
<p>In short, it would be a disaster for the locals to have an army camped out locally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's exactly right.</p>
<p>Large armies would forage a land clean. The ability of an area to sustain such an army was an important strategic consideration. The reason castles were designed to wait out sieging armies or force them into a bloody assault was because an army would eventually eat everything within reach and have to retreat or starve.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you think of it that way the idea of strategic retreat and burning everything down as you go does seem that novel of an idea. Your stuff is getting taken/destroyed either way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We read Caesar's Gallic Wars in high school Latin, and he was constantly talking about his supply train and making sure it was safe and well-ordered. Several times his enemies would cut off his supply lines and what that happened the first thing he usually did was to retreat back to a position where he could get resupplied.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did you read it in Lqtin, and if so, did you read this one massive atrocity of a sentence that spans like half a page or more, where it's just describing how Caesar ran around in the middle of an ambush laid by the Gauls, where they attacked them while the Romans were making camp, and people kept floodibg in making it harder and harder to oversee all the xhaos and how Caesar ran from one legion to thz next saying some words to motivate them?<br />
I think the passage starts with the horsemen crossibg a river to make a beachhead, and checking out the znvironment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The marius reforms that changed rome from an annual ametuer army of citizen landowners to a professional army of career soldiers actually saw a reduction in baggage train as the legionaires were expected to carry a lot more of thier equipment.</p>
<p>It made roman legion logistics that little bit better that helped them conquer the world.</p></div>		</li>
