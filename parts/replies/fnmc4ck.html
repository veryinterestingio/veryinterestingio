			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it is important to clarify you can solve full compressible Navier Stokes for a real but chemically inert gas relatively easily as far as computing solutions to nonlinear PDEs go - you get a numerical answer that depends on your turbulence closure model, but it will tell you pretty much what the flow will be minus really small scale effects that don't get resolved. The incompressibility assumption or the ideal gas do not make the PDEs that much nastier to solve - the main problems with nonlinear advection and turbulence occur for any fluid. </p>
<p>High Reynolds and high Mach might not actually go hand in hand - Reynolds number can drop off with altitude for example, or you have relatively small length scales in play.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Solving incompressible Navier-Stokes is a different ball game to solving their compressible counterpart. The fact that mass conservation equation doesnâ€™t have a rate of change term necessitates the use of something  like the Pressure-Poisson equation. This kinda makes them a bit nastier to solve than CNS. </p>
<p>Further, the non-linearity term itself is not a challenge to solve numerically. The fact that this is responsible for turbulence and the ensuing range of length scales is what makes it challenging. Forgive me if this is what you meant.</p></div>		</li>
