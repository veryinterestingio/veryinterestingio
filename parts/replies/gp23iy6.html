			<div class="markdown"><p>More conductive than pure water, which is almost totally non-conductive, sure..   More conductive than the salt water in your body (the salt is mostly sodium chloride, and very close to the salinity of sea water) not even close...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are less than 5 parts per million of chlorine in a pool. If it’s filled with tap water, which can be up to 250ppm salt, the amount of chlorine is already dwarfed by the trace amounts of salt. </p>
<p>By comparison salt is 9,000 parts per million molecules in blood 35,000 parts per million in the ocean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer.  I was surprised how much scrolling it took to find it.. :/</p>
<p>Also the reason it's incredibly dangerous to swim around boats on shore power, particularly in freshwater.  You form a better path to ground than the water that surrounds your body, and if there's a voltage differential due to ground faults on a boat with metal parts exposed to water, you'll become part of that circuit. :(</p></div>		</li>
