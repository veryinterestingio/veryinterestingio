			<div class="markdown"><p>I had read that compounds in green tea had been found to be effective at treating HPV infections*. However, the only mechanism that was explained in detail that I've come across is that it contains epigallocatechin-gallate, and since EGCG is a zinc ionophore ^(†), it interferes with RdRP (RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase) ^(§), which is normally used by RNA viruses to replicate. Do you happen to know if HPV somehow uses RdRP in its life cycle? It would be a curious thing if it used by a DNA virus.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some hpv viruses ARE cleared by the immune system. Depends on the strain and the immune system. Keep in mind that not all strains cause visible warts.</p>
<p>Men are less likely to notice the invisible strains, but when a woman has her annual smear test it will come up positive. Many women are positive for a few years and then negative again, after their body defeats that virus. Of course one can always pick up a new strain.</p>
<p>If you ever had warts on your fingers or toes as a child, you had a strain of HPV. It’s incredibly common.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this: DNA viruses <em>generally</em> enter the cell nucleus, which isn't able to detect the viruses and tell surrounding immune cells that it has been infected, which is the main method for cells infected by viruses to signal for &quot;help&quot; (assisted suicide). </p>
<p>And for herpes, it tends to infect nerve cells, which have a very long life compared to epithelial cells. Then they can send out new viruses through the nerve cells that infect epithelial cells, which gives the symptoms. But the virus is still latent in the nerve cells until it is activated again, so it's very difficult to cure herpes.</p></div>		</li>
