			<div class="markdown"><p>-1 for basically just copy pasting an articles pretty shallow content which doesn't explain the &quot;why&quot; and a viable explanation to why it also is unlikely to mutate like multiple users above did with advanced subject knowledge such as: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/fy50ed/can_mosquitos_spread_covid19/fmyjaeh/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/fy50ed/can_mosquitos_spread_covid19/fmyjaeh/</a></p>
<p>and</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You don't need to paste a link if your explanation is thorough and as plausible as an external source.</p>
<p>Why I react to this? Because there is time to put emphasize on &quot;individual thinking&quot; and scoring subject authority through comprehension and not just &quot;he pasted an external link, hence must be true&quot; mindsets which is prevalent in reddit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think the &quot;to date no reason that it does&quot; argument is a reasonable one anymore because until maybe a week ago the WHO and every other faculty or scientific journal seemed to say without question that pets were completely fine - and now it turns out cats and ferrets are very prone to covid19, and even dogs a tiny bit.
A more mechanical reason like stated above (that it's not physically possible since mosquito-spread diseases have to infect the mosquito first) is more reliable.</p></div>		</li>

<p>However they are mammals like the original source animal vector and so are more likely to be able to be infected than an insect would be. Making the jump to infect an insect is a huge jump and there is to date no reason to believe that it has or it is likely to do so based on the known properties of other coronaviruses and current studies.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Uhh, are you confusing the ferret results with the cat results? </p>
<p>Because your own link clearly describes it attacking the lungs of cats:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Infectious virus was detected in the viral RNA-positive nasal turbinates, soft palates, tonsils, tracheas, <strong>lungs of these cats</strong>, but was not recovered from the viral RNA-positive small intestine </p>
<p>Histopathologic studies performed on samples from the virus-inoculated juvenile cats that died or euthanized on day 3 p.i. revealed massive lesions in the nasal and tracheal mucosa epitheliums, <strong>and lungs</strong> (fig. S7). These results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in cats, with younger cats being more permissive and, perhaps more importantly, the virus can transmit between cats via the airborne route.</p>
