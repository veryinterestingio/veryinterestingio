			<div class="markdown"><p>Nick here: Thanks for your question. I think there are interesting parallels between the prohibition of alcohol and other modern day analogs for other drugs. In fact, this has been discussed as a more general phenomenon known as the &quot;stimulus of prohibition&quot;. This was written about by Alfred McCoy in his article titled &quot;The Stimulus of Prohibition: A Critical History of the Global Narcotic Trade&quot; in this <a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=tWYoRauhiK0C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=dangerous+harvest&amp;ots=Legk5sgxPy&amp;sig=DyGOaB-GQV17WwYsjPhVX44-C6o#v=onepage&amp;q=dangerous%20harvest&amp;f=false" target="_blank">book</a>. Notably, though, geography tends to be missing from such explanations.</p>
<p>With regards to the effects of legalization, no, our model does not explore such outcomes explicitly. This first effort was focused on re-creating and explaining past trends. However, a subset of us are currently working on a National Science Foundation-funded project to explore the effects of alternative interdiction strategies, and one of the strategies we are interested in is a &quot;stand down&quot; approach. This will mimic the effects of legalization by drastically reducing the number of interdiction resources deployed in the 'transit zone' (i.e., not the production or consumption areas, but the spaces between). This will allow us to understand the spatial implications of alternative interdiction strategies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the answer. It would be great if there turned out be some critical point where some pointed intervention could break the back of the cartels economically so they would fall apart and the affected counties wouldn't be saddled with decades of completely entrenched organized crime like we were even after alcohol prohibition ended.</p></div>		</li>
