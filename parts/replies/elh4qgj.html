			<div class="markdown"><p>I was in 2 lectures many years ago that reminded me of that, one was of a Dreamworks animator on Kung Fu Panda and a few other titles that said he worked on it for 3 years and his animation only covers 2 minutes of the entire movie in 2 scenes and he almost didn't see anything about the movie until it was released</p>
<p>The other by the animation director (iirc) for Avatar at WETA at the time and he told us that they had dozens of animators that worked for almost a full year on just animating mostly the ears, tails and fingers/toes of the Navi characters because the motion capture of those parts was non existent or lacking and it was mostly on 'draft' level so they barely got to see how it ended up looking, let alone the final scenes (though they did see the movie before everyone XD)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Only the famous ones. Most of them are a lot cheaper, you could make a movie with a significantly lower acting budget by not hiring famous people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the problem is they get more famous as the series goes on. Why do you think game of thrones is ending? They started off with mainly nobodies and now they’re all demanding a higher salary. It hits a point where you can’t afford it.</p>
<p>Avengers is similar except most of them were already famous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Terrence Howard got paid more than Robert Downey for the original Iron man, he got something like $3.5 million while Downey only got $500k. I guess Terrence wanted even more money for the second one and also he's batshit crazy so they gave him the boot. Then Downey went on to become the highest paid actor in the world year after year by a stupid margin. Might have something to do with the rumors that this is his last mcu movie.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I have a question, (idk if it would apply to you per se but curiosity has had me for a while) say you worked on endgame, and it costed let’s say for sanity’s sake, $10,000,000 to make and pay the actors, etc.  and the movie on opening weekend makes $80,000,000. Does the profits of that movie go to Disney or is there bonuses to the team that made the film?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Disney. They are the producers. They pay in front, they get the money after. Closely related: the government doesn't get that much, and any actors who negotiated parts of the gains neither: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_accounting" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood\_accounting" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood\_accounting</a></a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're half right about the actors getting nothing. This is really a thing of the past now since any actor (and by extension agent) worth their salt will negotiate to have a cut off the gross profits, not the net. People like Robert Downey Jr. would get something like this (along with maybe an exec producer credit). It's because of dodgy Hollywood accounting that they ask for the gross rather than the net. Downey makes bank from each MCU film he's in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That $80,000,000 opening haul is split up. The money goes to the studio, the distributor (if different) and to the theater chain/house that showed the movie. How the money is split will vary from film to film and from studio to studio, depending upon prior agreements. For a major studio film like a summer blockbuster, let's say a ticket is sold for $15. Roughly 55-60% of that will be retained by the studio/distributor, while the remainder is pocketed by the theater. </p>
<p>Actors can get bonuses if there's a clause in their contract that allows it, if a movie performs well. But for the most part they are paid a flat fee upfront by the studio. Actors working in higher-bugeted films will usually command higher salaries  </p>
<p>Remember too that movies always cost more than their posted budget, because of the marketing costs. A $200 million blockbuster might have an additional $ 80-100 million in marketing costs</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>55%-60% is true for domestic. it starts to get lower for intl grosses (something people overlook when talking about how much money a studio made off a movie). china, the big intl' market, only returns 25% of the box office to the studio (this was actually negotiated by china with the studios), with the rest going to the movie theater and the chinese distributor company.</p></div>		</li>
