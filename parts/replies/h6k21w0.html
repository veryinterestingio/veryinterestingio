			<div class="markdown"><p>We also change the shape of our eye to adjust the focus to something up close. But it’s permanent and is called myopia. Our eyes grow longer when we focus on short distances for prolonged periods of times. The chance of that happening is high with children and teens. But can still happen with adults, like gem cutters in poor countries who don’t use the proper magnifying tools sometimes become blind. Since the eye becomes too long and the retina starts to detach.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So do humans. That's how the eyes 'lens' works. The surface of your eye where the light enters changes shape to focus the light on the retina. Do you mean that the actual ball part of the eagle's eye can deform as well?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have an idea of what they are seeing in terms of shape because we have devices that can detect uv. But the experience we can't know. UV is probably closer to blue or purple and IR closer to red, because of the closeness in wavelength. But we can't imagine it exactly because our brains aren't set up for it, I would think.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrachromacy" target="_blank">Tetrachromacy</a> is a thing. Two of the genes for cones are on the X chromosome so it is estimated that a large number of women (having two X chromosomes) can actually see more than three colours.</p>
<p>How would you test it though? Basically all of our colour printing processes are based on three primary colours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While it’s not uncommon for women to possess the genes for 4 cones it’s still unknown the percentage of these women where all cones are ‘active’. So far, there has been 1 woman to be certified by researchers as a ‘true tetrachromat’, though it is suspected there are many more. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think we know even if individual humans perceive colors in the same way... Your idea of blue could be very different from mine, even if we look at the same blue light, due to differences in our cones, their density and how our brains grew and adapted to interpret visual stimuli.</p></div>		</li>
