			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah people like to go on about the simulation theory stuff all the time, especially after Musk got on board, but like.... so what? There's no way to tell, and I'd actually be happier not finding out I'm a brain in a jar or being used as a battery by robots.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The only thing that could shake me is finding out that other minds don't exist. That would suck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're talking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_in_a_vat" target="_blank">exactly that</a> in my into philosophy class. Apparently, the first time someone thought of that scenario, it was so long ago that they used an example of an evil demon tricking them to think everything around them was real.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While it’s true that Descartes imagines a demon that deceives all his senses, it wasn’t to imagine the existence of a brain in a jar scenario. The point of the exercise for Descartes was to apply absolute scepticism in order to see what can be proven with absolute certainty to exist. So it’s less about “what if we’re brains in jars” and more “well the only thing I can absolutely prove exists is my mind.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, but not exactly. Plato's Cave is more about perceived reality being only a pale imitation of true reality rather than a fabrication like in Descartes' Demon. One can learn or become aware of being within Plato's Cave, but Descartes' Demon can forever deceive you of everything but your own existence.</p></div>		</li>
