			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for drawing attention to that important distinction in terminology. Also, I appreciate your answers. That's very interesting. Personally, I've always found the Collatz Conjecture to be one of those &quot;oh wow, this should be pretty simple to prove&quot; and then you fall into that rabbit hole.  </p>
<p>What about proving that the Euler–Mascheroni constant is irrational? Would that possibly be another example? Can that be proven or is it known that it can't be proven?</p></div>		</li>

<p>As far as I know that's another example in the second category: Problems for which we simply don't have the answer yet. A definitive proof may exist, but if it does, we haven't found it.</p>
<p>But I find the question of whether a certain constant is irrational or not a lot less accessible than the examples I listed. With each of those, one can attempt a few cases with pen and paper and get a feel for the problem. Irrationality proofs aren't as easy to get in to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about the Euler-Mascheroni constant, but I have played with the Collatz Conjecture.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If it is true, it would seem the trajectory of any number should converge on a power of two. Every trajectory should in fact converge on some 2^(n), where n &gt; 1. In this case, we would see a branching pattern out going up and down, but always coming down to the... let's call it the 2^(n) line.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So perhaps another way of stating the conjecture is; the Collatz Function f(n) converges on some 2^(m), where m is an element of the natural numbers and greater than 1.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The solution to the problem is intimately connected to perfect squares.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>2^n where n is even</p>
<p>Every even power of 2 minus one is divisible by 3 and results in an odd number, and is thus eventually attainable through the function. </p>
<p>2^4 = 16 16-1 = 15 15/3 = 5 </p>
<p>2^6 = 64 64-1 = 63 63/3 = 21</p>
<p>2^8 = 256 256-1 = 255 255/3 = 85</p>
<p>And so on.</p>
<p>I'm not really a math guy, but this seems pretty straightforward, I don't understand how it hasn't been officially proved yet, maybe I'm missing the nuance of actual math proofs</p>
<p>Any even number, when divided by 2, will result in either another even number, or an odd number</p>
<p>Any odd number multiplied by three will result in an odd number, which when incremented by 1 will result in an even number</p>
<p>Any even number which is not equal to 2^n is equal to an odd number times 2^n</p>
<p>Therefore any number following this function will move downwards along the path of X2^n until reaching X and if X&gt;1 it will transfer to a new path of X2^n which cannot be any previously followed path</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm currently in the rabbit hole, and want to clarify something I noticed. For the conjecture to be true, all numbers must converge on 4\^n.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The only way to reach 2\^n (with n being odd) is either by making it the start of a sequence, or part of a 4\^n series converging towards 1. It doesn't seem it can appear any other way.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An example of an undecidable problem is the continuum hypothesis. We know that the set of all integers and the set of all real numbers both have infinite &quot;size,&quot; but the reals are strictly larger than the integers. The question &quot;is there a set of numbers whose size is strictly in between those two?&quot; does not have an answer that can be found by using our typical ZFC axioms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you explain why? </p>
<p>In the last calculus course I took the professor explained to me that you can compare infinities. Eg. the sum from n to infinity of n^2 + n is of greater magnitude than the sum from n to infinity of 2n + n, even though both are infinite. </p>
<p>Based off that assumption, why wouldn’t it stand to reason there’s a half step in between? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Either your professor was being a bit loose with their language, or you missed some subtlety.</p>
<p>Neither of those sums exists because they are both divergent. One increases much faster than the other, but they would end up being the exact same infinity, called &quot;aleph nought&quot; which is the smallest infinity.</p>
<p>You can compare infinities, but that's not anything like how you would do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of ideas of infinite. </p>
<p>The Calc idea you was using was about speed of increment. </p>
<p>Another is the Cardinal idea. How many elements do a set have? In this idea two set have the same cardinality if you can get an surjective function between the sets. So the Cardinal of the natural numbers is equal to the cardinal of the odd numbers. You can say that there are the same quantity of naturals than numbers in the form n^2+n (to 1 correspond 2, to 2 correspond 6, etc)</p>
<p>You can prove that the naturals and rationales have the same cardinality. (All the infinity is plagued with black magic).</p>
<p>For the reals you can prove that they ate a lot more than naturals. What can't be proved is that between those two infinites there isn't another. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The temptation is to think of &quot;infinity&quot; as a number, a sort of very big &quot;joker&quot; number that trumps all the other numbers.</p>
<p>It's actually a process, and each infinity arises as a result of some process.  It's the processes you can compare.  </p>
<p>The answer to your quiestion is, basically, you need to show (a) there is a gap (check) (b) there is something that can go in the gap (very much not check)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In category theory, there are models in which the reals have the same cardinality as the integers. Indeed, there are sound categoric reasons for positing this. </p>
<p>The usual proofs that the reals have higher cardinality are dodgy from the categoric perspective because they change categories in midstream by sleight of hand. Category theorists call this practice “evil”.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, there is one example of the first kind that is very approachable and it's the Halting Problem.</p>
<p>Basically the Halting Problem asks (in its most approachable form, there are more compact definitions that include more edge cases but are harder to understand):<br />
Given a set of instructions containing:    </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the standard math operators (e.g. y = 3 x + 1 ) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a way to check if two things are equal (is y mod 2 equal to 0 ?)  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a way to conditionally jump back to a previous instruction (if previous was true, start from first instruction)</p>
</li>
<li>a way to check if you're done ( if y mod 2 is equal to 1 you're done )</li>
</ul>
<p>Will this sequence of instructions ever be done?</p>
<p>Surprisingly it is possible to prove that there are instructions for which it is impossible to predict if they will ever finish or if you end up in a loop, forever jumping back to a previous instruction without ever getting closer to your goal. What's worse is that you can also not prove that you are stuck in a loop because there exist loops of arbitrary lengths. </p>
<p>That is, you can prove that you cannot prove such a program will ever halt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always thought Turing's first proof of the halting problem was nifty.  If you have a function that can determine whether or not something halts, you can easily use it to compose a paradox, so it can't exist.  Something like,</p>

    if halts(function):
        dont_halt()

To do that, you would need to provide an explicit program for which it's undecidable whether or not it halts.
