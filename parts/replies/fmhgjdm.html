			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually kind of what OP is describing. We evolved to have an appetite for sweet and fatty foods so we can “load up” on calories and go extended periods of time without eating. Kind of like “I found this apple tree, I should eat a bunch of sweet apples because I don’t know where the next apple tree will be”. The problem is in modern times we have an excess of food in developed countries and you don’t need to store up fat, although we still have the desire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because the &quot;trash&quot; is usually very rich in energy, mainly sugar (which is basically the SAME as carbohydrates!!) and also fat. Evolution has taught our bodies to get as much of those as possible, because food used to be rare and/or less saturating.</p></div>		</li>
