			<div class="markdown"><p>That's amazing. It just goes to show how far we've come in the last few decades in terms of advancements in safety. </p>
<p>In terms of aircraft wake turbulence, I believe I'm right in saying (but not quite sure of the amount in nm) there's certain distances that have to be maintained between different classes of aircraft upon takeoff in order to minimize wake turbulence.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The separations are specified in either distance or time (e.g. 3 minutes or 6 miles for a Light following a Heavy under ICAO rules). </p>
<p>The baseline separation requirements for FAA and ICAO divide aircraft into three categories (Heavy, Large, Small for FAA rules and Heavy, Medium, Light for ICAO rules). The categories are based on maximum takeoff weight. For FAA, the dividing lines are 300,000 lb and 41,000 lb (Heavy is above 300,000 lb, Light is below 41,000 lb, and Large is in between), while they are 300,000 lb and 15,500 lb for ICAO. </p>
<p>There are some additional complications (e.g. the A380 is actually in a fourth category, Super, for FAA while it is a Heavy but with special rules under ICAO, B757 aircraft are treated sort of like Heavy aircraft when leading despite being below the boundary as the result of a few well-publicized accidents in a relatively short time period, there is technically a division in the Smalls at 12,500 lb under FAA rules for certain situations, and a few other weird things), but that's the basic framework.</p>
<p>These groupings contribute to inefficiency in the NAS (National Airspace System) because of how wide the categories are - under ICAO rules, 5 miles behind a 299,999 lb aircraft is safe for an aircraft that only weighs a few thousand pounds, but the same 5 miles would be applied to a 15,501 lb aircraft leading a 15,499 lb aircraft. </p>
<p>As a result, both the United States and EUROCONTROL/ICAO have developed modified rules that establish additional categories with smaller groupings to improve operational efficiency. These programs are called Wake Recategorization (or RECAT).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>wake turbulence can for sure take down a light aircraft, but it tends not to be a problem because its part of the standard pilot curriculum and people know to avoid it. </p>
<p>mechanical turbulence on the other hand can really mess up a pilots day though. especially those around mountain ranges (not just mountain wave-which is a type of clear air turbulence). when you start getting close to the peaks and are affected by all the updrafts and downdrafts it gets really dangerous because there is so little time to react</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely correct but theres a difference between aircraft class and wake class so a large in aircraft class  wont necessarily be the same or recat. In recat you will have categories A through F . A is a super , b and c are heavies,  d and e are larges and f is small</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know you were mostly referencing commercial airplanes, but there're lots of planes which have been engineered to within an inch of their lives specifically so that turbulence is no worse for them than <a href="https://youtu.be/XyHBiZKyk1w?t=29" target="_blank">rapidly descending while spinning <em>while inverted</em></a>. That's a Pitts Special performing a 'headbanger'.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Eurofighter Typhoon was engineered in such a way that it could be thrown around like nobody's business without any of these stresses exceeding the capabilities of the plane's bodywork.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An opportunity to climb on my soapbox....</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By far the most significant hazard associated with atmospheric turbulence in commercial aviation is the risk of injury to passengers who are unsecured. <a href="https://www.faa.gov/travelers/fly_safe/turbulence/" target="_blank">Turbulence is the leading cause of injury in non-fatal aircraft accidents in the United States.</a> About two thirds of those injuries are suffered by flight attendants rather than paying customers. Turbulence-induced accelerations can, in some cases, cause momentary negative g-loading, i.e. the top of the aircraft becomes &quot;down&quot; and people and objects fall upward - and then down again a moment later. This is why it's vital to stay buckled in your seat unless absolutely necessary, and to keep luggage stowed in the bins or under the seat in front of you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Infants and children under two without their own seats - lap children - get injured in turbulence events at an alarming rate. Requiring that infants get their own seat and safety restraints has been a top issue for aviation safety agencies (NTSB) but regulators haven't implemented the rule. The FAA, who both regulates and promotes aviation, seem to think fewer people would travel if the lap child rule were eliminated. </p>
<p>A 30lb child, jerked forward in a 3G event suddenly seems to weigh 90lbs and the vast majority of adults cannot hold them in their arms. The kids sustain injuries when they slam into bins, seatbacks, bulkheads and other passengers. They often land several rows away, adding to panic in evacuation situations. </p>
<p>You are not buying an &quot;extra&quot; seat for your infant or child. You are buying a <em>safe</em> seat, just as you did for your car. Use a certified car seat. Use the CARES harness. Protect your child. </p>
<p>I'll go put away my soapbox now.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If we do have to fly with him, I'll be getting one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't you guys have infant belts in the US? I've only flown intra-europe with young children, but they always gave us a sort of second seat belt that clips onto ours. It's obviously not as having them in a car seat next to you, but it will definitely stop them flying around the cabin</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember using them in Australia and Europe on an around the world trip 14 years ago with a one year old and the US didn't have them. They just had an extra big seatbelt that went around you both which was obviously more dangerous.</p>
<p>You would think they would have them by now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because there's a huge difference between traveling in a car and an aircraft. A &quot;severe&quot; turbulence incident in an aircraft might be 1.5g to 2g, a fairly low speed crash in a car at 30mph produces 30g.  The provided children's lap belt is more than capable of safely restraining a child in a 2g bump and even unrestrained the potential for serious injury is literally orders of magnitude lower. That said, passengers are reminded to keep their seatbelts fastened at all times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another addition to this answer might be windshears (rapid change in wind direction and speed) and microbursts (small-scale intense downdraft caused by thunderstorms e.g.).
If those are encountered at low altitudes (especially before the landing when the plane is slow and the engines are idling) they are able to significantly reduce the lift of the plane and cause a crash.</p>
<p>Several planes have crashed because of those phenomenona and pilots are actively trained on how to act in such situations.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how well this fits the question. It was probably aiming more towards structural damage due to turbulence mid air, but I thought it might be an interesting addition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Compared to turbulence at altitude, low level windshear (LLWS) is responsible for far more fatal accidents. The biggest danger with turbulence at altitude is injury to passengers and cabin crew who are not wearing seatbelts. The airplane is strong and can take the beating, passengers are delicate.</p></div>		</li>
