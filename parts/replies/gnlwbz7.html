<p>I have over 1400 hours in that game now. Though there is large chunks of that where I was playing and just fell asleep... And I'm not sure how to remove that time that I wasn't ACTUALLY playing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally speaking you might be correct, but in this specific instance it's been announced by multiple government entities that generation failures due to insufficient winterization are the primary cause of the outages.</p>
<p>Texas runs its own power system, and the generation side is deregulated to the point that winterization procedures are suggested but not required...and since staying prepared for a once-a-decade ice storm would be costly, the generator operating entities choose to roll the dice.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;Bah, useless red-tape!&quot;</p>
<p>The sad part is this will be turned around by the same residents as saying &quot;government is useless!&quot; Well yeah, you invoked a self-fulfilling prophecy by <em>dooming it to failure</em>.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's kind of hard to understand until you see it, but ice is actually very heavy.  A cubic meter of ice weighs just shy of a metric ton, close to a short ton (2000 pounds), and you can get ice of similar volume clinging to every single surface.  Wires have a lot of surface area when you get down to it, and under the right conditions it can end up being heavier than the very thing it's clinging to.  While these cables are suspended with rather sturdy mounts, they're not designed to hold 2, 3, 4 times their weight or more, and depending on the conditions it can ramp up fast.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Throw in high winds, branches collapsing onto the lines, or just a lot of moisture over a large period of time, and the design limits of the mounts end up being exceeded.  The cable may not snap as well, which heavily complicates fixing the problem if a mount fails instead of the cable itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ice forms on the lines and builds up adding a lot of weight, then the attachment points fail and the lines come down.</p>
<p>Happens a fair bit up North, and the lines are built more sturdy because of it.</p>
<p>Contraction doesn't have that much of an effect because lines droop between poles.</p>
<p>Edit:
Additions from comments,</p>
<p>1.) Contraction can cause an issue at end poles or towers.</p>
<p>2.) The ice can act as a sail making wind even more of a stressor.</p>
<p>3.) Branches often get weighed down by ice and break off, those hit powerlines and break them.</p></div>		</li>
