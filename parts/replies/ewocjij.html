			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for this, I'm trying to use melatonin now to get used to my new shift. I worked 10am - 7pm for a year and all of a sudden I'm having to work 7am - 6pm. I've been using melatonin around 9pm and fall asleep at around 10, but I wanna get to bed at 9pm. I'll try cutting the pill, I've been taking 10mg.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Try microdosing. Like 0.1-0.5mg, it works better than higher doses for some reason. I vividly remember reading this in a study somewhere but I'm slacking at work right now and its risky even to write this comment let alone dig for sources</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if that even qualifies as microdosing. Most of the research on melatonin is done on much smaller doses than what it is sold in. </p>
<p><a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/07/10/melatonin-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/" target="_blank">Slatestar codex</a> suggests 0.3 mg for the elderly and maybe up to 1 mg for young people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also to add, melatonin taken orally is most effective at very small doses, like 0.1-0.5mg. those 5mg chewables are too much, better to bite a bit off one than take a whole one as research has shown high levels of melatonin to be counter-productive at worst and ineffective at best</p>
<p>I've confirmed this anecdotally, tiny bits of melatonin make me more likely to stay asleep while bigger doses I invariably wake up 1.5 or 3 hours after taking and am unable to fall back asleep easily afterwards. It's important to take it when you go to bed as it'll peak after 15-30 mins or so and you definitely wanna be mentally and physically ready to sleep by then as melatonin doesn't prevent rumination, which is one of the biggest reasons people have issues getting to sleep</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, I mentioned that above. The over the counter stuff is way too strong.  Take 1/3rd to 1/4 the dose instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh. My dad takes melatonin to urge him towards sleep, but he doesn’t take it as part of a schedule iirc, just an hour or so before he’d like to go to bed on that particular day. </p>
<p>I don’t imagining it’s doing much.</p></div>		</li>
