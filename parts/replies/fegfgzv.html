			<div class="markdown"><p>A positive inflation is also helpful because it lowers borrowing costs of the government. </p>
<p>To deepdive on the Japan example:
Japan has increased productivity per head that is in the working population. But because the workforce is shrinking and spending as a ratio to income is low Vs saving, deflation is happening.
Normally that would be a huge problem coupled with Japan's high debt-to-gdp ratio. But Japan's debt is owned by its own elderly population. So it is less of a problem for Japan's than for instance, it was for Greece.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The period of time is known as the lost score (20 years). During this time they saw high unemployment and decreased real wages to their workers. The economy stagnated and they could not fix it until the early 2010's when they took drastic monetary policy actions to get out of deflation.</p>
<p>They basically had what the US had in 2008 except it happened in the early 90's and they didn't recover until relatively recently. GDP has nothing to do with it. The US GDP was the largest in the world in 2008. Doesn't mean the US wasn't looking at a huge economic cliff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Inflation is also good for normal people because it depreciates the value of their debt. So a 30 year mortgage doesn't increase in its dollar amount over 30 years, but the mortgage's real value goes down even as the real value of the property increases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand what you're getting at, but (expected) inflation rates are taken into account when mortgage rates are calculated, so there's really no net benefit to a homeowner's mortgage losing value due to inflation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're built into the interest rate, not the actual loan balances. There is a net gain for the homeowner in the sense that the 3.8% interest rate they're paying is actually more like 1.8% taking inflation into account (ballparking numbers here, don't quote me on them). If you think about it from that perspective, that is a ridiculously good rate to pay on a loan in general.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it does when comparing the monthly mortgage payment to what the cost of renting that same property would be over the years.</p>
<p>Where mortgages get you is that they front load the interest payments so instead of paying an APR you are only making a small dent in the principal for the first decade or so of the term. So the bank gets their money even if you decide to sell or wait out the inflation</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but no.</p>
<p>So a loan does take inflation at the time of the transaction into account, but inflation is still beneficial.</p>
<p>Lets imagine that inflation goes up after the loan is made. This is the best case scenario as now the true value of the debt has decreased and your income is likely increasing in real terms. You also begin to have access to additional home equity as property values increase which can be leveraged into lower future interest rates and better credit.</p>
<p>What if inflation goes down slightly? This must be bad right? Probably not, although a loan is legally binding for the term, you almost always can refinance. The bank is locked in, but you are not necessarily. Refinancing allows homeowners to take advantage of lower interest rates but still avoid higher rates.</p>
<p>What if inflation doesnt change? Arguably, you are no worse off. There may still be some benefit because people are not typically logical with money. Inflation increases the interest you are paying on the mortgage but also increases the property value. So you end up with more equity in your home. For most people, if they had a lower interest rate they would not put additional money into their loan, instead they would likely spend it. Inflation in this way acts to increase saving which is good for long term financial stability.</p>
<p>Now, what if inflation turns to deflation? This could be like your typical market crash. For some people this is terrible, as refinancing likely wont help when you lose your job. However, even during a severe recession the majority of people still stay employed, and can take some marginal advantage of drops on prices. If you have already built equity in your home, chances are that you can make it through and come out the other side potentially better off than others.</p></div>		</li>
