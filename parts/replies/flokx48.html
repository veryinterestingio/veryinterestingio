			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, to add: by definition of the symptoms, &quot;the common cold&quot; is confined to the upper respiratory tract. It only affects the mouth, nose, and throat. There is no involvement of the lungs. So while the symptoms of a cold may make you miserable, they are not life-threatening and do not require (by and large) medical intervention.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I have gathered, the pneumonia caused by viruses like Covid-19 is caused by an immune reaction called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine_release_syndrome" target="_blank">cytokine storm</a>, where your immune system goes off the rails and causes massive inflammation in the lungs. This is one of the reasons why these infections affect certain age groups differently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, this is because many of the viruses that make up the cold are human viruses. A virus doesnt set out to kill the host, it only wants to spread, killing the host means that there is one less host in the world. Ideal virus on slightly disables you (a stuffy nose and a cough/sneezing) and is very transmissible. Viruses that kill humans almost always are zoonotic in origin as that virus is geared to be non fatal to that animal not to us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have any sources or articles about this? That’s fascinating to think about how it not being “for” our species is what can cause worse symptoms than a human only virus. Makes sense though if both SARS and COVID19 are coronaviruses that are deadly but zoonotic while the cold can be also caused by coronaviruses but human specific ones and not even close to as deadly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this mean that, over time, as the virus mutates, it should become less deadly? As this will increase its chances of spreading?</p>
<p>Also, if I remember correctly, the opposite happened with the Spanish flu. I believe this virus became more deadly during the second wave as it mutated</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lots of viruses mutate slowly enough, and present in a way such that the human immune system retains immunity for life after encountering the causative virus once. For the purposes of the virus therefore, that person is as good as dead - they can't be infected or pass the virus on in any significant way.</p>
<p>A virus that kills its host after the host has infected other people is going to persist and spread. There is no inherent selection pressure for SARS-nCoV-2 to become less harmful because it can spread perfectly fine. </p>
<p>The selection pressure will come because of the human response in the form of quarantine and social distancing trying to stop everyone becoming infected simultaneously. If the virus were already endemic in humans like cold viruses only a small proportion could be getting sick at the same time, there'd be no danger to health systems, and we wouldn't be instigating those protocols.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct.  A vaccine to an infectious disease tricks your immune system into thinking it is being attacked by a virus and so it develops protection against that virus.  If/when the real virus tries to infect, the immune system is prepared.</p>
<p>If you are already infected, the body is in already in full gear.  No more time to prepare.  So a vaccine is useless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth clarifying that having a virus in your system isn't quite the same as having the disease which that virus causes. I think we (i.e. non-medical people) refer to both of those as someone being infected, but they're not always equivalent.</p>
<p>I think for certain viruses, if you are exposed to it there is a window of time where the vaccine for that virus will still help you. There is with rabies, at least, but I've also heard that the flu vaccine takes too long. So it might not be true for all vaccines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, I'm told the story goes that Edward Jenner noticed milkmaids got cowpox and didn't get smallpox, so injected a child with cowpox, then tried to give him smallpox. The child didn't die, so Jenner gave him a house.  </p>
<p>Is there a &quot;&quot;cowpox analogue&quot;&quot; to SARS-CoV-2 in this scenario? Would it be low-hanging fruit, or is this the sort of thing that'd be hard to find because the virus is too novel? Would capsid components be more suitable antigens?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I was under the impression that sometimes you are given a vaccine anyways? Years ago, as a child, I stepped on a nail, and at the walk-in they gave me a tetanus shot (I wasn't sick, so it's not quite what my question asked, but I found it weird even then since either I had already been exposed, or I hadn't). I also thought that sometimes you're given the flu shot when already sick, for example. Is this a thing, or am I totally misunderstanding?</p></div>		</li>
