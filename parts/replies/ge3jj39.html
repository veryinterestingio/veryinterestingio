			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually silicon can go up to 20-30 GHz easily. The main reason is the heat dissipation as the small, dense area is so easy to heat up. So they made intentionally slower. You can increase speed by doing overclock but you need a cooling system such as liquid nitrogen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Silicon transistor gain drops as frequency increases and approaches unity at 20 GHz so there really isn’t very many practical applications.</p>
<p>Heat is definitely a big problem. What I’m getting at is the fundamental properties of silicon as a semiconductor compared to other semiconductor materials which are chosen for high frequency applications where silicon just won’t work due to its relatively low frequency response.</p></div>		</li>
