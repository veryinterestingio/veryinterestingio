			<div class="markdown"><p>We have tried. You can find a number of experiments, but simulating to a full extend is very complex and up untill now unsuccesful. We know so little of the circumstances and factors of influence and the mechanisms involved. It remains one of the biggest challenges in science in my opinion.</p></div>		</li>

Basically they simulated early earth conditions in a tube for a while and found amino acids at the end. Presumably DNA and RNA would form eventually.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Miller-Urey experiment is no longer relevant to abiogenesis studies. The atmosphere he used (reducing gases) has been shown not to be what was the likely atmosphere (nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and water vapor). Zapping N, CO2 and water doesn’t produce any of the amino acids Miller found. Even if RNA was formed, it’s incredibly fragile and would likely not have survived long enough to do much of anything, let alone forming specific sequences of RNA that did something - there are a myriad of possible connections the nucleotides could make that aren’t the normal 5’-3’ attachments without the protein machinery that form them today. Also of note, ribonucleic acids cannot form in the nitrogen rich environment that’s thought to have existed. The nitrogenous bases (A,C,U, and G) do not attach to ribose sugars. There’s also the chicken-and-egg situation of protein and DNA. In order to make functional proteins, you need specific sequences of DNA. But in order to replicate DNA, you need very specific proteins. So what came first? Assuming they both just HAPPENED to be in the same places at the same time - specific DNA sequences that code for RNA sequences (which require even more proteins to produce) as well as the ribosomal proteins needed to synthesize proteins from RNA is probabilistically impossible, or rather so low that it is insane to believe it occurred without any outside intervention. Decades of research and understanding into what DNA and RNA are and do do nothing but make it more and more impossible for it to occur by “chance.”</p></div>		</li>

Nick Lane is a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39001.Power_Sex_Suicide" target="_blank">popular science author</a> who has written on the subject and is currently doing research at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/departments/gee/staff/tabs/academic-iris-link/lane" target="_blank">University College London</a>. If you are curious he is a good mix of actual science conveyed by a person who knows how to communicate effectively. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find the way RNA and nucleotides are so central to all of life to be pretty compelling evidence for the RNA world hypothesis. RNA is involved in every level of protein synthesis: mRNA splicing and processing, binding amino acids, actually carrying out the polymerization reaction to make proteins in the ribosome, arranging the ribosome itself. Nucleotides are the basis for energy transfer throughout the cell as ATP. cAMP regulates basic singaling processes in every cell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've even read that lipid based cells originated spontaneously and formed vessels for things like RNA development to take place in a protected environment.  I've also read that clays are theorized to serve a similar purpose.</p>
