			<div class="markdown"><p>I think he meant in terms of seeing something coming directly at your head. If you're looking at, say, a rock that's coming your way, you'll be able to tell much more easily if it's coming at your head, then you would be able to tell if it's going to hit your hand. Similarly, if you had eyes on your stomach, it would be easier to tell something is coming directly at your stomach, but you would have it harder to tell if it's going to hit your head. That's not to say you don't know where your extremities are, but only the head has an effective distance threat detection system.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, my point is that that isn't true. Humans are highly capable of estimating impacts near their body. Thats why it wouldn't matter if it came right at your face (btw objects that come straight at your eyes are almost impossible to estimate the distance and velocity off, our 3d vision works much better when an object comes at our body at an angle) because it's not easier to dodge it then.</p></div>		</li>
