			<div class="markdown"><p>To really appreciate the complexity of driving, teach someone to drive. I taught both of my sons and my niece.</p>
<p>Control the car: start the car, speed up, slow down, turn, stop. Small movements of the steering wheel and brake. Negotiate roads and lanes. Accept there’s oncoming traffic just inches away. Merge into traffic moving at speed. Build the arm/hand strength to control the car for hours at a time.</p>
<p>Now take it up a notch. Rules of the road, and driving defensively. How to deal with the idiot swerving between lanes as they eat, text, put on makeup. What are other cars/drivers likely to do? Read their intentions and adjust accordingly. Complex intersections, highway interchanges, multi-lane roundabouts. Planning so you’re in the correct lane when it’s time to turn or exit.</p>
<p>I took my sons and niece on cross-country toad trips lasting 2+ weeks when they were 15 and newly licensed. They did about half the driving, about 3,000 miles (Seattle to East Coast and back), initially on interstates on the outbound leg, and US highways and rural roads on the return leg.</p>
<p>They also learned how enormous the US is, and how much is “empty” - either farmland or undeveloped. And how much land is dedicated to growing corn and soybeans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fantastic. Teaching another person to do anything will show you how difficult it really is. My parents and me drive during a long road trip when I was newly licensed and it was the best possible thing for my driving combined with making the daily commute from my suburb to a summer camp in an urban area around the same time. Having to learn how to navigate so many freeways was super helpful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the things described here become muscle memory with some experience, without much active input, shifting gears, holding the lane, </p>
<p>But I do agree that's it quite a strain on your brain because you have to pick up and analyze a lot of details for potential danger</p></div>		</li>
