			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve read statements from people who were born blind that they still “see“ things in their dreams, despite never having experienced sight in the waking world.<br />
Honestly, this makes sense. If somebody is blind because of a physical issue with the eyes themselves, or the connection to the brain, but the wiring in the brain for visual processing is all intact, it could still be stimulated.<br />
I’ve heard of hallucinatory drugs doing the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to dream in just sounds and other impressions. Not even black, really, just no visual aspect. Then one day I dreamed with images. Dunno what the trigger to start doing that was. </p>
<p>I don't know the actual answer to your question, but I'd be very surprised if someone who has never used their eyes had dreams containing visuals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People forget there's more to experiencing life than just sight, sound, etc. You could have a nonvisual dream but still experience a &quot;storyline&quot; so to speak. You could feel the presence of your family nearby or the warmth of the sun or maybe feel like you're on the moon or melting. It's like playing a video game that you know the backstory too, you're aware of the elements involved</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's some basis in therapies, such as emdr, where in response to a traumatic memory, the person is queued to move their eyes similar to REM eye movement to process the memory and move it out of the frozen traumatic experience state. This supports the idea that REM eye movement is for actively processing memories.</p></div>		</li>
