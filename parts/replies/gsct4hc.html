			<div class="markdown"><p>The other commenters here are correct, but I’d like to add that if you’re working with heavily used and/or large surfaces like the kitchen floor of a restaurant, it’s best to use a brush to scrub the floor with the soapy water and use the mop to get up the water. For your kitchen or living room floor at home, just using the mop with soapy water is usually enough unless you have some stuck on residue. Some mop buckets also have two compartments: one that you fill with soapy water, and one that catches the water you squeeze out of the mop. This allows you keep dipping the mop head into the clean water without getting it to dirty, which means you can clean one or two more rooms without having to replace your soapy water.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Once we swept up the big pieces and were ready to mop it down we would first use the mop to spread the water and cleaning solution all over the floor.  Then we’d go back and use the mop head to pick up all the dirty water from the floor back into the bucket.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You do - sorta. </p>
<p>wet mop, agitate floor, rinse mop, *squeeze/dry mop* (important step), agitate floor again, this time absorbing more than you put down.  If you don't dry the mop head between a cleaning and 'drying' phase, you're just putting dirty water back down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You definitely rinse the mop every time.</p>
<p>1) wet mop</p>
<p>2) mop floor</p>
<p>3) wet mop</p>
<p>4) squeeze water out of mop</p>
<p>Repeat until the water is brownish.</p>
<p>The water carries the dirt; so squeezing water out of the mop after rinsing it helps remove excess dirty water from the mop and reduces the amount of dirt you put back on the floor.</p></div>		</li>
