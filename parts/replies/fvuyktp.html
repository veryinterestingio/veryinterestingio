That included a traditional documentary, and if you check it out, you'll see some of our footage. This part of the project was always intended to be a series aimed to reach a younger, YouTube audience.</p>
<p>Also, there wasn't just one narrative storyline to follow; we wanted to profile a bunch of different stories -- covering both the science and the &quot;life&quot; of living in Antarctica. That's why it is shorter episodes. The idea being that across the series, you'll get real insight into what research and living down there is like.</p>
<p>The environment was a pleasure to film -- not as visually austere as you'd imagine. The terrain was fantastically varied and interesting.</p>

<p>You'll see it is quite a different thing -- but also awesome</p>
