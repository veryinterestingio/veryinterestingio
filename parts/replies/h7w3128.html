			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know if I’m an anatomic anomaly, but the stream of water seems to be so targeted that it never extends past my perineum. It’s like really…precise. My bidet has both a “front” and “back” setting and you can adjust where the stream hits. But it’s never even been close to an issue for me! I love my bidet so much I get grumpy when I’m traveling and have to wipe. If pooping is a game, bidets are a game changer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I give my butt hole a really good spray. Once I feel certain I've got all the poop off, I lean forward and spray the front hole area. I've had a bidet for over a year now and no issues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you set the sprayer up right, the water doesn't fly up your vulva unless you want it to. I have a 2 part-er, a jet for back and one for front. They definitely hit different areas. And if you shift weird and something goes sideways, you can always use the front to clean up. Also super helpful for that messy time of the month.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i get so sick of hopping in and out of the shower constantly when i'm on my period and it never even occurred to me (as a UK resident where bidets are not a common house feature at all) that this might be a good solution. guess i'll be doing some online shopping today</p></div>		</li>
