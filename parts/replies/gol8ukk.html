			<div class="markdown"><p>I can answer a bit, I think it really depends if the government is actually diverting a decent amount of taxes towards the socialized healthcare, or not. However, despite the fact that the UK government starve the National Health Service of funds, it still has lower average wait times in accident and emergency than the average wait times in American emergency rooms- of course that isn't universal across America, and different insurance providers have different levels of ethical conduct, but at the end of the day when you monetize health, you create an environment in which it is beneficial financially for hospitals to attempt to sell you things you don't need, etc. Pandemic wise I do not know- but I do know that America has the most absolutely horrific infant mortality and morbidity rate, the worst in the developed world, in fact worse than some third world countries, is appalling. And that's not least to do with the fact that pushing for further birth interventions while people are in labour makes more money for hospitals. A Caesarean makes a lot more money than a vaginal birth with gas&amp;air. Hospitals also have a practice of advertising that they will support you with a vaginal birth, and then actually pressuring you and outright assaulting you into interventions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, there are not significant studies that delineate public health care systems versus those without and performance around COVID. The more prevailing issue is whether countries chose to recognize COVID early to reduce spread. However, this would be an interesting study to evaluate. - Fatima Cody Stanford, MD, MPH, MPA</p></div>		</li>
