			<div class="markdown"><p>Parietal cells in the stomach lining undertake a whole bunch of reactions using starting chemicals that aren't dangerously acidic by themselves, then secrete those into the stomach through little mucus-lined ducts. There's really no simplying it past that point. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_acid#Secretion" target="_blank">Here</a>'s a more in-depth look at the process, if you're interested.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're 100% bullshit. I feel like whoever came up with alkaline water, realized that so many body fluids are slightly acidic (skin, spit, sweat, and vaginal discharge are just a few examples), and instead of seeing that and going &quot;ah, I see. Our bodies work best at a slightly acidic ph&quot; they decide it's something that needs fixing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>not a scientist, but yeah your body does a really good job of maintaining a proper ph level. The base in alkaline water is immediately neutralized when it makes it to your stomach. However, unless you’re  doing something stupid, it’s very unlikely to actually harm you for the same reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah anything that claims to be able to change the pH of any of your internal bits (and claims that that is a good thing) is always bunk. unless it’s coming from your doctor, doctors typically know what they’re talking about. </p>
<p>every body system operates within a specific pH range, because that’s the range where the chemical reactions necessary for the functions of the cells in that system can take place. if the pH gets too high or too low, that system won’t be able to function properly. so, unless there’s legitimately a dysfunction in one of those systems, attempting to change their pH will produce a neutral effect at best and a negative effect at worst.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>once the food+acid mix passes a part of the stomach called the &quot;pylorus&quot; (think of it as the &quot;gate&quot; that connects the stomach and the next section of the small intestine, the &quot;duodenum&quot; the pancreas releases bicarbonate as well as bunch of digestive enzymes (a bunch of fancy proteins). Feel free to ask any more questions if that wasn't explained well enough.</p></div>		</li>
