			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh. I don't know the answer, but reading these comments and then seeing 'vacuum' now has me wondering if that word is related to 'cwm', as a vacuum is a void of sorts, and a cwm is a valley, which is a type of void as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vacuum comes from vacuus (latin), cwm comes from Welsh. I don't really know the connection between Welsh and latin, but I don't think vacuum and cwm are related.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Welsh and Latin are both Indo-European languages but really are only related insofar as having proto-Indo-European as a common ancestor. </p>
<p>Welsh <em>does</em> have a lot of words of ecclesiastical Latin origin and also English words of Latin origin that were both absorbed into the language later. So there can be some Latin “false friends” in Welsh. </p>
<p>Cwm is from Proto-Celtic and is cognate with the Latin word Incumbere.</p></div>		</li>
