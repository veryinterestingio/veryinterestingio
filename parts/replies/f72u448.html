			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn’t true.</p>
<p>Having something pressing against the nerve or stimulating it hurts. Damaged and crushed nerves always hurt. But having it cut just makes it go numb.</p>
<p>Source: Had a major back disc blow out where a piece of cartilage was forced into the sciatic nerve. The entire time it was there it hurt like a bitch. Had surgery in which they had to cut some nerve to remove it. Woke up with zero nerve pain, but couldn’t feel three toes and parts of lower leg. Over years of physical therapy regained feeling in leg and one and a half toes with zero <em>nerve</em> pain (lots of muscle pain due primarily to weird work outs and muscles readjusting when they weren’t firing smoothly - but none of the electric pain of a damaged nerve).</p>
<p>Still can’t feel one and a half toes, but at least it doesn’t hurt every waking moment.</p>
<p>I know there is phantom limb syndrome and that nerves are weird and different people have different paths to recovery so I won’t say my story is universal. But it is the path the doctors predicted for me - which makes me think it is the more common outcome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you have surgery to sever a nerve to reduce pain, the surgeon is doing it in a way to minimize the chance of post-surgery nerve pain, for example putting a cap on the nerve so it doesn’t try to regrow. This is different from an injury (including surgery injuries) where the surgeon can’t or doesn’t  minimize the chance of post-injury nerve pain and painful neuromas develop as the nerve tries to repair itself but does a poor job. Suffice to say, your experience with getting surgery for nerve pain does not apply to someone who has lost a limb or experienced injury to a nerve.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s actually about 2.5 mm/day, or about 6 inches in a 60 day period depending on the size of the axon. The only problem is that after about 60 days, if the axon hasn’t reached the tissue it’s supposed to innervate, the structures on the tissue that allow it to be innervated become unusable and that’s all she wrote. Doesn’t matter if the axon eventually reaches its target.</p>
