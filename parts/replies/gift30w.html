			<div class="markdown"><p>Great summary and explanation, thanks.</p>
<p>Could I ask you about the validity of IQ studies across cultures and ethnic backgrounds?</p>
<p>I know there is controversy in this subject and understand if it’s not worth getting into as I really don’t want this thread to devolve into anything bigoted.</p>
<p>I have just heard some racist arguments based on IQ studies and am not sure if the variations are just due to different education opportunities, measures that are more suited to the cultures they were developed in, dated studies...</p>
<p>As you say, someone’s IQ has nothing to do with their value as a person, so hopefully there are good ways to counter such scary arguments.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IQ tests generally shouldn't be used in populations in which they have not been validated. Sometimes items on tests don't translate well (literally and figuratively). This goes for any psychometric test, not just IQ.</p>
<p>As for the rest of your comment, I'd rather not get into that in much depth. I am only saying anything because I am worried that silence might be interpreted as agreement with the racists. It's a minefield. I spent about 30 minutes typing and deleting and typing again trying to find a decent answer. It's a place where the science simply isn't being done (well) because the only people willing to do it are fairly racist, or are at least comfortable-ish with other people thinking that they're racist. Some researchers have suggested a complete moratorium on research in that area on the grounds that it can't produce worthwhile fruit (I think that's a bad idea since then the racists will say &quot;the only reason they aren't looking is because we're right.&quot;). There are very good reasons to believe that racial differences are not innate but are probably due to environmental and societal causes, however there is little research to &quot;prove&quot; this (1) because doing such studies would require data that might not even exist and (2) because, again, a good number of the people publishing in that specific area are racist, or racist adjacent, and other researchers would really rather not get tarnished by participating in that area of study. Not everyone who has published in that arena is racist, but it's toxic enough that getting good, honest people to give a serious scientific go at this question is borderline impossible.</p>
<p>I can't emphasize this enough though: if you are saying that someone is less than someone else on the basis of their intelligence, you're just wrong. That goes for if you're comparing within a race or between races. A person's worth has jack-shit to do with their intelligence. Frankly, you can take out the intelligence bit, if you're saying one person is more valuable as a human being than another, you're wrong. (I know you weren't suggesting that, but I really just need to be clear on that).</p>
<p>Edit: One hypothesis, but currently it is mostly just a hypothesis, is that whatever is causing the Flynn effect might be causing ethnic/racial differences. Whatever that is, it's probably environmental and probably changeable. There's a good chance it's related to things like education, particularly parental education, and if you have whole segments of the population who are systematically deprived of those educational opportunities, you're going to wind up with differences between groups. To be clear, this isn't a proven theory, but it tends to be the explanation I would favor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, really appreciate your answer and will likely use the 1st line of your answer to my argument along with your last point.</p>
<p>I get this was a loaded question and I hesitated to ask it. But I have a brother who keeps bringing this up along with some Steven Pinker quotes around Nature vs. Nurture theories... having researched the issue, I couldn’t find much so saw here an opportunity to ask.</p>
<p>You’ve explained the issue well and I hope this doesn’t bring on further debate on the matter in this thread.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Holy shit. To do the <em>science</em> you have to be comfortable with people thinking you're racist. Jesus Christ, I don't think I've ever encountered such an idea before. </p>
<p>I need to get some books and look further into this, if possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you say ‘intelligence’ ‘smart’ and ‘dumb’ - do these tests generally cover the gambit of different types of intelligence? My little sisters IQ is higher than mine-she’s a scientist who works with genetics, and I’m a fairly successful creative (painter/animator/musician).  We are both in awe sometimes at one another’s strengths, with them being so different.  She would also agree that I have more interpersonal intelligence.  Would these other strengths show up on an IQ test?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>PhD psychometrician here. Pretty much every exam, including IQ tests, are biased in some way. People coming from a similar cultural background as those who developed the exam typically have an advantage. Sometimes, there is bias based on gender too.</p>
<p>In psychometrics, this bias is called differential item functioning (DIF). Some researchers do DIF studies to identify questions that are biased, so they can be revised or deleted. But in reality, developing an exam is very costly and time consuming that people just dont have resources to spend much time thinking about DIF. Rather, it's more practical to just try to not write biased items in the first place, but that is difficult too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shouldn't people's scores be only compared inside groups that have similar cultural backgrounds? How fair is it to compare 2 people who are today aged 20 years, scored 100, but one comes from Switzerland and another a girl from South Sudan ?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The good way to counter such a scary argument is to get firm in the belief that a person’s value is inherent, and not a function of their utility.  </p>
<p>Basically if you can’t formulate the argument in terms of one race having average IQ lower than another, frame the argument on whether it’s okay to pick on mentally challenged people, and why or why not.  </p>
<p>If it‘s not okay to look down on your grandmother, whose cognitive performance has dropped to toddler levels in her end of life dementia, then it’s not okay to look down on a man from another race, who based on averages might have a slightly greater than 50% chance of being lower IQ than you.  </p>
<p>Basically the racist argument is (I’m guessing) based on the finding that average black IQ is a few points under average white IQ. So to really identify the principle in place, replace that dude whose racial predictor says he’s a few points lower than you, with someone whose intelligence is <em>ridiculously</em> lower than yours.  </p>
<p>There are a few arguments against it, but two of them are poor arguments because they reinforce the frame. The two bad arguments are:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Asians are higher than whites so you can drop this nugget on any white supremacists who are using IQ for racist arguments. But this misses the point.  </li>
<li>Distributions overlap, so any moron who thinks he’s smarter than anyone of that other race is likely to bet wrong pretty often. But this argument also misses the point.  </li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>good</em> argument is the one you can make that your grandmother, who is barely aware of her surroundings and cannot recognize her family members, retains her full value as a human being. How? Why is this feeble lump of flesh a full human, despite not being able to bench even the bar let alone any plates?  </p>
<p>If you can answer that question, you’ve found the basis on which you can take any racist IQ argument apart. Any bigoted and hateful argument at all, really. Anything dehumanizing.  </p>
<p>The first two arguments are hacking at the leaves, the last is pulling out the root once and for all.</p></div>		</li>

<p>*White. Not even really a usable nugget, many know that East Asians score higher and use it for the non-dilution argument. e.g Every group should have their own lands.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well said. I know many smart losers and I've seen complete knuckle dragging morons succeed because of their persistence.</p>
<p>But I HATE when people get uptight over the IQ stuff because it does correlate with certain things AND IT MATTERS in alot of cases. It matters. Your surgeon likely has a decent IQ. </p>
<p>Now you combine intelligence and persistence and you have yourself an unstoppable force.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a layperson, reading the wiki article on the Flynn Effect seems to suggest a lot of what you pointed out, and stuff that seems to make sense in some ways, but still raises questions in others.</p>
<p>For instance, you mentioned the Flynn Effect is referencing the increase in scoring on these tests. The wiki article also mentions that there is also a &quot;reverse Flynn effect&quot; happening in some other countries, most appear to be part of which we consider first world. It also sounds like in various populations, at various times, rises and decreases occurred, that are attempted to be tied to various criteria and ideas.</p>
<p>Some of the ideas and proposed reasons in this study do make a lot of sense when applied to certain populations or time periods for both increases and decreases in the average score.</p>
<p>But nothing in the wiki article answers a question I think is also important:</p>
<p>What relationship to the tested populations do the test creators have?</p>
<p>I see a ton of looking at environment and population factors in the wiki, but I don't see anywhere where they look at  the people who make these tests, and where THEY fit into the population that the tests are given to.</p>
<p>I ask because for a long time I've held that overall as humans, our innate intelligence builds on that of each previous generation. &quot;Shoulders of Giants&quot; and the like.</p>
<p>Each successive generation builds on the last, in some ways. Sometimes they go backwards in a generation, sometimes they go forwards in a generation. But on average they increase. So if the test creators are:</p>
<ol>
<li>part of the same population that routinely underwent IQ testing (and is part of the population that test is being formulated for, though older if these tests are usually given to children or similar)</li>
<li>continuously reading and learning about new studies other people did in their field</li>
<li>repeated and more frequent exposure to the testing population than average (if kids are the test takers, then having children, or working with a large amount of children over the years)</li>
</ol>
<p>It will all add up to create changes in the tests that will change the results. They don't even have to be a new generation, just keep up with the latest publications in their field, and learn how to avoid both the issues with the old tests, and new innovative ways to look at the new tests.</p>
<p>Do you know if there is anything written on this I can read or is this an idea that isn't mentioned because it was thought of and discarded as something not consequential?</p></div>		</li>
