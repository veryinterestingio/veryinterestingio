			<div class="markdown"><p>No mirror is perfect so in reality, the light would still go out. Plus the fact that if you're standing in that room, you absorb the light as well. But in theory, if you had a room of perfect mirrors that reflect all light and absorb none, the light would stay on forever. This is impossible to observe however, because as soon as you place anything in that room that absorbs light (a person, a camera...), it all gets absorbed in a fraction of a second. And because the light in said room is perfectly reflected, you'd see absolutely nothing, not even the mirrors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I assume you mean you also have a light in that room, a &quot;perfect light&quot; that isnt going to absorb the energy itself and melt, but the answer is yes.  Maybe not explode, maybe catch on fire, or evaporate, or all 3, something bad would happen to the pea.  After that your room would explode because light does have a tiny amount of momentum and therefore force</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a great photo of someone who lined a box entirely with mirrors and placed a camera in there with a timer and sealed the box (as well as can be sealed in a homebrew science experiment) and the outcome is crazy, it looks like prism.</p></div>		</li>
