<p>Fun Fact: People who are bone marrow recipients will always show donor DNA in their blood, even without blood donation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For bone marrow transplants, patients are susceptible to Graft versus Host disease (or GVHD). You've heard of people rejecting transplants because their body has an immune response to a kidney or something. Your bone marrow is the source of your immune cells, so if you got a bone marrow transplant, the donor bone marrow may now try to fight your host tissues. (Its like the reverse of transplant rejection).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For forensics, DNA testing is usually done with mouthswabs on victims or arrestees. So leukocyte transfusion wouldn't influence this. </p>
<p>Lets take another example: A burglar just had a leukocyte transfusion, and cut himself on a broken window and left a drop of blood on the crimescene. Police secure this with a swab and send it to the lab. Here it could theoretically give a mixed profile, and since you don't know who the burglar is yet, there wouldn't really be a protocol for this. If they catch him and make a mouthswab, they would compare the two profiles, with one being a mix, and calculate the odds of him being the perpetrator.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While we have you: do you have any opinion on Bane and the League of Shadows scheme in the movie The Dark Knight Rises? </p>
<p>They capture a nuclear scientist and fake his death by pumping some of his blood into a corpse and then crashing the plane the corpse is in. Would any of his blood have survived the fiery plane crash and if it did would investigators immediately think it was fishy that they find two distinct DNA profiles?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the blood survived the planecrash and you found two profiles, you'd probably just think it was blood/tissue from other survivors. Considering they might have crashed and splashed all over the place.</p>
<p>And in this case you'd probably take a DNA sample from something else than blood. Bone or muscle.</p>
<p>Another thing, when looking at profiles you also consider the peak heights in the electropherogram. If they only pumped 500ml of blood into the corpse (you can't drain him dry, obviously), the ratio would be about 1:10 in the two profiles (theoretically). Meaning the scientists profile isn't the obvious main profile in the electropherogram. Of course, calculations will be made, but considering the ratio, it would probably be pretty high in favour of not-the-scientist. And the body/limbs would be identified as the corpse. </p>
<p>In reality, they would investigate the passengerlist on the plane and get fx a toothbrush to help identify body/limbs for the funeral.</p>
<p>If the blood got burned up in the planecrash, I'd hope that you could find some DNA in the bones.</p>
<p>So would they ever find it fishy to find a mixed profile? Probably only if you knew the DNA came from an isolated bloodsample (DUI's for example). That would be weird. </p>
<p>I hope it was a satisfactory answer.</p></div>		</li>
