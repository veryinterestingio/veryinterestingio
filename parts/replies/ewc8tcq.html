			<div class="markdown"><p>And here I always thought it was because I was bored. The only time I ever pace while on a phone call is when I'm on one I don't want to be on, and even then usually only when I'm on hold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm the same even with people I know super well. I prefer texting any day.</p>
<p>Strangely enough I'm completely fine on discord talking to exactly the same people for hours on end, I even talk to strangers on discord too sometime. So my aversion to phone calls is entirely in my head I just can't seem to get rid of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ugh my wife does this. She calls me to tell me something that takes 15 second to explain and then it's 20 minutes later. I don't mind talking to my wife, I just fucking hate talking on the phone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's likely a secondary behaviour produced by stress and anxiety. If an animal (humans included) is frustrated, unsure or just plain nervous, secondary behaviours are often seen in different forms. Their purpose is thought to be stress relief.</p>
<p>Pacing, swallowing, and yawning are common in all mammals, canines might scratch themselves even if they're not itchy, felines can groom, bears can smack things around, to give a few examples. For humans the most commonly seen is likely foot tapping when you're sitting down.</p></div>		</li>
