			<div class="markdown"><p>The left ventricle does not get bigger.  If the left ventricle got bigger there would be less room for blood inside.  What it actually does in pump more efficiently.  I'm not 100% certain on the mechanics, but I believe it's related to the heart muscle's ability to stretch to allow for more blood to enter the ventricle and the resulting contraction will be more forceful.  This means that each beat will eject more blood into the systemic circulation.  It's why athletes have slower heart rates than most people.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So the ventricle gets...bigger. They didn't say the ventricular wall got thicker, but rather the cavity itself has more capacity</p></div>		</li>
