			<div class="markdown"><p>Fifteen months ago, I herniated my L4-L5 disc, for the third time.  This time though, part of the pulposes (nucleus) of the disc extruded out and fragments of it are on my spinal nerve.  After three days of sciatic pain that shot down my left leg, it started to abate.  BUT, I could tell something was wrong in my left foot.   It felt like I was walking on rocks and that feeling went across my foot, to my heel,  Like when you sock gets bunched up and you walk on it?  But worse.  It's been 15 months, and it has not gotten any better.  My doctor told me it will never get better.   I'm only 52, and so disheartened by this.  I cannot walk barefoot now, the pain is too bad.  Same for most shoes.  The ONLY shoes I can walk in and tolerate this terrible pain-sensation are these ugly ugly ugly CROCS flip-flops, because they are the only shoe with a lot of cushion.  I'm still a woman, so young, and I want to wear nice shoes, and I can't.  I'm not ready to give up my femininity for this, but I have to.  It hurts too much otherwise.  It's horrible.  So horrible,  Now I'm on a journey to lose some weight, hoping this herniation will never happen again.  They told me I need a multi-level spinal fusion.  Mom had that done, twice.  I DO NOT WANT IT.</p>

<p>Thanks for listening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hello, and thank you.  No, I've not considered it.  However, I did have a AmnioFix injection into my torn Achilles tendon, which I tore 11 months after some foot surgery.  The AmnioFix is made from amniotic fluid, taken from a mother who has just given birth.  It's used to help build tissue and do repairs in the body, like for my tendon.  I had to be put under to have it done.  It was a little invasive, but worked well.<br />
But I don't know about stem cell treatment for back injuries.  I will definitely be asking my doctor about this.  Thank you for the link, thank you SO much!!<br />
Also, a last thought:  FWIW, I am 52, and I'm in pretty good health.  I am clinically obese, but working on that right now with a keto diet.  My blood pressure is a little high, but I don't take meds for it.  When my dad was 52, the age I am now, he suffered from Cardiac Amyloidosis, caused by his exposure to Agent Orange in the Vietnam War while he was in the Marine Corp.  At 52, he had to have a heart transplant.  The day after the operation he woke up and said hello, he felt like he had new batteries put into him, and then he suffered a massive heart attack.  He lost oxygen to his brain and was in a progressive vegetative state almost three more years, before he died.  :-( So when I think of this, and how I'm at the age he was when everything went so damn wrong, some nerve damage in my foot, and the subsequent pain, seems so insignificant.  I'm working on losing weight, so I can have surgery on my other foot to remove a huge painful heel spur...  I'm doing this--I'm going to lose this weight!  I have no choice.   I know I can do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a very bad slipped disk 5 years ago.</p>
<p>Neurosurgeon performed emergency surgery because I couldn't walk anymore...</p>
<p>I could walk without crutches after approx 4 weeks.</p>
<p>Large parts of numb areas from the waist down are better now, but feet still problematic. </p>
<p>I have to wear crocs and flip-flops everywhere, I cannot stand to walk onto even a piece of gravel.</p>
<p>If I were to become 200 years old, my symptoms would probably go away, because nerves <em>do</em> repair themselves in many circumstances, but very slowly.</p>
<p>So I'm 53 and will never walk and feel like a normal person again ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. But everything is better than being bedridden and dependant on others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm so sorry to hear this happened to you!  I'm really happy to hear you are able to walk now, even if it isn't the same.  So you are another Crocs person?  I truly hate their shoes, but love them now as well, as they are the only ones I can wear.  I've literally been wearing the same pair of ugly Crocs flip flops now for about 2 years.  I started wearing them after I had surgery on my right foot.  I never expected I'd have to keep wearing them because of a ruptured disc.
I hope we both continue to heal in some way.</p></div>		</li>
