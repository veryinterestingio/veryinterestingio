<p>The next two Hydrogen isotopes will be just as hard to fuse as the last 2. This means the nuclear reactor has to fight FOREVER. The reaction does not self-sustain.</p>

<p>On the positive side, that's a great safety feature. If anything goes wrong the reaction stops immediately. The worst case is damage to the reactor components.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. That's why many of the newer models of fission reactors are also designed in such a way that something about the components naturally causes the reaction to stop. Some macro-scale mechanism that has to be constantly attended to have the reaction go, so you can have passive safety.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can shut down 100% of the fission sure, but this doesnt stop the heat generated by a fission reactor.   You still have megawatts of power generated after you scram the rods.  This is due to the short term decay products.</p>
<p>This is what caused the severe issues in Japan, not a run away fission reaction.   You need days of cooling on a fully shut down reactor.  The heat isn't like a fire, it has no maximum temperature.  It just puts out that amount of thermal energy until those decay products have hit enough half lives.  That's how you get meltdowns.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like haplo said here, all nuclear reactors are able to shut down if something happens. In particular, the control rods’ default position is to be 100% inserted; if the power plant lost power for whatever reason, these rods immediately go inside the reactor and suck up neutrons, preventing criticality from occurring. </p>
<p>Like haplo also mentioned, this doesn’t mean we are out of the frying pan. Really large reactors (think commercial reactors) have so much decay product, the heat alone from these products can lead to Fukushima if they aren’t cooled (hence why reactor need backup diesel generators if the lights were to go out). What Rapierian might be referring to here (and correct me if I am wrong) is that there are several modern reactor designs that combat this excess decay heat. One such design is present in micro and small modular reactors. These reactors are small enough that the heat generated by the decay products can be regulated by more passive systems, such as heat pipes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another major difference is that fusion involves temperatures so high that there are no known materials that you could contain the reaction in that wouldn't melt or vaporize. This means you have to use a powerful electromagnetic field to contain the plasma, which, with modern technology, requires more energy than you'd get out of nuclear fusion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>and the real problem is that you have to balance the plasma in the magnetic field. the plasma kind of bubbles so its inherently unstable and you need to re-ballance the magnetic field constantly to keep it in. there are projects that try to make the plasma behave predictably for instance the stellarator  Wendelstein 7-X  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendelstein_7-X" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendelstein\_7-X" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendelstein\_7-X</a></a></p></div>		</li>
