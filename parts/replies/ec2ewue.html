			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed, but still, that foot or so difference still makes a big impact. I know if I take a picture holding the phone normally vs at arms length my nose looks huge in comparison.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The selfie angle enhances the effect of your jawline. As well as accentuating a few other features we find desirable. </p>
<p>The focal distance is not a part of that. There are some photographers that have done videos on how to enhance your jawline when taking photos. Basically teaching you a bit of modeling 101 so you can apply it to your selfies or family photos. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes, because there's a slight fisheye effect, and the further away it is the less you see it. Holding the camera too close will make your nose look bigger and your face look fatter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually that's the ONLY factor. You are smart enough to realize this which is great. Ignore everyone telling about focal lengths being the culprit, its a big stupid myth, don't fall for it. Distance is what matters, focal length does not matter, no matter what anyone tries to tell you.</p>
<p>See, if that weren't true, then why is it that if you take multiple pictures on a tripod and you change focal lengths wildly, the perspective distortion doesn't change at all?!? Why is it that perspective ONLY CHANGES between the pictures once you introduce moving the camera closer or further away? But the perspective DID NOT CHANGE when you changed the focal length itself? That should tell ANY sensible human being that focal length is not what's responsible.</p>
<p>Look at it this way, if you add sugar (distance) to balance out the saltiness (focal length), would you say that the dish is sweet &quot;because of all the salt&quot;? No! Of course not. But that misunderstanding is what everyone around this thread is spreading.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iâ€™ve noticed that portrait mode tends to elongate your face in selfies. Depending on the shape of your face this might be good or bad. My face is a bit long so i usually only take selfies in landscape mode, and as far from my face as possible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is directly related to focal length. Shorter focal lengths require you to be closer to get the same frame than longer focal lengths. </p>
<p>Which he pretty much shows. If you take a 24mm focal length shot from the same distance away as the 400mm shot, you could crop it down to the same frame as the 400mm shot, but it would be extremely blurry. That's why you use the 400mm lens from that distance. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you change focal length and dont change distance, there will be absolutely zero difference in distortion of the subject. That should tell you right away that it has zero impact. It's <strong>distance</strong> that matters, not focal length.</p>
<p>Look at it this way, if you add sugar (distance) to balance out the saltiness (focal length), would you say that the dish is sweet &quot;because of all the salt&quot;? No that's completely wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That video is a great explanation (though it glosses over some details a bit). It's also interesting to note that this applies to depth of field too. There's a misconception that focal length affects depth of field, but it doesn't. It's all down to aperture and subject distance. Longer focal lengths give the perception of lower depth of field because they magnify the out of focus background more. You can even observe the effect in the video, though I doubt he controlled for aperture and he was shooting at difference distances. </p></div>		</li>
