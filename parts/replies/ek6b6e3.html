			<div class="markdown"><p>Very true. After I started working for a big bank's data warehouse I realized the credit decisioning model has far more attributes than the general people know or think about. That said, the ones we all know are the most important ones. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Signing a lease is absolutely debt when it comes to finance. You sign a contract requiring you to pay a certain amount each month and large penalties if you fail to make that payment. Basically identical to any other type of debt.</p>
<p>In my world, it is called an &quot;Obligation.&quot; A contractual requirement to make future payments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are undergoing behavior to seek more debt.  Your score represents the likelihood of you paying your debts on time.  More debt = less likely to pay.  It seems backwards and self-defeating, but it makes sense from the perspective of the creditors.  It'd be like a kid asking &quot;are we there yet?&quot; (Credit check) a million times and the likelihood that they will go into a tantrum (default).  The more times they ask, the more likely they are to become impatient and blow a gasket.</p></div>		</li>
