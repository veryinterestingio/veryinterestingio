			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for this, I guess since women don’t have the phase of losing the blood flow like men have with the penis, there’s essentially no reason for them to stop. However, I am a bit confused as I once read on this subreddit that Men not only lose blood flow but the brain releases a counter chemical to dopamine which makes the penis essentially “hurt” after sex as to lower dopamine levels in the brain, so i guess I further want to know why women don’t experience this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regarding pain, here is the short answer in case the link I'm going to post ever becomes invalid. -</p>
<p>Your erections are caused by blood being trapped in your penis, causing it to inflate. However, after a while the oxygen in that blood is used up and the cells inside your penis begin demanding oxygen. You perceive that as pain. That is why a guy typically can't hold an erection for much more than thirty minutes. To get an erection right after the last one doesn't give it enough time to recover.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure OP was referring the hyperstimulation after an orgasm. I don't remember the word now but basically your nerves become super sensitive and even a more vigorous spit would hurt. I'll try to find it assuming no one else beats me to the punch. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you say “that is why a guy typically can’t hold an erection for more than 30 minutes” are you referring to a single erection? Like it gets erect and <em>stays</em> erect for 30 mins? Or do multiple erections during the same short period cancel out the effect? Like get hard for 5 mins, soft for 2 mins, hard for 15, soft for 3, etc etc</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my experience, it's not really a case of orgasm, orgasm, orgasm with women.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In some cases it's orgasm, aftershock-orgasm (with less intensity seconds after the main one)... and in other cases it's orgasm, wait 5 minutes, orgasm, wait 5 minutes, orgasm (where each successive orgasm is more difficult to achieve). Women definitely have a refractory period, it's just much shorter.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I've heard that with women it takes 30 minutes to get to the first orgasm, and then 5 minutes each successive one after that, and with men it takes 5 minutes for the first orgasm and then 30 for each successive one after that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But women do have the same blood flow, no? The Bulb of vestibule (part of the clitoris structure) which sits on either side of the vaginal opening engorges just like a penis, albeit to a lesser extent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes thank you! I read through this whole thing waiting for someone to mention this! Blood flow is part of the arousal stage for women as well, it's just not as obvious. It's part of the vaginal walls loosening to prep for penetration (tenting I think is the term) and the clit engorges as well.</p></div>		</li>
