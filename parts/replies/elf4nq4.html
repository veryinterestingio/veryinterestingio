			<div class="markdown"><p>Your skin most definitely does depend on water as well. You don’t get dry skin just by handling chemicals that strip fats from the surface. </p>
<p>In relation to OPs question about water drying out skin, excessive water can strip the skin of the somewhat water soluble fats that help form the protective barrier against evaporative losses in skin. Once these are gone water can evaporate more easily. </p>
<p>Move to Arizona or New Mexico and you’ll see this quite quickly. </p>
<p>Basic moisturisers provide an additional barrier layer to water loss at the surface of the skin, aiding your own homeostatic response. More specialised/expensive ones will often try and repair damaged skin by having certain proteins and fats around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh definitely not! There’s just some fundamental science around this stuff :). </p>
<p>By and large until you start getting very expensive stuff, they all largely work the same with similar ingredients. So it’s about finding one that works for you.</p>
<p>I seem to respond really well to stuff that contains hemp for my hands.

<p>Whereas my face is quite oily so I need a very light moisturiser to keep that at bay.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You are wrong. Acetone is hellacious on my skin, and I have to use gloves when working with it as well as limonene. I've gotten blisters by scrubbing a floor and not paying attention to acetone soaking into the area around my knees.</p>
<p>Honestly, I don't even like handling isopropanol or ethanol gloveless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're misinterpreting what he said - he's saying that's not the ONLY reason you get dry skin, you also get dry skin by living in dry climates and showering and washing your hands and just being a normal person that isn't handling harsh chemicals daily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re oversimplifying the reason that works though...</p>
<p>It’s not the fats on the surface of your skin that make it dry or not. </p>
<p>Those chemicals you mentioned (I’m a postdoc in chemistry so have got those on my hands far more than I’d like to admit) not only strip the fats from the surface of your skin but also act as despicable by drawing the water out faster than natural evaporation would on its own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the same that your body produces, or not always at least. </p>
<p>Often basic ones contain something like petroleum jelly which helps prevent further water loss from the basal layers of your skin by forming a barrier. </p>
<p>Contrary to what the person above said, water loss is also a factor in your skin “drying out”, not just fat loss from chemical means.</p></div>		</li>
