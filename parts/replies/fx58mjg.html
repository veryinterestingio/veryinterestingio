			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't forge really thick stuff easily. Unless you have a giant press. The impact from a hammer isn't going to have much effect if your material is too thick. The impacts/pressure are what realign the molecules, and if you're working with real thick material you're working with very expensive and labor intensive materials. Forged heads are a thing, but they're waaaaay more expensive to make than cast heads.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Cast iron has some good properties, besides cost. It tends to absorb vibrations, and has a higher thermal capacity - best pans are cast iron, they spread the heat well and hold it well, sudden changes in heating temperature take longer to show an effect. They're great for massive non-mobile machines like e.g. a lathe or a mill, those weigh a lot but it absorbs vibrations and makes them very stable so they stay precise.</p></div>		</li>
