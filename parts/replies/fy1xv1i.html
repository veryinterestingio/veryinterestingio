<p>The same thing could be asked about the line analogy (e.g. &quot;What's outside the line?&quot;). It's really just whichever analogy helps the person understand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More balloon is the answer. </p>
<p>The problem here is hoping for a perfect analogy will get you nowhere. The answer really is “it’s just expanding”</p>
<p>Really the question is actually a bad one, in the sense that it’s based on an incorrect premise. (It’s a GOOD question in the sense that there are no bad questions) it’s just not correct from the get go. There is no “edge” and you kinda just have to accept that, even if it doesn’t make sense. </p>
<p>(Also I’m using the indirect “you” here, not specifically aimed at you, just “people”)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the problem is a confusion in two different definitions of space.</p>
<p>When <strong>everyone in the world except physicists</strong> say &quot;space,&quot; they mean  &quot;a continuous area or expanse which is free, available, or unoccupied.&quot;</p>
<p>When physicists use the word &quot;space,&quot; they mean &quot;the boundless three-dimensional extent <em>in which objects and events</em> have relative position and direction.&quot; The event part relates to spacetime, but that's not important right now.</p>
<p>What's important is the physics definition of space REQUIRES objects to exist. Otherwise, there is no way to measure anything.</p>
<p>The everyday definition of space is this idea of an empty volume.</p>
<p>What confuses me as a layman is why physicis spokespersons (be they experts or hobbyists) simply don't point out this distinction. Instead they themselves conflate the two concepts when trying to explain it to laymen. When physicists say,  &quot;Space itself is expanding,&quot; they are actually only saying &quot;the distance between objects is growing,&quot; and aren't even acknowledging the (problematic) definition of space used by laymen.</p>
<p>Not only that, when physics-minded people often try to explain space to laymen by saying something like &quot;The universe already exists everywhere, it's just stretching. Imagine a balloon's surface containing everything in the universe. When you inflate the balloon, objects grow father apart.&quot;</p>
<p>A common sense response might be, &quot;Okay, but what about the room that the balloon is inflating into?&quot;</p>
<p>Here I usually see the response, &quot;the balloon is all there is. Before the initial inflation of <em>this</em> balloon, there was no space nor time.&quot; To me, this is an unscientific answer without any good evidence.</p>
<p>Perhaps there is a really big balloon  and on it are a bunch of other balloons, already really far away from each other as they begin to be inflated. This would mean that there <em>is</em> space (in the physics sense. also, time) outside of the stuff that came out of our Big Bang.</p>
<p>addition: I think there is a common but mistaken belief among science advocates/fans/enthusiasts that &quot;if something cannot be measured, then it does not exist.&quot; To me this is a metaphysical idealism that doesn't belong in scientific discussion. It can be discussed, sure, and it might actually be true in some way. But, while science is a field that may study aspects of reality, it cannot encapsulate all studies of reality, nor was it ever designed to.</p>
<p>Someone tell me where I might be misunderstanding please, this is all just my take.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With your comment about &quot;what is the balloon is inflating into?&quot; I refer back to my number line example as something that's perhaps more representative of what's happening, compared to a balloon inflating. The number line is expanding into itself. It can do this because it's already infinite. It doesn't matter how far out you go, everything will have room to &quot;expand&quot; into. There doesn't need to be anything &quot;outside&quot; the number line.</p>
<p>Now the question of &quot;what happened at the beginning&quot; is far more interesting. Just like we can move &quot;forward&quot; in time by multiplying everything by 2, we can move &quot;backwards&quot; in time by multiplying everything by 0.5.  If you want to move further backwards, just multiply by smaller numbers, 0.1. 0.01, 0.00000001. The universe remains infinite, no matter how small we get. </p>
<p>Now, people logically want to ask the question &quot;what happens if we multiply by 0? That's the beginning, right?&quot; Well, yes and no. It's bounded by zero, in that you can't multiply by anything smaller than that. Negative distances don't make sense. But, then again, zero distance also doesn't make sense. One of the most basic rules is that &quot;two things cannot exist in the same place and time.&quot; But when you multiply the number line by zero, all numbers get collapsed into zero. All points get collapsed into zero. With spacetime, all times get collapsed into zero. The model breaks down, because now we cannot go forward in time any more. How do we go back to 1? You can't. How do you get to 2? You can't. What was infinite, is now just a point. So that's why people say it's useless to ask what happened &quot;before&quot; the big bang. The model doesn't cover it, and we can't possibly know how we went from a single point to infinity. By all rights, it's impossible.</p>
<p>Yet, the model for the expansion of the universe is exceedingly robust. It has made testable prediction after testable prediction, and all have been verified.  So, the model seems to work, meaning it seems to be an accurate reflection of the universe. Thus, when the model breaks down, and someone seeks to put strange inputs into it, we just tell them &quot;it doesn't exist.&quot; It'd be like multiplying the distances between two points by an imaginary number; the result just isn't meaningful.</p>
<p>There's also the issue here of the &quot;cosmological principle&quot; which, in a nutshell, says &quot;We aren't special.&quot; The laws governing the pysical universe act the same way no matter where you are, and no matter when you are. If we didn't assume that, then essentially no prediction is testable. The model that perfectly described the universe yesterday might not work tomorrow if the laws of the universe can change at any time or at any place. It would make science completely futile. But is it &quot;true?&quot; Your guess is as good as mine.</p>
<p>So that brings me to your last comment. I see it more as &quot;if something cannot be measured, then it's of no use discussing it.&quot; If there's no way to verify if something is or is not correct, or to put it more scientifically: some hypothesis leads to no testable predictions, it really doesn't matter who's right, does it? </p>
<p>For all we know, the Universe started last Thursday at 2:45AM GMT with every sub-atomic particle having an initial position and velocity such that our world looks exactly as we remember it, meaning we also have memories of &quot;time&quot; before that because our brains came into existence with those neural pathways. This solves the question of &quot;what was before the big bang&quot; because there is no big bang in this model. The problem is, even if that hypothesis happens to be correct, it provides no insight as to what will happen in the future. It makes no measurable predictions. Thus, while perhaps a fun hypothetical exercise for dinner parties, it really adds little to no value to people who want to know how the world works. String theory also suffers from this. It's a fun mathematical exercise, but until it can make some prediction about what the world will look like in the future, it remains in the field of mathematics, rather than the field of physics.</p>
<p>Science comes up with models about what the universe is and how it behaves. Things that do not produce testable predictions have no bearing on how the model behaves, thus they are not part of the model. On the flip side, sometimes our models are missing something, and when that happens, we add things to them to make them better. Hence why there's dark matter and dark energy. We have no idea what they are, but we know that the models don't work without them, but are very good at predicting things if we just fudge the numbers in the same way every time.  So, we say <em>something</em> has to exist there.</p>
<p>There's no good answer to be found here. You'll always be wanting something more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I can tell we are in complete agreement haha.</p>
<p>I was giving an example of how the balloon example breaks down when you conflate the layman's definition of space with the physics definition. I think you are right to say that the bigger room would still be part of the number line.</p>
<p>I also agree that the attitude of science re: unmeasurability ought to be that it's not worth worrying about.</p>
<p>We both seem to share the same humble opinion of science.</p>
<p>I think, however, that your number line metaphor is also guilty of ignoring the mismatch between laymen and physics senses of &quot;space.&quot; Your example perfectly coheres with the physics definition of space being a measurement between objects. </p>
<p>However, in the layman's sense of space, which is not necessarily a relational quality between objects, the metaphor has the same mystical quality, appealing to the truth of math to show how space expanding from itself is possible. </p>
<p>Again, the layman's sense of the word space is problematic but it's intuitiveness and everydayness makes overcoming it when discussing physics with laymen important.</p></div>		</li>
