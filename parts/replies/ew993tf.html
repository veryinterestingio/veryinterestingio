			<div class="markdown"><p>The cosmological constant can be calculated two ways: from cosmology and from particle physics, and it's the difference between these two calculations that is this gigantic 120 orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>The value from cosmology is fairly robust, since it can be calculated from the extensively studied statistical properties of the cosmic microwave background. Hence it is almost certainly the value from particle physics that is incorrect.</p>
<p>Were it the other way around, the universe would have to either be absurdly old (approaching heat death territory) or impossibly young (less than a single Planck time); obviously neither of these are the case.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In 2018 a mechanism for cancelling Λ out has been proposed through the use of a symmetry breaking potential in a Lagrangian formalism in which matter shows a non-vanishing pressure. The model assumes that standard matter provides a pressure which counterbalances the action due to the cosmological constant. Luongo and Muccino have shown that this mechanism permits to take vacuum energy as quantum field theory predicts, but removing the huge magnitude through a counterbalance term due to baryons and cold dark matter only.[17]</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know every particle experiences a force from every other particle in the universe, and they are mutually attracted.  At what point does the vacuum of space rip a gas environment from a planet?  I guess the mass of the planet (which includes the mass of the gas atmosphere) pulls the gas atmosphere towards it with gravity....  So a planet is just a very very weak blackhole.....It hasn't gotten enough mass to create enough gravity....</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It doesn't. If you have a small planet in an empty vacuum in isolation and you add an atmosphere, the atmosphere will stay surrounding the planet indefinitely, although the density will depend on the mass of the planet. (If you add a LOT of atmosphere, you end up forming a star!) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind" target="_blank">Solar winds</a> are largely responsible for stripping small planets of their atmosphere, not the vacuum of space.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>If you add enough mass to a planet while keeping the size of the planet constant you will eventually create a black hole, but planets are many orders of magnitude less dense than the Schwarzchild limit, and there are important conceptual distinctions (such as the existence of an event horizon and a singularity in the associated spacetime metric) which separate a black hole from an almost-as-dense object that isn't quite a black hole, such as a neutron star.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a tediously-pedantic correction, the atmosphere will not stay forever. It will stay a very very very long time, but not forever.</p>
<p>A thin upper atmosphere behaves like an ideal gas and has a distribution of speeds. Some very small fraction of particles in the upper atmosphere will be going fast enough to escape the well while also being lucky enough to not interact with any other particles. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just wanted to throw something else in there since the way you wrote something sounds like a misconception / could spread a misconception. The vacuum of space doesn't really suck things away. It cannot pull things from a distance, since a vacuum is simply nothing. From the perspective of what's going on at the molecular level, it's better to think about the gas particles pushing out rather than the vacuum sucking. This is because the gas particles have energy, which is partially stored as translational energy (movement through space). Because of this, an unconfined gas in a vacuum will just spread out, with the first gas particles in the cloud just being those that have the most energy, with slower ones following.</p>
<p>This is why reaction control systems in space create huge plumes of gas that shoot off at hundreds of miles per hour - the hot gas particles are released and there's nothing stopping them. Whereas down on the ground, they would run into other gas particles and, as a group, slow down, which is why it takes a while for a scent to travel across a room with no air circulation. But if you sprayed perfume in a vacuum, the perfume would spread at hundreds of miles per hour (and instead of a vacuum you'd now have very diffuse perfume).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that thinking of planets as weak black holes is very helpful. They stay together because the force of gravity is greater than the air pressure pushing against the atmosphere. If all of a planet's mass was compressed to a single point, it would be a black hole with the same gravitational pull as the planet had before it was compressed into a black hole. The amount of mass is not what makes black holes special, but how dense they are.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's because it's completely wrong. It's never helpful to think of things in an objectively wrong way that contradicts the definitions of the words used.</p></div>		</li>
