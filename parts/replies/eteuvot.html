			<div class="markdown"><p>This is bang on! I found, personally, that with Zoloft it also gave me the capacity to work through emotions rationally/sensibly. I didn’t catastrophize every bad thing. They no longer sent me into spirals of crippling depression and thoughts of ‘what if I wasn’t here anymore?’ </p>
<p>I was able to feel, process, and work through my emotions in a way that was kind of... leveled out? It made me view things on a happy medium, as opposed to either catastrophically awful or amazingly good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doctor here. Agree 100% with this explanation. I try to help my patients understand that most (sometimes all) of what we feel when taking medications for mood and behavioral health issues is related to our experiences and perceptions. Which makes sense, because that's what we're taking them for. The old &quot;serotonin pushes the happy button&quot; model for SSRI's was always too simplistic, and your physicians know that. This way of understanding the medicine's effect on you gives space for the &quot;you&quot; part of the equation, which I think is critically important. Cheers to your journey and you've got a good psychiatrist Sherpa to guide you!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not saying you’re lying but I wanted to know if anyone else feels this way</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. The baseline expectation is off. Happiness should not feel like an extreme emotion. It feels simple and peaceful. It’s contentment.</p></div>		</li>
