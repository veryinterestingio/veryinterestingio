			<div class="markdown"><p>pretty much this.  even if there's a <em>possibility</em> of something being dangerous, we do better to pay attention to it.  the early apes who dismissed the rustling in the bushes as the wind didn't live as long as the ones who thought it might be a tiger, <em>even if it was usually the wind.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's still kind of true, we just dread more complex things, but if in moments of anxiety we really ask ourselves what precisely it is we're afraid of, what our options are, what course of action am I going to take, and finally have I done everything in my power reasonable to do about this, we can go a long way toward mitigating anxiety.</p>
<p>It's a little more complex than that because one of the big elephants in the human room is our knowledge of our mortality, but applying this same system toward coming to terms with death can actually go a long way.  An old person will tell you their 20s feels like yesterday, you should be able to extrapolate from this that you will die tomorrow.  Come to terms with the terminal illness you <em>already have</em> now and the rest of your life becomes a lot better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is probably also the reason why we humans seek purpose and see meaning in everything. Erring on the side of caution helped us survive. And because of language we can <em>linger</em> on those thoughts, repeat, and spread them.</p>
<p><em>(bush rustling)</em> <strong><em>Who</em></strong>'<em>s there?! And</em> <strong><em>what</em></strong> <em>do you</em> <strong><em>want</em></strong>? ... <em>I don't see anything... Did the wind whisper? Talking wind? Talking and invisible... An invisible wind spirit?!... Hey Alf! Ever heard of a wind spirit?</em></p>
<p><em>Alf: A wind spirit?! ...Now that you mention it...</em></p>
<p>And soon the entire village talks about the wind spirit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yep.  we see agency everywhere, whether it's there or not.  witness the white girls today who say, &quot;the universe just didn't want me to get to class today.&quot;  (not that it's just white girls that do this, it's everyone.  just saying we still do it.  like when i stub my toe and blame the table, etc.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Put another way: we are NOT adapted to modern, first-world conditions.  The dumb but very old and very effective lizard that lives in the back of your skull and likes to eat, fuck, but especially survive does not understand the difference between:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feeling Munch After Dinner, Maybe Get Some Crisps</strong> and <strong>Starving During Ice Age, Eat Whatever Is Available</strong></li>
<li><strong>Modern World, Mores, Ethics, Sex</strong> and <strong>Spread Genes At Every Opportunity</strong></li>
<li><strong>I Did Something Embarrassing at Work And I'm Unlikely To Ever Forget It Oh My God Why Do I Keep Doing Embarrassing Things</strong> and <strong>Bigger Lizard Is Chasing Me At Full Speed And I'm Unlikely To Get Away But Must Put Every Effort Into Trying</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This is no excuse for when we behave poorly; instead, we should keep it in mind as part of our effort to behave better.</p></div>		</li>
