			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah a lot of Australia has very large expanses of forest. </p>
<p>Maybe it's the marketing, but a lot of people seem to think it's all like mad Max out here. </p>
<p>17% of Australia is actually forested. That's a lot of forest. EDIT: About the size of the UK, France and Germany combined (or 2 texases in freedom units)</p>
<p>Even out in the bush, there's still huge amounts of vegetation. Granted, they're like bushes and shrubs and small trees, but it's not like the entire country is just sand and rock.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first time I visited Perth, it looked how I imagined Australia looked from media images. Then I arrived in late August (winter/spring) and was surprised at how green it was. This year I had my first full winter here and now I know why...rain. So much rain. So much rain that our plumbing went haywire and we had to stay in the waterlogged Swan Valley for a week.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it's weird that not many people have mentioned this. Also, even large parts of the dry parts are actually monsoonal, with a wet and dry season (not directed at you, more for other people)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Port Moresby’s monsoon is very distinct but it’s also relatively dry overall (1020mm/year) because it sits in a rain shadow, getting about the same amount of rain as Townsville (1100mm/year), which also sits in a rain shadow. Cairns gets about twice as much rain as both (2000mm/year).</p></div>		</li>
