			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the symptoms don't tend to be the same. Humans' primary allergic reactions occur in the respiratory system whereas allergies in dogs typically show up as skin issues. Atopic reactions are common in dogs and they can be very difficult to treat. Even dietary allergies usually show up as itchy skin in dogs. There are some systemic medications and steroids are often used but both approaches can lead to lots of side effects.   Controlled exposure immunotherapy is a rapidly growing veterinary field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, I didn't mean to suggest that the reactions lined up one to one.  I mostly meant that the same spectrum of reactions that occur in humans (sneezing, runny noses, itchy skin, vomiting etc) can also occur in pets.  You and your pet could be allergic to the exact same thing, but express it very different ways.</p>
<p>I'm not going to pretend to know what the statistical distribution of reactions are and the most common ones, I just meant that the symptoms seen in people can also be seen in pets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true, the allergies can be similar. The process of patch testing is nearly identical for humans and animals also.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would probably depend on the severity of the reaction I suppose. It would be tough to decide what to do. I would try to give the pet to a family member if they'd take them, personally. That way they have a good home and you can still see them from time to time.</p></div>		</li>
