			<div class="markdown"><p>Nick here: Great question! Mainly, we were surprised that we could actually do it! The common perception is that narco-traffickers are these scary, covert, and expert criminals that are nearly impossible to understand, let alone predict. However, what we showed is that using a simple set of rational and predictable behavioral rules  - based on minimizing risk and maximizing profit - we could model narco-trafficking decision making reasonably well. Furthermore, putting it into a geographic context - opening the &quot;black box&quot; of the transit zone through Central America - we could see a clear link between when and where narco-traffickers moved and the actions of counterdrug interdiction forces. In fact, we also learned that we know much more about what narco-traffickers are doing than we know do about counterdrug interdiction efforts!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Would it be possible to apply your research to international terrorism? Terrorists have the same perception of being irrational and hard to predict.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is the first time I am hearing about this misconception.</p>
<p>Common perception  spread on the media is that they act just like legal entrepreneurs with the illegality twist and violent methods.</p></div>		</li>
