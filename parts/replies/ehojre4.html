			<div class="markdown"><p>An emulator is like planting a tropical tree in a greenhouse so it can live in Canada and think it's the Amazon.  </p>
<p>It replicates the games 'natural environment' within your computer, so the ROM file thinks it's actually running on the console.  </p>
<p>This is difficult as it's asking the computer to digitally create the console within itself.<br />
So all the chips, all the programming on those chips, your computer recreates in software in order to run just like it's the console itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is difficult for the programmer. That should be emphasized, because it’s not at all difficult for the computer. Our computers are so many orders of magnitude more powerful than the consoles that NES, SNES, Genesis, Atari 2600/5200, etc consoles operated on. The browser or reddit app you’re reading this on probably uses more machine resources than an emulator.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Emulators are a bit more difficult. Typically, emulators start by investigating as much as they can about the system they're emulating. What cpu is used, what instruction set it runs on, what is connected where to the CPU and how it's accessed. A lot of this is borderline trial and error using some of the games dumped from game carts to figure out what commands do what based off of what they might expect them to be doing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having worked on some emulators, I can say that this is very true. The idea is to approximate the original hardware environment according to more or less known specs. On top of that, it is necessary to create software with those limitations in mind and faithful to the original. Sometimes the source code of classic games is available, so it can be readily transcribed into another programming language, but sometimes it's not. I am quite amazed at the quality of emulators that exist as it is more than just coding; it's almost a form of art to get things right. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't tell you <em>exactly</em> how snap does it but the theory is pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>There are slight differences between the way the emulator and the real hardware process instructions. Imagine how a car &quot;Feels&quot; different from another. Lets say you drive a car that makes an odd noise or has a particular smell. A superficial detail that won't affect your trip to the local store and something you wouldn't notice if you were not looking for it. Ultimately, as long as it starts and drives it doesn't really matter unless you are looking for the differences.</p>
<p>The same is true with emulators. There are subtle differences in implementation that you can check for with specially crafted code.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>One type is memory mirroring. The following is a simplified example. Lets say a memory chip stores 256 (0-255) bytes. normally, you give it a number from 0 to 255 and it gives you the data at that location. Lets say you ask for the data at position 256. The real hardware would wrap around and give you the data at location 0 effectively &quot;mirroring&quot; the data. An emulator might give you a static value like 0 or 255. By asking for an &quot;out of bounds&quot; area of memory and seeing what you get back you can determine if you're in an emulator or on hardware.</p>
<p>TL;DR subtle differences in implementation that you can test for with specially crafted code.</p>
<p>also, something more meaty if you're inclined.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a follow-up: when playing an emulated version of Tetris from the original NES on a 6th-gen Intel i7, or even those retro consoles Nintendo has released, there is stuttering. I get that the processor architecture is a factor, but why does it seem impossible to correct 100% for having a different architecture? If I use an actual NES, I can smash even if I start at lvl 19, but there is an easily observable stutter on modern hardware.</p>
<p>And in the past 10 years I still never managed to get Dragon Force for a Sega Saturn emulator to work! This isn’t a question. Dragon Force was the shit.</p></div>		</li>
