<p>it's really fascinating yet somewhat obvious that our most fundamental sounds in language come from our laziness! lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But ‚Äúum‚Äù isn‚Äôt a schwa. A Schwa is an undressed vowel sound which is pulled closer to the center of the vowel space because of lack of stress. </p>
<p>Um may have a schwa in it, depending whether you consider it to have stress, but it also has /m/, which is made with the mouth closed, so it‚Äôs also low effort.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because people are really saying &quot;uh.&quot;  But then you get confused, realize you aren't sure what to say and close your mouth.  This turns the &quot;uh&quot; in &quot;um.&quot;  So that person is right, they just forgot a little detail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We aren't talking about IPA transcription conventions right now. Schwa describes a phoneme. One that requires little effort. The same one described by a wedge. Its a bit like correcting someone on calling a note C-sharp vs D-flat because of the key they are playing in. Based on convention, you'd technically be right, but they were talking about the frequency that plays when you strike that key, and youre going to confuse them because now they think they were talking about the wrong key.</p></div>		</li>
