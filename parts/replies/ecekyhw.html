			<div class="markdown"><p>Counterpoint: I am lucky enough to have a decent-paying job that I can either work remotely or travel to client sites. I intentionally moved to a rural area this summer. My salary will literally buy 3 times more house and land than before.</p>
<p>I sold our low-end 4BR house in Phoenix on a postage stamp for $250K, roughly $80K more than I paid in 2013, and I will roll that money into a larger-than-I-really-need home in the Great Plains on 10 acres that will cost less than $350K. </p>
<p>If you're making good money, and can work from home, move to the rural areas. You'll be killing it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is where the old home price is deceptive.  Of course when more home in the past are in rural areas and newer homes are getting larger, the home prices will be more expensive now than in the past.  </p>
<p>When land is basically free and you are building a shotgun style home with no air conditioning it is going to be far more affordable than a downtown condo with granite countertops, attached garages, and a community fitness center and pool. And all the maintenance and landscaping rolled into monthly dues.</p>
<p>Now it is not practical more many millennials to move to small rural towns as sadly they are dying off.  All it takes is the one final factory closing down to turn some of these towns into ghost towns.  You have neighborhoods of aging home owners who are retired and can deal with the fact their town’s only grocery store shut down a few years ago and there are no jobs.  They can have a big grocery trip once or twice per month and fill in with amazon shipping stuff.  It doesn’t matter that there are no jobs, but when they die, the house will basically be unsellable because nobody who needs a job can live there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s a lot more causes than just this. At any given time there are far more people who own homes than there are people looking for homes. </p>
<p>Our public policy historically has been more concerned with ensuring that homes are increasing in value (and therefore that homeowners are happy) than ensuring that new housing is being created. Existing homeowners are usually entrenched in their communities and have more political power to influence local government than “potential” homeowners, and use bureaucratic measures like zoning hearings to protect their interests in property value. Even leaving aside that people are generally resistant to the idea of outsiders coming into their community, it’s basic supply and demand. Limiting new supply is good for existing owners. </p>
<p>One of the policies that’s been historically passable is increasing the availability of credit, either directly or through tax breaks for mortgages. In the short term it keeps everyone happy when buyers have access to money to buy, but in the long term it leads to artificial price inflation. </p>
<p>Long term its been great for anyone who owns land. The losers are: younger generations, who are unable to buy homes like their parents did, and “stuck” renting later and later in life, forfeiting a large share of their income to a landlord rather than into home equity. It’s also hurt minority groups who’s parents and grandparents weren’t given access to credit (due to blatant institutional discrimination). </p>
<p>In a broader sense, it’s been economically inefficient. By artificially inflating the return on real estate investment, we’ve encouraged investors to sink money into real estate rather than in other more productive investments. </p></div>		</li>
