			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why, generally, listening to the song completely will finish the loop and let you get on with your life. In the world of songs that prey on your subconscious like crack, the song may just be too catchy and still be caught in your head for weeks.</p>
<p>Source: I had Eurovision songs stuck in my head for like 6 weeks after seeing the movie and listening to the soundtrack multiple times. And, now that I've mentioned the movie, the songs are back in my head, looping endlessly. Sigh. Love the movie though, would watch again. ...&quot;VOLCANO MAAAAAN!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually a big reason old Town road was so popular. The song is very short and we want just ONE more chorus to play. The song ends up feeling incomplete and we end up listening to it again to get that fix.</p></div>		</li>
