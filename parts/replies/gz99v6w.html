<p>For that matter, can you knock off varying size chunks from a nucleus or do they generally just split into mostly equal products?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't it be the other way around?</p>
<p>Fissioning a nucleus to produce a hydrogen nucleus instead of a strontium nucleus is still fission right? Or are we talking something like beta decay?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it is still fission, but if it was photofission, as in fission induced by a photon, it is also photodisintigration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have any good book recommendations for nuclear physics for moderates (I've taken up to E&amp;M physics in uni)? I've never even heard oh photofission until this point, and I didn't even know it was possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Photofission isn't something that's talked about too often, so it's not surprising that you haven't heard of it. But I'd recommend <em>Introductory Nuclear Physics</em> by K. Krane. It's the standard undergrad nuclear physics book, giving a pretty good survey of the field. It's a little old, so it doesn't cover what's going on at the cutting edge, but that usually isn't covered in a first course anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's too large we would call it fission. Doesn't really matter. If there is any ambiguity an author should specify what they mean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can and in fact there are even rare spontaneous fissions that give two large nuclei plus a third light nucleus.  Must often an alpha, but sometimes others either lighter like He-3 or heavier like lithium.</p></div>		</li>
