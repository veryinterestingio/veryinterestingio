			<div class="markdown"><p>Well 3*5 is 15, and if you count the top bend, that's three on each finger, excluding the thumb. Where he is getting the fifteenth knuckle, I do not know. Maybe he believes the wrist is our greatest and fifteenth knuckle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can also count using binary, which will result in 2\^10 - 1 = 1023 just using 10 fingers. </p>
<p>If you somehow incorporate knuckles... That could get really big, e.g. 8 knuckles expands it to 2\^18 - 1 = 262,143</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I count mantra using the sections on my fingers.. can easily count to 144, placing my thumb on each section.. 12x12.. binary counting on fingers is most effective, letting you count up to 1024.. </p>
<p>and the Mayans had an interesting way of calculating time with 20 fingers &amp; toes in combination with 13 major joints on the body for a 260 count, which they had as well as a 365 day cycle (20 months of 18 days plus a 5 day holiday) among tracking many other cycles. These added cycles make tracking eclipses and other event possible. They are really into multiples of 13 &amp; 20 .. </p>
<p>there is a popular conspiracy theory that the 12:60 ‘Babylon time’ was implemented to remove people from natural timing frequencies and we need to move to a natural calendar and live by a more natural 13:20 timing instead</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never considered counting binary on my fingers.  Not that many people could read what you were doing.  Technically we could use trinary by having our fingers in different positions to represent three states but that is a lot more mind bending.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I looked into why we don't user trinary in computers, since it's pretty trivial to get 1 0 -1 states instead of just 0 1 states.</p>
<p>It turns out trinary math is almost a full order of magnitude more difficult to implement than binary math. Every problem you come across in binary is more difficult to implement in trinary. It's cheaper and more effective to simply throw 50% more silicon at the problem and stick with binary than to go for the extra numerical density of trinary. </p>
<p>Trinary also doesn't mesh cleanly with decimal, octo, or hex systems, so you lose a lot of utility in translation between these systems. You would basically need to come up with new octo and hex equivalents but for trinary, and decimal is always going to be an inconvenient translation.</p>
<p>It ends up costing way more silicon than you save by switching to trinary. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, unfortunately the last knuckle doesn't usually have as much articulation on the fingers. But if we still consider it, there are 4 stages for each finger and 3 for thumbs, adding up to 38 distinct positions. By no means can they all be articulated in every possible combination, but then again I haven't even gotten to toes yet. Either way, we could theoretically count into the quintillions with all our digits. And that doesn't even factor in the other joints of the body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seconding the Sumerian system comment. Just been reading “Sapiens” by Yuval Noah Harari and on pg 122 “The Sumerian writing system... combin[ed] two types of signs which were pressed in clay tablets. One type of signs represented numbers. There were signs for 1, 10, 60, 600, 3600, and 36000. (The Sumerian’s used a combination of base-6 and base-10 numeral systems. Their base-6 system bestowed on us several important legacies, such as the division of the day into 24 hours and of the circle into 360 degrees). </p>
<p>The comment related to knuckle counting may be why it’s base-6? But it certainly comes from there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you wanna go down a Rabbit hole, you can research the secret code that Sumerians used to communicate... some of those indentions in the clay tablets were deeper than others they used, and that could be interpreted by some receiver in the know. I think I remember they used a ternary mathematical system for that esoteric whatever.. so it didn't help to recognize the indented symbols.. </p>
<p>So in a way they also left of the legacy of ciphers and cryptography. Lots of stuff honestly. </p>
<p>I think my favorite thing about the Sumerians is that literacy was pretty darn high at the time, and since they build from clay, everyone was always writing random stuff about how great they were on things like doorways and walls. &quot;Ashur is the best singer.&quot; and the like. </p></div>		</li>
