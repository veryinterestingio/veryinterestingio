			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh for sure I know lots of individuals will think of all kinds of dogs. I just wonder if most people would think of a golden. </p>
<p>Like I know labs are vastly more common dogs. Even German Shepard’s are more common than goldens, but I wonder if a lot of people would think of a golden anyways just because they are so iconic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are genetically similar, both being breeds of retriever, with the Golden being an offshoot of earlier retrievers and now extinct Tweed Water Spaniel. </p>
<p>You are correct about the Labrador being more popular. Lab is the most popular breed in the US, with the Golden being number 3.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My absolute favourite and most inspiring moment of abstract thinking had to be the Breaking Bad episode where Walt and Jesse are stranded in the desert with a battery-dead RV. </p>
<p>He builds an operable battery using scrap zinc and copper pieces. Taking the anode/cathode/salt bridge concept and applying it to a real life, live or die moment really made me try to up my survival knowledge.</p></div>		</li>
