<p>I’ve heard positive news about a Swiss company “Relief Therapeutics”</p>
<p>I believe “Sorrento therapeutics” has one as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A huge percentage of our population believe vaccines are a conspiracy by Bill Gates to plant a chip in children. Another huge percentage believe that vaccines give their children autism.</p>
<p>I would say there are at least 10% to 20% of people who will actively not try and mitigate the virus spread with masks or vaccines. Will that impact us long term?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>NAD, but what things like masks and vaccines do is reduce the R0 (reproductive index). Below 1 it burns out, higher than 1 it spreads. I don't remember the exact R0 of covid let's say 2.4 for ease of math, but feel free to use your own numbers. If 1/3 of population are non-compliant, that's a R0 of 0.8; It will eventually burn out but slowly. With 100% complicance, even with not optimal mask usage, it would burn out much quicker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this would require an equal distribution of maskers and non-maskers, but the reality I've noticed here in Georgia is that in Atlanta with the city folk, we're about 95-98% masked. Very rare to see anyone without.</p>
<p>30 minutes out in the suburbs, it's a rough 50%.</p>
<p>30 minutes more out, it's &quot;I've literally not worn a mask once this entire time&quot;. </p>
<p>If a distribution like that holds nationwide, then you'll see the virus eradicated in major population centers and continuing to fester through rural areas for quite some time. Perhaps a very long time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>its worthwhile to note that the math here assumes the vaccine is 100% effective, which it will not be. first, because no vaccine is. second, many pharmas are looking towards emergency use exemptions if they demonstrate a scant improvements over placebo (see moderna)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're on to something. However, If the vaccine is say... 50% effective, you only get half credit for each compliant person. your r0 is now 1.6. Then people feel safe, opening bars, and your r0 is back to 2. 4 eight his social factor.</p>
