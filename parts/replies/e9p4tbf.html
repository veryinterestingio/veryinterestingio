			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah, just because the element is above the iron peak does not mean it's instable, or that bombarding it with neutrons releases enough new neutrons to feed the nuclear chain reaction.</p>
<p>So in practice, only a select few isotopes can be used for nuclear power.</p>
<p>If all you car is the heat, you can use any unstable isotope. And whether something is unstable or not doesn't only depends on the ratio of neutrons to protons. So even elements lighter than Iron, for example Tritium can be used as energy sources, just from decay.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You could split any atom heavier than iron and get more energy out than you would in, but that's <em>if</em> you split it.</p>
<p>Splitting an atom requires firing neutrons at it, hoping one or more stick in the nucleus and kind of wedge it apart by making it unstable.</p>
<p>Many elements can handle extra neutrons and remain stable. Heck, even Hydrogen can. It has 1 proton, and it can handle a neutron without decaying.</p>
<p>As you get heavier, you start to get to isotopes like Uranium 235 that's already unstable, and it's <em>huge</em> so it's a bigger target for the neutrons.</p>
<p>When an atom splits, we need to be able to use the neutrons that explode out of it to trigger a nearby atom to split too, causing a chain reaction. Without that chain reaction, we can't feasibly run net-positive energy production.</p>
<p>Refined Uranium (so that it has higher % U235) is pretty much the best fuel for running a standard reactor because it splits rather easily and it can sustain a chain reaction as long as the reactor is kept online.</p>
<p>There are a few ways we can make that chain reaction more successful, and that's actually by trying to force the neutrons to bounce around more.</p>
<p>In a regular reactor, the neutrons can be absorbed by the hydrogen in the water. These neutrons are effectively removed from the chain reaction. CANDU reactors (designed in Canada) use &quot;heavy water&quot;, which has the hydrogen isotope Deuterium. Heavy water is already saturated with neutrons, so it doesn't absorb as many and they just ricochet off instead and have a better chance of hitting Uranium.</p>
<p>CANDU reactors can sustain operation with lower grade fuel like unrefined Uranium and Thorium. This removes the cost of refining Uranium (and also eliminates the risk of refined Uranium being repurposed for weapons a la comic book villain style), but has the cost of refining and maintaining a closed loop heavy water system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really, for the reactor to work you'd need to be able to cause fission using the energy produced and have a net gain in the end. Theoretically anything is possible I guess but realistically that'd be pretty damn hard.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The iron eventually builds up to the concentration that poisons the fusion reaction. In small stars, they just slowly die out. Larger stars actually collapse under their own gravity, the energy from the sustainable fusion previously preventing such a collapse now removed. This sudden collapse makes the star much denser, and it instantly fuses much of the hydrogen still left in the core all at once and explodes into a supernova. Even larger stars are so heavy that they just slide right past supernova and collapse into a black hole when they get iron poisoned. </p>
<p>Not that any of this adds to the understanding of why iron poisons a star, but its interesting stuff.</p></div>		</li>
