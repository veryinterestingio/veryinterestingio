<p>Surface wave motion decreases with depth.  It's mostly gone 1/2 a wave length below the surface.  In deep water wave length is about 1.5 times the period squared (actually g/2 pi) .  A fairly large storm generates say 12 second waves, a hurricane perhaps 15 sec.  That give a wave length of about 225 *1.5, lets say 300 m or 1000 ft.  The the top 500' would feel wave motion.   Agrees with what the guy on the nuclear sub 500' down said.</p></div>		</li>
