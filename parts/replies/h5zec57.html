			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly why I'm too scared to even try one.  My daughter gave me a huge brownie but I was too scared to eat it so I ended up throwing it away.  I've had gummies though, and they did nothing.  Ate 10 of them.  And I'm a light smoker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is one reason why im so glad legalization finally happened in my state (NYS) still got a few months before the stores start to open in my area. </p>
<p>A friend of mine makes edible brownies but the problem is the dosing on them is so hit and miss. Some a single bite would send you to the moon. Sometimes 3 brownies will give you a light buzz that would last 10 minutes. Dose control is so hard to manage with home made edibles. It led to me either not getting high or having a frankly horrible experience. Not to mention the taste was like eating grass.</p>
<p>But my brother in law went to colorado and brought back a chocolate bar from one of their weed stores. It had 16 cubes with directions. 2 if your brand new or 4 if its been a while. 5 if you partake regularly and 6 if your a regular and its a very special occasion.</p>
<p>I took 2 and had the first actually enjoyable high in my entire life. I cant wait to be able to do that regularly. Not to mention the taste was just like eating a chocolate bar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I made some recently for our states newest covid lockdown.</p>
<p>Dosage has definitely been hit and miss, but man oh man.</p>
<p>Edibles have been like the first time I smoked a bong instead of joints.</p>
<p>Just a crazy high, tons of train of thoughts that just go down the rabbit hole and then I suddenly &quot;snap back&quot; to where I am, but only 30 seconds has passed real time, whereas my thoughts made me feel like I'd lived years ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚</p>
<p>Highly enjoyable.</p></div>		</li>
