			<div class="markdown"><p>While we didn't go too far in depth about these receptors themselves in my class, I was able to dig up a little bit of information on these receptors. The  SAα2, 6Gal receptors fall into a class of receptor known as sialic acids (described in the background section of reference 1). These receptors have a few functions, but are taken advantage of by the viruses (as well as some bacteria) as a portal of entry. If you'd like more information on them, the 2nd reference below is a link to the wikipedia article about Sialic acids, which does also briefly touch on their involvement in Influenza viruses.  </p>
<p>My apologies for deflecting you to other sources, I'm a little tied up in studying for exams at the moment. </p>
