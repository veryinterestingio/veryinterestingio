			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope.  Water is relatively compressible.  Some liquids are twice as compressible, like most oils/petroleum products.   But we’re still at fractions of a percent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait I thought oils were useful because they weren't compressible? Or am I thinking about &quot;hydraulic&quot; equipment incorrectly? (I understood &quot;hydr-&quot; to mean liquid more than it meant *water* specifically, so maybe that's where I'm wrong).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fluid Elasticity = Compressibility of a fluid can be expressed by the Bulk Modulus of the Fluid.</p>
<p>The higher the Bulk Modulus the harder it is to compress.</p>
<p>Using the SI Units at the Scientific notation 10^9 Pa which in simple terms is pressure needed to compress it. </p>
<p>Waters Bulk Mudulus is 2.15X10^9 Pa.</p>
<p>Liquids with lower Bulk Modulus: around half that of water or just under half.</p>
<p>Gasoline 1.3X10^9 Pa which means it takes a little over half the pressure needed to effect a change than water needs.</p>
<p>Ethyl Alcohol: 1.06X10^9 Pa</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>pV=nRT is only applicable to ideal gases. The assumptions for a gas being &quot;ideal&quot; include no intermolecular forces should be present, this is only a valid assumption at low temperatures and pressures. For real gases you can use a &quot;compressibility factor&quot; (not sure on the english terminology) z which leads to pV= znRT or use different equations of state like van der Waals, Soave-Redlich-Kwong etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just commenting to say ‘exactly’.  Thanks for replying to that question, spot on.</p>
<p>The IDG is strictly for ‘ideals’ and works for most cases as a ‘close enough’.   It tends to fall apart at temperature extremes and high pressures as other forces really build or fall apart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gasses at low temperatures would be less ideal than gasses at somewhat higher temperatures (to a limit, I don't think this is true to arbitrarily high temperatures). For example, nitrogen at room temperature would be more ideal than nitrogen barely above its boiling point. Low pressures is also helpful like you mentioned because intermolecular forces are less important when there are less molecules in a given space.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But yeah, we call it a compressibility factor in english.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Exactly. In classical thermodynamics it's often treated as &quot;ideal conditions&quot; (i.e. high temperature, low or near-zero pressure, symmetrical, non-charged gas molecules), any deviations from that will affect the way the gas interacts with its container and with itself, deviating it further from ideality. </p>
<p>The ideal gas formula can accomodate for such deviations, by adding Z to the rightmost member, making it PV=ZRT (here, V is specific volume, or volume/mole), and as such approximating the behaviour of a real gas. There are tons of ways of calculating Z, with the more sophisticated ones take into account the shape of the molecule, and possible charged interactions, and there are whole books dedicated at recording the experimentally measured values for Z for certain gas mixtures at different temperatures and pressures. </p>
<p>For most intents and purposes, all gases can be treated as ideal. Only for research purposes, or when designing specialized equipment or dealing with substances that are known to be heavily non-ideal in the industry is a compressibility factor needed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of the replies to your comment are somewhat misleading. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressibility" target="_blank"><em>Compressiblity factor</em></a> is not the same thing as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressibility" target="_blank"><em>compressibility</em></a>. The compressibility factor represents the deviation in compressibility from that of an ideal gas, whereas compressibility is the partial derivative of volume with respect to pressure divided by the total volume. The <em>compressibility factor</em> for an ideal gas is 1 because compressibility factor is defined as Z=pV/nRT.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’d need to talk to someone better with particle physics than me.  I’m a fluid engineer.    I would theorize it has to do with molecular interaction and the way the molecules exert their energy, say, more vibration than linear movement, or being compressed enough and with enough energy to start showing molecular attraction than in low energy/low density states.   H2 is only one I know of that is never below z=1 above STP, it’s also only molecule with no neutrons.</p></div>		</li>
