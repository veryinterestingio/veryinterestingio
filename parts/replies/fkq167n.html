			<div class="markdown"><p>But OP is wondering why we can't just do these things altruistically instead of having money.  We have an economic system for control, but couldn't we have an emergency system where money is just suspended and we all work together to get everything stable again first.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If a box of food is worth $100, then a $100 note is like an IOU (I owe you)* for a box of food.  </p>
<p>&quot;You give me the box, and here's a piece of paper to say someone else owes you a box of the same value&quot;</p>
<p>So when everyone is taking all these boxes of food and not giving the supplier an IOU. Supplier is left with nothing.<br />
And suppliers aren't just big companies who have endless warehouses, warehouses are filled by producers, and producers need raw ingredients.  </p>
<p>So if big supermarket chains aren't getting IOUs, they can't give them to the factories who supply them, nor the farmers who do either.<br />
The whole chain will break down as you start trading services for goods, or X good for Y good, and all you're doing is going back to the barter system instead of using money and it gets really complicated.  </p>
<p>The only way for it to work is for someone else to foot the IOU, ie the government, and then the government can get IOUs back in the form of tax for example.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That is a great IL5 summary of a wellfare focussed, social-democratic state.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Different question.</p>
<p>That is the reason why we need to all be careful to not catch it and not spread it - so that while I can't do our jobs if we get it, our colleagues have kept clear of it, and so they keep working while I stay home, so that by the time they get it I'm back at work.</p>
<p>The question is why those who are still working can not be paid, while everyone doesn't pay rent or power or rates or everything else. Then when its over we start up the economy again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Altruistically really means the government orders it to happen, and if it doesn't people with guns go to make it happen. This would obviously fuck up trust in the economy and government for generations, but in the event of existential threats it's better than the alternative. Our scenario obviously isn't at that level of severity though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The simplest answer is because we cannot hit pause on our consumption of items that have &quot;value&quot;, e.g. food, rent, public transport or petrol for your car, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Part of the problem with the current crisis is that we <em>can</em> hit pause on certain items of value (leisure activities, luxury and non-essential goods, etc).</p>
<p>The problem is that our economy is interconnected. The market for “non-essentials” is inextricably linked to the market for “essentials”. </p>
<p>We may think it’s fine, for example, to give up going to the movies for 6 months. That’s “non-essential”. But when the theatres close down, everyone who works there can no longer exchange their labor for “essentials”. </p>
<p>This happens across the economy. </p>
<p>As long as the people working to produce and distribute “essentials” like food and medicine keep working, there shouldn’t be any shortage of these things. </p>
<p>But when the non-essential foods and services stop, the capitalist method of distributing essentials (in exchange for money earned largely earned producing non-essentials) breaks down. </p>
<p>That’s why we need a robust government who is able to step-in during an economic crisis and help ensure the welfare of the people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a few examples off the top of my head, either they owe a monthly mortgage and have to repay it each month or risk losing the house to the bank, or possibly if bigger they have a business loan they need to pay back. Banks freezing mortgage payments helps with this, but doesn't cover grounds maintenance costs like paying gardeners, people to fix drains and roofs etc, my flat leaseholder covers this and needs to pay those contractors and so need some money from me.</p></div>		</li>
