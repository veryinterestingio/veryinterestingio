			<div class="markdown"><p>I never thought about this. It's interesting that waterfalls disperse to mist instead of larger droplets like rain.  I'm guessing it's because of the turbulence of the water &amp; lots of air mixing in to the water as it goes over the edge &amp; bounces off rocks and stuff?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My guess is there's no other water falling and combining with the mist dispersing away from the waterfall.</p>
<p>Water directly under the waterfall has more volume of water surrounding it, any small droplets will have plenty of chances to combine into bigger droplets until it finds that balanced ratio</p></div>		</li>

<p>Lateral wind + vertical terminal velocity = mist.</p>
<p>No wind + terminal velocity = rain drops.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not a vacuum but there are cool videos in zero G from the ISS of water clumping into big, free-floating spheres, glomming onto people, etc.</p></div>		</li>
