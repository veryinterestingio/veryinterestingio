			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in a Canadian city where there are a lot of first and second generation arab immigrants. Mostly Lebanese people, but lots of other countries represented too. I grew up with lots of friends from school who speak arabic at home. Most of them were lebanese and i know a few words and phrases of lebanese arabic myself. I’ve heard that there is a form of standard arabic, but because all of these Arab kids grew up in Canada, they can’t speak to eachother unless their parents are from the same country. I find that interesting because they all speak arabic fluently, but they have to speak english with eachother to communicate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How different are they? Like is it just different words, but similar structure, the other way around? Or is it more like a really heavy accent? Like a lot of people who speak &quot;standard&quot; American English have a hard time understanding people from some areas in Louisiana or people with heavy Scottish accents or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The language of acadamia and news outlets is MSA, modern standard arabic. I was a 98G (crypto linguist) many years ago at the start of operation Iraqi Freedom. I spent 63 weeks in an immersion program at DLIFLC in Monterey CA learning it. Most educated people could understand me, however it was akin to speaking old English. It took many years, a few dialect courses, and a lot of time in country to finally blend in colloquially -- and even then I was only comfortable with Egyptian and Iraqi dialects. My Sudanese was passable, but I got a few come agains speaking with locals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not true. It isn't anyone's primary language, but when a politician gives a speech or an anchor reads the news, it's almost always in fusha. Additionally, in most countries' schools (at least as I understand it) the language of instruction is fusha.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However, all Arabs have at least some knowledge of FusHa and Maghrebis sre likely to have some working knowledge of Mashriqi dialects. So it's likely that any given Moroccan and Yemeni would be able to work through Fusha and shared knowledge of dialects to communicate some amount.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. </p>
<p>My husband is Algerian-Berber and is a native speaker of Berber (of which there are many dialects), Darija (Maghrebi Arabic of which there are many dialects), and French. He has professional fluency in Al Fusha from school, as well as non-native fluency in English. </p>
<p>He can understand all Arabic dialects and speak with them in MSA. Gulf and Levantine Arabs understanding Darija is obviously difficult because it’s the furthest removed from all other Arabic dialects. It’s Arabic + Latin Languages + Berber. I believe they locally refer to it as something like a “fantoche” or puppet language.</p>
<p>There is a project that seeks to record the vast number of Arabic dialects through volunteers native to corresponding regions—I forgot the name of the project. Someone was complaining that the person reading in the Algiers dialect was using too much French, but it was actually representative of just how much French modern Algiers Darija speakers use while speaking in Darija.</p></div>		</li>
