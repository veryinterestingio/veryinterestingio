<p>Now the exact mechanism is unclear and your question about why certain people are more affected has not been conclusively answered. Motion sickness is more common in women and those who suffer migranes, and there seems to be a genetic component too. We still have a lot to learn before we know for sure.</p>

<p>Interesting, I was not aware of that. I guess that's why my sister always got travel sick and I didn't.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You get used to it.</p>
<p>Some people are better at it <em>at first</em> but they can develop in to it.</p>
<p>Classic examples of this are found in video gamers who play games that make them dizzy. This is the opposite, the body sitting still while thinking it's moving. </p>
<p>Slowly gamers learn to become less dizzy. They don't feel sick from it. This is tuning the nervous system to say &quot;We're not sick. We're fine. This is normal.&quot; </p>
<p>I would venture to guess that people well adapted to those types of video games, like first person shooters, have a higher tolerance to motion sickness of all forms. They might even still get sick, but not as bad or as quickly. </p>
<p>First person shooters gave me the ability to look at extremely dizzying things and be okay with them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get motion sick quite often but im an avid gamer. The reason I dont think this applies is due to the static images around the pc screen that are also within ones field of vision. Knick-knacks and other such objects are rested round my monitor and I would want to guess those actually help prevent any sickness. On the other hand when I first tried VR I threw up. The lack of other peripheral objects to view is what I think attributed to this.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes but what sort of games? Ones that induce vomit quickly in other people?</p>
<p>Do you like a good fast paced game of Quake or are you playing League of Legends?</p>
<p>Because those two games are a world apart w/ respect to motion sickness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always been a big reader but in bursts, even as a kid, and I remember losing the sickness then getting it again after not reading during car trips for a while. Never had it as an adult, never had to factor in reading while travelling etc. That said, I love my games and play daily, might factor into it.</p>
<p>I wouldn't be surprised if it becomes less and less common as practically all kids have now grown up using phones constantly while travelling, accumulating &quot;practice&quot;, playing games regularly etc</p></div>		</li>
