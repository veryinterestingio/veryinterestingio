			<div class="markdown"><p>More of a personal experience, but my mum had some health issues because a doctor decided to use a general antibiotic. I can't remember what she had, but all in all it seems it wasn't necessary... In the end she had a lot of issues with c. difficile bacteria because her gut bacteria was thrown all out of wack. Had to take months off work and go back with light duty/accommodations...</p>
<p>General antibiotics are bad news and should only be used when necessary, basically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even then, I think with the vastness of the microbiome and sheer number of microbes, we are most likely losing a portion of them when we take antibiotics, even with the more targeted antibiotics. It's just the difference between fire bombing and nuclear strike depending on the course of medication taken. The thing is there is a wide variety of the commensal bacteria we have and there's still so much unknown about what exactly each type is contributing and how our microbiota are working together to regulate us (ie gut microbiota releasing hormone to the brain), processing of nutrition, and more.</p></div>		</li>
