			<div class="markdown"><p>coffin (n.)
early 14c., &quot;chest or box for valuables,&quot; from Old French cofin &quot;sarcophagus,&quot; earlier &quot;basket, coffer&quot; (12c., Modern French coffin), from Latin cophinus &quot;basket, hamper&quot; (source of Italian cafano, Spanish cuebano &quot;basket&quot;), from Greek kophinos &quot;a basket,&quot; which is of uncertain origin.</p>
<p>Funereal sense &quot;chest or box in which the dead human body is placed for burial&quot; is from 1520s; before that the main secondary sense in English was &quot;pie crust, a mold or casing of pastry for a pie&quot; (late 14c.). Meaning &quot;vehicle regarded as unsafe&quot; is from 1830s. Coffin nail &quot;cigarette&quot; is slang from 1880; nail in (one's) coffin &quot;thing that contributes to one's death&quot; is from 1792.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A sarcophagus is typically stone, while caskets and coffins are typically wood. </p>
<p>There are also jar burials, in which a body is placed in a jar to decompose. Some ancient cultures would collect liquids from different stages of the decomposition, and perform other rituals during this phase. Once the body was decomposed to a certain state, the jar would then be buried.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a woodworker, I don’t quite see how this saves wood in practical terms. I mean yes there is less wood in the final product but let’s think about the top and bottom pieces for a second. You would still need to start with a board that’s as wide as the widest spot. You could cut it down at the feet but then you just have some random triangular cutoffs that you can’t do much with.</p>
<p>Perhaps if you were starting with an infinitely long board you could cut coffin #1 out of it and then flip around for coffin #2, nestling the two shapes together so as to save wood. </p>
<p>But infinitely wide boards don’t exist. These are almost certainly not made from single piece boards but rather glued up panels made from multiple boards. It’s unlikely that they glue boards up directly into this shape - panels tend to be done as rectangles because you need to be able to apply even clamping pressure from the sides.</p>
<p>Maybe you save on the head and foot pieces, because they’re narrower but the bent sides are actually <em>longer</em> than straight sides would be. And you have to miter those angles together, which is not trivial to do in a way that will be strong.</p>
<p>So yes, the feet are tapered but in practice I can’t see really how this would preserve any wood in real terms. If you didn’t follow my paragraphs above, here’s an easy way to think about it:</p>
<p>Remember in Battlestar Galactica how every piece of paper you ever see is actually an octagon? Like a regular piece of paper but with the corners trimmed off? You might say they do that to <em>save paper</em>. But it doesn’t make sense, because you can’t make paper in octagons. It’s made in sheets. So yes, somewhere there’s a bunch of corners cut off but unless those are super useful in some way it doesn’t represent much <em>resource savings</em>.</p>
<p>Tapered sides would make the coffin <em>lighter</em>, which might matter if it needs to be transported by a horse drawn carriage and then carried by hand, and lowered into the earth by hand. The reduced weight would make a very practical difference there.</p>
<p>And it would also be smaller in volume so perhaps you wouldn’t need to dig as big a hole. Or you could even nest multiple coffins next to each other in a very compact way by alternating them head to toe. </p>
<p>But saving wood? Nope.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s a fair thought but do you have any idea how plentiful wood was in these times? Getting a couple of small cutoffs that will burn in minutes, once each time a person dies, does not produce any meaningful quantity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was thinking the same thing.  Wouldn't save wood. Also would require more cutting and joining so if anything it would increase costs.  Plus when the design was made popular wood was cheap and plentiful and everything was hand made.</p></div>		</li>
