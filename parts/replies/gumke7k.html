			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably 80-90% of them were. Sony had effective software emulation for the PS2 after the first generation of the ps3. The answer is because Sony doesn't want backwards compatibility.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sony doesn't want backwards compatibility, for someone to complain that only 90% of their ps2 collection can be be played. That's a class action lawsuit waiting to happen. &quot;you said back compat for ps2. That should mean all. Not some&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I'm not an expert on these models disks, I do know that Microsoft built a very special copy protection into their 360 DVDs, which required speciao drives </p>
<p>I'm kinda talking out of my butt here because it's been some time since I bothered with these topics, but a possibility is that PS2 disks can't be read with a default dvd drive. </p>
<p>That's in general an important topic because no console manufacturer wants their disks to be rippable by default drives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe they can be read by a regular DVD drive, but do some weird stuff with the format to check it's a genuine game disc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can’t imagine it would be that hard to make it so you could just plug in a usb dvd/cd drive. I use an external striped raid drive for my ps4 so getting game data that way can clearly be done. But they don’t get any new game sales that way. They may sell more units if they did that but the margins on hardware are thin if not negative. If I go buy a ps2 game it’s going to be at the goodwill or GameStop and I likely won’t pay more than a dollar or two for it, none of which goes to Sony or other publishers. If anything it cuts into sales of new games. </p>
<p>They don’t want you playing old games on new hardware unless the new hardware was made specifically for playing old games - s/nes classic, PlayStation classic etc and even these don’t let you play YOUR old games they all come preloaded.</p></div>		</li>
