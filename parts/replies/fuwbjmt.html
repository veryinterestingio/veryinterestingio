<p>This is something I was thinking about with ventilators.  Isnt part of the reason we cough (respiratory sicknesses) when sick is to expel the viruses from out system which reduces the total ammount of viruses in our system.  Wouldnt being on a ventilator just reinfect you with more viruses?  Maybe not, not familiar with ventilators and how the air is circulated.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sort of but not really. When you get a respiratory infection one of the things that happens is that mucus production increases. More mucus means more viral particles get trapped. With the buildup of mucus the body eventually needs to expel some of it, you cough and virus particles go out with it but this is happenstance not loading the viral particles that are in the body up into mucus and then expelling it.</p>
<p>Coughing can also an attempt to drive the fluid out of the lungs When you have cases where viruses attack the cells lining the alveolar this can cause inflammatory fluid to build up in the lungs. This is what COVID-19 does. When you cough you create a negative pressure which sucks the fluid from the alveolar and expels it.</p>
<p>The problem with COVID-19 (and other lower respiratory diseases) is that your capillaries around your alveolar are running wide open due to feedback loops from the immune system so when you cough you get rid of some of what's in there but it quickly refills.</p>
<p>Reinfection is based on the immune system's inability to fight not constant exposure. While the antigen is still being picked up by your body's sentinel cells your B cells are going to be multiplying and cranking out antibodies like crazy. This is why you don't get immediately reinfected after a cold or flu. If the same antigen comes back in there are immune cells with the antibody ready to go and the antigen immediately gets flooded out and destroyed before it can gain a foothold. So while you technically would be &quot;reinfected&quot; it'll typically be totally asymptomatic because no inflammation would be needed before the virus is quickly subdued and wiped out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the explanation.  But still have a question. So the total ammount of viral particles doesn't matter? You produce enough anti-bodies that any ammount of replication of the virus and subsequent total volume of viral particles doesn't really matter?  Is it possible your body (normal human) can't keep up with the production?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand that, but not sure how they are designed. For some reason I thought I read about how they are more like a closed system to prevent the virus from contaminating the room as much.  </p>
<p>I know there is new air, like when you breath out and in, just not sure if there is a large mixing of the air at some place.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ventilator air is not recirculated; fresh &quot;room air&quot; is filtered and pumped into the patient, and the exhalation is dumped back into the room. It helps you breathe by augmenting/taking over the air-pumping action of your lungs, that's it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't say that effective viral clearance by the immune system always means you have the 'right' b cell - firstly, in many viral infections cytotoxic t cells are just as if not more important to eradicating infection, and secondly I would say that a good proportion of asymptomatic people clear the virus with the innate immune system alone (providing the infective dose was fairly low) We know this because you can have automatically infected people that don't develop high levels of antibodies post exposure.</p></div>		</li>
