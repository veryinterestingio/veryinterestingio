			<div class="markdown"><p>So what's being asked then is: &quot;What in your body knows when to change the levels of those chemicals when sunlight isn't involved&quot;.</p>
<p>Where I live, the sun comes up about 3 hours later in the winter than the summer. I still wake up say the same time, regardless of what time I go to bed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For light, it's photoreceptors whcih communicate with the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). This is, by far, the biggest contributor to the sleep/wake cycle. There are also all kinds of receptors throughout the body (temperature, pressure, sound, etc) that likely play a role as well. Your SCN tends to set an internal clock and stay on that. (I feel like this is way outside of an ELI5 at this point) </p>
<p>When you wake up, do you stay in complete darkness? Probably not. Turning on lights and moving around essentially resets the clock. </p>
<p>The exact mechanisms and system is not super well known. We know surprisingly little about sleep. <a href="http://healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/healthy/science/how/NEUROPHYSIOLOGY" target="_blank">This link</a> has a pretty good explanation that goes more in depth. It also links out to other articles that go into further detail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Circadium rhythm. Your body has a clock, which is synced with a 24 hour cycle (actually close to 25). This cycle regulates your hormones, and this is why your brain knows when bedtime and wakeup time is. People with erratic cycles, like not eating around the same time, working on shifts patterns, not drinking abough water etc, mangles your Circadium rhythm a bit. If you have a regulated daily routine, you'll find that you're more in tune with the day cycle.</p>
<p>Light, is a big factor in when humans wake up and go to sleep, this is ancestral and doesn't always apply yo modern life. But your routine will. It always has and always will.</p>
<p>Cavemen (excuse the general term) had the same. They'd get up, forage, hunt, eat and sleep. Originally lived in caves or trees, wherever there was natural shelter. Ambient light would wake them. They'd do their day. Same for us. It's the heat (infrared) that activates us. You still get this, even when the sun isn't up. Light scatters around the earth through refraction, IR can't be seen by us, but enough of it can be felt. I guarantee that if you check the temperature when you're asleep, to when you wake up. There's a significant change in degrees.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Still begs the same initial question, what is that clock and how does it work?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone else can break down all that is wrong with this much deeper.</p>
<p>Unless you are sleeping outside nude or in a tent (during daylight hours), no IR is getting to you indoors with windows closed. </p>
<p>IR is not propagating around the world at night, either. Its the same as visible light, just slightly out of our vision range, but behaves no different from normal light.</p>
<p>IR is not heating you up in the morning, especially if its still dark.  Your body temp is regulated internally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The circadian clock's &quot;time&quot; is set by certain cues called &quot;zeitgebers.&quot; Light is the most important one, but other cues such as eating and physical activity also help set the clock. This process is called entrainment. For a non ELI5 explanation there are some good articles online if you Google &quot;entraining circadian clock.&quot;</p>
<p>This clock knows how to keep time. The hormones melatonin and cortisol rise and fall in approximately 24 hout cycles. This central clock tells all the other smaller clocks in your body what time it is. Even in a dark room, or say a submarine, and even if you weren't eating regularly, your circadian cycle means you want to sleep regularly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder what makes people night owls though? I've never slept well at &quot;normal&quot; times even though I spent 2\3rds of my life trying to wake up in the morning and go to bed early (school, college, then a 9-5 job). Even when i had to be up early for school/work and felt exhausted all day, i'd suddenly be wide awake by 8pm and it took me at least an hour to fall asleep, and even then not before 2am (and this was prior to smart phones so it wasn't like i was laying in bed on my phone!).  </p>
<p>Now I'm self employed and stay up till 5am every night and wake up at noon naturally. Not having to struggle through every weekday trying not to fall asleep at my desk was a big motivator for it. People keep telling me it changes as you get older, but I'm in my mid thirties, and there's no difference whatsoever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TIL about delayed sleep disorder!! I never really thought about it beyond 'i'm a night owl, how bothersome' and didn't realize there are treatments for it haha. I'm pretty happy with my life as it is now, but i probably would have gone to a specialist had i known this was a thing back when i worked an office job!  </p>
<p>My partner also is a night owl and works the late shift at his job, so we have the same sleep pattern. If anything ever changes and he needs to go to day shifts, it's nice to know there may be a way to help ease into that though! (for myself as well. I've gotten so used to having someone awake to have dinner with and spend time with after work!) Thank you so much for your comment!! :-)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But what about the times when people normally get up like 8am, then one day they have to get up a lot earlier for some reason but forget to set the alarm. But still wake up when they need to? Has happened to me several times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like I said, sleep is not super well understood. We have a good idea about the hormones and some of the neural pathways, but that's about it.</p>
<p>Educated guess? Having to wake up earlier would create stress, causing an increase in cortisol and a decreased quality of sleep. As a result, you likely wake up multiple times throughout the night but actually stay up when you wake up the time closest to your planned wake up time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, I find sleep to be very interesting, especially after I discovered Melatonin supplements(I'm a shift worker). I used to suffer badly whenever I had to change my sleep schedule for work, now I just &quot;reset&quot; my internal clock by taking a supplement.</p></div>		</li>
