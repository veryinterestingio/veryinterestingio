			<div class="markdown"><p>Influenza has an average of 1 basepair mutation per virus progeny. Virions of the same infection will turn out to be drastically different. This mutation rate is compounded by their segmented genome, allowing virions of the same initial infection to mix and match their genomes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everyone learns about “antigenic shift and antigenic drift in Virology 101, so they think antigenic shift is as common as drift. In humans, antigenic shift has happened about 4 times in the past 100 years, while antigenic drift happens many times each year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not true. Measles and polio, among many other examples, have no proofreading and mutate just as fast as influenza, yet they don’t show antigenic drift. The difference is not in the proofreading, it’s in the unique ability of influenza proteins to tolerate mutations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, since all life is subject to evolution.  Having milder symptoms can result in a greater reproduction success for the virus.</p></div>		</li>
