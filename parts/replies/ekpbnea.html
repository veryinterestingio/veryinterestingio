<p>My understanding is that fingertips, and fingertips only, can completely re-grow as long as the bone isn't damaged.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The new fingerprints may or may not follow the pattern of your original fingerprints and shows some deformity or deviation depending on the complexity of the lost patch  of fingerprint.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can confirm, at least in the short term, extremely deep and not so wide cuts on fingers can disrupt a fingerprint.</p>
<p>A few months back I cut my left thumb with my knife (DON&quot;T USE KNIVES TO CUT ZIP TIES -- I made a rookie mistake that I knew better). The blade entered at a steep angle on my thumb pad and went all the way to the bone, only reason it stopped when it did. It's completely &quot;healed&quot;, but I've lost most of the feeling in about half my thumb pad. There is a noticeable gap in the fingerprint lines as well as even a few indention grooves in the scar where a finger print line should have been.</p>
<p>EDIT: I did not go and get stitches. I just kept it cleaned and pressed together for about a week before the surface healed back shut. Not sure if stitches would have prevented some of the scarring, thus reducing the thumb print deformity.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>EDIT2: Upon further inspection there is 2 thumbprint groves are seemingly perfect still across the scar, but the majority have the gap. Bodies can heal back in weird ways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't.  When you ate born your dermis in your fingertips form into some patter by random happenstance.  If you don't completely fuck up the dermis, epidermal damage will not be a big deal, since it will grow back to be like the dermis.  If you completely wreck the dermis, it will either not grow back like a fingerprint, or will grow back but look like a different finger print.  Your own, original fingerprint would be lost forever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>is there a way to determine whether there has been such damage? imagine you leave fingerprints on a crime scene, then wreck the dermis, and grow a new fingerprint. now after the healing, the cops come and take your fingerprints, which are now different. can they see if you always had fingerprints like that or would they say &quot;yeah the dermis has been damaged a while ago, those are new fingerprints&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to this, certain injuries can in fact leave scars and other “marks” or disruptions on your fingerprint. If you had a print before a bad injury and then another done after it completely heals, there’s a good chance you will see differences now, but not always. This is one of many reasons why they will take prints from all fingers and palm when booking. One thing CSI workers look at besides ridge lines, are foreign scars caused by cuts, burns, or any other injury because they will remain there also throughout life. There’s actually cases of fugitives using acids to burn off their finger prints In case they ever get caught again, but most the time the guy who’s purposefully removed his fingerprints is probably the guy you’re looking for lol.</p></div>		</li>
