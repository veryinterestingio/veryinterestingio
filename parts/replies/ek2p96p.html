			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks.
I thought we did good work on that tank.
All those rivets on the armor? Were stick on plastic bumpers for the inside of kitchen doors on MDF. Paint it all grey and you get riveted armor plate. Plenty of weapons were a pipe with gobs of epoxy and other stuff to make it look complicated and cool. Lots of time only the face the camera saw was painted up and finished, the other side was struts and bare wood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A friend of mine was an extra in the Tom Cruise version of <em>War of the Worlds</em>. There's a scene where a mob pushes a car into the river. </p>
<p>The car had to be modified before the scene: engine, oil tank, anything else that could cause pollution was removed first. Then, as soon as the cameras stopped, divers went into the river to retrieve the car so it could be hauled out of the river as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>They did multiple takes of that scene, which meant that they had to prepare multiple cars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its all in the budget. the bigger the budget the more a director can specify what scenes look like and how dramatic the visuals can get. Which also extends the time spent shooting. Look at the number of crew spending all day onsite to make a few seconds of product. Each body there aside from the talent is making a minimum of five hundred bucks, and double or triple if its weekend or overtime. Film crew make a sick amount of money being a creative part of a whole crew dedicated to making a convincing illusion of reality. Making instances of illusion to be assembled on the factory floor (cutting room) where the film editor is a crucial part of the final cut.</p></div>		</li>

Colm Feore was once talking about how the food supplied for shooting Pearl Harbor was more than how much it cost to make &quot;22 Short Films about Glenn Gould&quot;</p></div>		</li>
