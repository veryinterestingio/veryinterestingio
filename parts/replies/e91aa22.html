Higher concentrations (like 35%) can damage your gums if applied incorrectly or for too long a duration (or your stomach if swallowed), so allowing any old Joe to buy and use that would expose a company to too much liability.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Higher concentrations can be fatal if swallowed and can damage your lungs just from inhaling the fumes, so it's not really something you should mess with unless a professional is involved. It's fine if you use a small amount at an appropriate concentration and apply it properly, but what qualifies as &quot;small&quot;, &quot;appropriate&quot;, or &quot;properly&quot; are not things you should trust the Internet with.</p></div>		</li>
