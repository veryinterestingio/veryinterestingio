			<div class="markdown"><p>You may just be able to keep it in a ergnomical position then if it doesnt happen on PC unlike the other times. I messed my wrist up from a wonky fall(please learn how to fall correctly as it's one of the common ways to mess up your joints, especially wrists) and I have the same symptoms as you. The only time mine bothers me when Im on PC is when I'm not using my wrist bar or have to use a lot of keys that are far(like using CTRL+___ keybinds) a lot. </p>
<p>You dont need a carpal tunnel specific brace to help, just a regular wrist brace will also work when youre sleeping can help as it keeps your wrist in a neutral postion. That allows the inflammation to go down and keep all your muscles/ligements in a relaxed postition so theyre not being overly contracted or stretched from sleep positions.</p></div>		</li>
