			<div class="markdown"><p>The last I checked, they are a bit of puzzle/mystery still.  With some confidence at least some (the larger) are probably the cores of smaller galaxies that built up the host galaxy over time.  This is supported by their location with respect to the host -- in a spherical halo around the galaxy, far from any (obvious) dense, massive nebulae.  Also, the stellar components appear very old -- older than the host galaxies, even.  </p>
<p>Wasn't there anything about this in the wikipedia?  I'm in a hurry rn ...</p></div>		</li>
