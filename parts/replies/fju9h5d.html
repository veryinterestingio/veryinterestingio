			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a paper about this in 2012 or so. I was at the annual EEID conference in 2013 when the author gave a talk about how Spanish Flu was likely equine and not swine because researchers didn't account for specific genetic drift by zoonotic pool. They just assumed an average and noticed the similarity in antigenic surface between the 1918 strain and H1N1 and assumed it was all swine in zoonotic origin---or at least no one thought to dig deeper.</p>
<p>Everyone was surprised; the results were convincing. After presenting the experiments and results, the author said, &quot;think about it, when in history were millions of horses shipped across the Atlantic to Europe?&quot; A room full of tenured professors and scientists and post-docs and grad students all mumbled a collective &quot;ooooooohhhh&quot;; most impressive thing I've ever seen in academia. A room full of very knowledgeable people having a collective &quot;a ha&quot; moment simulatenously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had to check myself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Between 1914 and 1918, the US sent almost one million horses overseas, and another 182,000 were taken overseas with American troops. This deployment seriously depleted the country's equine population. </p>

<p>So about a million. </p>
<p>But why would moving those horses to Europe (shortly after which they were almost all killed) make an equine flu to being transmitted to humans more likely than a swine flu?</p></div>		</li>

The speaker and lead author was Mike Worobey. <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038%2Fnature13016" target="_blank">This is the paper about that project</a>. Yeah, it's crazy how ubiquitous horses were back in then, and so easy to overlook now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>so the swine flu is a distant cousin of the Spanish flu that shared a common ancestor all the way back in the 1800s and had nothing to do with the Pandemic from 1918?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, that moment when you learn something new. </p>
<p>This “theory”, if true, fills in a lot of epidemiological boxes. Two populations under severe physiological stress (humans and horses in a war zone) in close, fluidly variant contact trade viral exposure amongst each other until one variant manages to cross the zoological barrier. Human immune systems accustomed for a millennia, and immune to equine variants are caught completely unprepared for the key supplied from mutations across species. </p>
<p>This must be explored further. For if it is proven, then we can reasonably surmise that cross species mutations can arise from nearly any species of animal. This could have huge implications in terms of anti-viral vaccine research and protocols.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There aren't any good records from before then. The concept of a virus was identified as a result of the 1918 pandemic and nobody knew how to look for evidence of it before then.  It's quite possible that the virus was around and mutating just as aggressively before then but couldn't cause as much damage because people didn't travel as much or in as cramped conditions until the Americas got involved in ww2</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have learned through history of geographical immunity. This means that a virus or bacteria that is prevalent in one area may not be present in another. Think of the native americans when explorers arrived and brought their diseases with them.</p>
<p>The same is true for other animals. Horses in europe deal with different diseases than those in the Americas. This is why race horses have to be vaccinated for so many diseases. </p>
<p>In conflict where the body is stressed by fatigue and injury the immune system is taxed. Consider that at the time of 1918 most people, not just soldiers, did not have a steady diet of good foods. The body was under nourished and constantly fighting off illnesses. There wasn't a colera outbreak in NY City until a sanitation department was implemented to clean the streets. The lack of exposure lead to a reduction in immunization by exposure.</p>
<p>The fact that horses were used as a means of moving cannon and supplies meant that they were worn down and could easily be exposed to this flu. As mentioned, close exposure to the horses and their spit and waist possibly lead to the rapid spread of the disease. The returning of soldiers who were infected also lead to the wide spread of the disease across the world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Influenza always mutates but it didn't mutate aggressively to become so deadly to humans. The issue lies in that the virus basically uses the blue print of its previous host which often has deadly effects in the new host while the old host is often fine or only slightly sick.</p>
<p>Viruses don't &quot;want&quot; to kill their host, they want to survive and multiply. This is also the reason regular influenza strains became less deadly over time since the mutated strains that were less deadly could spread easier and farther. These mutations are also the reason we can't develop a vaccine against all influenza but can only analyse current strains, predict the most common ones in the coming season and then try to vaccinate against that. Some times it works better than others. That's why it is also unlikely we will be able to vaccinate against coronavirus completely and if we can't contain it it will join the other influenza strains circling the globe and become less deadly over time.</p>
<p>Also, not only does the virus change but the human immune system adapts over time to better deal with the infection. A good example of non-adaptation would be native americans and settlers dying to viruses from one group that the other group hadn't adapted to yet.</p>
<p>This is the reason Zoonosis is so dangerous. Bats and other creatures carry a bunch of coronaviruses and other diseases and there is always the possibility of a virus making the species jump especially when we encroach on nature and discover new viruses and also due to unsafe food practices such as wet markets.</p></div>		</li>
