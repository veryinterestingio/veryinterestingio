			<div class="markdown"><p>The japanese knife is typically flat ground on the right (or on the left if you buy a lefty knife) and slightly concave on the other so it can slice straight. It is extremely sharp, it's only weak because an extreme 15% angle means it's thin for slicing. You can make a single bevel extremely strong, like a chisel, or bone cleaver. But it won't slice, like a chisel. In the japanese restaurant I worked at, we switched to a small bonesaw for bones. You're right there's no japanese magic, it's the blade geometry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would it be sharper? Isn't sharpness based on the thickness of the apex? Why would there be a difference?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless the double bevel knives have the same angle as the single bevel. An isosceles triangle instead of a right triangle.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah it'll have the same angle, and be ambidextrous, but it'll be even weaker at the edge and is double the work to grind or sharpen, it works great for double hollow ground razors but not food</p></div>		</li>
