			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the only thing that could really go seriously wrong on the surface of Mars is an equipment failure, and it would be very difficult to justify in the story how they would all get away without the MC if it was that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only thing I could think of is maybe some sort of cave collapse or ground subsiding under the lander, which might get it slowly tipping and ensure they need to make a run for it.  But that doesn't leave the opportunity for Watney to be lost in the storm or lose suit telemetry.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Or a meteorite hitting the area close to them. Theoretically possible, just very unlikely it would happen at that moment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are lots of things on the surface of Mars that could cause equipment failures.  The dirt is very fine, sharp and can have a static charge causing failures in sensitive seals, valves and electronics.  Mars dirt also has low levels of perchlorates that are reactive chemicals that harm humans and degrade equipment.  Plus, there are solar &amp; cosmic rays that zap electronics and cause cancer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if maybe they should have had something else, like a distant asteroid strike on the surface which blasted a shockwave over the landing site. (Yes, a less powerful one than it would have been on Earth, but still enough to make the astronauts scramble.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh wow this is kind of eye opening. I always pictured Mars having kind of the same atmosphere density and air pressure earth does- just hot or cold and arid and dead. I always wondered why it was so difficult to send people there to setup a base (outside of the enormous astronomical cost)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the air is so thin that it is extremely hard to get lift from winged aircraft and even parachutes are relatively useless be there just isnt any air for the fabric to catch.</p>
<p>That's why NASA has had to resort to absurdly cool, but effective means of getting things to the surface, like sky cranes and giant bouncy &quot;bubble wrap&quot;</p>
<p>They cant use the atmosphere to slow down to safe landing speeds</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats crazy. Did it ever have a dense atmosphere and just somehow lose it? Or is it generally thought it was always thin like that</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A good point I heard on one of Frasier Cain's recent videos. Because the atmosphere is so thin, even if you got hurricane strength winds you wouldn't even be able to fly a kite.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder, would jetpacks be an effective way of personal transport on Mars given these facts. It's the only mode of aerial travel that'd probably benefit from a low pressure atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>gravity is what keeps our atmosphere here.  the energy levels of our favourite gases do not exceed earth's escape velocity.  the reason we keep dropping robots there is it is habitable, cause it ain't too close to the sun, and ain't too far to well, be too far.</p></div>		</li>
