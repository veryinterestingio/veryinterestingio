<p>If you want to go on a deep dive into this, check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Monetary_Theory" target="_blank">Modern Monetary Theory</a>. It involves a discussion of deficits that dispels a lot of the myths that come up when people try to use personal debt as a metaphor for government debt. Debt is completely different when you print your own money.</p>

<p>Government debt does not exist in a vacuum, the government is spending it on something. If the government spending stimulates the economy to grow faster, the increase in tax revenue will offset the debt.</p>

<p>That's only if the tax rate is high enough. The US government never cuts the tax rate thankfully... Also, it is not guaranteed that government spending will stimulate the economy at all. <strong><em>Shitloads</em></strong> of government spending is funneled directly into the pockets of rich tycoons via no bid contracts. Those rich people don't spend the money, nor are they taxed particularly highly on it.</p></div>		</li>
