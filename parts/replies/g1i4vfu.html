			<div class="markdown"><p>Imo that was the point of Obamacare. They of course wanted more but they were willing to get in what they could because it would become a precedence for more later. Also I think they were hoping that it would become as loved as Medicare and social security.</p>
<p>I definitely think that it will be difficult to remove aspects like preexisting conditions and allowing kids to be on parents insurance until 26. So it accomplished some of its goals. But obviously because the last 6 years of presidency Obama had a republican senate it was difficult to pass anything else let alone more healthcare.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The funny thing is, if you talk to someone thats vehemently against it, tell them everything it does, but call it Affordable Care Act(its official name)  as if its separate from Obamacare, they are generally more likely to look on it favorably.</p>
<p>It definitely has its problems, and was essentially sabotaged during its creation in hopes of it dying on the florr of the House or Senate, but it was a step in the right direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The biggest flaw of Obamacare was that it was gutted by the senate. It had potential to lay the groundwork for genuinely affordable healthcare, but the pockets of the rich are never full.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am self employed in a major city and for me, Obamacare has been great. The marketplace provides me a convenient way to shop for health insurance every year and compare plans. Because of the regulations in place, I know all plans will perform certain ways (ie no lifetime limits) so I don’t have to worry about reading fine print. There’s still lots of things to compare between plans: deductibles, networks, HSA eligibility, etc. But it makes it possible and reasonable for me to compare plans which I greatly appreciate. Because I’m in a big city, I have many plans to choose from. I realize those in low population and less healthy zip codes are not always as lucky.</p></div>		</li>
