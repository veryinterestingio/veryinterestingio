			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm... not sure what you mean, with pain not being an emotion? What exactly do you think pain is, if not an emotion?</p>
<p>You might be right though, I've never thought about it too deeply, I've always just assumed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pain is a sensation, a signal traveling through your nervous system. Emotions are chemicals released by your brain into your blood system. Roughly speaking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree that both pain and emotions are body events meant to signal something to the owner of the body. I think we tend to associate &quot;emotions&quot; as those events accompanied by thoughts - but of course we all sometimes experience emotions out of nowhere that we don't fully understand. Interesting to contemplate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of these other comments hit the nail on the point I was trying to make, i.e. I understand pain as a physical sensation and reaction of the nervous system from an outside stimuli. Emotional 'pain' (cortisol) in excess can lead to negative health effects and physical pain, but.... Honestly I'm just wondering what makes your eyes water when you step on a goat head, or your cat scratches your face</p></div>		</li>
