			<div class="markdown"><p>That was a great read. I wonder how wide the applications of blood flow restriction training are in physiotherapy and rehab. Seems like a great way to increase the efficiency of exercise in patients where factors may be hampering their mobility.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're both right and wrong. That study explores the effect of metabolic stress on hypertrophy, but nowhere does it say it is the only cause or most likely cause (spoiler alert: because it's not). </p>
<p>Metabolic stress results in hypertrophy, but progressive overload (mechanical tension and volume) and eccentric overload (what OP asked about) both cause hypertrophy as well. So while lactic acid production does result in hypertrophy and growth, it is definitely not the only or main cause  - progressive overload is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Real myofibrillar hypertrophy is probably some combination of CNS stimulation and metabolic/mechanical stress triggering certain pathways that end up signalling for protein synthesis. Exactly how this takes place is actually unknown. Needless to say it's a very complex topic, for example initial strength gain (first 8 weeks or so) when starting training is mostly nervous system adaptation to activate more muscle fibers rather than hypertrophy. There's also sarcoplasmic hypertrophy which is simple increase of fluid volume in muscle cells (which is why strength isn't strictly correlated with size).</p>
<p>I'm really unqualified to go more in depth though, what I said is basically colloquial knowledge from reading and some personal experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since it seems everyone is giving you ELI-PhD answers, basically when you put your muscles under stress, your body responds by telling your cells to grow more muscle tissue in that area so it can be more prepared for the next time that stress occurs. That’s why you have to progressively overload on your exercises, so that you’re constantly giving the muscles the signal that they need to keep growing to be prepared for new stresses. </p>
<p>This part is just my opinion, but it’s an educated and experienced opinion: stimulation &gt; devastation</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah its well know in the field of mechanobiology and tissue engineering that mechanical loading has a big impact on cellular activities. Particulaly bone formation and muscle growth. As you explained, there's no need for tissue damage to occur. The mere presence of mechanical forces are felt by cells mechanosensitive proteins and pathways (YAP/TAZ, Piezo1) and influences their behavior.</p></div>		</li>
