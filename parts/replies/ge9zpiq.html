			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the prevailing theory is that an infection triggers an immune reaction that causes the immune system to attack the insulin-creating islet cells causing type I diabetes.</p>
<p>Doctors often observe a higher rate of other auto-immune diseases in Type I diabetics than normal so thats why they suspect a link.  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4219937/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4219937/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4219937/</a></a></p>

<p>Since they thought you had type II, you may have lost your insulin cells over time as described here. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-1-diabetes/expert-answers/lada-diabetes/faq-20057880" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-1-diabetes/expert-answers/lada-diabetes/faq-20057880" target="_blank">https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-1-diabetes/expert-answers/lada-diabetes/faq-20057880</a></a></p></div>		</li>
