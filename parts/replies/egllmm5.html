			<div class="markdown"><p>Materials testing lab manager and FAA paving project manager here. Can confirm that u/zipherus's answer is spot-on. I'll add a few things: </p>
<p>HMAC (hot-mix asphaltic concrete)  like any concrete, is an inherently heterogeneous material. That means that even with good QC/QA practices, you're going to get portions of the paved surface that are too fine (too much small rock) too coarse (too much big rock), or have too high or too low an oil content (which affects how the rocks stick together). </p>
<p>Also, HMAC isn't just a slurry of random rock and tar; these are highly specific and complex mix designs intended to produce specific product qualities based on project need and price point. A good mix design will compact over time to a 'sweet spot' of roughly 4% 'voids'; that is, empty spaces between the mix. Due to over-compaction or under-compaction, or just because of a sub-standard pocket of mix placed in that spot, some locations end up with a higher or lower level of compaction than other locations. </p>
<p>Insufficient compaction leads to 'rutting' where tire pressure over time continue to compact an area; the differential shape of that area's surface as compared to the surrounding pavement can lead to pieces breaking into small chunks, creating an 'alligator' looking surface (lack of sufficient tack coat also leads to this, as does subgrade failure). Also common is over-compaction, which leads to 'ravelling' where loose rock breaks off under the repeated load-cycles of many tires over time.</p>
<p>Fun fact: even though most HMAC is designed so that the compaction over time stops around 96% of maximum density (the 4% voids I was talking about earlier), in practice, for economic and practical reasons, it's common to compact HMAC to only 91% or 92% during placement (leaving 9% or 8% voids). Why? Because A) it's REALLY hard to get that last few percentage points without beating the mix until it 'tenderizes' and starts segregating (making it susceptible to ravelling as the coarse particles rise to the top, like shaking a can of mixed nuts) and B) why take the time and expense when the wheels of the vehicles on the road will compact it slowly over months and years until it hits the sweet spot? That't right, your car's tires are helping to finish the compaction of the road. So, like, thanks for that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, there are times that holes in pavement are cut in order to locate utilities or take soil samples for testing. If the compaction isn't done sufficiently when backfilling, the asphalt may sink leaving a rather perfect looking pothole. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spot on. You can do as much QA/QC as possible, but there are still real world issues outside of control. Construction Manager here.. Generally the equipment and/or material you use in the industry are not perfect and will have random spots of mis laying. Concrete slabs also have this issue. One spot that gets an accidental tiny amount of water poured will cause flaking. </p>
<p>Also, snow plows definitely help find these weak spots in the pavement. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hypothetically, could we build roads that are pothole immune? I've noticed that Roman Roads still exist and are still functional to this day. Being in Italy, they avoid the freeze/unfreeze cycle of northern climates that makes it easier to maintain. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it's possible, but if you penciled out the total costs over the service life of the road, as compared to the usual methodology of ensuring serviceability, and accepting that repairs will eventually be needed, it wouldn't make sense to pave a road like that. It would be like making a washing machine that didn't need service except once a century; we could probably do it, but it would cost far more than what would make economic sense. That said, future developments in paving technology could render everything I just said obsolete.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Roman roads were built to handle groups of soldiers marching and similar light loads. Our roads have to handle massive lorries and trucks with badly weighted loads bouncing up and down on them. </p>
<p>A number of roman roads also have broken. We have confirmation bias because there are so many and a number survived. If they had been having heavy trucks drive over them for several millennia, they'd have probably broken.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes the original Davison freeway in Detroit had a meter of water floated on it and it didn't need replacing until 1996, it was built in 1942. Yes we can do this, but it's almost impossible to get funding like this in the modern era.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about the morons that paved our roads here in Monroe (NC) and then proceed to slice off every entrance to every neighborhood because they had to lay new water pipe down... essentially leaving a gaping wound with access to each layer you described.</p>
<p>Oh they filled it with gravel because that will totally solve the problem. It has been months now and Iâ€™m sure they plan to finish the job but it is clear by what you describe that damage is already being done.</p></div>		</li>
