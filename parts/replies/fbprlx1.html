<p>If there is any contradictory data during development the cell is usually killed off. In fact, in T cell development, 98% of T cells don’t develop the correct suite of cell surface proteins and are subsequently apoptosed. </p>

<p>To be fair, that's somewhat unusual compared to other cell types. It's because T cells (and B cells) need to be able to recognize foreign antigens (or antigen-MHC complexes), which is achieved by the cells scrambling part of their DNA to generate all kinds of receptor surfaces that can recognize all kinds of things. Those cells that end up recognizing the body's own components, or nothing at all, are killed off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The cells of the epidermis aren't killed through apoptosis though, so I don't think you can include them in your examples. I agree death is common, but u/CrateDane is pointing out that T cells and B cells are unusual in that positive and negative selection occurs prior to the cell having any use or function in the organism. That's unusual.</p>
<p>Also, to echo u/Odeon42, your understanding of virus replication seems to be a bit flawed. Measles virus is an RNA virus and replicates entirely in the host cells cytoplasm. It doesn't have a reverse transcriptase and doesn't enter the nucleus. Also, your use of 'incorporation' leads me to believe that your understanding of DNA viruses might also be off a bit. Most DNA viruses don't insert themselves in the host genome (as I'm interpreting your use of incorporate). They just exist inside the nucleus and are transcribed like any other DNA material. Virus incorporation into the host genome (like with HIV) results in proviruses which have an entirely different set of considerations and lifecycles than most other viruses.</p>
<p>Sorry if I'm being a bit pedantic, just want to be sure that people reading this post are given the most accurate information.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Measles is not a retrovirus and thus does not incorporate into host DNA.  Only a select few viruses can incorporate into host genome (retroviridae).  Also, your description of T cell depletion is inaccurate.  It is not necessarily about the suite of cell surface proteins.  It is more to do with the affinity of the TCR to MHC-self peptide complexes that drives depletion.</p></div>		</li>
