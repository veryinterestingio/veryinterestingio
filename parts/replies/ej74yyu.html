			<div class="markdown"><p>If TacoDelMorte’s response is accurate, perhaps sexual screams are in response to a sensory overload that comes from the experience. Much like you would scream when pain is overwhelming, maybe we’re encouraged to scream during all sorts of things?</p>
<p>Could be an individual thing. Like, I don’t scream out from pain, I just clench up and bottle it in, or I freeze up when I’m startled instead of crying out, and I don’t feel inclined to make noises in sexy times. Makes me think that they could all be linked to personality types, like introvert/extrovert kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading on why the &quot;o&quot; face resembles a painful face. In MRI tests, subjects experiencing an orgasm had the same part of the brain responsible for pain light up. They weren't sure why at the time but it kind of explained why we make that face during orgasms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sensory overload thing makes sense. You can scream from overwhelming pain/pleasure, but you can also scream in excitement or joy or fear, like when you're riding a roller coaster.</p>
<p>As to why some people scream at certain stimulation and some don't, it probably is an individual thing. A shy person probably isn't going to draw attention to themself by yelling when they stub their toe or something, so they learn to redirect it into a different action (I personally hold my breath and clench my hands when I'm in pain).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m an introvert and I hold my breath instead of screaming. I may gasp in between for air, but I’m no screamer. This applies to both pain and pleasure for me. I’ve never even thought about the correlation until now. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bonobos, one of our closest relatives (and one of the only other animals that engage in all sorts of kinky sex purely for fun), also moan during sex. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep16135" target="_blank">We believe it is a way of the female signaling to other males that it's sexy time</a>.</p>
<p>See, if a bunch of dude bonobos bang the same chick, and she gets pregnant, none of the males will know which is the father. Because of this, they'll all assume they could be the father. This means that each Male will take turns caring for the baby and helping to raise it, rather than murdering it and fathering their own (as most other mammals will do).</p>
<p>It's believed that humans moan for the same reason. We don't need to worry about infanticide anymore, but that behavior hasn't gone away</p></div>		</li>

<p>sometimes it really sucks at multitasking</p>

<p>Multitasking involves using the same piece of software to perform two or more tasks concurrently. Humans can walk and talk, because they both involve separate pieces of software. Humans cannot concentrate on driving and texting because they both involve some of the same pieces of software.</p>
<p>There're some interesting ongoing studies regarding swearing and pain reduction. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard the part of the brain that controls swearing is in other mammals when they're warning of a predator or danger being nearby, so this would indicate a partial reason for swearing when something bad or surprising happens is partially because we have an instinct to warn those around us of danger (and quickly, which may be partially why swear words tend to have few syllables). This is also my be at least partially why swear words are considered offensive, as your society should stigmatize &quot;crying wolf&quot; unless there's an actual wolf (or other danger).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Notice that when people are lost in car or are looking for where to go, they tend to turn off the radio.  Listening and problem solving overlap in the brain so you’ll unconsciously reduce audio stimuli to better concentrate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m interested in the analogy here: where do you draw the line between software and hardware? There are physical parts being the hardware of the brain we can attribute these reactions to (amygdala, hypothalamus). But I understand that similarly we “develop the software” by how we learn to control our mind to redirect pain. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say the brain and body would be hardware, while software is all the neural pathways that have formed throughout the brain and body. Like burn marks on a cd, or electrical load on sectors of a hard drive. After all, software is stored physically on hardware.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the analogy is using its terms badly. Multitasking is <strong>hardware</strong> running multiple tasks. Tasks are software.  The analogy works great if you make those changes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All the midwives at the hospital told me to shut up during the labour and birth of my son, because the screaming wouldn't help relieve the pain... but I thought it helped a lot. Probably more because I was screaming so much that I scared the rest of the birth-giving-women and staff in the marternity ward. They could just have told me that and I propably would have tried to hush myself down a bit more. </p></div>		</li>
