			<div class="markdown"><p>How do they isolate the exercise equipment? I remember seeing a video (smarter every day I think) showing how they use pistons to create a constant pressure while simulating squats and don't understand how that machine could be separate from the station. I'm not disputing you because I can definitely see how repetitive movements could affect the station's motion I just can't see how the exercise equipment could be separate and not float around hitting everything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The same way you isolate any vibrating equipment on earth as it happens.  If you've got a vague idea of what frequency the vibrations are going to be, and what kind of peak force they'll have, you can mount the equipment on a platform separated from the station by springs and dampers tuned so that the majority of the energy is transmitted to the station over a wider frequency range, and a lot of it's dissipated (as heat mostly, though it's fairly trivial in terms of the thermal load it's creating). A similar process is used in submarines to stop the (very loud) engines and turbines and whatnot transmitting any noise into the ocean. A similar design process goes into &quot;mass dampers&quot; on engines</p>
<p>EDIT - some clarifications</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Muscles have an efficiency of about 25%, which means that the energy you dissipate from your body directly as heat is at least 3x as large as the heating caused by the dampening of the vibrations caused by the exercise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When it's in use it's not bolted to the station. If I remember I think there's some straps to keep it suspended away from walls that won't transfer a lot of movement. So a leg press/dead lift machine has its own floor plate and hydraulic arm to pull against while you float independent of the station. Some with an exercise bike. You strap into the pedals and the seat and float around pedaling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From the wiki article, it seems to be attached to the station by way of a “bag” of sorts that creates effectively a fluid bearing. The Astronauts are tied to the treadmill itself, not the station, so the vibrations are mostly absorbed by the fluid bearing.</p>
<p>Edit: scratch that, the wiki article has a section talking about the latest treadmill on the station. It’s supported by dampers and springs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The original ISS plan called for a second station that would float only a few tens of meters away from the primary station. This second one would be a full sized orbital drydock where the astronauts could build spaceships without wearing suits, then when the ship was done the air gets pumped out, the doors opened, and slowly it gets nudged out. The two were kept separate to avoid the vibrations of construction work from harming the science experiments.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this drydock did not get funded.</p></div>		</li>
