			<div class="markdown"><p>And it’s why he’s not just another scientist, it’s why he’s Einstein- he gave birth to the simple idea that beyond physics the language of the universe is mathematics, all of it, no exceptions. Beyond that scientifically correct leap is also all the potential of humanity- it’s only a problem so far as we cannot define it, and if we can define it, we can conquer it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That wasn't exactly a new idea. Einstein might have been the first to put what Maxwell's equations were screaming at us together, but Laplace's demon is roughly the same idea, and logical positivism was huge at the time while being only marginally different from what you just described. The only difference being that they believed that mathematics described the universe well while not actually being the universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It must be so strange exploring all these ideas when they're far from sure. Right now a few labs might be toying with new theories that 2100s will take for granted.</p></div>		</li>
