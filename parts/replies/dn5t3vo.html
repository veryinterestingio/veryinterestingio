			<div class="markdown"><p>Good points. Also, it's far more depressing when you're reading the book collections and Charlie Brown is getting dumped on a thousand times in a row - one strip a day didn't pack the same sad punch. It was more of a relatable moment. It's like the difference between reading a wistful FB post and reading the person's sad memoir.    </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Y'know, this is probably it. Being exposed to all of Charlie Brown's misfortunes all at once compared to people who got one strip a day. </p>
<p>The movies have no excuse though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's exactly this that makes modern commercialization of peanuts so disappointing.  Peanuts was depressing, relatable and real. That's what gave it it's heart. Charles Shulz wanted the strip to die with him. There were no new strips, but it lived on like a zombie in the products created after he died. My coworker has a mug with a picture of Schroeder kissing Lucy surrounded by hearts and the word &quot;smile&quot; plastered over them. There is just so much wrong with that mug. The heart of Peanuts has been completely lost just to make a few bucks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The theme of the Charlie Brown Christmas special is blatantly anti-commercialism which makes it sadly ironic that ABC, who airs it every year, has cut parts out of it to make time to air more commercials.</p></div>		</li>
