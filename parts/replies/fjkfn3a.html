			<div class="markdown"><p>Stage &quot;hypnosis&quot; is a combination of audience plants and human nature to go along with the crowd.  If it worked in any real way militaries and corporations would be, quack, excuse me.  They'd be, quack.  Sorry.  They'd be using it everywhere, quack!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I was not a plant and I partook in a stage hypnosis show, and I can tell you, it's 100% bullshit (at least the one I was in). Frankly I doubt they use plants, because I simply think you don't need to.</p>
<p>One of the things they did (and I've seen this in other shows) is they start by asking for volunteers, so you start with people who already want to be part of it. Then they do a &quot;weeding out&quot; process, where they say you're hypnotized but are going to get rid of the people who aren't susceptible enough, what they're really doing is getting rid of people who don't play along convincingly.</p>
<p>So they just try and get the audience members who will play along the most, and then they give pretty explicit instructions so it primes you to be able to play along well.</p>
<p>One of the subtle things you can observe that tell you this is all fake bullshit is that people will pick the thing that is the best mime rather than the actual way you'd do it. Like if you tell the group of hypnotized people &quot;you're being pulled over by a cop, roll down your window and give them your ID&quot;. You'll see a bunch of people doing the hand crank motion, way more people than have hand crank windows. That's because pushing a button isn't a good mime, cranking a window is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a ten year fear of flying. Just the thought of going to an airport could make me break into sweats. When my kids were young I wanted to take them to Disney. So I went to a hypnotherapist. One session in a recliner in his office where he had relaxing things to look at, and calm music. Once I was relaxed he did a hypnosis session. I was awake and alert during the whole thing. He did a relaxation exercise, and a visualization of walking into a park, and sitting down and experience the relaxing setting. Then went into visualizing getting ready for a trip, excitement of going, heading to airport, etc. also addressed anxiety i May feel but it is because I’m going to a new place. I forget how it ended but he recorded it on a CD and I had to listen to it in a quiet place every day for 28 days or more. I was able to fly and have ever since. One additional thing that I gained from it was on the CD, the background music was a classical music piece and now whenever I fly, I listen to it on takeoff and landing and it immediately relaxes me. Just my experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes you’re probably right—I wasn’t ever under a hypnotic trance. He was called a hypnotherapist. I had done regular therapy for two years prior— and while it helped general anxiety a bit, it didn’t get me anywhere closer to flying. I was at a point where I was open to trying anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That <em>is</em> what real hypnosis is, though. It's not putting you completely under the hypnotherapist's control, it's just putting you in to a calm, relaxed state where deep-seated problems can be analyzed and worked through instead of stressed over.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean the full idea behind hypnosis is to put the mind in a state called Trance. This isn't so rare though, it happens all the time: when you're driving and your mind seems to shut off into its own world, or when you go into the &quot;zone&quot; gaming, working, playing sports. Meditation is about entering this state at will. You can actually measure what happens in the brain when this is available. It's a state of focus and certainty.</p>
<p>One of the things is that you become emotionally calm. What really happens is that you shut out distractions and focus on the &quot;task at hand&quot;, this includes emotions related to things that aren't the &quot;task at hand&quot;. A hypnotist will generally try to induce this state without such task, which leads to the mind choosing interesting ones. You can get people becoming uninhibited, dissociated or detached, you can become very susceptible to what people tell you, it's easy to believe them. Generally a hypnotist will try to use the last one to recommend things. You don't &quot;loose control&quot; but simply become more willing to play along things. Someone tells you that you should act like a duck because it'd be hilarious, some people think its dumb and refuse, but other people think it's hilarious and not being afraid of what other people will think, happily play along. Things don't stress you out unless someone mentions that it should. Memories also seem to have different storage within hypnotism, as it's common to not remember everything fully, I personally don't know if people can choose to forget something in this state or if being in such a state makes it hard to recover the memories in normal conscious state (just like you can't usually remember your dreams).</p>
<p>Generally the state above is useful, but I think that it's more common to </p>
<p>So lets go and list the myths of hypnotism and what it does:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hypnotism does not make you do things you do not want to do. Hypnotism can reduce your aversion to do something that you'd like to do but scares you. You also don't gain strength or abilities you didn't have before, you simply aren't afraid to hurt yourself when you do something.</li>
<li>Hypnotism cannot recover lost memories. You don't gain the ability to do anything you couldn't before inside your mind either.
<ul>
<li>But it lets you recover painful or stressful memories without being stressed or in pain (this is called mindfulness, and it's useful to use this ability to process the day and events in a healthy way that can break vicious cycles of pain reinforcement, as in PTSD).</li>
<li>Some memories can be so painful to recover that the brain simply doesn't do it. The most extreme form of this is Depressive Psychosis where the mind finds reality so painful it decides to, against it's normal better judgement, prefer imagination as reality over what happens. In a trance state you can access this memories that are blanks (or a weird and incomplete fake story that with some prodding can be shown to be illogical).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>People can manipulate you while in a hypnotic state. You are more open to listen and consider what they say, which makes you vulnerable to suggestions.
<ul>
<li>While this isn't inherent to trance, a hypnotist tries to put you in a state where the task at hand is hearing what the mind says. People can drop suggestions and events that tinge your memories or events. But these don't erase or rewrite your mind either and you do have access to reality.</li>
<li>It used to be that people would use hypnosis with drugs that also made your mind even more dissociated from reality, this makes it easier to manipulate or suggest memories, feelings, etc. It doesn't mind-control you even then, and at the worst will be a really bad trip. There's a reason the CIA uses good ol' fashioned torture, and not drugs in &quot;special interrogations&quot;.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hypnosis has no more permanent effect than any other could. Even suggestions are no worse than someone telling you something very disturbing. But hypnosis may work as a placebo, it may be enough of an excuse for people to think themselves capable or willing to do something. It may also make them notice some things they do on their own from before.</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem is that your suggestibility also makes it hard to know what is real or not, it's easy to let our imagination take us, and in a trance state it can go so far that it can plant false memories or other issues. It's probably better (not a psychologist though) to use self-induced and self-guided trance, basically what you do when meditating, and there's therapy that aims to do this, like CBP.</p>
<p>I have used hypnotic-like techniques to help people calm down (and really that's the only thing that works consistently) even bringing them down from a panic attack (but also, good to deal with bad trips).</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe something, generally the room you're in. I keep adding more questions and getting them deeper and deeper into their observations of what they are seeing, so much they enter a trance state observing the room. I use a relaxing tone and then switch to ask of their bodies and make them relax it. Keep going through that and they calm down. Last time I used this a friend couldn't sleep due to suicidal thoughts, this got them sleeping through the night.</li>
<li>For people with a bit more practice in meditation I ask them to focus on their breathing. I remind them they can get distracted, that when they do they should acknowledge the distraction, understand why it affected them, and then let it go because right now the focus is on breathing.</li>
<li>Focus on a toy that moves or something, generally that will not stop. A simple pendulum may work.</li>
<li>Focus on relaxing fingers, one at a time until hands are fully relaxed. I generally break this with a clap at the end (if done correctly you end up with really soft hands and white spots on the palms, not sure what stimulates oil production but it works).</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I use breathing-based self-hypnosis to help myself fall asleep in hot (28°C+) days/nights, so I can confirm your info.</p>
<p>I focus myself on breathing ever slower/softer while keeping watch on my heart's pumping rythm. Using this method, I can usually remember the exact moment I fall asleep. It's amazing.</p></div>		</li>
