			<div class="markdown"><p>In his novel, The Terminal Man, Michael Crichton has written about doctors doing brain surgery to correct seizures in a man that cause him to become violent and one of the doctors is approached by a man off the street asking if they would do this as an elective surgery.</p>
<p>The man is interested because an implant could also be designed to stimulate the pleasure centers in the brain directly - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de_b7k9kQp0" target="_blank">just like the infamous experiment on rats that press a button to deliver a stimulation to their pleasure center until they're too exhausted to press it</a>. A small dose of electricity in the right spot could circumvent the need to take drugs to get high.</p>
<p>One of the doctors says the man is an ELAD - an ELectricity ADdict, just waiting for the right time when an unethical doctor could perform the surgery cheaply enough.</p>
<p>This was written a long time ago, but still envisioned the possibility of such a thing in the future.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I still think drugs would be preferred though because of how they interact. Acid, for instance, when it bonds to a serotonin receptor, the receptor basically refuses to let it go. That's why the high lasts for 14 hours. I believe amphetamines have some sort of unique properties as well that causes the high to last for so long.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This means if you want a high, you have to inject directly into the brain, which is difficult for obvious reasons. Even then, it may not be sufficient. In different regions of the brain, dopamine has different effects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems like you know your stuff and like a real 5y.o. I have further questions that I will ask anyone who seems smart to me.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Does dopamine naturally occur in all of the brain, or are there parts which are sensitive but are normally not triggered?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do we know what dopamine does for all places where it occurs? What about in the rest of the nervous system?</p>
</li>
<li>Are these different regions of the brain in the same place for everyone? Are 'regular' dosis the same for everyone?</li>
</ul>
<p>Because it seems like its a matter of time untill we figure out how to induce the trip that OP is looking for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Some bits have more dopamine receptors that others, or have different versions of dopamine receptors. Dopamine release is often at the end of a pathway from one brain region to another. The upstream region activates the downstream region using dopamine. So again it matters a lot where dopamine is released on the effect more of it has. One of the reasons that all psychiatric medications have side effects is because you're turning up or down neurotransmitters everywhere, but only really interested in the effect in specific regions.</p>
<p>No, but we're trying very hard. One difficulty is that you actually need your whole brain working well to do anything. In recent years we now think of the brain as overlapping and interconnected networks that &quot;do things&quot; rather than modular bits that do things.</p>
<p>As far as we can tell, maybe. Everyone's brain is a different size and slightly different shape. If you're doing brain imaging research one of the first steps you make after doing an MRI scan is &quot;standardising&quot; by stretching and squishing the 3D image so they fit into the &quot;standard&quot; brain shape. Only then do you compare activation between people or between tasks.</p></div>		</li>
