			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus you only recognize this stuff when it's on your mind. People can't remember what they ate this time last week.</p>
<p>Sure the models are scarily accurate, but people don't even realize the information they gave it to begin with.</p>
<p>It's like learning a new word etc too, you'll pick up on seeing it frequently right after but that isn't to say you haven't seen it hundreds of times before without paying attention or remembering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This plus you're pretty much ignoring all the irrelevant ads, which is the algorithm's attempt and miss at finding something you might be interested in but haven't specifically searched for yet. Who knows what its actual correct rate is and how many just look like random untargeted ads.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where did you watch the movie?</p>
<p>If it's a streaming site it's a near guarantee that several advertisers know about it.</p>
<p>Even if it was a DVD/cable there's a non zero chance that it's been logged somewhere because of smart features in television.</p>
<p>If a movie that had a surge in popularity and you are group a the type of person who would enjoy that franchise then it could just be coincidence that it was recommended on the same day. </p>
<p>If it was a rip from an old movie you got from a friend on a flash drive that you watched on a whim then idk man it's as much black magic to me as you at that point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Deep in the settings of your smart TV are privacy checkboxes. Samba is the provider on my Sony. Basically, they are scanning the images on the TV to identify what you're watching on cable. If you're watching it in an app like Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, etc, your ISP is selling you out. Congress voted to allow your broadband provider to &quot;listen&quot; to your internet traffic and sell your data. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/28/house-vote-sj-34-isp-regulations-fcc/" target="_blank">https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/28/house-vote-sj-34-isp-regulations-fcc/</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe it’s a weird coincidence, but a similar thing happened to me. I was talking with a friend about a dog she adopted and not really knowing what kind of mutt he was, then a day or two later Instagram was serving her ads about pet DNA analysis.</p></div>		</li>
