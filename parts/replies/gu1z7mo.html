<p>where you want to stand on the ground and take a photo of a building without having some of it go out of focus because the top of the building is further away from you than the bottom of the building </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Small quibble: The use of shift in architectural photography has to do with perspective, not depth of focus (if it were just depth of focus, you'd use a small aperture and call it a day).  </p>
<p>For architectural photography, you want parallel lines in reality to remain parallel in your image. This requires your imaging sensor (or film) to be parallel to the face of your building. The problem is that, with a conventional lens and for most convenient distances, this requires either an ultrawide lens + cropping (which brings its own issues and results in low resolution), or an accessible building across the street to get yourself halfway up (or the power of flight).   </p>
<p>If you just use a reasonable size lens and point it straight at the building, you only get to see the bottom of hte building: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pc-lens-demo-levelcamera.svg" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pc-lens-demo-levelcamera.svg" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pc-lens-demo-levelcamera.svg</a></a>  </p>
<p>If you tilt your camera up, it will look like the building's falling away from you, as the top will look very small: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pc-lens-demo-tiltedcamera.svg" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pc-lens-demo-tiltedcamera.svg" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pc-lens-demo-tiltedcamera.svg</a></a>  </p>
<p>A shift lens has a very large image circle and allows you to adjust where in that image circle your sensor (film) lands, which allows you to &quot;look up&quot; while keeping your sensor parallel with your building, giving you an image of the whole building, undistorted: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pc-lens-demo-lensshifted.svg" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pc-lens-demo-lensshifted.svg" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pc-lens-demo-lensshifted.svg</a></a>  </p>
<p>Shift lenses have largely fallen out of use in the digital age because it only takes a few clicks to adjust for perspective in Lightroom or Photoshop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent explanation.  For those still having difficulty visualizing the result, here is a good, practical <a href="https://petapixel.com/2015/04/06/a-quick-introduction-to-shooting-with-a-tilt-shift-lens/" target="_blank">example</a>, involving a real building.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A shift lens is still essential for professional architectural or interiors photographers. Adjusting for perspective in Adobe software isn't a great way to compensate for significant parallax convergence. There is too much frame loss and image degradation for the software to be reliably used. It's a shame because tilt shift lenses are very expensive for us photographers. I've never used the tilt function. ðŸ˜…</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have Nikon's 28mm f3.5 PC (I checked ebay, and they're only about $350), which is shift-only. It holds up quite well to modern sensors (though I've also gotten perfectly acceptable results with just a wider lens and software adjustments, so my acceptable and your acceptable may differ).  </p>
<p>I'll bow to your professional experience though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely correct! I decided it would be good to not add the extra complexity of the concept of parallax and perspective for the &quot;ELIV&quot; theme, but regardless, I'm glad you added the extra info!</p></div>		</li>
