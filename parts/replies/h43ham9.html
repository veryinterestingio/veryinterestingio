			<div class="markdown"><p>That's... that's not how it works. Food takes about 3 days to fully move through your digestive system. I'm just guessing here, but I would think competitors would fast for a few days before the event to give their organs as much room to squish around as possible. So even if they tried to poop while eating, nothing would come out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>3 days seams far too long. 12 hours in my case. I do not keep track but i do know my ass gona sting half-a-day after super-spicey kebab. Then again i'm thin as a stick so it may be that &quot;fast metabolism&quot; crap.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>if this is who i'm thinking it is, there was also some technique involved. the original record was smashed because they were always eating a hotdog as you normally would, but the record breaker found eating the sausage alone whilst dampening the bread with the water and eating it after was quicker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Number 1 is not true for everyone. Most eaters, including Joey, drink gallons of water in order to stretch the stomach. If I remember correctly, starting 3 or 4 days before a competition, Joey fasts and only drinks water to stretch his stomach.</p></div>		</li>
