			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember watching a documentary-type TV show where 2 friends had been struggling with being morbidly obese. </p>
<p>One eventually passed away from complications due to his overeating and weight, and in grief/frustration, the other stopped eating entirely. </p>
<p>The second one soon passed away as well from a form of malnutrition, (according to my memory of the show) as although his body had enough stored fuel to continue on for quite some time, you still need some necessary vitamins to remain alive, with potassium probably being the most significant (or at the very least, the likely one that the lack of will kill you first). </p>
<p>The second man refused to eat anything, was not taking any supplements and was not under a doctor’s care, so eventually his potassium level plummeted (which results in muscle seizures), and he died of “starvation” even though he was still overweight, due to a heart attack.</p></div>		</li>
