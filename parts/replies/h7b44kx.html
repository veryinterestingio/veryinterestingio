<p>Our stomach acid is strong enough that the bottom portion of your stomach is lined with special cells specifically made to resist that acid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well to be clear they line the entirety of the stomach, the mucous they secret is just thicker at the bottom. At least that's what I can remember, I'm not gonna lie it's been a hot minute since my A&amp;P course in college. </p>
<p>The esophagus has its own set of specialized cells that do the same but not to the effectiveness as the cells in the stomach. Anywho, the layers of mucous around the stomach is more than enough to protect you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually that's on a nearly empty stomach. When the belly is full of food, the hydrochloric acid has already reacted to it and is largely neutralized. But produce too much acid on a stomach that doesn't have food present to react to it, and it can burn when it hits other parts of your body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In fact, part of the reason we chew our food is because our acid isn't super fast acting. If you swallowed a whole streak, it would be there quite a while. Chewing speeds the whole thing up.</p></div>		</li>
