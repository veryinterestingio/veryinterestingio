			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s definitely a possibility, though their skull size was still small enough that infants shouldn’t have had too many extra problems even with an HSS mother. That’s a good point though and likely does result in some mortality rate biasing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>None of that is supported by any evidence, especially your statement about IQ.</p>
<p>It’s thought the larger brain had more to do with vision and color differentiation in a beige steppe environment.</p>
<p>All available evidence says their level of technology was significantly lower than ours.</p>
<p>Do you have even a single credible source for the statement they were “probably more intelligent”?</p></div>		</li>
