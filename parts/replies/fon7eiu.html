			<div class="markdown"><p>Uranus and Venus rotate the opposite direction from the other planets. Anti-clockwise instead of clockwise when viewed from above a position far above the solar north pole.  So Venus is said to be tilted 177 degrees instead of 6 degrees relative to the rotations of the other planets, as if it was flipped over.  Uranus is &quot;tilted&quot; just past &quot;level&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think there is some speculation on that point. Perhaps Venus had a collision with a large protoplanet like Earth did, but instead of coming in at a shallow angle in the direction of rotation, it hit Venus in a shallow angle in opposite direction of rotation effectively stopping it.
Plus any debris cloud thrown up after the collision would be revolving around the planet clockwise, meaning that any moons formed would  deorbit in time, due to tides.
Such a collision might explain Venusâ€™s lack of rotation and moons.</p></div>		</li>
