			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. My room mates dad had to go on a low sodium diet and didn't understand how he was getting too much sodium when he never added salt to anything. But he was eating almost exclusively processed frozen foods üôÑ</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even foods typically thought of as ‚Äúnon-processed‚Äù can push you over the line. A cup of skim milk has around 130mg of sodium. Have a few of those a day and you‚Äôre already at 25% or so of the DV. It‚Äôs a minefield out there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol, wouldn't a big part of a low sodium diet be checking labels for sodium?</p>
<p>Edit- ok, rereading that I'm thinking the need for the diet was the result of eating the processes foods, not that he was eating the processed foods as part of the diet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A great example of something that doesn‚Äôt taste really salty, but is high in sodium is; cheese.  </p>
<p>If you want to go on a low sodium diet, do research about which cheeses are high vs low in sodium due to their production methods.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cheese is unsurprising given how much sodium is in milk. But, yeah, anyone who has to monitor their sodium or potassium levels closely will find it a very fascinating array.</p></div>		</li>
