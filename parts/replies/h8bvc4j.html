			<div class="markdown"><p>The large unit is the number written on the currency. Like using a 50,000 Balinese rupiah note for lunch. Bitcoin would be the opposite, as it’s price is so high compared to most (all?) other currencies that you have to use small units of bitcoin to pay for lunch. </p>
<p>Large unit, small value. Compared to Bitcoin which is large value, but small unit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's two dueling definitions of the word &quot;unit&quot; going on here. A &quot;unit&quot; can mean single example of a thing. One dollar. One bitcoin. One piece of product (&quot;we've moved a lot of units this month&quot;). But it can also be &quot;unit of measurement&quot;. A kilometer, a megawatt.... </p>
<p>Language is weird.</p></div>		</li>
