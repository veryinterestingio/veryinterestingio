			<div class="markdown"><p>The short version is that objects can't move faster than the speed of light within space, but that space itself is growing so that distances between objects can increase faster than the speed of light.</p>
<p>Imagine running on a giant rubber band. There's only so fast you can run, but rubber bands are stretchy - if someone is stretching the rubber band while you're running on it, you may move further away from things faster than you yourself can run.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I imagined one of those moving walkways you see in airports. Like... You can only run so fast on the walkway, but if someone cranks up the speed of the walkway itself, to someone standing on the side it will look like you're getting faster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The speed of light is the limit of the propagation of light through space. That wouldnt affect the rate that space itself can expand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The speed of light is the limit that information can travel. Information includes anything that is something. The space in between everything is nothing though, and it is that nothing that is expanding and since the nothing is expanding and nothing isnt something it can go faster than light.</p></div>		</li>
