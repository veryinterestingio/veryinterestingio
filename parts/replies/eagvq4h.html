			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay this is a really rough estimate. But the st Lawrence rive has a depth of 28 ft. The river has a discharge of 5.1x10^10 ft^3 a day. The tough part is estimating the shore profile of the Great Lakes. Let’s assume that the area of the lake that is not 28 feet is negligible to the area that is (this is super rough and anyone with a better estimate is welcome).  Given the surface area of the lakes at 2.63x10^13 ft ^2 and a constant discharge rate even when the lake begins to drain (again rough estimate) this gives us a time of 1443 days. Basically the Great Lakes are amazingly huge. There’s obviously variance in the river bed depth but I think it would take a very long time to even slightly slow down Niagara Falls </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do we have a risk with climate change that it could stop flowing? I mean like in the next 50-100 years. I know anything can happen over the much longer timeframe with or without human intervention.</p>
<p>Has the flow been slowing/decreasing the amount of water flowing over Niagara Falls?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah from a quick search it seems that climate change is actually having the opposite effect. It seems as though the warm air is causing an INCREASE in the amount of rainfall in the Great Lakes river basin. Whether that’s from hotter temperatures causing air to carry more water or a change in climate patterns or a myriad of other reasons would be really tough to discern without a lot of research </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not likely.  The flow has generally been increasing.  They had a record low for at least Michigan-Huron recently, but it's still a relatively small change, since the flow is so constant.</p>
<p>The whole Midwest has seen massively increased rainfall, particularly in summer.  It's basically developing a summer monsoon.  This year, for example, they had record flows on the Upper Mississippi for fall (not really a big problem because it's usually low), with one stream station in Wisconsin which had been there for around 50 years recording a streamflow four times the previous record, with no significant land use changes to cause it.</p>
<p>I've seen simulations which claim that at RCP 8.5, SE Missouri will be tied for the hottest place on Earth, ranked by average annual maximum 24-hour wetbulb temperature.  It's not even anywhere close now.</p></div>		</li>
