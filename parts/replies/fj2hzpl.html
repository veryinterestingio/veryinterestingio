			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly how do we get valid data to work with? People with very mild symptoms may never be reported as they have a “cold” get well and go on with life. How many early deaths were written off to other causes? How long before someone is cured so they go into the cured column? Just an absence of data being filled in with statistical projections.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. This too is a dynamic problem. Eventually, everything will be steady state. We can fully expect there to be a rapid test developed sometime between now and then, along with a significant amount of knowledge gained regarding the problem you've mentioned. Luckily, most deaths ARE reported. So dynamic estimates remain conservative.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>FWIW, it's not like they found every person with a mild flu in 1918.  In <strong>every</strong> historical case you're calculating numbers from those infected enough to seek treatment.  The numbers may be adjusted to calculate for that, but the basic methodology will always be the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, they aren’t and definitely not by the same standard. Our flu mortality rate is based on decades of research and careful controlled study to estimate how many people get infected, regardless of the symptoms. Our coronavirus mortality rate is based only on the confirmed cases which will contain almost every single fatality but nowhere near every actual case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After all of this is done, they can randomly sample the population and look for antibodies to determine total infected.  Since it was fairly contained at first...any missed deaths will work it's way out.</p></div>		</li>
