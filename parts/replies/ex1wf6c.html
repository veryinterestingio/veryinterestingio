<blockquote>
<p>It is shown that the decrease in muscle mass relative to total body may be wholly responsible for the age-related decreases in basal metabolic rate.</p>
<p>Fat tissue in the abdominal cavity is connected directly with the liver through portal vein. Accumulation of abdominal fat causes disturbance in glucose and lipid metabolism.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I touched on testosterone.  Reduced T leads to reduced muscle mass.  Less muscle mass means less energy demand for maintenance.  (Sidenote:  The popular notion was that each pound of muscle burns 50 calories per day.  That's completely false.  In reality, it's about 10% that amount - 6-7 calories per day per proud of muscle.)</p>
<p>But compared to reduced activity, these are honestly secondary, maybe even tertiary, factors at best.  The truth is that your lifestyle changes as you get older (move slower, sit more, less exercise, etc.) count for the overwhelming majority of metabolic reduction - to the extent that everything else is negligible in comparison.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you saying that if I had the same activity as a 60 year old me vs. a 20 year old me, my metabolism would be the same? Don't your hormones and organs begin to lose efficiency/break down with time?</p></div>		</li>
