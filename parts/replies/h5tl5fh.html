I always thought it was just the resolution of the eye, like the little &quot;pixels&quot; are the individual nerve signals constantly shifting and we cant see any finer than that.</p>
<p>I dont think floaters or color splotches are what OP is talking about, it really does just look like colorful static but much finer. Still no idea what it actually is</p></div>		</li>
