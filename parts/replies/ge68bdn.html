			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup! The closer you are, the more detail your eyes can see, so the more detail you want displayed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed, it's not just resolution and screen size, but also distance from the eye.</p>
<p>A big billboard that's seen from far away can have very big pixels and still have high resolution, but it's just imense. While some phone screens are 4k and less than 8&quot; wide.</p>
<p>when apple came up with &quot;retina&quot; screens, the whole thought behind the name was supposed to have the best possible image, like trying to have the perfect ratio from what the eye can see and how many pixels do you really need on a screen.</p>
<p>I really wouldn't want or even need to have an 8k phone screen, because it's so small that even if I put it close to my face it wouldn't be as noticeable as having a 75&quot; 8k tv and comparing to an 4k while sitting from the couch, or standing next to the screen, as if trying to find how big the pixels are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but there is also a limit to how close you can sit before the edges of the tv leave your central vision cone and enter the peripheral vision area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, thanks. So if you sit 8 feet away from the TV you can't really distinguish between 1080p and 8k?</p>
<p>Edit: I was looking at the 60&quot; mark because I'm poor and can't even imagine a bigger TV lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, I want to keep this in the non-sciency part of the thread. But if you were buying a TV, Contrast ratio, brightness, and Color gamut (HDR) are all things in higher-end TVs (read, 4K)  that could make an upgrade beneficial.</p>
<p>But as for resolution, this chart seems to be accurate from my anecdotal experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/apearl" target="_blank">apearl</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on screen size. At 8 feet away, 8k is likely never beneficial over 4k, but if your screen is greater than ~62&quot; then you're better off with at least 2k.</p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Kered13" target="_blank">Kered13</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>That charts shows that at 8 feet away you need a 62&quot; screen to see an improvement over 1080p. The next step on the chart is 1440p, which is common for computer monitors but not for TVs, so you would probably have to go for a 4k (2160p) TV anyways. But there is no noticeable improvement from an 8k (4320p) TV at 8 feet for any reasonably sized TV.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean the vive pros OLED has better blacks but Jesus christ don't chose a vive pro over an index. The index is better in so many ways its worth slightly less blacks.</p>
<p>Personally I prefer the Quest the index or my vive but that's mainly because I don't trust the kids with the I dex and the difference is negligible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I chose the Index over the Vive because it's basically Version 2. I trusted them that whatever needed to be improved with the Vive would be done with the Index, and whatever was unnecessary would be cut. </p>
<p>I picked up Star Wars Squadrons this weekend, and me and my family and friends think it's even more immersive than Alyx.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Monitors are a different story, obviously.</p>

<p>Maybe I'm just dumb, but is that because people typically are much closer to their monitor then their TV?</p>
<p>Physically, of course. Most people are emotionally closer to their TV than their monitor.</p></div>		</li>
