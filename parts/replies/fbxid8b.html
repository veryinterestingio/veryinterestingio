			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the BBC  (or other) did a few years ago a recreation of this project for a TV show. They built from scratch the pile driving machine, and had blacksmiths produce special fittings and points. I migh have watched that episode 5 or 6 times as a kid and I was always fascinated.</p></div>		</li>
