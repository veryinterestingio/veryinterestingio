<p>There is no simple way to measure the entirety of carbohydrates because they are so complex (sugars, starches, fibers, etc)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How is fiber measured in isolation? Because most nutrition labels give the amount of carbohydrates, before listing its sugar and fiber components.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I googled it and found this method:</p>
<p>ELI5: Simple sugars can be extracted from a sample since they are more soluble and chemically active than complex sugars, and the amount can be determined using a fancy technique called liquid chromatography. The remaining sample can be tested for ash and protein and the amount of complex sugars determined based off these tests.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A general scheme has been developed to determine sugars, starches and total dietary fiber (TDF) in a 0.5 g freeze dried food sample. Free sugars are extracted into 80% methanol, dried and derivatized to their trimethysilylated oximes or ethers, and quantitated on a gas-liquid chromatograph (GLC). The residues after the dilute alcohol extraction are suspended in deionized water, autoclaved at 120 deg. C for 1 h, cooled to 60 deg. C, mixed with a solution containing amyloglucosidase in acetate buffer. The mixtures are incubated at 55 deg. C for 2 h. The hydrolyzates are centrifuged and duplicate aliquots (0.1 mL) are removed for glucose determination by GLC. Starch content is calculated as glucose (g/100 g) x 0.9. The remaining hydrolyzates are diluted with 4 x volume of 95% ethanol, and the mixtures are left at room temperature for l h, then filtered through glass crucibles matted with celite filter aid. The residues are dried at 100 deg. C for at least 2 h, and cooled in the desiccator. One of the pair of residues is analyzed for crude protein and the other for ash. TDF content is calculated as the residue weight corrected for crude protein and ash.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are detergents and enzymes at various pH values used to digest in vitro and estimate different fiber contents. Interestingly enough, ruminant animal feed quality laboratory analysis is fairly advanced and highly commercialized due to the necessity of balancing rations that work for their complex rumen and stomach (fiber content and quality matter greatly and minor imbalances can cause serious medical trauma for the animals). If interested in the laboratory methods, simply follow the websites of companies that offer these services. In the US, there is Cumberland, Dairyland, Rock River, Denelle, to name a few. You can also browse the analytical methodology SOPâ€™s on the UC Davis Analytical Laboratoy website for more detailed information with sources for the described methodology cited and linked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a little dismayed that this thread has neglected to mention that there are (and have to be) windows of accuracy allowed because naturally grown and harvested foods will differ in nutrient content from season to season, field to field, and type (i.e. granny smith vs. Honeycrisp).</p>
<p>Additionally, the US FDA will allow for +/- 20% of the stated value on the nutritional panel. </p>
<p>Sorry to shatter the image of perfection, but we do the best we can with what we have.</p></div>		</li>
