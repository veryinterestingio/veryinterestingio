			<div class="markdown"><p>I got a Sleep Innovations 10&quot; queen mattress from Amazon years ago, all of $370, IIRC.  I just set it atop the old box springs and bed frame.  It rocks.  I think I got it in 2011,  still holding up fine.   They may not  offer that model anymore.</p>
<p>I did a lot of research, the Sleep Innovations mattress was highly recommended at the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Zinus 12” on Amazon. The one with green tea in the description or something. I absolutely love this mattress. Had it for two years and it feels brand new. I think it’s under $300 and sometimes goes on sale closer to $200</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can’t speak for Tuft and Needle, but I recently bought a Brooklyn Bedding Aurora medium-firm softness.  I loved it, but was waking up with back pain until I decided to get a box spring.  MAJOR DIFFERENCE.  I miss being low to the ground, but it is the perfect bed now and no more lower back pain.</p></div>		</li>
