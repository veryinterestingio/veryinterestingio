			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work in a hotel in rural Guatemala for a while and generally went barefoot, and experienced this myself. Initially I just hurt myself all the time, but eventually I got to the point where I could go hiking barefoot and mostly sense where to shift my weight as I was placing my foot down, though I did use my eyes as well to spot anything majorly sharp.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Pavement and shoes have let us become totally disconnected from the simple process of placing our feet safely, but it doesn't take long to re-learn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a person that grew up barefoot, it's very accurate. As some one that's run in running shoes and barefoot, you run completely differently. Barefoot, you're stepping lighter cuz being careful. Also, when I ran barefoot it was on my toes. My heels didn't strike. It was all toes/ball of foot. With shoes, I heel strike first and just not as careful. I felt more lumbering/less springy as well if that makes sense.</p>
<p>Your feet also become incredibly tough. Summer I could walk across hot rock where temps got over a 100. I could walk in snow barefoot for quite a bit with no issues. </p>
<p>Goat heads/thorns will stick, but there's so much callouses it barely hurts. Only thing that really broke through was Russian Olive tree thorns. Those are a beast, do not recommend.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a korean who moved to New Zealand....</p>
<p>Kids would go barefeet during lunch to play rugby. I wanted to fit in so I took my shoes off too. </p>
<p>Within 15 minutes I had to put em back on... my feet were covered in thorns and bleeding from cuts.</p>
<p>The kiwi kids feet were so hardened the thorns did nothing to them. Bloody hobbit feet xD</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also grew up barefoot most of the time (we lived in the suburbs, I was just homeschooled and hated wearing shoes), and I naturally walk on the balls of my feet and grip with my toes for balance. </p>
<p>When I wear shoes they usually feel like clown shoes, they're like... Well, it's like trying to go about your daily life wearing mittens. Pretty hard to type or make dinner with mittens on, right? I feel similarly limited in thick shoes. My feet can't flex or grip correctly, they're just heavy slabs.</p>
<p>Years ago I decided I cared more about comfort than looking cool, and I got some Fila Skeletoes, which are about the closest I can get to barefoot in public. I wear those unless it's wet or cold.</p>
<p>On the other hand (foot?), if you didn’t grow up barefoot, going without shoes might be a lot more uncomfortable for you, as modern shoes really deform our feet by squeezing them into a point. My feet are very wide, with a thumb-size gap between my big and second toe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We definetively can’t «test the ground» to such a degree while running, but still, if we run by landing on the front of our feet (in stead of our heels) we actually get an extra joint to move on (the ankle joint) when landing, allowing us to graduate the landing more smoothly instead of  the high-impact all-or-nothing hell strike. If we hit something sharp, there’s the option to tilt the pressure on the foot away from that, or alternatively relieve the pressure on the entire leg (although that does cause quite a stumble).</p>
<p>Have you ever lost your balance by stepping on something sharp or uncomfortable? That’s your foot almost reflexively pulling up or relieving it’s muscle tension; you stumble a bit but your foot is still alright.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Barefoot runners have pretty serious calluses but don’t really have a big problem running ultramarathons. But at the same time running barefoot makes you run in a way where there’s less ground contact with your foot and the arches in your feet act like springs.</p></div>		</li>

<p>(I have shitty feet and need serious arch support to be comfortable, so even at home I'm always wearing orthotic slippers. Also I hate having dirty feet, but achey knees and hips are the real motivation.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t even go barefoot (though socks aren’t much of a step up in the house) but when I got my leopard gecko, she was very timid and I couldn’t make sudden movements to avoid startling her or else she’d scream like an actual adult woman if I wasn’t careful. That’s not a hyperbole. Well she’s very used to life years later but I never shed that silent and methodical way of walking around so I have an annoying habit of scaring people unintentionally by just appearing without warning. I say annoying because half the time their yelping startles me.</p></div>		</li>
