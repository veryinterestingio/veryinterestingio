			<div class="markdown"><p>So, in other words: all mass adds blood volume, but lean mass adds more than fat mass.</p>
<p>We traditionally use height and weight as the equation, which like BMI is generally consistent across a population but not necessarily at the individual level. Would having actual estimates of lean + non-lean mass (via composition analysis) actually be a significantly more accurate individual predictor, independently of height? I have a suspicion now that height in those equations is just being used as a normalized guess at body composition.</p>
<p>Edit: found some resources that suggest this is true. A 'muscular' man is approximated by &quot;Glitch's Rule&quot; (aptly named) to have 75 ml/kg; an obese man is 60, with 70 and 65 at the &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;thin&quot; categorical marks. Same for women -5 ml/kg to offset the composition differences. I would suspect that this strongly follows a continuum with extreme bodybuilders at higher than 80 ml/kg and extremely overfat individuals under 60 ml/kg.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fascinating, right? When deriving an equation to predict what dose of heparin (a historically weight-based drug) would have the highest likelihood of producing a therapeutic aPTT, weight alone has been proven to be a terrible predictor- accounting for &lt;30% of the variability. Blood volume would be helpful, but for a medication where it must be started as soon as possible after discovering a clot, no objective method of blood volume measurement can be realistically employed. Using BMI (which is obviously flawed, especially in heavily muscular people who would have an “obese” BMI) in addition to age and weight in an equation to dose heparin accounts for ~50% of heparin variability. There’s TONS of other factors that influence heparin dosing variability like ATIII, vWF, etc - but again it’s difficult to have that information at the moment when you’re making dosing decisions. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Please consider posting links to any already-published data on the subject, this is legitimately fascinating. It's something I never knew I wanted the answer to. I've only been in medicine as a scribe so far, so my knowledge on this subject is limited and I'd love to see more on this. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ugh this. Schooling has taught me this makes perfect sense, but I still always get surprised when the patient with a BMI &gt; 40 needs this itty bitty dose to be therapeutic ??‍♀️</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know of any literature on that topic, but it’s a fascinating question. Would a recently-slimmed person have the vascular volume of a person that is their previous weight? Does that correct over time? If so, how long would that take? What weight is more accurate for drug dosing? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking anecdotally, my blood pressure, resting heart rate and overall cardiac fitness greatly improved going from 309lbs at my largest, to the 160-170 range where I’ve been since. I had a resting heart rate near triple digits then. Once I lost the weight and started running regularly, my resting heart rate ended up in the 40s. One very key thing here though, is that being at a normal weight also allows me to be much more active in my daily life (taking the stairs instead of the elevator, walking somewhere when it’s reasonably close instead of taking a bus) and exercise in a healthy way (sustained exercise without as huge of an injury risk e.t.c.). And it took a hell of a lot of cardio to get there. Generally though, obesity isn’t just bad because of the fat and mass.. but very much also because of how all that fat affects how you live your life day to day. And often the other way around too: a lot, or maybe even most people who get obese are not very physically active.. and putting on the weight is a steady decline as a result of that. Naturally combined with taking on more calories than burning - which of course can be possible even with an active lifestyle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it would still decrease because cardiac output would decrease due to less mass needing blood to be delivered to it. Skin folds are even less vascular than adipose tissue, so while theres still tissue there, it won't require as much blood. </p>
<p>A huge bodybuilder at 285lbs is still at risk of heart disease more than a 180lb person. The question is; is the 285lb bodybuilder with 8% body fat as much at risk as the 285lb obese person with 40% bodyfat? The answer should be no, but it's pretty close still. Lots of huge athletes still wind up dead from heart attacks compared to those at normal weights. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally speaking, yes. Your body will note that it has too much blood volume for its current size and you’ll pee out excess water and your blood cells will gradually die off, and some of them won’t be replaced as they weren’t needed. The typical life span of a red blood cell for example is ~200 days. But this is ok because you’re constantly making more of them, so all that needs to be done in this case is to slow down the rate of blood cell production.</p></div>		</li>
