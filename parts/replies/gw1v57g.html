			<div class="markdown"><p>Talking slightly out of my ass here but my kids pediatrician said it was better for kids to get some illnesses younger because adult or more grown up immune responses can have devastating systemic effects vs small responses. My younger kid caught RSV  pretty much at birth (his sister was fighting it when I went into labor) and he said “better now than at 6 months. At 6 months his immune response would be robust enough that he’d be hospitalized”.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be much better to get RSV as a child or adult than as an infant. There are some things such as varicella, herpes simples, or EBV where one would rather have these illnesses as a child if one had to choose. However, as a neonate these are potentially lethal.</p>
<p>Edit: The paediatrician was likely referring to some diseases being better to acquire in childhood rather than as an adult. To say that it would lower risk to be infected with these viruses as a young infant/neonate is incorrect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why a lot of the fatalities in the 1918 flu pandemic were younger, healthier people. Your body will make conditions hostile for the invaders, like giving you a fever, runny nose, etc. but those effects can be dangerous.</p>
<p>The 1918 flu caused what is called a &quot;cytokine storm&quot;, where in a nutshell, your body produces too much of a substance meant to make things difficult for the flu but also weakens the patient, and in many cases contributed to deaths where older &amp; younger patients couldn't field as strong of a response.</p>
<p>Generally a stronger response is better, but not always if it gets out of control.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You generally don’t just lose immunity. It’s likely your antibody titers (concentration) were below detectable levels (which is usually common if haven’t been exposed to the particular antigen in a long time).</p></div>		</li>
