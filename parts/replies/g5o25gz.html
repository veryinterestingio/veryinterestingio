			<div class="markdown"><p>An object (of unit mass) could also have a position x = e^(-2t) and not break the laws of physics (on the condition that it did not start out before t = -log(c)/2, at that time it would have the velocity of light). You just need a force to act on it that goes like 4e^(-2t). You could think of an object of unit mass that experiences a force proportional to its position, which would have an equation of motion as follows:</p>
<p>d^(2) x / dt^(2) = 4x</p>
<p>Note that this second order ODE has <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=d2x%2Fdt2%3D4x" target="_blank">two solutions</a>: one where it flies off to infinite speed, and the other where it decays nicely.</p>
<p>This could e.g. be a block sliding on a surface with a dynamical friction coefficient that increases with x. I can't really think of a real life example, because most typical surfaces do not change like that. Maybe an object experiencing drag when entering a medium with a linearly increasing density profile? The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_equation" target="_blank">drag force</a> depends linearly on the density. Or maybe you can somehow manage to create a linearly increasing electric field and have a charged particle fly into it? </p>
<p>Solutions like these occur much more often in things like pharmacokinetics, diffusion MRI signals, electrical (RC) circuits, pandemics (epidemiology), ...</p>
<p>As a final note, an object could very well have an exponentially increasing speed, but for relativistic speeds you would also have to take into account special relativity. You could subject an object to a force that increases linearly as described above, but you would probably find that you'd need an infinite amount of energy or a force of infinite magnitude to accelerate an object up to v = c, as its relativistic mass will also go to infinity. It would actually be quite interesting what v(t) would be when taking into account special relativity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh hey thanks for this. I remember in my Calculus 3 class there was a problem: “the position of a particle is given by  x=e^t” and I thought “how is that possible?”  I didn’t think about force increasing with position (I hadn’t taken Diff. Eqs. yet so I didn’t have the language to think about that really).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can, but only for a limited time. The issue people are having here is they're forgetting the core concept of a derivative because the most practical uses are the ones where the derivative can be taken everywhere on a function and have meaning. It's not an important thing, and often it's better to just find one that's unsustainable ad infinitum but sustainable at some useful interval</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since y, its derivative y' (and so on) all have different units (e.g. m, m/s etc) and can't really be compared, is there no physical significance to the fact that this sequence of y_n's are getting exponentially larger?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're completely correct in the physical sense, that it doesn't make sense to compare 2 m/s to 1024 m/s^(10). However the question as posed asks about how many derivatives it would take before you got to 0 - my argument is that the answer is &quot;it might never reach 0&quot;, and in fact, it might go up as you repeatedly take the derivative.</p>
<p>If you can't guess, I come from this question from more of a math side than a physics side.</p></div>		</li>
