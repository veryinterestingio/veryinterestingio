			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right. The guys name was <em>Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi. Algoritmi or Algorismi</em> is the latinized versions of al-Khwarizmi<em>.</em> Original name of the book mentioned  (The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing) <em>is al-Kitāb al-mukhtaṣar fī ḥisāb</em> <strong><em>al-jabr</em></strong> <em>wal-muqābala.</em> Hence, <em>algebra.</em></p>

<p>Of course it is a loan, but most likely it's from Swedish, and not directly from latinized version </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Glad to see someone mention this, from Wikipedia :</p>
<p>It was considered that the earliest text to use a decimal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_notation" target="_blank">place-value system</a>, including a zero, is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lokavibhaga" target="_blank"><em>Lokavibhāga</em></a>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jain" target="_blank">Jain</a> text on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology" target="_blank">cosmology</a> surviving in a medieval Sanskrit translation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prakrit" target="_blank">Prakrit</a> original, which is internally dated to AD 458 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saka_era" target="_blank">Saka era</a> 380). In this text, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9A%C5%ABnyat%C4%81" target="_blank"><em>śūnya</em></a> (&quot;void, empty&quot;) is also used to refer to zero.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0#cite_note-29" target="_blank">[28]</a> </p>
<p>A symbol for zero, a large dot likely to be the precursor of the still-current hollow symbol, is used throughout the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakhshali_manuscript" target="_blank">Bakhshali manuscript</a>, a practical manual on arithmetic for merchants.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0#cite_note-Weiss-30" target="_blank">[29]</a> In 2017 three samples from the manuscript were shown by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocarbon_dating" target="_blank">radiocarbon dating</a>  to come from three different centuries: from 224-383 AD, 680-779 AD,  and 885-993 AD, making it the world's oldest recorded use of the zero  symbol. It is not known how the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birch" target="_blank">birch</a> bark fragments from different centuries that form the manuscript came to be packaged together.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0#cite_note-31" target="_blank">[30]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0#cite_note-32" target="_blank">[31]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0#cite_note-33" target="_blank">[32]</a> </p>
<p>The origin of the modern decimal-based place value notation can be traced to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhatiya" target="_blank"><em>Aryabhatiya</em></a> (c. 500), which states <em>sthānāt sthānaṁ daśaguṇaṁ syāt</em> &quot;from place to place each is ten times the preceding.&quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0#cite_note-Aryab-34" target="_blank">[33]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0#cite_note-Aryab-34" target="_blank">[33]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0#cite_note-35" target="_blank">[34]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0#cite_note-36" target="_blank">[35]</a> The concept of zero as a digit in the decimal place value notation was developed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_subcontinent" target="_blank">India</a>, presumably as early as during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gupta_period" target="_blank">Gupta period</a> (c. 5th century), with the oldest unambiguous evidence dating to the 7th century.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0#cite_note-bourbaki46-37" target="_blank">[36]</a> </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>because, surprise, roman numerals are actually base 10 numerical system, this makes sense when you look how its written which is done left to right by first doing the thousands, then the hundreds, then the tens then the ones, so for 998 we have <code>CM</code> + <code>XC</code> + <code>VIII</code> which means 900 + 90 + 8. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am by no means an expert, but I think it must be similar to why you write VIII and not IIX. Maybe you can only write a single smaller numeral ahead of a larger numeral for subtraction? </p></div>		</li>
