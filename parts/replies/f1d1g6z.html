			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen it at one particular plant where they used color for your rank. </p>
<p>Orange was entry level, yellow was after your 90 day probation, red was 1st level supervisor,  green was next level supervisor, white was office/plant super and blue was visitors. </p>
<p>I loved that when I worked there I still wore my white hard hat, you could tell the new guys every time I came back because they didnt recognize me and would start panic working when I walked by.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When hats are worn for pleasure, they're the kind that I like best.</p>
