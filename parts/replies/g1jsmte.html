			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it is important to unpair actual IQ from performance on an IQ test.  Depression strongly influences performance on IQ tests, but does not alter IQ. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1440-1819.2006.01564.x" target="_blank">article</a>.
Additionally as mentioned above, decreased motivation can suppress IQ performance as well.  Valid IQ test performance  requires motivation and limited influences from other psychological variables (emotional issues, sleep deprivation, etc).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a lot of explanation, but somehow it doesn't get clear to me how the overall IQ (which is, by its definition, a total score) can remain stable when some sub-tests are timed (leading to a lower sub-score and thus, to a lower total score).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who was training to be a school psychologist I can say that when I personally tested people I would take note of processing speed (qualitative info you get is just as important as quanitative) plus there's ways to score the tests were timed activities dont count as much to the total or are scored untimed. For example, I was working with a kid who we  thought could potentially have ADHD based on observations, interviews, ect and when I tested him, he got distracted very easily and did very poorly on timed activities so I made sure to calculate both versions of full scale and the individual subsets (as well as observational data) so when I presented the results to the rest of the team I could say he could do the tasks, he just got very distracted/worked slowly throughout multiple subtexts and this likely negatively impacted his performance on timed tasks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Clinical psychology PhD and neuropsychology resident here. I’ll add that during depressive episodes you’re also likely to have a hard tome attending to things you want to focus on. When you can’t pay attention to something, you don’t encode it well, and therefore can’t recall it later. Oftentimes I see adults who are concerned about their memory when the underlying problem is actually their mood or anxiety, which is generally an easier problem to fix than a true memory deficit.</p></div>		</li>
