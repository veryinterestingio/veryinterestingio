			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the most accurate answer as to how medical pathology labs are run and why multiple vials are needed.</p>
<p>Much more than a drop is needed because there is a minimum volume needed for this lab equipment to work. Plus, each vial will test for different things so as to save time in getting the results and minimize sample loss (coagulation of the blood in the tubes).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to this: each tube is actually coloured to show the anticoagulant or preservative used in them. Common examples include lithium-heparin, citrate and EDTA, but there are lots.</p>
<p>Some tests can’t be done with certain anticoagulants. For example, if I need to analyse how your blood clots, I can’t use a tube that contains an anticoagulant that will interfere with that test, because then I’m just testing how well the tube works. So a coagulation test is often done in a citrate tube, since it doesn’t interfere with most common coag tests, and can’t be done in a lithium-heparin tube because heparin does interfere.</p>
<p>This also affects the order of draw. Here, coags need to be done first, for instance, to avoid contaminating the blood you’re testing with the anticoagulant from an earlier tube.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition, most tests are more precise with larger quantities.</p>
<p>If you use just a drop, some will evaporate or stick somewhere, changing your concentration. With bigger volume you have less surface per volume and thus less problems.</p>
<p>You'll also have better relative precision in sample volume and reactant volume.</p>
<p>Plus, the blood is not always completely homogeneous, so taking just a drop might give you a non representative sample.</p>
<p>All these issues plagued Theranos, a company that recently claimed they could do tests with small blood drops, and the method ended up too unreliable, and the company crashed (it was valued 10Bn at some point). Worth to look into in this context: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos</a></p></div>		</li>
