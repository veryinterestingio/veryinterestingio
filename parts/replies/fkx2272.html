			<div class="markdown"><p>That's really more about ecology. the largest dinosaurs clock in at around 70+ tons which is bigger than all but a few of the largest whales. It is in some ways easier to 'make' large animals in water but scaling isn't the reason there's more big animals in water than on land, it's to do with productivity and resource partitioning and competition.</p></div>		</li>
