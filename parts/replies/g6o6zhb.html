			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's this. I know for a fact that my dog has no bad intentions towards me. I don't think they understand the concept of good and evil. Dogs don't know I'm teasing it. They don't hold a grudge when I'm hungry and tired and might be a bit rash with the poor guy because he doesn't know my &quot;malicious&quot; intent. (I'm very good to my dog. He is my best friend)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rough-housing and play fighting is a natural part of play in dogs. He probably thinks you're playing a game.</p>
<p>My dad used to do that with our golden retriever. Sweetest dog you'd ever meet (seriously, she managed to catch a robin, bring it to my dad, and it was unharmed but traumatized), would never growl or bare her teeth ... except when play fighting. And the moment dad said done, she immediately returned to her normal self and seemed to be all the happier.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Some of them damn sure know when they have been bad. I have to GSPs, if our male gets in the trash he has 0 regrets. If our female gets in the trash she won't come to you even if you haven't seen the mess yet. She will sit in my chair and look away from me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both of our dogs are getting on a bit now, and occasionally you’ll be stroking them and hit a sore spot. They’ll do the trademark Greyhound Scream of Death and maybe snap their teeth in your general direction automatically, but it’s never malicious and they’re always so apologetic afterwards.</p>
<p>Even if they do catch you with their teeth, it’s not a proper bite (i.e. it’ll leave a scratch, but never break the skin). You’re way more likely to suffer an injury by them accidentally head butting you hahah.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love this about dogs. I'm not sure how, but my 2 and a half pound chihuahua Frankie ingested marijuana without me knowing (I don't know where it's from, but the doctor said even a lick after you touch weed if you haven't washed your hands can do it) and I thought she was dying, I rushed her to the emergency vet an hour away and when I got back I was exhausted. </p>
<p>Her brother Bean was so happy to see us and see Frankie was okay, and he wasn't even upset when I didn't end up giving him the walk I promised when I got home.</p></div>		</li>
