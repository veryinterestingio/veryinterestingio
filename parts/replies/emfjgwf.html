			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! This is one of the things I was thinking of when I asked this!</p>
<p>They really emphasize how rare they are but then youâ€™re seeing it right there so it made me wonder. Really amazing dedication that they were able to get that footage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>they are frequently using very expensive high res cameras too so that they can shoot from really far away and still get good hi res video when they zoom in on the parts they want.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC they used a Canon 50-1000mm lens to shoot the snow leopard scene. The lens was specially designed for wildlife photography, and retails for around $70,000. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>for certain scenes they used a Sony A7iii I think. while the massive hi res cameras are awesome it also shows the leaps and bounds personal cameras have come in recent years, to a point where a documentary known for overall quality is using a consumer level camera</p></div>		</li>
