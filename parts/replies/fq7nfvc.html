			<div class="markdown"><p>Soooooo</p>
<p>There was a guy who my biology professor knew (i'm certain it was actually <em>my biology professor)</em> who used to like putting his - you know - into an empty cola bottle to pee. Because of how it felt.</p>
<p>Anyway, one day he peed into this 2l plastic bottle, and when he was done he felt his bladder <em>immediately re-fill</em>, but with air. He'd peed so much pressure into the bottle that it had to equalize, via his urethra. He spent a couple minutes feeling like he really needed to pee again, but couldn't, and eventually passed about 1L of <em>pure air</em> which make a kinda &quot;Ffffssssh&quot; noise as it escaped his Johnson.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lookup <em>Kegel Exercises</em> </p>
<p>They have more intense exercises and training equipment for serious strengthening (for example, a “weight toy” women can insert vaginally and hold in place). But basically all you have to do is squeeze those muscles all the time. Sitting down doing nothing? Squeeze those muscles. Same ones you use to hold your pee in or clench your butt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah, not all the time. Its a simple exercise you can do anywhere, maybe a few times a week. That muscle never gets flexed, so you get results quickly. Those being, pee control, more intense orgasms, harder erections. Does good for women too. YMMV. Using any sort of external device is overdoing it. Its interesting and neat, look into it</p></div>		</li>

<p>I used to not be able to control anything, once I started I couldn’t stop.</p>
<p>Now I can stop and start as much as I want, I can even squeeze it out with more pressure if I want to make a whole lot of Noise in the toilet bowl.</p></div>		</li>
