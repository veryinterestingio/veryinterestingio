			<div class="markdown"><p>They’re saying it overshoots, so when cooling from above 70, it likely overshoots and ends up getting the room to say 68. Usually isn’t that drastic unless you have an improperly set up system, but that’s the general idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, it overshoots on purpose on a hysteresis loop. </p>
<p>The physical values fluctuate all the time, and the sensors are unprecise. So if we target exactly 70, we would be turning the cooler/heater on-off all the time. This tends to break things (an expensive AC, from that perspective, is not so different from a light bulb).</p>
<p>So a calculation of over- and under- shoot values goes into the design to prevent that, while maintaining the system somewhere around the target value.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Going from Room A to Room B, where A is slightly warmer than B, will result in B feeling cold.  Going from room C to that same room B, where C is slightly colder than B, will result in B feeling warm.</p>
<p>So if the A/C is on to cool down the room, it will feel colder as the temperature is dropping.  Also if you are in the flow of the air it will feel very cold as the incoming air will be far below the temperature of the room.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is it, exactly, My thermostat actually has an &quot;auto&quot; setting, but requires that you set upper and lower boundaries. They can't be within less than 3 degrees celsius of one another. The thermostat also has a terrible UI, which makes setting the upper and lower boundaries kind of unintuitive.   </p>
<p>Ultimately, it's easier to just tell it to do one thing, since it never feels cool or warm enough on auto, and it's a pain to get it to the right setting.</p></div>		</li>
