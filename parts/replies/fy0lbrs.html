<p>I don't mean to be rude, but nearly your entire answer is incorrect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can see that there are areas in the tropics and subtropics where it doesn't rain at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is incorrect. There is no place on earth where it does not rain or snow at all, even in extreme climates such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atacama_Desert" target="_blank">Atacama Desert</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMurdo_Dry_Valleys" target="_blank">McMurdo Dry Valleys</a>. Everywhere gets rain or snow sometime, and the ocean especially so since there's a constantly available source of moisture. The white areas of the map are just regions that get less than 0.5 mm of precipitation (rain plus snow equivalent) per day on average, or less than 18.25 cm (7.19 in) of precipitation per year. That's a long distance from no rain at all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Usually it's because there is normally a westerly wind and a mountain chain which means that the air is very dry as it flows out over the ocean (and before it can pick up more moisture).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is also incorrect. First, I'm not sure if you even looked at the chart when you made up this answer, because most of the areas of lowest precipitation over the ocean are <em>upwind</em> of major mountain ranges, not downwind. &quot;Rain shadow&quot; effects don't really apply over the ocean.</p>
<p>The real reason for the very dry ocean areas is a combination of two big factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The general circulation of the atmosphere (the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadley_cell" target="_blank">Hadley circulation</a>) results in a general tendency of air to sink from roughly 15-30 degrees from the equator. This is because the sun heats the area around the equator the most, which results in warmer/less dense air that tends to rise and form clouds and rain. But this rising air has to go somewhere, and in general it moves away from the equator and sinks in areas further north and south. This means that the area roughly 15-30 degrees north and south of the equator will tend to have sinking air, and so any air in that region that is attempting to rise and eventually become clouds and produce rain will have a tougher time in these areas.</p>
</li>
<li>It's a bit complicated to explain why, but basically due to the rotation of the earth an ocean basin will tend to have an anticyclonic circulation (clockwise in the northern hemisphere, counter-clockwise in the southern). This means that the eastern side of an ocean basin will have currents that move from the polar regions to the tropics, bringing cold water towards the equator. Since air warming up near the surface is vital to the rising motion that produces most storms, this cold water also tends to suppress rain over the eastern sides of the major ocean basins away from the equator.
<ul>
<li>^(Side note: this is the same circulation that results in the famous) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Stream" target="_blank">^Gulf ^Stream</a> ^(that brings warm air up from the tropics on the <em>western</em> side of the north Atlantic; in general these currents are known as) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_current" target="_blank">^boundary ^currents</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The rotation of the earth also pushes air into the tropics where it flows upwards and dumps rain (hence the very high rainfall band around the equator).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See above: this is not due to the rotation of the earth, but due to the sun heating the tropics more than other areas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fascinating answer. I guess this explains what I've kind of wondered about why some areas in the world are so dry, like North Africa, Australia, and the Southwestern corner of Africa compared to areas that I'd ignorantly expect to be as dry, like Central Africa. Thank you for the explanation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The british Isles are so rainy due to the gulf stream. The warm water from the gulf of mexico travels across the Atlantic ocean and hits the westen side of the british isles. The warm water causes evaporation and produces the rain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is only partially true. Firstly, the Gulf Stream is on the western margin of the Atlantic Ocean and does not cross the Atlantic to reach Europe (although you'd be forgiven for making this mistake because even many experts who should know better describe the two as being synonymous). What you're referring to is the North Atlantic Current which is a related, but separate current from the Gulf Stream. Secondly, although my knowledge of meteorology is limited, it's my understanding that atmospheric dynamics are <a href="http://ocp.ldeo.columbia.edu/res/div/ocp/gs/pubs/Seager_etal_QJ_2002.pdf" target="_blank">at least as important</a> as oceanography for determining UK climate although this is all a matter of discussion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the Canary islands are far from dry. The northern side of the islands gets a lot of rainfall. Up to 1000 mm/year. That's more than a lot of places in Great-Brittain. It's the south/west side of the islands that are dry. Mostly because the easterly trade winds blow over high elevation mountains and dry out on their descend. The air dries out and warms up. The reason the Britisch Isles are wet is because of their path in the jetstream. The gulfstream contributes, but not that much. Even cold water evaporates pretty good at those latitudes.</p></div>		</li>
