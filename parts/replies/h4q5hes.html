			<div class="markdown"><p>My wife just went through this process 3 weeks ago with our first child. In our case it was decided that inducing her a week before her due date was best to minimize a few risk factors that result from her having sjögren's syndrome. We basically went through the process above with the addition of a few things. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The doctors used a Foley balloon (inflatable catheter) in addition to the vaginal medication to physically help progress to 3 cm dilation at which point we were moved to the labor and delivery suite. </p>
</li>
<li>From there the started the epidural and broke her water which further coaxed contractions in addition to the medication. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the monitors (two on mother's belly, one to monitor contractions and the other to monitor babys heart rate) started picking up steadily rising contractions that eventually started coinciding with dips in baby's heart rate. After backing off the meds and having her lay in different positions it was determined that the umbilical cord was likely being pinched against the baby during contractions. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>water was added back into her womb with a catheter (didn't know that was a thing that could be done) which successfully cushioned the baby enough to mostly prevent the heart rate dips during contractions. And the medication for the contractions was resumed. </p>
</li>
<li>unfortunatly once it became time to push the baby's head was not quite cooperating, this along with a return in the baby heart rate dips had us opt for a C-section even after 50 hours of labor. </li>
</ul>
<p>The hospitals nursing staff was amazing both during the procedure and recovery for several days after. However watching my wife go through an unplanned c-section while being completely exhausted from the weekend long labor was the toughest moment of my life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same thing happened to my wife and I 10 years ago. We were 18/19 so we didn’t question the doctor or any of his advice. He told us to go to the hospital on a specific date that he would be on call because he was going to go on vacation the week after. He told us to tell the ER staff that she was having contractions so that they would induce her. They called her doctor who told them to start the pitocin. 18 hours later and she still wasn’t very dilated so they broke her water. The babies heart rate started to drop soon after and they rushed her to an emergency c-section. It was a terrible experience. We should have just let her body run it’s course. The anesthesiologist put the epidural in the wrong place twice. She’s had back problems ever since and our second baby had to be born c-section. I hope nobody else has to go through that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard similar stories from friends who had OBGYNs, they seemed more concerned with their (the drs) timing than with the baby's. I find it very strange</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Congrats on the baby! I also had induction-long labor-C-section. It was crazy to have all the labor and then fifteen minutes after heading into the surgery having a baby. It’s crazy to think that 100 years ago baby and me would have likely both died. Actually I probably would have died earlier from the extreme morning sickness. Or that time I had bad strep at summer camp. Actually I probably would have died like three times before giving birth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had the same process with being induced (swept, Cervadil, gel, drip) 28 hour labour, 4 hours of pushing then a c-section at 42 weeks exactly. It was not fun but we all came out safely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a child from the same - induction (at 43 weeks, the doc thought it was just 42), 2 days unproductive attempts at stimulating labor, c-section. Oddly enough, the regular delivery ward was under renovation, and so I was in the prison delivery ward, but because I was a c-section, I escaped being born behind bars.</p>
<p>My younger sibling was a vbac, and at 10lb 4oz, was a rough go of it. Probably should have been a c-section, with the strain caused.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Similar to us 4 months ago except we didn't need the balloon and went to emergency C-Section. Its unbelievable how good mid wife's are. Hope you're doing ok, it took us 2 months to properly settle into being first time parents so if you have any questions or want to vent to anyone, hit me up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was induced at 41 weeks. My labor lasted maybe 6 hours. Does this mean I might've been close to going into natural labor or the drugs just worked quickly for me?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No as far as I know it’s just that some people’s bodies labour faster than others. Whether or not you’ve had a baby before makes a bigger difference than how many weeks you were. But some people just have faster labours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems to vary person to person. Several people my wife has helped with are in and I to labor in a day, and baby is out no problem. Some are longer, some go to C-section.</p>
<hr />
<p>Story you didn't ask for time:</p>
<p>Our hellish labor &amp; delivery...</p>
<p>My wife took 3 days on oxytocin to get to a 10. She was stuck at an 8, crying and screaming for more than 24h because she was having contractions every few minutes but was told to not push because she wasn't dilated enough (For good reason). </p>
<p>Epidural did not work for her unfortunately. They re-did it which was so hard when she was having contractions, I swear I pulled all my arm and back muscles bracing her (Standing in front of her with my arms up her back holding her upright and steady) so she didn't move during that process.</p>
<p>Thankfully the baby was tolerating all of this, and the doc didn't pressure for a C-section. My spouse wanted a normal birth as much as possible.</p>
<p>She was finally at a 10, and the doc was ready to go, and we timed for after the next contraction so she (the doc) could go up in her and feel around to confirm that we are good to go. Unfortunately we had bad news, the babies head was impacting her cervix on her hip, the baby cannot move down without significant risks and damage.</p>
<p>So now she is is half giving birth, contracting, sobbing, crying, screaming during contractions saying &quot;I'm trying not to push, I'm trying not to push&quot; and periodically passing out for a few seconds or minutes at a time (exhaustion). </p>
<p>Doc pulls me aside and says that we need to get the baby pushed back up off her cervix or it's going to have to be a C-section. And that a spinal tap may not work, meaning general anesthesia, which puts the mother and baby at a higher risk of death. Note: We already tried physically pushing it up, and that wasn't working.</p>
<p>At this point my wife could no longer make decisions, she just wanted the pain to end. I knew she was adamant about not having a C-section, and would want me to do everything possible to avoid that. I knew that a C-section under general anesthesia would be hell for her.</p>
<p>She didn't want to, but we got her on her hands and knees, rocking back and forth to try and move the baby around. But that didn't work. Eventually it came down to the wire, the &quot;We need to have a baby or take her to the OR now&quot;.</p>
<p>The doc, bless her heart, had one more trick to try. Going in and manually pushing the baby back, and sliding the cervix around his head with her fingers. It would be incredibly painful, and may take a significant amount of time. My wife said no, but she was unable to understand that she would have to go to the OR otherwise. Doc looked at me for the decision, and we went ahead with it.</p>
<p>It worked! And a team rushed in to assist with the labor process and the delivery. Which itself took several more hours.</p>
<p>Baby came out, healthy, I cried. Placenta stayed in though, it had been an hour now since birth and the placenta wasn't coming out. They took her to the OR to remove the placenta and I was left alone with the newborn. I'd been up with her the whole time, and was a complete wreck. A nurse came into the OB to check in and see what I needed, and I had to go to the bathroom and just had a crying breakdown for a few minutes before I could collect myself and come out.</p>
<p>At this point it had been 2 hours for a surgery that was supposed to take 30 minutes and I'm practically having a panic attack. I can't lose my wife, I just can't...</p>
<p>She's eventually brought back, thankfully the spinal tap worked and she was awake and well.</p>
<p>We stayed there a couple more days, and eventually went home, and all has been well since.</p>
<p>She doesn't remember any of it, but just recalling it makes me tear up for so damn reason...</p>
<p>It was a hellish process, and I never want to see her go through that again. She wants another, but I can't go through that again, that was the scariest and most traumatic thing I've went through thus far in my life. Moreso than almost dying...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty sure I was. I had back labor something fierce for the last two weeks of my pregnancy. I'd already been admitted for the agonizing back pain and was induced anyway since I was on the cusp of going into preeclampsia. I got the medication placed for my cervix and they checked in the morning. It didn't seem quite ready yet, so the nurse was going to check with the doctor. No sooner than she got my blanket back in place then my water broke! It was about 9am at that point. I had to wait til about noon or 1 for a delivery room since lots of babies were being born that day. Then at 7:12 that evening, I had my baby boy. My entire med team figured I was already about to go into labor on my own.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit: He is my only child, so idk if there's any real correlation to slower first births or not.</p></div>		</li>
