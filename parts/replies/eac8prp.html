			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. This one right here is the first thing that came to mind.</p>
<p>People don't realize that in most historical accounts which refer to &quot;war elephants&quot;, they are referring to a now extinct species of smaller elephants. Actual African elephants like we have now were used in very small numbers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was surprised I was the first reference I found in the thread. It made me incredibly sad when I first found out because I like the ears on the African elephants better than the Asian elephants and would have enjoyed having one. The same goes for the dwarf elephants of the Galapagos. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what confused me so much when reading early military texts. They refer to elephants in India as bigger and more difficult to train vs  those from Africa. Which runs counter to what I &quot;knew&quot; about elephants. But these were Mediterranean civilizations writing about the North African elephants. Somehow even modern texts rarely bother to mention that, and I was thoroughly puzzled. </p></div>		</li>
