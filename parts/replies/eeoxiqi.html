			<div class="markdown"><p>An example of how acting is regulated compared to a 9-5 job: school.  My mom spent many years as a tutor on film sets.  Kids who act have to adhere to a strict schedule of schooling in-between their work.  Even though the &quot;former child actor&quot; horror stories are what makes the front page, there is very much a framework in place on film productions for kids to become well-rounded individuals.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Combine that with the fact that, with the exception of long-running series (for example, the original Full House), acting is a short-term job for most kids.  A kid cast in a commercial might only work two days total.  A kid cast in a movie will likely not work more than two months.  It's a temporary disruption/change of pace, rather than a full-time commitment like the jobs most adults have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to do a lot of acting for TV when I was younger. Nothing major - I’d have lines sometimes but it was often as an extra. </p>
<p>Even as an extra the rules are super strict. I think the longest I ever did filming for was a week, but it was usually only a day or two. Even then I was only allowed to work for a certain amount of time, and was allowed breaks/food pretty frequently. </p>
<p>Overall it was really enjoyable and topped up my savings account nicely. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, I would think it's less the actual acting and more the fame and money that messes up those kids.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I imagine it comes down to the fact that for regular jobs (like restaurant work etc) there is no reason for why it <em>has</em> to be a child that performs that job. An adult can do that job just as well (even better) so put that burden on a child?</p>
<p>But when it comes to making movies or TV series, there is a reason why it <em>has</em> to be a child: you do not have an alternative. You cannot hire Terry Crews to play a five year olds. We don't have super advanced androids or something who could believably play a child. The only option for when you want a child in a TV show/movie is to have that role be filled by a child.  And seeing that we as a society want to see movies/tv shows that include children, we are willing to make that exception provided it is strictly regulated so the child is protected.</p>
<p>It's sort of like how for a restaurant job, you can't say 'I don't want to hire a black man', but it is perfectly fine to do that in a tv show/movie when you are trying to fill a certain role. Like, if I am making a biopic of Stan Lee's life, it is perfectly fine for me to say 'I only want a white guy filling this role'. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also it’s not like there aren’t children that really wanna perform and love being on tv/stage. How would one hone their craft and become a great adult actor if they can’t get experience growing up? (Not that every great adult actor started as a child but most at least did theatre work) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The argument for it is that children in Movies, TV and Theater can't be replaced by adults that do the same thing.  The work is not inherently dangerous and they are not employed just so you can pay them less.</p>
<p>So with limited work hours and requirements that they have have the education they would have in school att the same time  so you need to provide for that. The result is that in may was they are more expensiveness then adults so if you can you avoid to employ them.  That is a large part of the reason that when you portray people at High School the actors are almost over 18 where you have a lot less regulation.</p></div>		</li>
