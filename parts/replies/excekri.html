			<div class="markdown"><p>Curious if you know anything about how MTHFR enzyme mutations affect brain function with regard to depression and &quot;brain fog.&quot;  Apparently, MTHFR = lowered methylFolate, B12 and SAMe levels = lowered BH4 levels = lowered neurotransmitters, et al.</p>
<p>Apparently, mitochondrial energy levels are affected as well, which is probably why it feels like my brain lacks the energy to start certain circuits leading to intense &quot;brain fog.&quot;  I'm able to overcome much of it by supplementing the various components to the methylation cycle, but it's no panacea.  </p>
<p>If conditions are right, and I get the supplement mix right, I can go from non-functional, debilitated, to doing full-on artificial intelligence research in a matter of hours, and it's sustained throughout the day.  There are a lot of unknowns that make it inconsistent, though.  My model is definitely missing some pieces.  It seems the biggest problem in MTHFR isn't lowered methylFolate, but lowered BH4.  I wonder if there's a better way to get more BH4 than focusing on the methylation cycle.</p>
<p>I know it's insanely complex, and I'm not sure of your area of study, but I'm always interested to hear a passing neuroscientist's thoughts on it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So then why do SSRI’s get prescribed for depression? If the evidence doesn’t support it increasing serotonin levels what does it show?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The acute effect is indeed higher serotonin levels. But after a while the receptors adapt to the higher level of neurotransmitters and they get downregulated. Some evidence shows that suicidal people had more serotonin receptors IIRC. Thats why it may take weeks for the SSRI to start having an effect against depression. </p>
<p>And of course this is not the whole answer. There may be many other effects we dont know or understand yet</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't have to increase serotonin levels to be effective. We don't know how SSRIs work. You can take a look at the Wikipedia page on SSRIs for more info.</p></div>		</li>

<p>work by increasing the availability of serotonin</p>

<p>When this happens, are other hormones/neurotransmitters/whatever thrown out of wack like it happens when other hormonal drugs are used?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You've hit on a very important distinction: neurotransmitters and hormones are completely different.</p>
<p>Hormones are broadcast signaling molecules. They are used to send messages to your whole body. So it makes sense to talk about the &quot;level&quot; of a hormone, because the overall level of that hormone in your bloodstream is what matters. </p>
<p>Neurotransmitters (I'll abbreviate NTs) are different. They are highly targeted signals from one neuron to a specific group of other neurons. Neuron A could release dopamine at its connection with neuron B, and that could mean something totally different from if neuron X released dopamine at its connection with neuron Y. For this reason, it does NOT make sense to talk about the &quot;level&quot; of a NT, because NTs do not function on a body-wide or brain-wide scale, so the brain-wide amount of dopamine being released at any given moment doesn't mean anything. </p>
<p>So, it's hard to say how SSRIs affect other NTs, because what actually happens is that the drug will affect many different brain circuits in different ways, and those brain circuits will use dozens of different NTs. All those circuits will suddenly be functioning differently, because their various serotonergic components will be functioning differently than usual. Eventually, those circuits will stabilize in new patterns of activity, and it's believed that this is how SSRIs actually work: as a result of some downstream effect on other brain circuits, not a direct effect of increasing serotonergic signaling.</p></div>		</li>
