			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also been a bit of talk about how accurate this prediction actually was. It's a little odd that the one group that had a different prediction than most others also introduced a space debris collision avoidance service less than 6 months ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, that's the company that has the largest interest in very accurate forecasts. Sure, we don't know, but both explanations are plausible.</p>
<p>We'll see over time. If their predictions are better they should predict ~0% collision chance most of the time when others predict a non-negligible chance.</p></div>		</li>
