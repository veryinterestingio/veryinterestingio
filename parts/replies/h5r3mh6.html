			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm super confused, people can't move their fingers independently?  I'm 43, never heard of such a thing.  I can move each and every finger on both hands while keeping every other one still, is that what we're talking about?  This is abnormal?</p>
<p>Also, my wife and I can both do the Vulcan thing, but she can do something I can't, easily alternate between that and then the middle and ring finger being joined but then spacing out between the index and pinky fingers, kind of like a scissor motion, fluidly.  Odd thing is, she has terrible dexterity and hand/eye coordination, so that can't be the excuse like it is for me (been playing games since I could hold an Atari joystick).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>can you move your ring finger (from the base!! very important!) 90 degrees to your palm without any of the other fingers moving or pulling forward? Most people can kink it in the middle nuckle of that finger but not the full thing. Hell I can't do that with literally any finger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! I know exactly what you mean! I can do this (making an L by bending just the middle knuckle) easily with every finger except my right pinky. I can also lift my right ring finger independently off a table far more easily than my left.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, I think this is what OP is literally asking about. I know lots of people that can't. You and your wife sound like an anomaly unless you do stuff that require fine motor skill, whereby you'd develop the ability.</p>
<p>The scissor thing you mentioned is something I realized I couldn't do a few years ago so I've been practicing it and now can do it quickly and fluidly.</p>
<p>Maybe to use another context - most people can't move their individual toes. But lately when I'm bored with my feet up watching TV I've been working on it. I'm still not very good at it but I'm starting to get to where I can move one toe without curling my whole foot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a huge level of variation regarding dexterity of hands among the public.  And not just controlling individual fingers but having good fine motor control in general.</p>
<p>Some people have &quot;good hands&quot;.  It can mostly be trained, but if you talk to plumbers and carpenters and surgeons they will tell you that some people just can't do those jobs very well.</p>
<p>I know a kid who can't even begin to play 1st person shooters on console controllers, and he knows it will never be something he can do. Kinda sad....</p></div>		</li>

<p>But with some practice you can train yourself to move individual fingers without moving the others. There are a ton of musicians (piano, guitar, etc.) who can move their fingers freely. Probably true for surgeons too. I can hold my hand in front of my face and move each finger independently.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an interesting experiment for the guitarists out there - compare the mobility between your two hands.</p>
<p>I can see a difference between my right (picking) hand where I don't typically make use of my ring or pinky fingers when playing, and my left (fretting) hand where the act of playing guitar and fretting notes acts to better the mobility and strength of those fingers. This is despite being right handed - where you would assume the dominant hand would be the stronger and more articulate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, this is for sure interesting (also a guitarist who likes to work on finger stretches, etc.)</p>
<p>What I noticed is my right (picking) hand has a significantly shorter span than my left.</p>
<p>When I practice hand exercises I primarily focus on my left hand. Yet somehow my right hand is kind of learning the same motor skills. Not as good, but noticeably better. I think this reinforces that it's partly neurological and partly a muscle/tendon.</p></div>		</li>
