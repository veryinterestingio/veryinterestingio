			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it plausible that animals with better eyesight than us can see some of those galaxies and nebulae, or are they not sensitive enough either? Are there blue whales out there laying on their side an night on the surface talking (singing?) amongst themselves about potential life in other oceans in that big there cloud of dust that we can't see with our naked eye?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is said that a aboriginal tribe from central Australia had such good eyesight that they could have seen the Shoemaker-Levy 9 comets smashing into Jupiter. Apparently their eyesight (rods, not cones) is better than any other group of people.</p>
<p>Seems rational: their survival depended on seeing long distance landmarks in their travels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>S-L 9 was around mag 14, maybe 15.  Normal human eyesight gets to about mag 6 at best.  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude#Calculations" target="_blank">ratio</a> between mag 6 and mag 14 is \~ 2.512^(8) =\~ 1500, meaning, S-L 9 was over a thousand times too dim to detect with the naked eye.  It's conceiveable that a tribe could have up to one magnitude of advantage, but there's only as much as you can push it without radically altering the basic design (the eye, the head, ..). I think we can safely assert that no person on the planet saw, or could have seen, the S-L 9 with unaided, naked eyes.</p>
<p>The momentary flashes were certainly brighter (at least to mag 5 or so, comparable to the Galilean Moons), but the resolution of the human eye isn't sufficient for detecting separate flashes so close to the planet's rim, especially when accounting for the 'glare' of bright targets due to diffraction etc. at the observing end (the eye); iow, at best, the aboriginals, or anyone, could have detected a very brief, and very slight, brightening of Jupiter, at most.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>try looking at the sky from your peripheral vision, you will see slightly more than looking directly at something.</p>
<p>(cones or rods in the side of our eyes are only black/white receptors hence we can see slightly fainter objects)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read about that a while ago and that's definitely true. In the middle of Orions belt is a nebular or something else cloudy and I can only make it out when I look at it when looking at it from the side of my vision. Same with a lot of very dim stars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We probably need to establish some parameters about what it means for Earth to be a &quot;giant eyeball&quot;. Yes, telescopes distributed around the globe can simulate some aspects of an eyeball, but this is mainly considering the size of the distributed network of telescopes making a very large aperture. It is really more like a very large fly's compound eye with only a few cells operating rather than an eyeball. If we look a <a href="https://usercontent1.hubstatic.com/7701690_f520.jpg" target="_blank">diagram of an eye</a> or <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Amit_Sawant3/publication/228921287/figure/download/fig4/AS:300767165599747@1448719888204/Internal-structure-of-a-human-eye.png" target="_blank">this </a> instead and scale it up to the size of the Earth. From this we could project the size of the objective lens, its aperture and focal length. The size of the retina could also be used to project the size of our imaging sensor and give us a pixel count, assuming current technology sensor pixel density.</p></div>		</li>
