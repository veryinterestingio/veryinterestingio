			<div class="markdown"><p>Phantom pain is caused by the parts of the brain dedicated to sensing in the missing part having trouble accepting that it is no longer there. (That's my very ELI5 explaination. There's more to it than that but you can get the gist.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was like 12 years old I was talking with a cool ass dude in a retirement home that had his leg amputated at the knee.  We got to talking about it and he asked me, &quot;You know the absolute worst part about it?...waking up in the middle of the night and my big toe itches like a son of a bitch&quot;. Blew my little mind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, phantom pain is purely a psychological phenomenon. Kind of like a PTSD since the process of getting a limb removed can be very traumatic. The pins and needles feeling is purely a result of physical process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve been an amputee for 19 years and still get phantom pain. I lost my legs when I was 8 and I don’t even remember what having legs feels like. I think my brain is pretty used to my legless body. Weather changes can upset some phantom pain for many of us.</p></div>		</li>
