<p>Other viruses in recent years spread massive epidemics worldwide in poultry and pigs, but did not spread well in people. Chinese agriculture is still recovering from the pig epidemic. </p>
<p>The new virus looks more contagious. China is taking it very seriously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An enormous proportion of the worlds colds, flus, and viral disease come from southern China and northern SE Asia.</p>
<p>It’s a combination of a massive population that’s densely packed (even in rural areas), close proximity to domestic animals as well as a thriving (and largely illegal) bushmeat market, over-all lack of hygiene when it comes to factors that affect disease transmission, and they fact that many medications are available over the counter and people only take them until they feel better, not until the course of treatment is done, if they don’t just rely on “traditional” medicines instead.</p>
<p>I work in environmental conservation in this part of the world and while my job doesn’t deal with zoonotic and other diseases I know a lot of folks in that specific field.</p></div>		</li>
