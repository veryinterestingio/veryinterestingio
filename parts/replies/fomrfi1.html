			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Babies lack object permanence until they get older. This means that if they lose sight of something, they think it's gone. Let's say you show them a baby toy, then you put that toy in a box. They won't think the box has the toy in it, they will think the toy has vanished instead. </p>
<p>Fun fact: Crows have recently been studied to also show object permanence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, but it is the reason why infants are bewildered when you play peek-a-boo with them. When they can't see you, they literally can't figure out that you're just hiding. It's only when they develop the concept of object permanence do they realize that things still continue to exist even when they're out of sight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. I had to show my kids mom a study on this to get her to just leave when I was staying home with the wee one. We were young parents and she's like, &quot;no! I can't just leave her crying, I'll cuddle her a bit more and show her it will be ok!&quot;. I'm like, just go and she'll be fine in 2 minutes. You're dragging this out into a 15 minute ordeal and she'll still cry when you leave because she thinks you're gone forever. Sorry to say it, but I'll play with her or turn on skipper the dog and she won't care anymore that you're gone forever&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is completely wrong.</p>
<p>&quot;to coddle&quot; is &quot;to take <em>excessive</em> or <em>extreme</em> care of&quot;</p>
<p>The <em>original</em> definition was &quot;to cook something in water that isn't boiling&quot;, and the meaning of &quot;to treat someone excessively gently&quot; derives from that, being so delicate with your food that you won't even boil it, just cook it slowly in warm water.</p>
<p>I was paranoid about this, so I just looked it up in like a buncha dictionaries; Macmillan, Cambridge, Oxford, Webster's all agree, and the usage of &quot;care excessively&quot; goes back to at least the 1800s.</p></div>		</li>
