<p>Everybody here seems to be focused on devices like Xboxes (do these even rate how efficient they are, and what is considered the work they do?) but a lot of energy wasted is in devices like washing machines - these devices vent their wasted energy into the drains, outside of the house. </p>
<p>Perhaps ironically for the OP the efficiency of a washing machine is the inverse of how much energy is lost to the room, a more efficient machine will dump a much greater percentage of its heat into the sewer than a poor efficiency machine which dumps it into the house. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>xbox = 100% efficient.  nothing is wasted.  100% power put into it, is extracted in fun/air heat indoors.  if the heat was pumped outside, then it would be a loss</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the sake of simplicity, let's assume you live in a soundproof home. Then it still gets converted to heat ?</p>
<p>That energy is likely very very small compared to the work / heat losses we're talking about.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Similarly, let's not factor in the amount of light from light bulbs that escapes out your windows. It's negligible, nearly 100% if energy the bulb uses will remain in the house as heat.</p></div>		</li>
