I just hope that if it's the case, we can prove it before we die ^ ^<br />
It would be a bit less depressing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And also, this is cool, as things move away from you <em>really</em> fast, their light changes, it gets more and more red. Light can only move so fast, and if you stretch it, it changes colour - until you eventually can't see it anymore. So not only would far away stars be super dim, it's also that some of their light simply isn't so that you can see it anymore.<br />
But if you took a telescope and let it collect light from any direction for a really long time, and maybe even have it so it can see in the infrared, the sky is, indeed, full of stars.  </p>
<p>Tried to ELI5 that response, I hope you don't mind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, not realistically. Observable universe is 46 billion light years in radius and you can barely see galaxies that far.</p>
<p>Also, we have been able to see that far only since a handful of years ago. There needs to be a visible star between 45,999,999,990 and 46,000,000,000 light years away for it to be at the edge of visibility compared to ten years ago.</p>
<p>When we look at that far away, we see the past. So past in fact, we see the first lights from the birth of the universe. There are no stars or galaxies yet.</p>
<p>We don't see the birth of the universe in a shiny way either. The light is subjected to so much doppler effect that we can barely see just a little bit of infrared light only.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well technically it would just redshift until the light left the visible range and we couldn't see it anymore. I would think it would happen extremely slowly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, that is not possible to see. What we would see is that light from that star becoming infinitely red shifted while time on that star appears (to us) to slow down infinitely.</p>
<p>It is the same thing you see when something falls into a black hole. This is why it's called the cosmic event horizon.</p></div>		</li>
