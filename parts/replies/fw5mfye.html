			<div class="markdown"><p>I found routine is key as well, do the same things every day at same time. </p>
<p>Also hydration. When i worked nights all my coworkers were drinking coffee, redbull's etc but always complained about being exhausted. Had them switch to straight water and they noticed a huge difference.</p></div>		</li>

<p>ugh.  i made it through a few cycles and got the hell out</p>
<p>a while later i had an evening job, like 330pm to 1130pm.  that was actually pretty good.  got out early enough to hit a bar for a couple of hours after work if we felt like it.  could sleep in as long as needed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your body can adjust to it, but our bodies are predisposed to get tired around nighttime (and this is helped by human patterns of 90% of the population sleeping at night time anyways).</p>
<p>And yeah, as others have said, it's more if you keep flipping between the different times of day you sleep. My job before I got furloughed had me constantly swapping between first and second shift on a whim, so I was perpetually exhausted, and now they have me on a very short third shift schedule, so depending on how I manage my sleeping periods, I'm either ready to fall asleep the entire shift, like I was last week, or I'm as awake as I should be, like this week.</p></div>		</li>
