			<div class="markdown"><p>There are some vehicles out there, purely proof-of-concept things, that are 100% solar powered. They tend to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_car#/media/File:Solar_Car_Tokai_Challenger.JPG" target="_blank">hilariously far from street-legal</a> or practical in any way. </p>
<p>The sun gives us stupid amounts of energy, but unfortunately the amount falling on any given square meter just isn't enough to shove a human around at speed, much less in a safe metal box.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, solar vehicles are good engineering training tools, as they require good aerodynamics, structures, controls, electrical systems, ergonomics, and mechanical design and it also has to be light and compact. Scaling them up is not really practical, unless you are making an aircraft, where the size and speed constraints are relieved somewhat, and you can go above the clouds. The Solar Impulse 2 flew around the world a few years ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Assuming a person riding a recumbent bike has an upwards-facing surface area of 0.5m^2, solar irradiance of 1000W/m^2 and solar panels with efficiency of 25%, if I covered myself in solar panels I'd be able to generate 125 watts which isn't far off the average cyclist power output of 150W.</p>
<p>That's under ideal solar conditions, and also way too optimistic for flexible solar panels which only hit about 12% efficiency. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On average, every square meter of Earth receives about 3936 Wh per 24 hours. (164 Watts per square meter per 24 hours on average).</p>
<p>The smallest battery pack for a Tesla Model S is 75 KWh, or 75000 Wh. User  comments say it uses about 230 Wh per km, heavily dependent on situation of course.</p>
<p>3936/230=17.11, so a single m2 of solar panel would net you an extra 17 kilometers. The Model S is a little under 2 meters wide and 5 meters long, so 10 m2. You'd be lucky to put solar panels on half of that, so 5 m2. 17.11*5=85.55 extra kilometers. But we get only 33% of those kilometers, so *<strong><strong>ONLY 28.23 extra kilometers</strong></strong></p>
<p>Solar panels are expensive, really good solar panels are really expensive, and also are quite heavy. The really good panels will also be even more expensive when you want them aerodynamically curvy, or you'll get a lot more drag. All in all, adding a few more batteries is probably wayyyy more efficient.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>

<p>Sadly, no</p>
<p>If I remember correctly, the maximal output of a solar cell is about 1 kiloWatt per square meter <em>under ideal circumstances</em>. This means no cloud cover, no dust on the panels, sun covers the whole panel, not too hot of a day, etc... </p>
<p>Let's use the Tesla Roadster as an example, which has a 200 KW/h motor. So you need about 200 m^2 of solar cells to power that thing. Under ideal circumstances! Not going to happen.</p>
<p>Better to have batteries in the car (which you need anyway if you want to drive at night), and generate the necessary electricity off-site. </p></div>		</li>

<p>1kW/m^2 is assumed sun irradiance for solar cell comparison - in other words 100% effective solar cell would output 1kW/m^2.</p>
<p>Tesla Model 3 (Long Range variant) has battery capacity of 75kWh, so 33% efficient solar cell with 1m^2 area (about area of car's roof) would need 75 / 0.33 = 225 hours of full sunlight for single charge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your 1kW per square meter figure is way too high. Take a look at an example solar module. The LG 395W is about 2m x 1m, so 2 m^2, and under peak conditions, produces about 400W of usable power. That's 200W per square meter, so 1/5th your estimate.</p>
<p>You're also using units incorrectly; electric motors are measured in kW, not kW/h.</p>
<p>All that said, your conclusion is correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the roadster has a 220kW (peak power) motor, but only a 56kWh battery. If you drive at 60mph, you use around 20kW/h in the roadster. The most efficient road legal solar car uses around 10kW/h at the same speed.<br />
But you dont need to charge with the maximum engine power, thats what the battery is for. If you drive 20 miles a day in a normal EV, you will have to recharge only around 5kWh per day. So with a car mounted PV you would need 1.7kW (8m² for a high efficiency panel - which is probably the whole non-window surface area of the roadster)</p>
<p>BTW there is a startup which is starting to build such a car in germany - just not as sporty as a roadster (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLZKdkgB85k" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLZKdkgB85k</a>)</p>
<p>kW/h is a unit of power consumption. kWh is a unit of power storage. kW is a unit of power</p></div>		</li>

<p>Nope. The absolute maximum is 50 %, because that's the Maximum Power Point.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A solar cell is a diode, it's not a voltage source with a linear resistance. Its resistance changes with output voltage, and the efficiency can indeed exceed 50%.</p></div>		</li>
