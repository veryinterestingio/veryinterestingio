			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an interesting concept like if that's true I don't ever want to get the accurate taste of certain things. Like cola.. if the same thing applies you'd get a more accurate taste of cola at room temperature. Or milk! Ewwww.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldnâ€™t say that. Taste is a word that only describes the sensory experience â€” There isnâ€™t a true taste that you are measuring against. A hot beverage tastes <em>different</em> than a cold beverage, but neither is more accurate. Both tastes are accurate descriptions of how the beverage tastes at different temperatures.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Boiling water will have the most intense flavor because itâ€™s moving the fastest.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m totally kidding. Itâ€™ll definitely be intense though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just that. The warmer you make the water the less it can hold oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen gas. So the water gets the flat taste as it gets hotter. I have a longer top-level post about that. But there's all sorts of chemistry going on not just the taste bud thing. And there's lots of biological reasons for needing to be able to Tell how likely it is that the water you're drinking might be stagnant or full of excess dissolved material.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cold water from your tap is usually aerated by that little screen called an aerator.</p>
<p>We are biologically attracted to running water, because in nature it tends to be aerated, and cold water because both are less likely to be contaminated with disease and parasites.</p>
<p>So we have evolved to prefer cold rushing water the most and warm stagnant water the least.</p></div>		</li>
