			<div class="markdown"><p>Also look where they originated from. SARS from rural China in 2003 took a while to spread to cities and China was no where near as global. Almost 20 years later, COVID-19 came from a HUGE population center, on top of the other factors you mentioned just a recipe for disaster</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not entirely true saying that SARS spread from rural China. SARS started in Guangdong, where your iPhones are made. But I agree that Guangdong was not nearly as connected. It only technically spread around the world because of a major outbreak in Hong Kong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean in 2003 that is pretty much rural China. Also GuangDong is a state not a city, the city is named GuangZhou. SARS started in rural GuangDong.</p></div>		</li>
