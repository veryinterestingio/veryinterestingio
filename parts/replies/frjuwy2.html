			<div class="markdown"><p>If we’re sticking to the estimates, then just reduce the exponent by 1. Plus we could take the upper end of OP’s J estimate of clicking instead of the lower estimate, which would reduce the exponent by another 1. So now it would only take 10^16 clicks, and the whole world could lift the rocket with only 1,000 clicks per second.</p>
<p>EDIT: We could cut the numbers in half by left-clicking and right-clicking simultaneously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At most an order of magnitude, right? </p>
<p>Ultimately all the energy comes from fuel so the energy required to put the shuttle in orbit is just the fuel mass times the energy density of that fuel (summed over each stage/component). </p>
<p>The main booster had about 102500 kg of LH2, which has an energy density of about 140 MJ/kg, which will be a few times 10^13 J. Add in the solid rocket boosters, which I believe used a significantly more massive solid fuel, and with similar energy densities you'll get right up to 10^14 J.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also guesstimated at most an order of magnitude, but this still feels like the roughest part of the approximation, and the whole fun of this game is to get a feel of the margin of error.</p>

<p>This doesn't quite feel right. A lot of that energy is spent into accelerating fuel and ultimately in the kinetic energy of exhaust gases. For small enough loads (a satellite) the result could be way off (maybe two orders of magnitude?). Probably in this case it doesn't really matter (large dry mass, low orbit, relatively short burn, etc), but it's definitely a non-linear relation. I seem to recall the high school physics class when we learned this and there was quite the difference. I'll probably end up writing the equations, but that would be a forfeit :)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Depends on what OP is actually asking. The way the question is asked you can either go for the amount of clicks needed to get the same amount of energy actually used in such an operation but you could also see it as the amount of energy you would need to just send the shuttle up. In an ideal situation, without any losses and the needed of lifting all that fuel up too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's an interesting math problem, but a rather silly one since it's impossible.</p>
<p>I suggest, rather, that we focus on a goal we can achieve together:  How long a plank would need to be, where a lot of us can jump down on one end, and pop the shuttle into orbit.  Should it be graphite?  Steel?  Titanium?</p>
<p>Also, how high would the tower we jump from need to be?  Would it be better to use fat guys instead of skinny guys?  We're heavy, but we take up a lot of room, and I reckon the smaller the jumping platform, the better.  What's the best weight per square foot ratio?</p>
<p>Should we do this on the Equator and get a little farther from the Earth's center?  Surely, every bit helps.</p>
<p>I'd like to participate, but I have to take my neighbor to the chiropodist on Thursdays, so let me know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, in this particular case you wouldn't have any fuel for continuous acceleration after the space shuttle is launched, which helps in regard to weight (75,000 kg versus 2,000,000 kg). But it would actually require significantly more energy because instead of having the majority of your speed where atmospheric air density is low, your fastest speed will be at the point where the end of your lever is when it has fully pivoted.</p>
<p>So that's where things get REALLY hard. We have to figure out the speed that it has to leave the lever that it will decelerate to ~7.6 km/s when in orbit. So you have a changing air density problem with an extremely high velocity and air density at your initial position. Calculating this even with an extraordinarily simple object (such as a sphere) would be extremely difficult, let alone the space shuttle. I'll work on it a bit today, but I don't have time now.</p>
<p>Once you get the velocity the acceleration should be easy to calculate, but as far as what material to use? No material that we know of on earth is going to be able to withstand the forces that are going to be going on (space shuttle would certainly be destroyed) We use air to slow down the space shuttle on re-entry, and that creates a ton of forces for the space shuttle to overcome. Trying to be at a velocity higher than orbital velocity and go up through the atmosphere? I'd imagine we're gonna be getting some super hot plasma from the temperatures and pressures present. For any material we use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This goal is also quite silly, but maybe not for the reason you expect. The hard part about getting into orbit isn’t getting away from earth. It is getting enough sideways speed so that when you inevitably fall back down, you miss the earth. A large lever would propel the space shuttle vertically, but this would be a sub-orbital trajectory (aka it falls down). We would need some mechanism to give the shuttle horizontal velocity at the same time.</p></div>		</li>
