<p>If that is real, the article is respectable enough but I would have liked a linked publication.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For what my layperson's take is worth, articles on physorg generally seem to stick with the actual content of academic papers, and they usually link to the paper in question.  I'm disappointed they didn't in this case, although they did provide enough info to find it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting.  Not sure that means for the induced atmosphere.  </p>
<p>Does &quot;bursting outward&quot; mean an energy loss and/or physical forces disrupting ionospheric stability?  Or does it mean <em>more</em> stability, magnetic lines reinforcing some of the atmospheric structure?</p></div>		</li>
