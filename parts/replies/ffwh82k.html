<p>Edit: It turns out that I was wrong about it being all European automatics. </p>
<p>My automatic has an automatic handbrake, which doesn't release until the accelerator is pressed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Direct-shift automatics usually have dry friction clutches. So just like on manual cars they get hot and wear a lot when they are partially engaged. So they are usually programmed to not creep until the throttle is pressed. </p>
<p>Old-school boxes with hydraulic torque converters, which do creep, are still around in many Euro cars, though.</p></div>		</li>
