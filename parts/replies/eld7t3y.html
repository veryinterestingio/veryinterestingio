			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s just the armored section, which is close to shore. Cables can be buried as well for protection from trawlers. For most of their length, in the deep sea, they just lay on the bottom with no armor or anything to protect them. Source- I survey cable routes.

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not true for fiber, I cannot speak on any other sea cable. </p>
<p>But there is definitely a protective barriers around undersea fiber. It's not just bare fiber laying on the ocean floor. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well yea it’s not the fiber laying on the sea floor, but it’s not much more than the fiber, electrical wire (for the repeaters), and plastic. It is considered to be unarmored.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Op didn’t say bare, they said they are not armored. </p>
<p>For example aerial copper/fiber cables are not armored. They are still covered in several layers including a non metallic sheath. </p>
<p>Buried cables and some under sea cables have additional armor usually made of metal to protect against strikes. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are they really laying on the bottom in the deep sea? That seems like it'd required a lot more cable than just having float it about 200 feet down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would think that it would be safer for both the cable and the sea life to have it on the sea floor, though. Harder to snag or get tangled in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a 1000 mile cable run, a straight line between the ends would be something like 35 miles beneath the surface of the earth at its midpoint, because of the earth's curvature. Average depth of the ocean is maybe 2 miles? Floating just under the surface means taking a longer route. And it's a logistical nightmare.  200 feet under the surface, you have to float it somehow, and it's subject to powerful currents, and fishing nets, and tons of sea life trying to do its thing.  On the bottom things are relatively still and dead and the currents aren't doing much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Galvanized steel (hot dipped or otherwise) means that a sacrificial layer of zinc has been applied over the steel. The zinc corrodes preferentially (galvanic corrosion, corrosion occurring when dissimilar metals are in contact with each other and immersed in an electrolyte), protecting the steel underneath, but like anything sacrificial, the zinc has a finite lifetime.   This is an example of passive corrosion protection, where no external input or power input is required. </p>
<p>Not sure off the top of my head, but I thought undersea cables had external cathodic protection, like zincs on boats.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not healing, it's just mitigation. The loss of metal cannot be replaced just through conventional flow of electrons since the corroded material more than likely has broken off over time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You wouldnt really be healing it from time to time as you would still lose material, it is better to keep it continuous and just minimize the rate of corrosion</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work at a water utility and you’re absolutely right about the zinc wearing off. All of our parts are brass which, as far as I can tell, doesn’t react but customers will often times use galvanized fittings to connect to the water meter. When they get old enough you just gotta look at those things the wrong way and they break.</p></div>		</li>
