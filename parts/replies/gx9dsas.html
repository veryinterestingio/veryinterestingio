			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! That was super clear.
One thing I didn’t understand though was these lines
“each block written allows the author to declare the creation of a new public wallet address which has coins from nowhere, to which the miner holds the private key.”
Does the miner have the ability to just create as many Bitcoins as he wants on his wallet? Would he be constantly creating new wallets?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. The Bitcoin Network has a protocol limiting the creation of Bitcoin tokens per block, this number is cut in half every 4ish years. </p>
<p>Once the miner is allowed to create his new Bitcoin as a reward for posting the latest block of transactions the Bitcoin Protocol determines how many new Bitcoin they are allowed to create. This number was 50BTC per block in the first 4 years and every 4ish years after that the issuance rate is programmed to cut in half so 50 &gt; 25 &gt; 12.5 &gt; 6.25 (where we are now)</p>
<p>Eventually the network is programmed to stop producing new Bitcoins at 21M. We are currently at ~18.7M and the last Bitcoin won’t be created until the year 2140.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if one block gives you that many bitcoins, does that mean that if you get lucky enough to process the next block you essentially become a millionaire by instant? I thought mining was supposed to give small returns?</p></div>		</li>

<p>The last full Bitcoin will take <em>40 years</em> to mine, beginning somewhere around 2100, and finishing in the year 2140.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So just to be clear, there's a mathematical operation that's used somewhere in this process that acts to spit out the numbers to create next public wallet? Is crypto broken if someone cracks the mathematical operation?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is correct. And yes. If the hashing algorithm was broken it would break Bitcoin as well.</p></div>		</li>
