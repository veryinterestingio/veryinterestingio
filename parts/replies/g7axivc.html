			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe that's where the enthusiasm for xylitol for dental health came from.</p>
<p>From my understanding, the bad microbes in your mouth don't produce the acids from it compared to other sugars or sugar replacements.  As well it takes more energy for them to break it down than gained so they &quot;starve&quot; themselves.  Meanwhile the good microbes aren't affected as negatively.</p>
<p>Anti-septic mouthwash while technically better at eliminating bad bacteria just kills everything good and bad and then it all comes back.</p></div>		</li>

We are not 100% cellular, something i found shocking when i first learned it. There are of course living cells that produce the collagen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We spend a lot of time learning about cells and metabolism, but in fact we are mostly made of collagen. Some people in this thread talk of biofilms; our tissues are kind of similar, but with cells living in them in lots of different configurations. Most cells don't have much structure. What makes your skin what it is for instance, yes there's the hardened part that is the epidermis and that has keratin and epidermal cells at its base, but it's in large part the dermis which is mostly made by collagen secreted by fibroblasts. This collagen is part of what is called the extracellular matrix, which also has other important structural proteins like elastin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suspect it’s a little spooky to think of ourselves as having so much non-living material. Like wait I’m made out of polymers and minerals ? Teeth are weird . Teeth,  hair and nails are weird - they are the only dead things that project out from our insides. They create a permanent break in the wall yet they don’t allow infection to get in (usually) In the mouth this is especially remarkable.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Collagen is the primary fibrillar component of this ECM, along with elastin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Was trying to keep on ELI5 . I think it’s useful for younger learners to understand that much of our body isn’t “alive” the way at least I thought. I always thought we were 100% cellular, like I thought even bones were made up of bone cells ...teeth from teeth cells, etc. but when I first saw slides of cartilage I was surprised at how few cells there were!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dentist and tooth regeneration engineer here:
The difference is the type of cells that make up the bone and teeth and some amazing evolution. </p>
<p>The pearly white parts of your teeth is called enamel, the layer underneath is kinda softer called dentin and the living core called the pulp. All of the enamel is laid down before birth and when we are babies by cells called Ameloblasts. These Ameloblasts produce enamel matrix protein which acts as a scaffold for calcium/phosphorus and other minerals to deposit on. Pretty much like the grade school experiment of growing salt crystals from a salt solution. Ameloblasts become dormant and get encased in mineralized enamel and can no longer produce the matrix once we are born. Enamel is now dead.
To prevent damage, evolution devised this fantastic mechanism called enamel filament Decussation- fancy word to say meshed. All it means is that there is no straight lines in the enamel so if there is a crack it will always be intercepted by another interwoven enamel band. Enamel and bone is a ceramic so very strong if you put constant pressure, very sensitive to instant blows. Hence chewing is okay but a softball to your face may cause it to chip.
Bacteria can also lodge themselves within the nooks and crannies of teeth, produce acid and dissolve enamel (remember all the chewing gum ads).
Once enamel is damaged you cannot regenerate it only fill the hole with enamel minerals that acts similar to a patch on an asphalt road (remember sensodyne commercials)</p>
<p>Now bone also forms similarly but instead of Ameloblasts it’s formed by osteoblasts. These too lay down matrix and get encapsulated in minerals. The difference here is when you fracture a bone, it has  access to blood supply unlike the enamel. The blood supply brings with it cleaner cells called osteoclasts that eats away the broken dead bone, then recruits osteoblasts to make new bone and the process starts again. Healthy new bone is friend and fracture is healed.
Bone is living. Teeth are living but the enamel of the tooth is dead/calcified.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure how you define access. Fillings and sealants do prevent further damage and can last for many years. Stains, depending on what causes them can be removed via professional cleaning and in office bleaching. We don’t yet have a predictable way to regenerate the complicated tooth structures.</p></div>		</li>
