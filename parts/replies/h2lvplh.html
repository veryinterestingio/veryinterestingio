			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had anxiety attacks so often when I feel my body telling me I'm doomed I just do a quick check of my vitals and go back to what I was doing because life's too short to spend a lot of it worrying that I'm about to die when I'm probably just gassy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;Is this death, or just a panic attack?&quot; is a fun mental game.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My doc didn't give a crap when he was overprescribing metoprolol to me.</p>
<p>I told him I felt ill at ease and an impending sense of doom.  He said my BP was still too high and prescribed me more.  I said that I get white coat syndrome and that my home BP checks were normal.  He still prescribed a higher dose.</p>
<p>It got to the point that my BP at home once dropped to 75/35.  I stopped taking the meds AMR and my BP has been normal ever since.</p>
<p>He just didn't listen to the symptoms of insufficient cardiac output.  All he cared about was blindly prescribing meds and calling me a liar.</p></div>		</li>
