			<div class="markdown"><p>I watched this video of a simulator about someone who was having an episode. I couldn't imagine living every day hearing thoughts and having hallucinations. It's scary to me. I admire my friend to endure all of that. I wish him safety if we never end up being together. I just want to see him happy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It certainly can be a scary thing. I would make sure to not approach the subject in a ‘worse case scenario’ mindset and try not to make any assumptions because it can be very harmful to them. It’s normal to them to have those experiences (unless it started very recently) so there’s no reason for it to be a big deal.</p>
<p>I had no idea it wasn’t normal to have hallucinations until I was around 18 when it came up in conversation for the first time. They’ve almost never scared me. That person was a friend but they never really spoke to me again after that because they were so bothered by the idea of hallucinating and the negative stigma around it that. They couldn’t get past their preconceived notions of what it was like to consider my viewpoint and how for me it’s just normal.</p></div>		</li>
