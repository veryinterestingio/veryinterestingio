<p>And because it was not a very important area of research nobody got the funding to do further research on this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a completely underestimated aspect of science. You know that study that dogs poop north/south? </p>
<p>It's complete bollocks, but people love to repeat it. And because it really doesn't matter, no one is really refuting it scientifically.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Honestly though it's true, there's all sorts of 'facts' that actually have no basis in reality. Lemino did a video on swallowing spiders in your sleep and how there's genuinely no scientific backing to it.</p></div>		</li>

If a stranger came up to me and started explaining that some particular shape of boat hull is more hydrodynamic than another and his explanation sounded reasonable Iâ€™d probably take his word for it, because itâ€™s most likely not going to affect me or anyone else I come into contact with, so why expend the energy?</p></div>		</li>

Just food for thought cuz obviously everyone who spreads misinformation isn't always doing it in that sense, a lot just don't know the &quot;facts&quot; to know otherwise.</p></div>		</li>
