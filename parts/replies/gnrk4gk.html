			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a question Canada should have been answering in 2010, or 2000.</p>
<p>We're currently in the process of building several vaccine-production facilities across the country, all of which look like they'll be up and running by Christmas. </p>
<p>This has been done in part to simply address that capability gap, but more practically, it's likely that we're all going to need annual COVID booster vaccines for the next decade, and anything we produce that's surplus to national needs will certainly find a home on the world market.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Canada asked the pharm industry about 10 years ago (under Conservative governments) what should be done about vaccines.  And we were assured, guaranteed, that there was no reason for concern, no need for national regulation;  production would be much more efficient if it is centralized, and Canada could always count on supply from transnational corporations.  There would never be a need for regulation of the industry to make sure their was supply in Canada. Oh, heavens no. </p>
<p>Oops.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even with a science-friendly government, Canada still spends less on research than Apple and Google. It's something like half of what the US spends, per capita, 5% in absolute dollars. The issue isn't the next pandemic, it's that we're basically unprepared for the next &quot;whatever&quot; that is going to R&amp;D capacity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the issue with pandemics, is you don't know what the next one needs. Project warp speed insured that we had a lot more preparation for future steps than what would have happened without it, but unfortunately there isn't a vaccine making machine that can just be installed and calibrated to the various virus vaccine.</p>
<p>What we <em>do</em> have to start preparing for, however, is the possibility of having to produce annual vaccines, like what we do with the flu, which will require massive renovations of our development and medical facilities. Essentially stopping most of our progress in fighting things like cancer, and would take several decades to be able to fully adjust our infrastructure and educational systems to account for the new increase in yearly diseases. All while simultaneously having one of the largest drops in life expectancy in recent history.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isnt that exactly what mRna vaccines are? vaccines that can be made by a (mostly) single process as all other mRna vaccines?</p>
<p>I get that traditional vaccines are all very different from each other, each one requiring completely separate tooling, but I was under the impression that apart from the code of the mRna, all mRna vaccines use more or less the same tooling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>if they ask them to without paying them, I'm sure they'd say no, since they won't have anyone to buy the vaccine once it is set up. however, wealthier countries need to really start thinking about &quot;reserve capacity&quot; in more than just oil or grain. paying someone to build a mRNA vaccine production facility 10x larger than what is needed for flu and whatever will certainly cost money, but will be a very good insurance policy.</p></div>		</li>
