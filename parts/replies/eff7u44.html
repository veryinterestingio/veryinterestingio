<p>He lives in Anaheim now. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In 2006 they put off the <a href="https://www.brainerddispatch.com/content/state-nordic-ski-racing-meet-postponed" target="_blank">state high school cross country ski meet</a> in <a href="https://www.giantsridge.com" target="_blank">Minnesota</a> due to cold weather. Which just meant everyone skied anyways but not officially. I took the chair lift up and bombed down a hill as fast as I could and felt my face freeze starting with my checks to my lips to my eyes. Near the bottom of the hill I couldn't move my eyes and had to turn my head. Luckily it went away quick but I learned to go slower the next times I went down the hill. Side note short skis on cx bindings may have been my greatest invention. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I downhill raced up in Thunderbay in -30 actual temp and the gates and people's equipment started failing. Gates shattering on contact. Binding exploding, skiis bending. I survived but my balaclava was frozen solid after a 90 sec run. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh man. That's the perfect B-list climate horror movie. Skier goes down a slope, no goggles, insanely cold weather(some might say unprecedented hurr hurr). Fast dash down, loses feeling as you describe and vision blacks out so they have to stop. They start screaming, a friend stops next to them, he turns around, his outer layer of skin, nose, eyelids and eyeballs all break off his face, falling in congealed, frozen chunks as he tried to pat his face.</p>
<p>Hmm....</p></div>		</li>
