Other ways humans have learned to process food before eating it (cooking, cutting/grinding, adding or taking away certain components of food items) have reduced the need for larger, stronger teeth, jaws, and facial musculature. It's probably also affected how our gut functions. </p>
<p>Humans are omnivores as well as predators, so our gut is neither as large as a gorilla's nor as small as a cheetah's. Its &quot;efficiency&quot; depends upon diet, age, and health of gut flora, a subject which scientists are just beginning to explore in-depth (pun not intended) as it affects not only our body but our brain.</p></div>		</li>
