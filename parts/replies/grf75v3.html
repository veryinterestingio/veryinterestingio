			<div class="markdown"><p>This exactly. It's less a taste (the taste part would be &quot;sweet&quot; and &quot;green&quot;) and more the nerves being activated in a particular way. It's a whole other realm of what we think of as taste -- there's flavors, there's textures, there's salt (which is a strange thing), and then there's the whole world of &quot;nerves being fucked with.&quot; </p>
<p>Sichuan pepper is a great way to experiment with this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.foodbusinessnews.net/articles/9587-the-flavor-of-texture" target="_blank">I found this</a>, which says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consumers often confuse taste and texture. There are five basic tastes: bitter, salty, sour, sweet and umami. These are not to be mistaken with aromas, the flavors processed by olfactory cells in the nose. Together the basic tastes and aromas comprise the flavor of a food. Texture is an entirely different attribute, one that is experienced both by visual cues and mouthfeel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>... if that helps at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Salt is both a flavor and a flavor intensifier (and can have a great impact on texture). You know this intuitively - salted foods taster better that their unsalted equivalents, it's why even foods you don't think of as salty (ice cream) have added salt. It has something to do with the way salt affects the cells in your mouth, including taste buds.</p>
<p>Salt also has effect on texture. Ham is ham and not pork because it's tumbled and cured with salt. Canned vegetables are different from boiled laregely because of the salt. Slice some onions, sprinkle salt on them, then let them sit for 10 minutes - the salt ruptures the cell walls, softening the pieces and causing the flavors to mingle, effectively cooking them at room temperature. Salt can also make watermelon strips into something like a jerky, but I've only ever done that with salt blocks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Adding to this, in the sameway those chemicals illicit reactions I learned way too late in life Mango isn't suppose to &quot;taste&quot; tingly / rough. I'm allergic and thought mango just had it's own effect.<br />
Mentioned to one of my friends (happens to be a nurse) that I like mango besides the effect...<em>record scratches</em> and she describes the sensation. I'm like, &quot;yeah, good job you've eaten a mango before&quot;<br />
Nope, she pulls up on google basically what she said word for word; allergic reaction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably about the same as eating an icyhot patch.</p>
<p>Seriously though, that's an interesting one. They're different receptors, so your brain would get hit with both. You may very well feel both at the same time, which would be real strange</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>in some cuisines, red chilli peppers are often used with mint (along with other herbs/spices like cumin, szechuan peppers, coriander, star anise etc) to cook lamb/beef in</p>
<p>the chilli pepper seems to take main stage and you get a deminished sensation from the menthol. I suppose we could experiment with a simple combo of chilli with lots and lots of mint to see if we can avoid chilli being the dominant flavour</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mint also relies on its scent, as most flavors do. If you were to eat a peppermint with a clogged nose, it will taste sweet and cool. The same with spearmint. Eat them with open nasal passages, and you'll detect that both are mint, and also that they are two different kinds of mint.</p></div>		</li>
