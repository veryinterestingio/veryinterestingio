			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the reasons fluid humanoid robotics are verrrry hard. The robotic 'choppiness' is just that it's emulating from the bottom up and explicitly putting all these small actions together (so it has to aim for something simpler than what we do). AI improvements are helping emulate a top down approach but we're far from nature's performance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had no idea that's why robots walked so choppily, but it makes complete sense. It also makes sense to do the &quot;top-down approach&quot; - tell the robot to &quot;walk&quot; and let it figure out the details.</p></div>		</li>
