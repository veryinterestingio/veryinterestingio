			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Competing effectively means making the right tradeoffs, and the tradeoffs change when the rewards and margins for the different choices change.  Spend X amount more efficiently extracting water means you can't spend that soaking up sunlight.  In a desert, where sunlight's easy to come by, water not so much, you spend it on getting water.  Other places, you spend it getting sunlight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The real question is, why does life seem to have a certain number of 'evolution statpoints'  and why must it make tradeoffs. Why can't it just always keep all the best stuff. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because there is no &quot;best.&quot;  Thinking of evolution as a move from worse-to-best is false. </p>
<p>Eyes, for example, are great.  Who doesn't like seeing things?  Still, there are dozens, if not hundreds of species that once had eyes and lost them once they became resident in cave systems that had no light.  It might be better to have eyes, and they'd certainly come in handy if the descendants of those cave-dwellers ever ventured into the light, BUT in the meanwhile, those eyes are metabolically expensive for every individual and every generation in the caves.</p>
<p>They take resources to nourish and over time, individuals that accumulate genetic changes that shrink, then eliminate, the eye will have more resources to move, feed, and breed until the eyeless are the only ones left.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because that's how evolution works. If you're going to spend energy and resources developing an efficient way of extracting water in an environment where water is plentiful then your competitor that didn't spend all that energy for no reason is going to have that energy to grow more useful systems in the environment, reproduce, etc.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It does, you are seeing it. Though &quot;best&quot; just means survives to procreate. Though I think you are suggesting things such as a creature being both the best at swimming AND the best at running. The problem is the configuration of bones and muscles for one is completely different from the other, so it is not physically possible. Sometimes instead of not physically possible it is not chemically possible, like saltwater fish introduced into a freshwater environment.</p></div>		</li>
