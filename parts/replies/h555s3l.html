			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm like that too... My cabinet has about 10 times as many cups as I'd ever need at any one time. I don't know why this happens, but I somehow always just end up with more and more cups! The variance in shapes has made the alternating quite akin to some sort of strange jigsaw puzzle.</p>
<p>And what's with never being able to fit the last cup in the cabinet? It fit before, but not now? </p>
<p>The mind boggles..</p></div>		</li>

I have to run the bottom of the mold under hot water to loosen them up, then push the silicone bottoms up as much as they will go. Much more difficult than a standard ice cube tray.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also have the silicone cube one but I feel like the silicone itself doesn’t allow you to pry them out. With a standard rigid tray you can twist the entire tray which makes the ice cubes pop right out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>with a silicone one, you can push the soft material from the bottom to turn the mould inside-out. I have silicone ice trays that have a more classic shape, and they pop out quite easily. The &quot;true cube&quot; shaped ones release much harder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're not supposed to <em>pry</em> them out of a silicone mold though.  The material is really elastic so you can just grab the top with your fingers and push the cube out from the bottom with your thumbs, stretching the sides open as you push.  It should be a lot easier than a rigid tray.</p></div>		</li>
