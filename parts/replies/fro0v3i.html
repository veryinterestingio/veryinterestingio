			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually you are thinking of endometrial cancer here. Ovarian cancers are not all one and the same - some are just embryonic cells gone rogue, but we think the most common type ovarian cancer (serous epithelial) is increased with more exposure to ovulation; we see less ovarian cancer in birth control pill users, for example. The ovary “makes” estrogen in women who are not on an exogenous form, so it’s not possible to completely extricate the two risks, but the cancer that will actually rise commensurate with obesity is endometrial (uterine). Progesterone-containing IUDs are already being recommended by some OB/GYNs to the super obese as an effective step toward prevention but more study is needed here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Studies are conflicting on whether there is an association between endometriosis and endometrial cancer.  If there is a risk, then it is only slight.</p>
<p>The biggest risk factor for endometrial cancer is unopposed endometrial hyperplasia (or growth in the lining of the uterus without shedding).  The uterine lining grows normally during a menstrual cycle  under the influence of estrogen and then is shed with increasing doses of progesterone.</p>
<p>However, if a woman has been through menopause and then has unexplained vaginal bleeding, this is a very concerning and she needs to be evaluated by a physician.  Often in these cases, we’ll find that her uterine lining is thickened on ultrasound, and she’ll need a biopsy.  If there isn’t an atypical cells, she can be prescribed a course of progesterone to “clear” the built up lining (and therefore hopefully reduce the risk of malignant cells developing in the tissue).  If there are atypical cells, she’ll need a D&amp;C (dilation and curettage) and regular follow-up.</p>
<p>I think the big take away is that gynecological health doesn’t end at menopause.  Unexplained bleeding should be evaluated.  Other concerning signs are unexplained weight loss (generally if you lose &gt;30 lbs or 5% of your body weight without trying in 6 months) or conversely persistent abdominal bloating and early satiety with eating are also potential warning signs of ovarian cancer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Endometriosis is not thought to be a risk factor for endometrial cancer as far as we know right now. Many of the treatments for endometriosis would probably lower the risk for endometrial cancer, but this is because the goal for both conditions is to inhibit the growth of endometrial cells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would you mind explaining this a little more, I'm very interested, but also not that smart. </p>
<p>I understood that progesterone iuds don't stop ovulation, the birth control part happens from an uninhabitable uterus? So are you saying it is being prescribed to obese people to lessen occurances of ovulation to mitigate cancer risk?</p>
<p>(For reference I have a mirena iud and I feel very effected by the hormone fluctuations of ovulation).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mirena doesn’t prevent ovulation and so wouldn’t prevent ovarian cancer, but it can be used as prevention and even treatment for endometrial cancer (the progesterone can stop the cancerous overgrowth of the endometrial lining that is being caused by excess estrogen that is produced by the obese).</p></div>		</li>
