			<div class="markdown"><p>no that’s not the reason why it releases energy.  the most efficient atoms to fuse together is tritium and deuterium (isotopes of hydrogen). you are right abt how they get fused together so i’m not gonna explain that. but when they are fused they create helium and 1 neutron. if you compare the atomic masses before and after the reactions take place you’ll see that a tiny amount of mass is gone after the reaction. the mass is converted into energy through einstein’s famous equation e=mc^2 so thats is a lot of energy being released bc it’s the mass multiplied by the speed of light squared.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it does conflict because you said that during fusion when energy is released that’s just the particles moving very fast (which they are but that’s not a result of the reaction) the result of the reaction is making a bigger atom and releasing mass in the form of energy (photons)</p></div>		</li>
