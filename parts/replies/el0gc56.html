			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes you technically could. However, these wireless charging systems are tuned such that the drive frequency on the charging coils match the resonant frequency of the phone coil. </p>
<p>Additionally, the Qi standard system used in most samsung wireless chargers operate at at least 100kHz. This is usually a requirement of efficient wireless power transfer. So in order to get a permanent magnet to charge with any real efficiency, you'd need to have a magnet spinning at about 6million RPM. </p>
<p>For reference, a research team in Belgium just set a record for getting a shaft to spin at 1.2 million RPM using air bearings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that the oldest radio transmitters worked (more or less) exactly this way, and ran up to around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexanderson_alternator" target="_blank">30 kHz</a>.  The key is to use hundreds of poles on your rotor, reducing the rotational speed requirements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It boggles my mind that the fastest spinning neutron star (so far) rotates at 760 rps or 43,000 rpm. </p>
<p>I have such a hard time imagining how are why this happens. Incredible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is called a magneto, and is basically how power stations work.  something spins a turbine, (usually steam, but can be wind, water, etc.) connected to magnets, that spin around loops of wires, and give you electricty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC this is how most security access cards work as well. In between the plastic layers of the card is a coil of copper wire attached to a chip. When you hold your card up to the reader the copper coil produces just enough electricity to power the chip so the serial number can be read</p></div>		</li>
