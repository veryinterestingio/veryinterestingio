			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a 4-year-old and she hasn't asked about Amino acids but I explain complicated processes and new terms to her all the time. She likely doesn't understand but it's good to get them exposed to the vocab so when the time does come it will be easier for them to digest. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Dune the stillsuits that capture the body’s moisture (waste, perspiration, etc) and repurposes it for drinking is said to only lose about a thimble full of water each day, allowing a person to survive the Arakeen desert for weeks. </p>
<p>Let’s say for a 5’10” Male around 150 lbs (made up averages), is that remotely realistic as to how much water actually goes towards this process?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the suit also covers the head and traps moisture that your exhaling, then yes absolutely. The vast majority of water you lose is through exhalation, perspiration, and excretion. If you can catch what you lose there and repurpose it you’re golden</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does. The suits have tubes that go into the wearers nostrils and they breathe in through their mouth and out their nose to capture their moisture.</p>
<p>But it’s cool to know that the idea is possible, thanks.</p></div>		</li>
