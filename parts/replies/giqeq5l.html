			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the chlorine or iodine is consumed in the process.  If you drink bleach, you will absolutely get chemical burns.</p>
<p>At trace concentrations though, it will just react away to nothing as you consume it without doing anything interesting to you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agree with you almost completely. Just for the casual observer..a small technicality to take it a step further.  It reacts to form something that is no longer free chlorine. But it's still there.</p>
<p>In the case of chlorine it can form trihalomethanes (tthm) which can be carcinogens and the concentration of which is regulated in drinking water in the US. They are also easily removed with carbon filtration or RO.</p>
<p>So chlorine kills the pathogens, but can leave some undesirable other stuff behind. Not sure what iodine leaves behind but it's used in tablets, but not in municipal drinking water afaik although I have seen it used in wells.</p>
<p>Edit.  Added word municipal</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>also to add to that - with the amount that is in pools some cells will get damaged, the thing is though, humans have layers on layers of cells with a close to impermeable  layer on top called epidermis, all the while a bacterium is a singular cell which doesn't have protective layers such as this, since they need to be able to absorb water to get it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Small correction:</p>
<p>We don't have cell walls. We have cell membranes. Bacteria (mostly) do have cell walls, in addition to their cell membranes.<br />
This is one of the key distinctions between us and bacteria (there are others) that antibiotics use to be lethal to bacteria, and harmless to us: They (some of them) attack the cell wall, which we don't have in the first place.</p>
<p>Note that this doesn't matter for chlorine and iodine, which attack indiscriminately.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would impact you. If you drank bleach or iodine you would get very sick or die.
Edit: even if you TOUCH undiluted bleach it will cause chemical burns. Source: used to be a lifeguard, worked with almost undiluted chlorine, got chemically burned several times.
edit: fixed mistake</p></div>		</li>

<p>I have handled elemental iodine lots of times. Never even got skin irritation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The mechanism by which halogens such as chlorine or iodine kill microbes is not fully understood. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not very complicated - they're strong oxidisers and non-specifically break down organic materials at the molecular level by ripping out electrons, breaking bonds and forming new molecules. Since microbes are simple single-cells and lack the more sophisticated multi-cellular structures and biochemical defences that eukaryotic cells possess, they're more susceptible to this damage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So would the iodine be stealing the free electrons from within the microbe and disrupting its electron transport chain/ respiration? Or would it be ripping its molecules apart instead?</p></div>		</li>
