			<div class="markdown"><p>No OP but there are a multitude of .30 caliber cartridges. I'm not sure of the physics of why but .30 seems to be an ideal battle rifle caliber as it's used throughout the world with different loadings. The following are the same relative caliber:</p>
<ul>
<li>.30-03</li>
<li>.30-06</li>
<li>7.62x51 NATO</li>
<li>30-30</li>
<li>7.62x39 mm</li>
<li>7.62x54r</li>
<li>7.62x39mm</li>
<li>7.62x25mm</li>
<li>30-40 Krag</li>
<li>300 blackout</li>
<li>.308 Winchester</li>
<li>Several others I'm sure I'm not including and also depends on what can be considered .30 caliber (e.g. 8mm Mauser and 8mm Labelle) since the nomenclature is wonky.</li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout all the cartridges mentioned, the bullet weight could vary from as little as 85 grains to 220 grains, they could be round nose or spritzer, they could be lead core or steel core, they could be subsonic or supersonic. This is all one caliber and only a few are interchangeable. Even if you have a 7.62 NATO rifle, it's a bad idea to chamber .308 since the chamber pressure is higher and could damage/stress fracture a rifle not proofed for it. Tell a gun person you have a .30 caliber, they'll ask &quot;thirty caliber wat?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have ever seen a .22 rim fire cartridge, the lead bullet and the brass case both have the same diameter. For the bullet to fit into the case, the base of the lead bullet has a step in its diameter, so a slightly smaller section at the base slides into the inner diameter of the case. </p>
<p>The benefit is that boring the barrel is easier, since it's the same diameter all the way through. Smith and Wesson patented a lot of cartridges back in the 1850's so they would have exclusive rights to make the ammunition for several years. This is why S&amp;W had a 38 and 44, while Colt had a 36 and a 45.</p>
<p>After the S&amp;W patents expired, Colt began making an optional 44 pistol, because of the popularity of the 44 Winchester rifle.</p>
<p>In order to prevent lead from building up in the barrel, the 22 bullets had ridges cast into the sides, as a place to smear grease. We now use a thin copper jacket for that.</p>
<p>The grease worked, but it attracted grit and dust. The early rim-fire cartridges had a copper case, which was cheap to make, but it limited the pressure of the amount of gunpowder you could use. </p>
<p>S&amp;W decided that their line of 22, 25, 32, 38, 41, and 44 caliber rim fires needed to be upgraded to the new Winchester center-fire style, with a stronger brass case and a separate primer.</p>
<p>At that time, they also made the entire lead bullet diameter the same, with no step at the base. This way, the anti lead-fouling grease could be around the base of the bullet, which was now inserted into the brass case for protection from grit. </p>
<p>This meant that, although the case was still 38/100ths of an inch in diameter, the 38 bullet was now actually .357 inches in diameter. </p>
<p>The brass case was also twice as long to hold more gunpowder since the brass was stronger than the previous copper cases. They called it the 38 special, so you wouldnt confuse it with the 38 rimfire. (There was also a 44 rimfire, upgraded to 44 special)</p>
<p>After WW-One, improved powders were available, so S&amp;W began making a &quot;heavy duty&quot; 38 in a 44-special frame, in order to take the higher pressures, encouraged by Elmer Keith.</p>
<p>However, as you can imagine, some people began putting the new 38 heavy duty ammo in the older 38 special pistols, with some of the pistols cracking. Therefore, the 38 heavy ammo duty had their cases increased in length by 1/10th of an inch. This way, 38-special ammo could shoot from a 38 HD pistol, but the 38 HD ammo would not fit in an older 38 special pistol.</p>
<p>For marketing reasons, the 38 HD was renamed .357 magnum in 1935. In 1955, they did the exact same thing with the 44 special, resulting in the 44 magnum. Of course, they could have renamed it the .429 magnum, but 44 mag sounded better.</p>
<p>Will type more in a minute...</p></div>		</li>
