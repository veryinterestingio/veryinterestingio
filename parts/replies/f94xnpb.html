			<div class="markdown"><p>While I agree with much of what you said, I know firsthand for a fact that with training like CBT, DBT, EMDR and strict adherence to lessons taught in therapy many people with add/adhd as well as many other mental impairments can rewire (neuroplasticity) the patterns and symptoms built from many years of reinforcing unhelpful traits. With that rigorous adherence to change, many people can benefit enough to challenge thoughts, redirect patterns of thinking etc, and while our minds may initially jump from subject to subject we can eventually reign that compulsion in and truly decide what to focus on. It just takes lots of work, sometimes many tries (because it is difficult to stay on task in the early years of restructuring patterns, I know that, and as easily as it is for our brains to want to jump around.. it is just as easy for our brains to grow tired of focusing to fight the habits and want to give up). While it may feel without the right support that we are slaves to it, I don't believe that anymore.</p>
<p>For most people living with a cognitive issue I do have faith in them that if they keep going back to try, they will ultimately gain better control of their thoughts little by little, the ability to choose what we focus on and hopefully enough mindfulness that can lead to a less distressful future.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do agree with that, and hope it comes across that I have faith in the original posters ability to challenge that thought. I know without support and even for quite some time with it, it does 'feel' like a fight that can't be won. My fingers are crossed that people who feel that way give the work a try to see that it's often a feeling rather than fact, that most can conquer if determined and given reliable support. I say 'most' because I also understand the levels of an issue like this, that severe cases exist, are more complex, and such levels I can't pretend to understand the difficulty they face day to day as it is different than my own experience(of complex ptsd, ADHD, severe depression, social anxiety disorder...). I know how difficult it is in general, for instance I know how hard I must continue to work after years and years of programs, ongoing therapy to this day, scheduling, digital reminders to draw my attention back periodically etc. Despite days where it feels impossible to stay on the right page, giving in to what my brain instinctively and obsessively wants to do.. it is possible to challenge those feelings that feel irreversible, maybe not every day but over time more often than was possible without assistance. </p>
<p>All I can do is hope that others who feel trapped as well can hear accounts like my own and know it's not impossible, things here aren't 'fixed' but can become more manageable, little by little until all of the 'little's' add up. Anyone out there struggling, take care, try not to let it keep you from fighting for control, tell yourself it's possible, for fucks sake breathe (!), and go easy on yourselves today. I don't know you, but I believe in you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I found CBT intensely demotivating because I can recognise the signs or patterns perfectly fine but I can't change the result. For me I typically get the urge to quickly do something else routine or easy, such as check Reddit or get up and get a coffee, rather than take steps to complete the task I want to do. However, knowing that I'm about to do that doesn't help, it's not like I'm making excuses to myself that it's okay or that it's something that I want to do instead. (I will frequently open Reddit on a new monitor despite the fact it was already open on my last monitor and I was reading something.) It's more like the action happens anyway and if I try to really force it to stop things get cloudy and then I don't do anything and sink into a depressive state.</p>
<p>I tried CBT when I was struggling to complete coursework, but then I ended up on the floor unable to move in what I think was an anxiety attack (felt like I was about to die). The woman trying to help was losing her patience because I was unable to explain why what she was telling me didn't actually work and that &quot;recognizing the pattern of procrastination&quot; didn't change anything and just made me feel powerless.</p>
<p>I'll quite happily work for 11 hours straight on some occasions though. I have a hyperfocus ability, but it feels like brain is being flooded with poison if I try to do that when it's not happening naturally.</p></div>		</li>
