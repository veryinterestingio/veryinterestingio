<p>Technically there are also photon-photon interactions, they are just so rare that they are negligible in most cases. With <em>ideal</em> walls they would be the dominant interaction and thermalize the gas over long timescales.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That depends on the ensemble and in the simplest micro-canonical and canonical ensembles we would work with a fixed number of photons. I'm not really sure what you're worried about.</p></div>		</li>
