			<div class="markdown"><p>Could part of the reason be how common wigs have been through history? And up until very recently, most men wore hats a lot. When life spans were shorter and people married younger, fewer men would be worrying about their attractiveness by the time they start balding.</p>
<p>Just guessing, although I bet there's been &quot;cures&quot; for baldness on the market since ancient times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah, the reason is much simpler.</p>
<p>You need to act on a pretty complex chemical system to make hair regrow.</p>
<p>No way they had the tech to do that before like 40-50 years ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An interesting thing is that if you take hair from an area of the scalp that isn't affected and transplant it into an affected area, they will keep growing and remain unaffected. So it appears to be even more complicated than just the location. There's a lot we don't understand.</p></div>		</li>
