			<div class="markdown"><p>You can hear a bit of their tone/timbre through coughs and sneezes, but more likely you just recognise their sneeze because you know them and have heard them sneeze or whatever before. People tend to have very distinctive sneezes.</p>
<p>If you heard a random celebrity sneeze or cough, I'd be very impressed if you could identify them, even if it was someone with a really distinctive and easy to recognise voice.</p></div>		</li>
