			<div class="markdown"><p>I did a science fair project in grade school in which I bit into each flavor of lifesavers to check whether I could see a spark (also a good excuse to eat a lot of candy).  I saw sparks on each of the white minty ones (wintergreen, peppermint, etc.), but not on the sugary ones (five flavors, butter rum, etc.).</p>
<p>I then compared ingredients and found the one common to the white minty ones was Stearic Acid.  I concluded that Stearic Acid is probably causing the light.</p>
<p>Thanks for the insight, now I understand what was going on better.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Buut flavours aren't usually listed as the actual molecules they are composed of, so the difference could still be from the flavours themselves.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Other kids did how many licks it took to get to the center of a tootsie pop, how salt/sugar affected the freezing point of water, and one kid did the negative effects of various liquids on human teeth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My solid state physics isn't the best but until I'm corrected on the nuance this picture will probably work, but lacks a bit of eloquence. You're shearing unit cells apart from each other, which have a little bit of electron sharing as the packing arrangement is favorable. You take something macroscopic that is low in energy and you smash it with a hammer, leaving weird things at the edges of the new crystals. They're not at their minimum in this new situation due to the rapidity of the breaking, as some electron excess and defects occurred in some of the newly fractured crystals. Triboluminescence is seeing the relaxation process of these freshly fractured crystals. </p></div>		</li>
