			<div class="markdown"><p>While this is a great response, to go into slightly more detail, air doesn't conduct in the same way that metals conduct electricity. In conductors, electrons are free to move around in an applied electric field (voltage). Once voltages exceed the dielectric strength of air, 3 x 10^6 V/m, air becomes partially ionized, which means that the valence electrons are stripped from their atoms. Now that there are free electrons (and their previous atoms, now positively charged, but more massive), they will move in the electric fields; et voila. Current is literally just moving charges.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If one strips an electron from an atom, the atom now has a charge of +e. This means that it will move in the opposite direction of the electron in an applied electric field. The Lorentz force will be equivalent, but the atom will accelerate less than the electron as it's significantly more massive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a pure vacuum, arcing is not possible. The space environment surrounding the Earth is not a pure vacuum. Additionally, if you have any contamination on your satellite (for example, a fingerprint), it may outgas creating a locally elevated pressure that may enable arcing. </p>
<p>The arcing events spacecraft designers are primarily concerned with aren’t gas arcs. Once you get down to LEO pressures, the main arc events you’ll encounter are surface arc tracking, or flashover. Those events manifest when you have contamination on the surface that lowers the surface resistance enough to support an arc. </p>
<p>Here’s a publication that NASA released on surface tracking/flashover studies for Kapton wiring harnesses:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless you define a vacuum as not containing any metal surfaces, you can absolutely have arcing in &quot;perfect&quot; vacuum. They are called vacuum arcs.</p>
<p>The trick is that if you expose a metal surface to a strong electric field, electrons will tunnel out through the surface, and it will be concentrated on any field-concentrating nano-tips etc. This will in turn heat the tips up, which causes them to release gas. If the gas is dense enough, and the electron shower powerful enough, you'll have the seed for an arc.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a spacecraft, specifically, I would imagine that satellites in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geosynchronous_orbit" target="_blank">geosynchronous orbit</a> (at around 35km altitude); arcing could come from static electricity from the upper parts of the atmosphere.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere" target="_blank">(The article on the ionosphere has a helpful diagram of the various atmosphere classifications)</a>  These higher parts of the atmosphere are not completely empty, and satellites are moving extremely quickly, so charge can build up over time from friction.</p>
<p>More commonly on Earth, cathode ray tubes make electron beams (a.k.a. a vacuum ark) and were very commonly made for old CRT (cathode ray tube) televisions.

<p>Um, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_arc" target="_blank">yes you do</a>. They just aren't as visible/dramatic as an arc in air. That's because when electrons arc through a gas they create columns of superheated, energetic ions which emit visible radiation as the excited ions fall back to a less-excited state. In a vacuum it takes a lot more voltage but eventually the electrons are ejected from the cathode and travel to the anode, arcing mostly invisibly since there are few atoms in the way to ionize.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He's not talking about pure electron emission (thermionic/cold field, ...), he's talking about the proper formation of plasmas. And you can definitively get that in what starts out as a vacuum until you apply a field.</p>
<p>What happens is that the cathode emission of electrons can cause a few atoms to evaporate, which then gets ionized in the electron beam, and bombards the surface. If the bombardment and electron beam is intense enough, you'll end up with more atoms than you started with, and you'll get a runaway process.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A side effect of this being that vacuum tubes can actually be more efficient than if they were filled with a conductive gas (like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjMZ5qtyCUc" target="_blank">mercury vapor</a>).  The electrons don't lose any energy over distance, although they do tend to spread out.  At normal scales, vacuum tubes are still much less efficient than transistors or diodes- the heat required to liberate electrons and the additional loss once the electrons hit the other electrode are a huge waste sink for power.</p>
<p>When I was in research, one of the guys in my lab was looking at making nanoscale thermionic devices.  Due to quantum weirdness it becomes much easier to liberate electrons from very small, spiky objects.  As long as you don't try to push too many electrons at once you can get really startlingly high efficiencies and speeds!  AFAIK it's still mostly a novelty thing, but it's really nice how it all comes back around and vacuum tubes are at the bleeding edge of science again.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Could you elaborate that? It piqued my curiosity because it doesn’t seem like it’d require “quantum weirdness” at all, since it’s very easy to liberate electrons from spiky conductors in general. Electrons <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images-archive-read-only/wp-content/uploads/sites/222/2016/02/20113035/Figure_19_07_08a.jpg" target="_blank">become clustered</a> at the point producing strong electric fields, which is sometimes enough to cause arcing entirely on its own. Lightning rods and power stations both use this effect to prevent buildup of charge!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's one definition but it's not, necessarily, the only one. Often times these definitions are one thing in one field and another thing in another. Some fields define an arc as a breakdown of gas by an electric current, others define an arc as the movement of electrons across a poorly-conducting gap.</p>
<p>Thus the confusion, if you ask one type of expert they may give you a different answer than another type of expert. In their own fields they may each be correct.</p></div>		</li>
