			<div class="markdown"><p>Fascinating! So is the age of the ice just determined from a snowfall accumulation rate? And if so, is the rate of snowfall in that region consistent enough for a constant rate to be reliable? Or do they have some way of determining snowfall rates from different periods?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes annual snowfall Rates averaged out is one option. But that partially assumes that the snowfall stays consistent (which in our lifetime it generally does). So there is also another method, just like trees have Rings, ice cores have layers that form over the years that you can count.</p>
<p>It’s also important to remember that even for more recent samples no one can say the exact year it came from, scientists might say its 5000 years old, maybe it’s 5001, maybe it’s 4995, maybe it’s 5025. But its close enough that we are able to look at trends that change over the scale of hundreds of years, where one year or two isn’t super critical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I should point out, that some of these &quot;rings&quot; are layers of ash from very large volcanic eruptions that blotted out the sun for a few years.</p>
<p>So we can use our knowledge of geology to also help verify the timescale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is ice. Not snow.</p>
<p>And, for further explanation, they do not check it against current atmo levels, but the levels in the closest layers of ice. Using the data from when cores were extracted in the past with atmo data then, they can guess what it is currently with a fair degree of accuracy. The more data they collect with accurate atmo data... The easier it is for them to estimate the current levels based on ice cores.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always known this was the method but one thing has always irked me. How do they know there weren't periods of time where the climate was too warm for ice to freeze in that area? They say certain greenhouse gas concentrations historically never exceeded x amount, but couldn't the climate have simply been too warm for the samples to have been frozen in the ice core? Seems like there could be a survivorship bias in the data. I'm sure scientists have thought of this but I've never seen an explanation addressing it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the history of earth? Yes sure. But that’s isnt what ice cores study.</p>
<p>The oldest ice cores max out around 750,000 years ago.</p>
<p>We’re there times where what is now Antarctica was actually green and had dinosaurs on it? Yes there were, and ice cores don’t claim to go back that far. In the grand scheme of the earths life 750,000 years isn’t very long, and there weren’t any extremely warm periods in that shorter timeframe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You cross reference with tree cores, fossil records, and sedimentary layers. Science is collaborative, and you can cross reference between specialized fields. Especially large events like the one that killed the dinosaurs can create basic benchmarks in the records across a lot of different fields.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So they choose areas where there would always be some ice accumulation, that would be our ice caps in Antarctica primarily.</p>
<p>They also use the oxygen isotope ratios to determine how much water was trapped in ice at a given time.</p>
<p>There’s 3 oxygen isotopes-O16, 17 and 18.</p>
<p>The more O18 is in a sample of ice, in relation to the other two isotopes tells more or less how warm or cold the earth was.  O18 is the heaviest and is evaporated in lower quantities for that reason.</p></div>		</li>
