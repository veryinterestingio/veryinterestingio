			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this the technique used to crack the neck is called cervical neck manipulation. Evidence is inconclusive on this practice. With that said studies have shown these quick harsh thrusts can cause tears in an artery leading to the brain, these can cause blood clots and strokes, and in some cases death.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A gal I grew up with had a stroke because of a chiropractor. She worked at a gym with my sister. She went for an appointment during her lunch break, drove back to work, parked, and couldn't get out of her car. A member found her. Really scary. She was only 23 or 24.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm a nurse on a spinal cord injury unit and I've only personally had one patient who was paralyzed by a chiropractor, but I'll still never go to one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s something that happens and it’s incredibly memorable when you see one but it’s not like it is super common. It just can be devastating when it does so once you’ve seen one case... it becomes a giant nope.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nutritionists are still a thing despite the obvious issue of people confusion them with dieticians. Homeopathy just recently became required to have a label describing them as such. There's a lot less regulation than you would think.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve seen babies and a horse being ‘cracked’. Who the fuck thinks a baby needs to be ‘cracked’. They don’t even have fully formed bones, some are still probably pretty much cartilage. </p>
<p>Also, I doubt a human is strong enough to manipulate a horses back/spine. These people are nutters.</p></div>		</li>
