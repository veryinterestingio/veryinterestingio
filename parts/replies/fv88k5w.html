			<div class="markdown"><p>This is great. I think I’ve always understood this part. So now my question is, and maybe this is THE question, but how do we get our brains to not perceive the “meeting with boss” as a threat to our lives?</p>
<p>Are we just not yet evolved to connect those dots? I think you answered this by saying “brain is setup for living in the wild.” So maybe after a few thousand more years of dealing with modern life that will work itself out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Basically, develop ways to change your perception of events in order to avoid triggering innate responses.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The neurological pathways in your brain are set at a young age and once you get to your early to mid-20’s it becomes almost impossible to change your way of thinking.  </p>
<p>Behavioral therapy is one of two ways.  Severe trauma is the other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I generally have more than one job, and it definitely changes my mood when going into meetings, because it removes ALL power from my boss. Does he want to fire me? ok, no problem. I have another job. It's when you are desperate for income that you are totally fucked. Giving someone that much power over you is just absurd.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our brains have probably always recognized social factors like discipline and rejection  as threats. The &quot;predator model&quot; of stress really isn't as scientific as it sounds. Early humans needed to be included in the group to survive because exclusion from the community meant losing the protection of the community. Humans have always been social, which means we likely have always know social stress--otherwise, as you brought up, how would we recognize social factors as a threat?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the thrust of my point above and should be more visible. It's the key to anxiety and depression and other things to understand how our psychological reactions are based on functional evolutionary adaptations to social dynamics. I see lots of people throwing therapy around as an answer but as a therapist myself, we still aren't good at appreciating this the roots of these things. Many of the therapies are basically premised on pretending there isn't a good reason for thinking these thoughts, or that this is just maladaptive learning, rather than functional systems with dysfunctional outcomes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s awareness or mindfulness. It’s not letting anxiety get the best of you. That’s why mental health is of utmost important. It’s being aware that, “ hey I am experiencing stress right now but it’s okay I will get through it just like the thousands of times I’ve done in the pass” instead of succumbing to anxiety or depression which is negative enough in itself but some would resort to drinking, drugs etc. Which leads to more physical and mental damage. Feel and analyze whatever gives you anxiety and accept it instead of escaping or obsessing about it. That’s why therapy is very helpful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is great, except the part about bears. It's a really tired cliche in psychology. Early humans were also social and lived at a time when being excluded from the group would have been near-certain death. Stress related to social factors (inclusion, cohesion, making everyone happy) isn't something that magically appeared in early humans, it has always been there. </p>
<p>The predator model of stress has a really obvious conflict. How does the body recognize &quot;modern&quot; threats if it's still primed recognize only a few physical threats? How can nervous system be both unchanged over time but also entire attuned to stressors that may only be a few years old?</p>
<p>Most evolutionary psychology is a crock of shit because you can't ask dead people what they think. We do know that early humans were social and sought other humans, and from that we can infer that they may have experienced social/emotional stressors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue with this is that flooding the body with fight or flight chemicals in response to being exiled does not provide any benefit to the situation. We are social, but the current stress response, mass dumping of adrenaline for example, to social stressors is problematic for us. This is especially true when most exiles happen to maintain social cohesion and often being more aggressive only reinforces the reason for being exiled.</p>
<p>My degree in biology doesn't really go down the psychological evolution route. I mostly focused on biology from a mechanical perspective. So this heads into a bit of uncharted territory for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with stress is that it is subjective. What one person finds intolerable may be considered motivating or otherwise useful by the next person. Not everyone experience stress as aggression. </p>
<p>Stress is also a biological process driven by the thoughts, emotions, and behaviours we learn from others. We do know that some ancient societies had a fairly sophisticated understanding of mental illnesses, even complex mental illnesses like borderline personality disorders, and they had some knowledge of what we consider self-manageable today.</p>
<p>We also don't know how early humans viewed stress. Modern humans consider it to be a bit of a broken system, and that may have been true for earlier humans as well.</p></div>		</li>

<p>From an individual perspective perhaps but consider it from the herd perspective. What would be reason for an animal to be exiled from its herd? Infectious disease is one. What does excessive cortisol lead to? Inflammation. What is inflammation good for? Ridding the body of disease. What if the disease can't be eradicated? It's better for the herd (and therefore the species) if the infected party dies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can think of it in situation we can still relate to today. </p>
<p>If you are with your group in some unfamiliar woods, exploring, then as it is getting dark you get separated from the group and hear very unfamiliar noises. </p>
<p>That same fear/predator/isolation will make your body activate the same fight/flight system but is something we all can understand today even if it was more applicable a long time ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Evolutionary psychology is no different from any other framework of psychology, except that it takes an extra step of providing a <em>probable</em> answer to the “why” of a phenomenon. Psychologists using an evolutionary perspective don’t tend to make assertions about how ancestral people lived, unless they’re citing anthropological work. It’s just a useful framework to guide your logic in answering questions. </p>
<p>Now if you want a shitty research line in psychology, check out terror management theory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always liked the analogy that if every time you called the fire department, every fire truck showed up with every possible tool for every possible situation and broke down the doors and smashed windows even if the fire didn't need that kind of response. Some things will happen that aren't needed, but whatever you needed will be in there somewhere. The problem is that system can cause other damage when it keeps getting called in to save the day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's one of the big problems with inflammation. The body senses damage and declares martial law , assuming that foreign pathogens have been introduced. But in the case of a bruise or something similar, that may not be true. Even after millions (billions) of years of evolution, the immune system recognizes mitochondria (which likely evolved through endosymbiosis) as foreign bodies and goes to the attack.</p>
<p>Evolution is efficient in its way, it's not &quot;smart&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
