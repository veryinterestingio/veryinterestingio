			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're probably right, or at least pretty close to it. I'm fascinated, because one of the problem areas is right by a new shopping center, and I know they would have had to conduct a traffic study prior to its construction, so someone, somewhere had a plan. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to this. Where do you expect all the traffic to go?</p>
<p>Before you can pass through the intersection you where just stopped at, the traffic at the next intersection must first (or simultaneously) be cleared. If you wish to be able to pass through a series of many intersection with a single traffic sequence - the lights in front of you have to stay green, not at the same time but for a full extra cycle + transit delay time multiplied by the number of intersections you wish to traverse. The problem gets worse when pushed further up the line - the traffic needs to be simultaneously cleared and flowing at each subsequent traffic signal to allow a clear lane for you to drive into. This is ofcourse and infinite series.</p>
<p>Then there's the issue of congestion. Even if you decide to stop traffic on all intersecting minor roads for an hour. Just an indefinite red. Any level of traffic that causes congestion of any amount blows the entire plan. The staged reds help manage flow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess I just don't understand why having a light that turns green as soon as the next light turns red would help ease congestion. In my mind it's more of a problem than a solution, but I'm not a professional and haven't really investigated traffic on adjoining roads, although I can't say that it would be anything significant enough to justify that pattern. Having lights that are green at relatively the same time and turn red in an ascending or descending order would make sense, but these don't. </p>
<p>Edit: Not sure why I'm getting downvoted here for reiterating the same question here as I did above. - _(ツ)_/¯</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And to coat tail off this, but in a different direction, check out your metropolitan areas overall infrastructure and city planning. Is there a lot of squabble about traffic? Is there a thought out structure to the city, especially as far as roads go.
I kind of break it in to two when this happens on a very consistent basis. Either your city planning is on point and your missing lights to be part of the bigger picture. Or, and a lot of growing cities face this problem, your in a traffic clusterfuck and so many people are pleading their own self interests in the logistics that nobody can take control and create a plan. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this someone going the opposite direction wants the same thing so all the lights have to stay on long enough to clear the intersection in both directions. A couple lights can be synchronized but beyond that it wouldn't work very well overall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've lived in several cities that set their lights to get traffic into town in the morning and out of town at night. If you're going in the direction the planners expect, you hit nothing but green. If you're going the other way, you always get caught by red lights. That may be what's going on here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a main street where I live like this.  If you go the posted speed limit (30mph) you can effectively never hit the brakes or come to a full stop for a good 3 miles.  In the other direction you can't rely on this unless it's a certain time of day.  It's also kind of amusing to see the other cars hit full throttle at the green light only to have to brake at the next while I come steadily and pass right by them going the posted speed.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on, as you said, there's traffic studies and plans made for this sort of thing. Initially it takes a little guess work but with the vast amount of traffic data they can narrow it down to be pretty exact to what's optimal for their goals. Once it's in place, there are people who will sit at an intersection for immense amounts of time and count every car that comes through, what direction they're coming from, and what direction they're going once the leave the intersection. Traffic engineering is a thing and is constantly being implemented to optimize whatever goals the client (usually city but could be private for something like a shopping complex) has. This can be optimal traffic flow, safety, etc. While it might be hard to see/not make sense to you (and I know it can get very frustrating when you're hitting every light and just want to get home), there is a plan in place for how the lights operate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>City employee here. This is pretty spot on. I'm always hassling the traffic control guys in Pub. Works to give me all greens at 5pm to no avail, but I did learn a lot about how TC works.</p>
<p>I think one thing that most people don't realize is that all traffic control in medium to larger cities is a quilt work of different infrastructure and monitoring systems. If you're in a town of 100k+ population there are likely 3-4 completely different and non-connected traffic control systems ranging from years to decades from when they were installed. </p>
<p>A lot of lights are also timed depending on the time of day. During rush hour the focus is on keeping greens/reds longer to help people get on the highway and not back up traffic in the inner city. In the early morning, mid day and evening hours most traffic control is regulated towards the magnetic sensors you drive over so traffic can be prioritized on demand. I know in some larger cities there will be traffic control switches that will be in sync with other lights that are dozens of blocks away. It is actually pretty cool.</p>
<p>I also found out that in busy downtown areas during rush hour you likely don't need to hit the crosswalk button if you are a pedestrian. The reason being that those intersections are essentially on autopilot and you pressing the button does nothing at all. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This.  I too am a city employee, and was in on a meeting the other day where our city is starting to utilize waze data for low budget traffic studies.  </p>
<p>So historically it was a complaint driven system to get things changed.  And an intensive traffic study was performed at a great cost, some over 50,000$ of it's a bigger stretch.  And it may turn out to not really be that bad, but there were just a lot of complainers on that route.  With Waze, it tracks people's phones location and can tell speed and congestion.  You can look at this at a glance, and for free, to see if there are any glaring issues that require further study or if it's within reason.  </p>
<p>Sometimes there's just no way to fix something easily by adjusting lights unless you just redo a street or intersection, which could cost millions.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. In downtown areas in all major cities there is almost zero wiggle room for road expansions. We have an issue with a local intersection under the 101 frwy and it has been a nightmare for decades and will continue to be a nightmare for decades. There is just no way to fix it unless there was magically a 200 million dollar surplus in the annual budget. </p></div>		</li>
