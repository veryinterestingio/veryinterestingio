			<div class="markdown"><p>From reading about them over the past several years, and from study as I'm also a graphics programmer who studies how people see things.  It is one of many topics I love.</p>
<p>There are actually several types of color-related issues that affect how people see a mix of colors, not just tetrachromats.  If you've ever seen chromatographs </p>
<p>Every color of chemical has a unique blend of wavelengths, <a href="http://ledmuseum.candlepower.us/27/hygeni7.gif" target="_blank">like this one</a>.  Even things you may think look white tend to have bands with peaks and troughs. When paints, dyes, and other pigments are mixed they create their own unique spectral signature.</p>
<p>Most people are sensitive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_cell#/media/File:Cones_SMJ2_E.svg" target="_blank">around three peak wavelengths</a>: A red around 560 nanometers, a green around 530 nanometers, and a blue around 435 nanometers. The farther a wavelength is from the peak color, the less it detects.  The brain processes the three signals, figures out their relative strength, and gives us a color.</p>
<p>The brain is really good about inferring colors based on those three values, but sometimes it gets confused. If the eyes see something that excites both the blue and the green, the brain doesn't fully know the difference between seeing one primary wavelength around 475 nm, or if it is seeing a mix of wavelengths around it. It can guess accurately much of the time because there is so much overlap of the sensors, but we need to use technology to reveal which frequencies are actually present.</p>
<p>However, not everyone peaks at those values.  People who are dichromat or monochromat color blind are missing one or two of those sensors.  But they aren't all the people.  Some people have natural drift on where the peak sensitivity is. When the sensitivity is different the perception of the colors is different. Perception also changes as we age, for example, children are more sensitive to blues than adults, and children are markedly better at differentiating between mixed blue colors.  That is, both may appear similar, but they have many wavelengths of light which the eye averages out and sees as blue.  </p>
<p>Tetrachromats have a fourth color they can see, which means they can better tell the difference between mixes of colors.</p>
<p>If the eyes have a different sensitivity, or tetrachromacy, dichromacy, or monochromacy, they can be better or worse at seeing those color blends. There have been scientist artists who intentionally mix colors to be seen differently with different sensitivity.  They may have two or three different pigment mixes that appear to be the same color to some people, but appear as three slightly different colors to someone with the different sensitivity. Then they paint a hidden image with those colors.</p>
<p>That is how color blindness cards -- the real ones that are specially printed -- work. If you have normal vision you see one mix of color dots, but if you have the color sensitivity the cards check for you see a different mix of color dots. You're probably familiar with the cards for dichromats, but they have color cards for tetrachromats too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Brown is pretty much just dark orange. open a color picker and set the color to orangish and you'll see that the dark values of that is where brown resides.</p>
<p>See attached image</p>

<p>Notice how the color slider at the bottom is very definitely orange, but choosing a dark shade of it is definitely brown. </p></div>		</li>
