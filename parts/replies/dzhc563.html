			<div class="markdown"><p>It takes about two years to cultivate a habit of good posture. Yoga and like activities may speed that up, but basically it's practice - and, initially, remembering to sit up properly every time you find yourself slumping. Eventually sitting up properly will become the ingrained habit, and you'll have the muscle tone to go with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A great trick I learned from a physiotherapist is to get properly aligned (after a massage, physio treatment, yoga, if you're able to just do it when you're paying attention, whatever) and then, while in good alignment, have a friend run a strip of sticky tape along your spine (on your skin) from top to bottom. If you fall out of alignment, you'll feel the tape pull on your skin, and you'll feel when you readjust yourself correctly because the tension on the tape will rebalance. Like any habit, training and repetition is key - - keep the tape on for a few hours and it will give you many opportunities to adjust and start to build a better posture habit! </p></div>		</li>
