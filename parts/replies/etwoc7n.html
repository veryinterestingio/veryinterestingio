<p>They aren't understanding that every species is a transitional species. Any individual organism is just a snapshot of life in a 4.5 billion year process of adapting to the environment by means of natural selection.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We kind of have to, it's how our language works and how our brain works. We need concepts like &quot;species&quot; to talk and think about things even though in nature it's usually never so clear.</p>
<p>Still important to keep it in mind and break up the way we think about stuff once in a while.</p></div>		</li>

There are some &quot;pure humans&quot;, some hybrids with neanderthal, some with denisovan and others, and a wide range of varying degrees between all of them. It's best you not delve too far into it though because you'll give the racists ideas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><del><strong>Disclaimer: lots of guess work, feel free to correct me</strong></del></p>
<p><del>I'd say no, because it's likely that vast proportions of the <em>H. sapiens sapiens</em> population have the same fraction and segments of <em>H. sapiens neanderthalensis</em> DNA.</del></p>
<p><del>For example, you probably have the same segment as your brother and sister, who have the same segment as your mother and/or father, and their parents and theirs etc etc. You don't have to go back many generations before you see that it's probable that your entire ethnic group shares most of their neanderthal DNA.</del></p>
<p><del>Despite there being more than 7 billion <em>H. sapiens sapiens</em> running around today, I doubt there are enough unique lineages to make up the whole genome.</del></p>
<p><del>tl;dr: we all have a lil bit of neanderthal in us, but we all have pretty much the same bit.</del></p>
<p>See the reply from /u/zoozema0 to see how wrong I was. In my defense I'm an ecologist and not a geneticist!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A question would also be how much the DNA of the Neanderthals actually differed from Sapiens at that time; I mean, they were able to mingle and create offspring, and probably also shared a common ancestor at some point. So you might end up with a chicken vs egg ordeal for some regions.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit: thinking about this for a second longer: not all DNA mutates at the same rate, so you might be able to use that to your advantage somehow to figure out which mutations happened first.</p></div>		</li>

<p>would be cool though, and many people would also have several neanderthal segments in their genes, so who knows!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more than a simple thought exercise: the coyote wolf hybrid is taking over the USA.</p>

<p>I wonder what happens when new evolutionary pressures (in this case, humanity) cause the hybrid to dominate.</p>
<p>Species shift or new species designation?</p>
<p>That wild canine running around out there is some coyote, some wolf, and some wild dog. And something new.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would almost say it depends on the mother. You could argue that since the female also gives her Mitochondria DNA, the offspring would be slightly more from her family line. thus making the offspring slightly more than 50% of her. But then again, I don't work in a field that has anything to do with that.</p></div>		</li>
