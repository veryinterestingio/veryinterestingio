			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe she's not working the same hours, but it's definitely more taxing day by day when you're having to be creative to earn your money. Marketing, travel, logistics, ... it takes a toll. Working 12s in a factory is tough but it's something you can get used to a lot more quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What happened to that podcast? I feel like it ended very abruptly without any sort of conclusion (especially with the girl who signed up for the makeup MLM to see just how dodgy things could get). Were they threatened with lawsuits?</p></div>		</li>
