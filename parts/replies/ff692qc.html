<p>Motion sickness is, as you said, caused by your brain getting confused about whether you are moving or not. Inner ear tells it you are moving, eyes tell it you are not. However, for that to happen, there needs to be perceptible movement for you inner ear to pick up. In other words, an acceleration of some sort. Like when you take a turn in a car, your inner ear picks up the motion of fluid inside it caused by centrifugal effect as you turn. When you move in a uniform, non-accelerated state, the movement isn’t picked up by your inner ear. Compare it to sitting in a car: you feel no difference between standing still and going 200km/h in a straight line at constant speed. Another example: you can’t feel the rotation of the earth even though you are technically moving through space.</p>
<p>So the astronauts in the ISS can’t perceive that they are moving as their speed is constant. Therefore, the speed that they move at is not a reason for their inner ear to confuse  their brain and make them nauseous. </p>
<p>What does happen in space is, there is no force keeping food on the lower side of your stomach. This leaves the food free to move around more inside the stomach, and the “overstimulation” of the stomach wall makes you nauseous, sort of if you jump up and down a lot after eating a big meal</p>
<p>I had never thought about the problems of defecating in space. Makes the whole rpoopknife thing even funnier.</p></div>		</li>
