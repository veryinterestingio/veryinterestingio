			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting,  I read that the jacobi ellipsoid refers to an object made of uniform matter so perhaps the difference
is that  haumea is not uniform (like most planets have cores and layers )</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes: when you have different layers in a rotating body, the gravitational attraction of the different layers can interact in complex ways. The shape of the core is often different than the shape of the surface, and these shapes are dependent on the specifics of the internal structure to a modest extent.</p></div>		</li>

Its unusual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobi_ellipsoid" target="_blank">triaxial ellipsoid shape</a> is accounted for by the physics of a self-gravitating deformable body of uniform density.</p></div>		</li>
