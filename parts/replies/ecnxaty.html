			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also worth noting that while a larger rotor has a greater power output, the spacing of the turbines from each other is also proportional to the rotor diameter. In fact both the spacing and power output are proportional to d^2 . So the maximum power output you can achieve per land area (i.e. MW/m^2 ) with a windfarm is actually (mostly) independent of the rotor diameter. The main reason people build big turbines is simply due to the higher windspeeds at higher altitudes, and the economies of scale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Larger rotors also have a power curve that enables better generation in lower peak wind speeds. Rotors have by and large gotten bigger and bigger as more marginal wind farm locations are developed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not completely exactly true, since you could go higher maximum output still with a vertical stack of turbines and take further advantage of the third dimension, or higher density. The total output per dollar invested would certainly drop dramatically, but the total power output per land area would still go up.</p>
<p>use 80 meter diameter turbines with center of rotation at 50 meters (so area covered goes from 10 meters to 90 meters) but put another center of rotation at 150 meters, with another blade set going from 110 meters to 190 meters (And another center of rotation at 250 meters with blades from 210 to 290 meters!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I suppose this notion only applies to wind turbines in the conventional sense, with a single rotor. Though I'm curious as to how dramatically vertically stacked turbines would disturb the airflow around them, since that's what makes it necessary for normal turbines to be spaced about 5 diameters apart (hence resulting in a energy density of about 2 W/m^2 for most windfarms).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't a lower rotor diameter lower the vertical coverage and lower total output? While you can bunch the turbines closer when they are smaller, the vertical coverage would drop. I suppose you could compensate by stacking multiple turbines or tessellating them at different vertical heights to get the same coverage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm assuming that it's because the rotors have to be able to rotate, so that they are always pointing towards the wind. That means the spacing has to increase in two dimensions, just like the size of the rotors are increased in two dimensions. That's why they both scale with d².</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The opposite.  Lower RD turbines spin up more quickly because they require less torque to get them going, resulting in more energy and a much higher net capacity factor.  As a result a wind farm of say 100 2MW turbines will greatly outperform a farm of 50 4MW turbines.  The latter will be cheaper to build but still a less economic investment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. </p>
<p>And the wind turbine makes an AC load, not DC. Things like batteries create a DC load, magnets over copper coils create an AC load. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand most inverters are a sort of transformer with a switching circuit that alternates the current direction through the transformer at the desired frequency. The induction in the transformer coil acts as a low pass filter and smoothes the square wave produced by the switch into a sine wave.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of permanent magnet generators for wind turbines, especially for larger offshore designs, but for the onshore turbines that make up the majority of the wind fleet in most countries, a doubly-fed induction generator is used. These output AC rather than DC, allowing for a smaller inverter.</p></div>		</li>

<p>for a second I thought you were going to explain that wind turbines use rotational energy harvested from wind to power a generator which is used to operate some sort of de-bustion chamber that combines water vapor and CO2 into complex hydrocarbons and spits them out in some form of liquid hydrocarbon mixture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>thanks for the information. I had an interesting thought. So I know that on some airplanes have small winglets on their wings to combat that turbulence effect at the tips. Could that technique be used on a wind turbine as well?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to what others have already mentioned, there are some designs of wind turbines that <em>ducted</em> blades; the blades have a circular enclosure around the outside which prevents turbulence at the end of the blades. I believe they do increase the efficiency of the turbine considerably but the increased cost and complexity, and potential hazards during high winds, mean that they haven't caught on.</p>
<p>Edit: the wing tip winglets are actually a design found in nature, check it out: <a href="https://www.uh.edu/engines/redtailedhawkiwingtips.jpg" target="_blank">https://www.uh.edu/engines/redtailedhawkiwingtips.jpg</a></p></div>		</li>
