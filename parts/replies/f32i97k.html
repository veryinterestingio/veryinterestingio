			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, they were kind of right.</p>
<p>If I say &quot;Joe must be wearing a red shirt because its Wednesday&quot; despite having never seen Joe on a Wednesday, or discussing his wardrobe with him, am I right or lucky when Joe walks in wearing red and then confirms &quot;I mean I just pick randomly, I dont like, wear red every Wednesday or anything&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both. They were right <em>and</em> lucky, for that instance. Their hypothesis would be valid, until the following week, then you get double the sample pool and so on.</p>
<p>The important distinction we should focus on is that just because you are right <em>does not</em> mean you are being scientific. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The hypothesis was not proven right. There is no continent on the south pole that balances out the landmasses in the northern hemisphere, there just happens to be a continent on the south pole. Reality happened to intersect with the conclusion of their wrong hypothesis.</p></div>		</li>
