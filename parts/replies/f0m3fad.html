			<div class="markdown"><p>To follow up, music is usually the last part of the production process. The composer will receive rough cuts of the film along the production schedule, and will time out all hit points and scenes themselves and write the music to fit exactly to the picture. (But they will also have spotting sessions with the director or other members of the team, usually just the director though, to determine where they think music is needed and what might work best where). As scene lengths/dialogue changes over the course of production, the composer will have to alter the score accordingly.</p>
<p>And in more detail, the music files that are delivered will be embedded with timecode, which allows them to be imported straight to that exact timecode in the final mixing sessions, so there's no question of where the files need to go</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't understand why this isn't the top answer. I'm a professional animator and the first answer applauding the voice actors is wrong. The voice artists ARE VERY talented but that comes first. It's us that then animate everything to the voice track and/or sound track.  We couldn't do it without the sound files, granted. But it's our job to sync everything and work out timings. This is then made even slicker thought editing and additional sound effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting sidebar (I'm an animation writer): a lot of the time, after the movie is completed but not completely &quot;locked,&quot; if it tests poorly, they will STILL hire writers to come in and punch up the dialogue.  You're asked to come up with funnier dialogue, but that will fit the existing mouth movements already animated.  Sometimes there's a little bit of budget left to re-animate mouth movements; other times you just have to work with what's there.   You live for when the character has their back to the camera.  </p>
<p>Another sidebar as long as I'm sidebarring: back in the day when there was a lesser, direct-to-video sequel to a major animated picture, or mini-featurettes on the DVD, many of the top comic voice actors had voice doubles (Eddie Murphy, Nathan Lane (Timon in the Lion King) even Robin Williams).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>LOL. If I had a dime for every time I was told the picture was “locked”... I’d have about tree fiddy. </p>
<p>A sidebar to your sidebar, the voice actor for Woody from Toy Story in all the non-movie appearances is done by Tom Hank’s brother Jim Hanks. Very similar voices.</p></div>		</li>
