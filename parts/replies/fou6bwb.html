			<div class="markdown"><p>Slight deviation from the original question:</p>
<p>Can we do anything to mitigate the symptoms of an erupting volcano given enough lead time? I'm thinking along the lines of managing the Ash cloud somehow, maybe a way to manipulate the weather to encourage rain? What about some sort massive excavation effort to put a billion gallon lake over the eruption site?</p>
<p>Realistically, can we expect to control the flow of lava for an eruption to direct it away from cities? Again, excavation might be able to &quot;moat-up&quot; around a city or critical infrastructure? Can we even predict what the eruption will produce in terms of volumes of lava?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The lava flow questions are directly addressed in the write up I posted. We can't necessarily predict volumes, we can use past eruptions of the same volcano as a guide though.</p>
<p>The 'billion gallon lake' idea is similar to the NASA thought experiment of how to siphon heat off Yellowstone, which is also addressed in the article (spoiler alert, it would take hundreds-thousands of years and probably wouldn't work anyway).</p></div>		</li>

<p>While I was not present for this event. I was present for a similar undertaking in the early 90's when Mt. Etna erupted again.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not sure if that's sufficient to avoid a 'year without summer' though like when Mount Tambora erupted in 1815. Also, airplanes and volcanic ashes are not a great combo.</p></div>		</li>

<p>(3) other strategies like bombing a volcano, if they did anything, would most likely just trigger an eruption.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fun fact: this was (sort of) done before <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/found-two-bombs-dropped-hawaii-volcano-1935-180974429/" target="_blank">at Hawaii in 1935.</a> It was a lava flow rather than the actual vent or fissure which was targeted, but it’s still a good indicator of how tricky it is for us to do anything about it. We certainly have more powerful bombs to use today, but would we really want to when it’s fairly unpredictable on how it will play out?</p>
<p>Despite that chap declaring his bombing a success, it didn’t do what he wanted it to and the lava flow died out before hitting any settlements almost certainly because it was going to anyway. There are always complications with trying to divert lava flows too, seeing as it’s not something we can typically practice a lot. In that case, I think it started to go through forested area and caused wildfires before it stopped.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Controlled release of faults has been studied in the past. I can't find the paper right now, but a thought experiment was published back in the 60s to study the feasibility of releasing strain on the San Andreas using a combination of increased pour pressure (i.e., flooding the fault zone) and small yield explosives.</p>
<p>Immense costs aside, the generally accepted conclusion for such a plan is that it wouldn't work in any predictable fashion. Faults are very complex and dynamic systems... the physical extents and stress fields of even well-instrumented fault systems (e.g., San Andreas) are not fully mapped.</p>
<p>The most likely outcome for any sort of geo-engineering would be either no impact, or transfer of stress from one portion of the fault to another, which would change the entire system and require a remapping of the stress field.</p></div>		</li>
