			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh, maybe that's why I've not been eating as much lately. I already have a really weird appetite, but I've been playing a lot more intense multiplayer games lately and have started to feel less hungry lately as well. Interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get that same sinking feeling and instantly have to take a crap anytime i’m in an enclosed dark place like a cave or abandoned houses/sheds etc..<br />
I’ve never felt scared or anything though,love going through places like that.<br />
Always thought it was strange though how it’s almost instant and exactly like i’ve read in books when someone is very scared or filled with impending doom or dread.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This totally just reminded me - when I was a kid, my cousin and I would play hide and seek at our grandma's house. She was a few years older than me, but was always cool and willing to play with me; and hide and seek was something I really didn't play outside of these times. </p>
<p>Well every time it was my turn to hide, I would get the strongest urge to poop. Every. Single. Time. I had no idea why - and this now explains it. But one day after successfully talking her into a game, I felt the sudden urge hit. Kid me decided to 'hide' on the toilet - so I could 'poop and play'. The look on her face when she found me was priceless. Even more so when she asked me why and I explained. I'm also pretty sure that was the <em>last</em> time we ever played hide and seek. lol</p></div>		</li>
