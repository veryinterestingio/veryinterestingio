			<div class="markdown"><p>The concept you're talking about is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_mimicry" target="_blank"><em>molecular mimicry</em></a>, where a molecule on a pathogen is so similar to a molecule in the body that the immune system will recognize and attack both. This is the underlying mechanism of rheumatic fever and Guillain-Barr√© syndrome, for example. It is not involved in allergy, although I could see why you'd think so.</p>
<p>It's difficult to quantify exactly how &quot;unique&quot; the spike protein is. However, the immune system is extremely good at being specific in its targeting, as evidenced by the fact that molecular mimicry occurs in only a handful of diseases. Also, the spike protein your body will assemble after receiving this vaccine is identical to the spike protein you'd encounter with a SARS-CoV-2 infection. <del>As far as I know, we have no reason to believe that molecular mimicry plays a role in COVID-19</del>. And, even if it did, it is unlikely that, of the 26 proteins the viral genome encodes, the spike protein would be the one causing molecular mimicry.</p>
<p>Edit: I did some digging and it turned out that there are some theories that there may be some molecular mimicry of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7289100/" target="_blank">Here</a> is a study showing that the spike protein is has some similarities with proteins found in the body, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7289093/" target="_blank">here</a> is a letter consering other viral proteins. </p>
<p>However, just because proteins are similar does not necessarily mean that molecular mimicry occurs. Theoretical possibilities can be discussed ad nauseum, but only actual safety testing will reveal whether the vaccine is safe or not. So far, the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines appear very safe, and there's no real reason to believe that the future will show otherwise. Of course, the safety of the vaccines will continue to be monitored even after they're put into widespread use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And to add to this, I believe because they are targeting the actual spike protein itself, any issues with mimicry would likely happen anyway if you were to become infected with an actual Covid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice overview. One thing I needed refreshing on, was how on earth does a cell recognize a protein as foreign, amongst all the proteins it is normally producing. The TLDR is that proteins are presented on the cell surface, and a T-cell makes the decision on whether it is foreign or not. T-cells know because they have been trained from the get-go to recognize (bind to) all body proteins within a certain amount of time, and if they can't, it is presumed foreign.</p>
