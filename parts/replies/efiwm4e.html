<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Case in point - Cuba.  There are two living species of crocodile there - the American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) and Cuban crocodile (Crocodylus rhombifer).  The Cuban croc is known for being especially aggressive, but the larger American crocodile outcompetes it for nesting space in brackish-water environments along the coast.  Sea level change wasn't much of a problem before humans showed up - the two species shifted their ranges as their preferred habitats moved.  But now, as sea level rises, the Cuban croc is going to be pinched between brackish water and cultivation.  In the wild, it may be doomed. (It's already critically endangered, though thankfully, it reproduces in captivity reasonably well.)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I suspect that's going to be true more or less everywhere.  Crocs and gators will try to move themselves around in response to changing climate and sea level, but only if there's somewhere to go.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Regarding the Great Lakes - gators are unlikely to occur there, but they did extend further north during warmer periods between glacial episodes.  There are alligator remains from Missouri (not far from St. Louis) and down-state Illinois.  These probably moved along the Mississippi drainage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is my question as well. With rising temps, will we in the Great Lakes area be looking at migration into our waterways?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is certainly possible (though probably won't happen for a long time, even with the relatively rapid rate of warming). There is at least circumstantial evidence that American alligators have been expanding their range slowly northward. However, just because it becomes warm enough for alligators to live in a place doesn't mean they will rush to move. There will probably be a substantial lag between the expansion of habitat warm enough for them and them actually filling that space.</p></div>		</li>
