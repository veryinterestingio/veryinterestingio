			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. It is also irrelevant if they formed before or after. Tidal interactions always act to align the secondaries orbital vector with the primaries spin vector. The timescale for dampening of inclination is the same as the timescale for circularisation. Since Uranus' moons have near zero eccentricity it would be expected they would be aligned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also I have to add (for the original poster) to say that it is not certain that it was a giant impact (or multiple) as the tilting of the rotation axis can be done by other mechanisms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does that mean a Dyson swarm is impossible? Not just because intersecting orbits would be a headache, but because any ring of solar cells not parallel to the equator would eventually migrate toward the equator, and potentially use more energy than they produce to stay aligned?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is an interesting question. If they were left on their own then it would be a problem. However, the amount of energy (assuming they were made out of solar panels only as efficient as we have today) they would generate would likely be enough to keep them where they are meant to be. You would just have to negate the build up of small perturbations over a long time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gravity is ridiculously weak. Subtle effects of gravity, like those that would align the orbits, are even weaker. They would definitely be more than able to course correct with the energy they collect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;push&quot; to make them align with the equator would be highly determined by the closeness to the Sun, but would not be powerful on short timescales at any reasonable distance. Even the limited efficiency of our current solar panels would produce more than enough power to correct this orbital drift. A larger issue would be solar wind slowly pushing the swarm further away, but even this would be more of a &quot;tax&quot; on total power rather than something serious enough to prevent power gains.</p>
<p>The question of how the satellites of the swarm would correct their orbits is the more challenging one (refueling them individually would be very inefficient), but there's a lot of potential ways to handle this. Maybe some of the power could be used to power lasers in further orbits to &quot;push&quot; them back in place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>in general there are a number of mechanisms that can excite inclination. Planet-planet interactions, Kozai-Lidov mechanism, tidal interactions, to name the main ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Uranus it is possible (from simulations) that from the initial conditions of planetary formation that Uranus can tilt on its own just by ejection of a large moon. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0912.0181.pdf" target="_blank">This paper describes it</a>. And I would point out Jacques is not a small name for these kinds of things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am typically against giant impact theories as they are lazy. There are many interesting mechanisms that act on orbital parameters of astrophysical bodies that are significantly more interesting than cosmic billiards!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The giant-impact hypothesis is that a Mars-sized object struck proto-earth, and that ejected the material that eventually became the moon.

			<div class="markdown"><p>We already have a decent understanding of the composition of Uranus, which we've determined by the mass and density of the planet (possibly confirmed by some other observations, I don't remember off the top of my head). It's a lot easier to determine composition by density for gas giants because they don't have thousands of minerals with different densities. Their density scales predictably with increasing gravity towards the core.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Strongly disagree. Just using the average density of a giant planet gives you a very poor idea of internal composition. For example, Jupiter has an average density of 1.3 g/cm^(3)...but the core (as measured from gravitational higher moments) has a density much closer to 12 g/cm^(3).</p>
<p>Planets with surfaces have the benefit that we can measure earthquakes. Analysis of seismological waves can then be back-derived to map out the location and density of layers within the planet. Gas giants have no such benefit, at least not until fields like <a href="https://www.oca.eu/en/jovial-welcome" target="_blank">jovioseismology</a> come into maturity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The moon and the Earth did not collide.  Some giant object hit the Earth when it was very young and flung lots of rock into space, which eventually coalesced into the  moon.  It's a reasonably well accepted theory now because the very oldest rocks on Earth are quite similar to moon rocks, suggesting that the moon came from the Earth.  It would also explain why our moon is unusually big relative to its planet.  So it's both commonly accepted and a neat theory.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Pretty well accepted. But it's not that the moon and early collided, it's that the moon was formed of ejecta created by the impact of a rogue protoplanet early in the solar system's history.</p></div>		</li>
