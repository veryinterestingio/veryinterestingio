			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to this, it is also important to note that there is a cap to this. There is a maximum height which the human structure could reasonably attain based on multiple factors. If a population had the best nutrition possible over generations, they would be taller than the previous generations, but would likely only be as tall as their genetic+structural potential growth level has set. </p></div>		</li>

<p>(Baring the rare case of gigantism caused by a tumor in the pituitary gland. This doesn't really count as the frequency of this disease(?) wouldn't change the average height by a noticeable degree.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Being tall puts you at a higher risk of cancer, blood clots and bone related problems/injuries. It's usually not because of the height itself but the added mass. Being shorter also has it's problems. The average human height will probably find an equilibrium between the social preference for tallness and the physically limitations of the modern human structure.</p></div>		</li>
