<p>The unprecedented rate of warming is arguably as, or perhaps even more, important than the magnitude of warming as this rate is, or will, likely outpace the rate at which ecosystems and human systems can effectively adapt </p>

<p>It always boils down to this. People will often (rightfully) point out that the global temperature has been warmer than it is today at various points of the planet's history. But if you look at the temperature curves, they're almost always gentle slopes where the temperature increases over tens or even hundreds of thousands of years. In the case of anthropogenic warming, the line is basically vertical.</p></div>		</li>
