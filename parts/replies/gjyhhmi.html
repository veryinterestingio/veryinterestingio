			<div class="markdown"><p>I can’t speak as much to lactate metabolism, but when you think about certain athletic events it’s generally attributed to the type of muscle fibers that person has. There are three types of fibers: fast twitch, which uses things like glycogen and phosphocreatine for energy and is useful for things like weight lifting, slow twitch, which are more geared for long use and use fats, and an intermediate fiber type. </p>
<p>Genetic predominance of different kinds of fibers are partially responsible for people having a proclivity for certain activities. A marathon runner, for example, might have more of the slow fibers, but a star power lifter might have more fast twitch. This is only part of it though, because the training you do will hypertrophy, or make bigger, the group you’re using. More to your question, muscle fiber cells are terminally differentiated, so you generally can’t easily make more. You just grow the size of the type you train. This is why a weight lifter can’t necessarily run a marathon even if their legs are giant and defined. </p>
<p>If I had to guess about lactate differences, I’d guess it was related to metabolic rates in the liver and muscle. If you could theoretically upregulate lactate dehydrogenase activity you could theoretically clear it faster, but that wouldn’t necessarily correlate to unlimited energy since it doesn’t solve the fuel problem. </p>
<p>Sorry if that’s brief, I’m on mobile! And I’m not flaired, but I have a background in medicine.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ofc, but that man did run for three days and three nights without stopping and the only reason he did stop was to sleep, not cause his muscles were fatigued or sore.
So yeah, above the muscle group and their roles are important but can we(normal humans) get that kind of endurance by some treatment in our generics?</p>
<p>For reference,  I had this question while reading <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2013/aug/30/dean-karnazes-man-run-forever" target="_blank">this article</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Full disclosure, I’m almost done with medical school, not an exercise physiologist or geneticist, etc. </p>
<p>So in my 4.5ish years of medical school I’ve never encountered the “lactate threshold.” From what I read in your article and from some stuff online it seems like that’s the point where you switch to anaerobic metabolism, which generates lactic acid in the absence of oxygen (compared to normal respiration, anaerobic processes are ~15 times less efficient). To answer your question, I would say no, you can’t modify your genes to handle metabolism better. It goes back to the different proportions of fibers that are specialized for a certain task and probably related to the way the muscles get their blood supply. You do have satellite cells in your muscles that are stem cells capable of making new muscle cells, so it’s theoretically possible to induce those in a lab to develop into endurance fibers, but from a practical standpoint I don’t think it’d be possible in your body on a large scale with gene editing technology. Again, your muscles are already set in their makeup so even if you could edit your DNA it wouldn’t make the cells that are already there change type. Hopefully that was more clear!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes when we are starved for sugar or protein (not enough in the diet or during cancer, for example) the body will break down muscle. While fat is a better energy source, you can’t make glucose (blood sugar) out of it very well. If someone isn’t eating, or under the influence of certain chemical signals, the body will break down proteins in muscle to convert into sugar. In this case the muscle cells get smaller, but you don’t change the number of cells. The same goes if you’re not using a muscle. The most obvious example is someone in a wheelchair; you’d find that their legs are very small, and that’s because the body diverts the resources away from muscle that isn’t being used. This process is called atrophy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a number of adaptions and genetic 'lotteries' one must win in order to run for days at any significant speed. Most healthy humans likely have the capacity to go for 3 days at <em>some speed,</em> only there is no point and walking slowly for days will not impress anyone. </p>
<p>The key question is whether one can change their genetics to go faster.</p>
<p>Gene therapy is being explored, and recently some <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31277975/" target="_blank">promising advances</a> have been made. For athletic performance we are probably talking about tens of different genes and not just one and the cost is currently prohibitive.</p>
<p>It's not possible to change ones genetics through training. To what degree the genes are being used can be modified through training, but there is no special 'gene targeting' training program - just good ol' training. </p>
<p>The genetics will set the upper limit (in terms of speed) for running for days.</p></div>		</li>
