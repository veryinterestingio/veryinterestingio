			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to generalise this a bit. Typically planets and stars are not perfectly spherical (neglecting topography such as mountain ranges). If you include the rotation in the calculation of hydrostatic equilibrium you obtain an oblate spheroid (squashed in the rotation axis), or more specifically to this problem it would be considered a Maclaurin spheroid. If you neglect rotation and include tidal interactions then they take the form of a prolate spheroid (although this is a crude approximation as it assumes an equatorial orbit which may not be the case). Taking both into account the proper shape for stars and planets is a triaxial ellipsoid.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>But in all fairness, you can also get a triaxial ellipsoid just from faster rotation and no tidal forces (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1964ApNr....9..323C" target="_blank">Chandrasekhar &amp; Lebovitz, 1964</a>). Haumea is a great example of this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>wow, I didn't realise there was an intermediate answer to &quot;what shape is Earth?&quot; in regards to pedanticness. Level 0 is &quot;Earth is a sphere&quot;, level 1 is &quot;Earth is an Oblate Spheroid&quot;, level 2 is now &quot;Earth is a triaxial ellipsoid&quot;, level 3 is. &quot;Earth is a Geoid&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Earth is not a geoid. A geoid is a theoretical, undulating surface of equipotential, or equal potential energy. It's a static model of the dynamic gravity field that includes contributions from topography (mountain ranges pull the geoid away from the center) and materials (denser rock will pull the geoid toward the center), but it excludes contributions from higher frequency events, like the lunar and solar tides.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what about even more massive objects rotating at immense speeds? I’ve read that pulsars for example are so massive that features on them could theoretically only be a few atoms tall, despite their quick rotation. But what happens with a Super massive black hole rotating at speeds that approach the speed of light? Would that imply a flattened event horizon?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The deformation of an object depends on competing effects. The centrifugal force and the gravitational force (you can say friction too, which is basically the objects desire to not move). For small dense objects the gravitational force will be harder to overcome. So neutron stars will not suffer much deformation despite their extremely rapid rotation. </p>
<p>Interestingly for neutron stars, the deformation due to rotation is important as it results in a phenomena known as glitches. Basically neutron stars have a hardened crust which is deformed by rotation. As the neutron star spins down the deformation becomes less but the crust is somewhat rigid and doesnt move. At some point there is a rapid redistribution of angular momentum as the crust adapts to the slower rotation rate. I have heard this described as a star-quake, but do not believe this is really how it should be interpreted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The singularity in a rotating black hole has been calculated to be a ring instead of a point! The event horizon would be some squishy spheroid too I imagine, though what flavor I'm not sure. I'd guess oblate because it's only distorting due to rotation. Unless it's got an orbital partner of significant mass, like a neutron star or another black hole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if Pluto is not a planet because it has other large objects in it's orbit, would an earth sized planet with an earth sized moon not be considered a planet? Like a binary planet?</p>
<p>If Pluto eventually came close enough to smaller objects in it's orbit and threw them out of orbit would it then be considered a planet? What is we send a rocket to those objects and artificially pushed them out of Pluto's orbit?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The path-clearing requirement is a little vague tbh. Jupiter has captured asteroids at its stable lagrange points, which some may consider to be not a &quot;clear&quot; orbit (they'd be wrong). The main point the disqualifies Pluto as being a planet is that it has an orbit that is heavily inclined relative to the orbital plane of the solar system.</p></div>		</li>
