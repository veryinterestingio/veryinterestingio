			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a related question: when I get really tired and start uncontrollably yawning, I produce a lot of tears while yawning! Like, my eyes water a lot, to the point where my SO might think I'm upset haha!</p>
<p>My question is: why does this happen? Is it because when I yawn I close my eyes? I'm so curious!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That comes from the fact that when you do a really aggressive yawn, you squeeze a lot of the tissues around your eyes. Your tears start off as fluid in the tissues around the eyes. So when you squeeze them hard like that it causes a little bit more of that fluid than normal to get pushed into your eyes, and the excess rolls out.</p></div>		</li>
