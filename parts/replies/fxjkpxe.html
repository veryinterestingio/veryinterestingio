			<div class="markdown"><p>Nicely put; I really like that example. If you start with a 20-heads-advantage, then flip another 500, you don't expect to land on exactly 50/50 heads in total; instead you expect all the following flips to be 50/50 so the 20-heads-advantage persists. That's a very nuanced explanation of past results not influencing future performance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fundamental building blocks of it shouldn’t be hard to comprehend - but apparently they are.</p>
<p>I can’t tell you how many times I’ve had a conversation - often at a bar - that went something like this:</p>
<p>Other guy: Look at that. Lotto is up to $500 million. Wow! But it’s such a long shot.</p>
<p>Me: You know, you can double your odds of winning if you buy two tickets instead of one.</p>
<p>Other guy: Bullshit. That’s not how it works.</p>
<p>Me. Sure it is. [I give a simple example using small numbers.]</p>
<p>Other guy [under his breath]: Idiot.</p>
<p>One time I was in a golf group with a guy I didn’t know. Looked to be about 25 years old. He said he’d been to about 10 to 15 of the local baseball team’s games every year since he was 10 - and that he’d never seen them lose.</p>
<p>I couldn’t resist. I told him flat out that he either made that up or he was delusional. He reaction was anger that I didn’t take his story at face value.</p>
<p>Speaking of golf, I’m not a very good player anymore. My typical score is around 95.</p>
<p>Now, I can make a par on any hole at any time. So why I can’t string a mere 18 of those in a row and shoot an even-par round? Because I’m not good enough. I usually revert to the mean on the very next hole!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the one aspect that seems to elude people after they have accepted that the flips are independent. If you you have a lucky streak in the beginning, the advantage gained will stay!  Of course there is still a a chance for you to fall below the estimated mean, but your “new” final estimate will include the “luck” in the beginning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's only one pattern of flips that will get you 10 heads in a row, but a ton of ways to get 5 heads and 5 tails depending on the order you get them in. My math says ~252, but I haven't done permutations since highschool, so I might be way off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've not heard many others discuss this idea, but this was why I found out I really enjoyed craps.  I've only played about 3 or 4 different days on a business trip to vegas, so very much a noob.  One night I ended up down there pretty late with a decent amount of shitty liquor in me.  I started looking at the &quot;field&quot; bets, where if any one of the numbers comes up, you win your bet.  Now, at the most basic level, it is 7 out of the 12 possible numbers.  Seems like a no brainer right?  I just ride the field bet, and the law of averages will take me to profit.  However, if you start looking more closely, you will realize the majority of those numbers are on the extremes of the possibilities.  2 for instance.  There is only one way to roll a 2, two 1's.  Same for 12, you have to roll two sixes.  However, for all the other numbers there are more permutations which have increasingly more possible numbers as you get towards the middle.  Most of these numbers are not included in the field bet.  So, while there are more than half of the numbers, there are fewer permutations which allow players to get to this number.  Very interesting psychological trick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly the explanation you want to hit. Of course now I am sitting here thinking about the binomial distribution and the probability that out of the next 100 flips you will get at least 20 more tails than heads, ending up on the other side of the mean, is only about 2.8%. But if you flip 1000 more times instead its 27%. 10000 more flips is 42%. And now what happens when I set up a Markov chain to try to find the average number of flips before we cross 50%... this is what liking math leads to lol</p>
<p>Edit: ah right, random walk. Infinity to the last question.</p></div>		</li>
