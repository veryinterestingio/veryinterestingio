			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't so much an element of FM vs AM, it's just that commercial AM radio is in a lower frequency band.</p>
<p>Those frequencies aren't locked to being AM, you can transmit in almost any kind of modulation on them. With the &quot;radio&quot; you have in your home though, that's all it picks up.</p>
<p>Just clarification, not trying to argue anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true, and an amazing occurrence to happen across. There's essentially no way to predict it, but when it does happen, it's amazing. We call it &quot;skip&quot; because essentially the radio wave skips off the charged ions in the ionosphere around the Earth to travel much farther than it normally would as a ground wave. </p>
<p>It's pretty awesome. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually fm is wider than AM due to the bandwidth requirements</p>
<p>Also it being wide has no bearing on the distance you can be </p>
<p>Distance relates to frequency for example it is not uncommon infact it is common for transmissions below 30 MHz to travel 100s to 1000s of miles this is due to it being able to reflect off the ionosphere (different frequencies work at different times) </p>
<p>FM at least the commercial stuff is broadcast at around 100MHz this is to high to reflect off the ionosphere instead it punches straight through it therefore frequencies above 30 MHz are generally line of sight only </p>
<p>But AM and FM are just methods of encoding audio they don't mean to much outside of that</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They meant wider as in longer wavelength, i.e. lower frequency.</p></div>		</li>
