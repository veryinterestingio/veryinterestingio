			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait: 44,000 times 16 is only 88,000? I thought it would be 704,000 b/s. (Never mind that it is probably either 44.1kHz or 48kHz.) Maybe you meant kB/s?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, Byte is &quot;B&quot;, bit is &quot;b&quot;.</p>
<p>On a related note, kilo is &quot;k&quot;, not &quot;K&quot;. &quot;K&quot; is for Kelvin.</p>
<p>So kilobytes is &quot;kB&quot; and kilobits is &quot;kb&quot;.</p>
<p>Also, Megabyte is &quot;MB&quot; and Megabit is &quot;Mb&quot;. &quot;m&quot; is used for milli.</p>
<p>For some reason people always mix these up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The CD audio standard sample rate is 44.1 KHz, with a 16 bit sample depth it would be 706,000 b/s or 88.2 KB/s. 1.41 Mb/s for both channels uncompressed. 48 KHz is DAT.</p>
<p>That said most audio is compressed by a factor of 4 or more from that, especially anything streamed. It's actually quite rare to hear audio at more than 160 kb/s nowadays.</p>
<p>That's not to say that audio quality is bad, just that the compression standards are very effective at reducing the storage size of audio at an effectively unnoticeable processing cost. This is particularly true for anything processed in the frequency domain.</p>
<p>For example the advanced audio coding (AAC) standard uses a Modified Discrete Cosine Transform (MDCT) and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) creating a variable bit rate that produces a compression effeciency that is usually greater than 2x that of mp3 which was already a 4.4 - 7.3x filesize reduction.</p>
<p>Imperceptible audio quality difference or 10x as many songs. Most consider it a worthwhile trade off considering the cost of data storage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Love AAC. Just wish streaming services would give us 320bit, esp as compression and files sizes are so small. </p>
<p>I pay the same to netflix and amazon prime music, and one sends 4k video, the other I cant even get 192 bit audio without an additional surcharge. Trillion dollar owner.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes sense though. I remember back in the Napster days you’d download a song and it would be X amount of space. If you downloaded it off a CD at high quality it would take up more space. I remember though as time went on the file sizes got smaller, even though it seemed like the quality got better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In context, when transferring between chips (like for AC97 or I2S), you are sending uncompressed data at the fundamental sample rate.</p>
<p>I set my AAC to 320kbps (VBR), which is like the highest setting I can use in iTunes. Much better that 160kbps <strong>anything</strong> my iPhone plays, and my 5.1 computer audio and Etymotic earbuds tell me so. (I am one step from lossless at this point, if it wouldn't fill up my Flash storage.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By convention, to avoid confusion and because capitalisation is annoying (and not supported on many legacy systems), bits per second is usually shortened to bps (or bit/s), while b/s or B/s always means bytes per second. It just makes life so much easier when you don't have to worry about the k being lowercase, all the other prefixes being uppercase, and all the other annoyances that come with confusing semantics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The terminology confusion doesn't end there. In the past Google counted and converted a kilobyte as 1024 bytes,but now a kilobyte is 1000 bytes and a kibibyte is 1024 bytes. So now it's mebibytes as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know how that would work. You keep seconds lower case (s) to reduce confusion from Siemens (S). And I agree prefixes are somewhat inconsistent with the kilo traditionally being lowercase; but then you have milli and Mega, which I'm happy with. And then with micro, ya gotta go greek (µ). </p>
<p>Stick with conventions, or else chaos will reign!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yea and if, in theory, muting stopped the data processing but not pause the sound source (ie. progress bar keeps going), when it was unmuted the app would have to fill up the buffer first before it can start playing again which might take a sec and be counterproductive as an optimization.</p></div>		</li>
