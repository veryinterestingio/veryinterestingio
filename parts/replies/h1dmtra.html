			<div class="markdown"><p>If the receptors are all the same why is the sensation different in the mouth/anus than it is anywhere in the middle?  Don't get me wrong, I'm glad I don't have to feel burning sensations all the way from start to finish but why are the same receptors from 1 site causing burning and from another causing cramps?</p></div>		</li>

<p>this is often tricky when asked of evolved responses.  often the real answer is, &quot;it was easier for your ancient ancestors to keep something that worked okay rather than coming up with a whole new way of doing things,&quot; or, &quot;doing it this way didn't kill people before they had kids, and no one in the environment had evolved a more efficient way of doing it.&quot; </p>
<p>evolution does not tend toward some kind of perfection or ideal, and it doesn't have to make sense to us.  it does the easiest thing it can get away with to pass on one set of genes marginally better than another set.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, this is incorrect. The receptors for this chemical in your nervous system do not need to cause the same response as the ones in your digestive tract. The skin is not apart of the nervous system. I also didn’t say that this receptor is in every part of the nervous system, or what it does there. I specified it’s function in the digestive tract. This receptor stimulates a reaction, in different ways, to alert a human to dangerous heat. This response can be different in different systems. Why are you arguing this?</p></div>		</li>
