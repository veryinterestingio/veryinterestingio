			<div class="markdown"><p>HERVs! One of my favourite aspects of virology. Interestingly, some HERV proteins are linked to a variety of diseases. Some HERV proteins are produced in cancerous cells where they wouldn’t normally be, and there is ongoing research as to whether HERV proteins can be used to detect or even treat some diseases.</p></div>		</li>

And that's not mentioning the others suspected to regulate gene expression and modulate immunity.</p></div>		</li>
