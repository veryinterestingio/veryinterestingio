			<div class="markdown"><p>Finally someone mentioning the Kalman filter. Maybe a bit too complex for an ELI5 but if people would think about it, most of them have seen it in action. </p>
<p>The Kalman filter makes an assumption of where your next position is going to be in order to compensate for irregularities in the measurements of your position. So if you ever took a turn on the road that was different to what your satnav wanted you to do, you might have noticed that it shows your ‘car symbol’ continuing on the route it intended, until finally ‘realising’ that you went somewhere else. This is the Kalman filter telling your GPS sensors that you are going straight, until your GPS sensors are so ‘persistent’ that the filter says ‘well okay then, I guess you’re over on that road?’. And when you start going off road it really messes with the filter because it constantly tries to assume you must be on the nearest road. Pretty funny actually!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is a gyroscope alone able to determine direction? Recently looked into fitbit’s SDK to perhaps make a clock face that would show true north. Most of my search results make it sound like I’d have to use GPS and it likely would burn the battery too much. So my hope was if the gyroscope could be used to determine this, it would be less expensive to the battery?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gyro alone won't be able to determine compass heading. It's purely for rotation. Most smart phones have magnetometer because it's really cheap. Only mid-tier and flagships have gyro which is more expensive. Most Chinese phones have gyro, whereas for Samsung you'll need a Galaxy S3+, Note 3+ or the A series from year 2017+.</p></div>		</li>
