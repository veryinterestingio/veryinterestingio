			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Even in full band, live concerts, performers wear ear pieces designed to block sounds around them so they can hear their desired mix. Almost all have the click and instructional tracks audible. </p>
<p>Performers will have a mini mixing board somewhere where they can adjust the volume of each mic, track, or instrument in their ear. In addition to the drummer example above, vocalists usually have other vocalists turned up higher so they can work on the vocal blend between them.</p>
<p>The audio the performers are producing gets routed in individual channels to a much larger mixing board operated by an audio engineer, who is responsible for “cleaning” the audio in each channel and mixing it in to the audience mix that gets output to a recording device and the main speakers of the venue. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While it's true that some performers have &quot;personal monitor control&quot; systems, most of the time their mix is either controlled by the audio engineer out front who is also mixing the sound the audience hears, or by a second audio engineer with a separate mixing console off the side of the stage. </p>
<p>Also while it's increasingly common for performers to wear in-ear monitors as they are called, many also have specially designed speakers on the floor pointed back up at them called &quot;monitors&quot;. They are also commonly called &quot;wedges&quot; because of their typical wedge shape.</p>

<p>You guys do so much to help the band/performer and it often goes unnoticed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This! Also, if you're on the Beyoncé level of things, you'll have your own audio engineer for your monitor mix, whereas the rest of the band gets a different person.</p>
<p>Which makes me wonder how much time is spent to dial in the mix each night. I'd suspect that most of it is pretty controlled and saved up, but rooms do sound different from venue to venue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dude- I knew all of this except the “instructional” part. It’s so dumb that I never realized you could pipe in stage directions, but given the complexity of some of the staging I’ve seen, it was hard for me to believe they had the whole thing memorized. </p>
<p>Very cool, thanks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vocalists in particular need to hear themselves in order to stay in tune. Vocal tuning is a feedback loop.</p>
<p>In this video (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liyiT_DGREA" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liyiT_DGREA</a>) of The Four Seasons from <del>1963</del> 1975 you see Frankie Valli with large headphones that he only uses while singing. He needed the headphones because at this time in his life he was suffering from hearing loss caused by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otosclerosis" target="_blank">otosclerosis</a> and was almost stone deaf by the late 1970s. Luckily he was able to have inner ear surgery in the 1980s that restored most of his hearing. </p>
<p>Edit: fixed my goof up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They also often have a metronome or “click track” that everybody listens to in order to keep everyone at a steady tempo. Even the most skilled musicians speed up and slow down a bit, especially in a live setting. The metronome helps keep everyone at the same speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly/normally. Only one band member should typically have a click unless you’re dealing with a very high-tier group of musicians. If someone loses the beat and starts playing to their click, and they’re off, it’ll train wreck the song. </p>
<p>Our recommendation was always to have click in the drums only. If the rest of the band is playing to the drummer, everyone stays in time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d disagree. Everyone plays to the same click, that’s the point. If you lose the beat you get back on track with the click that everyone else is playing to. On the contrary, I think only having one member on the click is more likely to cause a trainwreck. What happens if the drummer is laying out for a few bars? If there’s a long guitar intro and then the drummer comes in at a different tempo? I can only speak from my experience. My band has played some major gigs and opened for some national touring acts, but I’d hardly call us “high-tier”. We all play to a click. Every group is different though!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can get in-ear monitor-sourced bootlegs from some artists. I was listening to a U2 bootleg a few months ago, and it was sourced from Edge's (guitarist) IAM. You could hear the whole band, but the guitar was mixed <em>much</em> louder, and Edge's guitar tech was calling out transitions in advance (e.g., &quot;bridge, 2, 3, 4,......&quot;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the opposite. Crowd noise and just the loud sound of the band would be distracting while you're trying to concentrate on the music you're supposed to be focusing on, so a few words every now and then reminding you what is coming up can be helpful. Of course you'd want to rehearse with any voice tracks or stems (extra instrument recordings that aren't actually playing live) before the actual performance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you're in the middle of a song you know well, you're running on reflexes a lot, and you easily &quot;slip&quot; into patterns (like doing verse → bridge → chorus every time in the song, <em>except</em> this once when a solo starts). The reminders can help a lot.</p>
<p>As for throwing you off by being distracting, you're playing in front of a roomful of distractions. The mix is the most familiar thing you'll hear, and helps to attenuate how distracted you can get.</p></div>		</li>
