			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow that sounds interesting! </p>
<p>But what does that mean exactly? That the things that happen forced in a nuclear reactor, somehow happend naturally here?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. This was a very long time ago, when naturally occurring uranium was richer in U-235 than it is now. There was a very rich underground deposit that, combined with groundwater to act as a moderator, achieved criticality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow that is cool and kind og scary lol. Why was it richer back then? Does that have something to do with the Half-life of these materials, and them having &quot;aged&quot; away over time?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way nuclear reactor works (in context of this discussion) is that radiactive ore emits particles, these particles collide with other ore and destabilise more particles, which also start emitting and colliding etc, causing chain reaction. This requires a specific amount of material. So its entirely possible that somewhere on earth a required amount of radioactive material has gathered to create a naturally occuring chain reaction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Natural uranium will not have a chain reaction without very specific and unnatural conditions today (like being embedded in a lattice of extremely pure carbon, or being in heavy water). The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_nuclear_fission_reactor" target="_blank">natural reactor of the past</a> was almost 2 billion years ago, when the concentration of U-235 in natural uranium was much higher (3%, compared to today's 0.7%).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok that's really interesting. So potentially, somewhere, kilometers below the Earth, a natural chain reaction might be going on? Or would we be able to meassure that?</p></div>		</li>
