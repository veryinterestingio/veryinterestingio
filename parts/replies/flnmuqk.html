<p>A hypothetical $100k house is worth more now than the same hypothetical house worth $100k in two years.</p>
<p>And considering they're printing money trying to jumpstart the economy (so there's cashflow), the inflation is worse. Which means that if anyone has savings, they're worth a lot less.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh 2-2.5% a year inflation really isn’t “nothing”. Especially if you’re talking about $100k.  A 2% inflation rate for 5 years on $100k is over $10k “lost”</p></div>		</li>
