			<div class="markdown"><p>As a sidenote, you can use this same logic of &quot;going backwards&quot; to show that 0! = 1 and that (-1)! doesn't exist. </p>
<p>(The exclamation point means &quot;factorial,&quot; where, say, 5! = 5*4*3*2*1 )</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not following that, could someone help?</p>
<p>So, going backwards from 4! is,</p>
<p>4! = 4*3*2*1</p>
<p>3! = 3*2*1</p>
<p>2! = 2*1</p>
<p>1! = 1</p>
<p>I lose the logic after that. How does it work for 0! and (-1)!?</p>
<p>edit - Thanks! I wasn't logicking enough to use the result of the calculation!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of &quot;factorial&quot; as being the number of ways to order things.  I.e. you can order 3 things 3! ways (3<em>2</em>1)  there's only 1 way to order 1 thing, thus 1! = 1.  Likewise, there's only 1 way to order nothing, therefore 0! = 1</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another important thing to understand is that math concepts often start with real life intuition and then later get extended in a way that keeps the structure intact.</p>
<p>So the idea with exponents is repeated multiplication and you &quot;obviously&quot; use positive integers for that. Multiplying a number with itself 0 times or 3/4 times or −2 times makes no sense, intuitively.</p>
<p>With that very basic &quot;repeated multiplication&quot; concept you eventually notice a special property though: 3^(2) × 3^5 = 3^(7), because it does not matter how you &quot;cluster&quot; or &quot;group together&quot; multiplication (fancy math speak: &quot;multiplication is associative&quot;):<br />
(3×3)×(3×3×3×3×3) = 3×3×3×3×3×3×3 = (3×3×3)×(3×3×3×3) = (3×3)×3×(3×3×3)×3 or any other arrangement. So:<br />
3^(2) × 3^5 = 3^(2+5) = 3^(7)<br />
3^(3) × 3^(4) = 3^(3+4) = 3^(7)<br />
3^(2) × 3^(1) × 3^(3) × 3^(1) = 3^(2+1+3+1) = 3^(7)  </p>
<p>Or as a usual general math formula: n^a × n^b = n^a+b</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Great. Now we seem to have some fundamental property that is somewhat special for exponents. And at some point people then start to ask themselves if we can use that to solve these weird questions above we could not answer before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) What is n^(−1) supposed to be?<br />
Well, our formula tells us that n^(2) × n^(−1) = n^(2−1) = n^(1) = n, so in short, we want to find some reasonable thing that fills this gap:<br />
n^2 × ? = n. We need some sort of anti- or backwards multiplication. And we realize we have this concept already: It's called division.<br />
n^2 × (1/n) = n × n / n = n.</p>
<p>Consequently we get the same for negative numbers with higher magnitude, so<br />
n^(−2) = 1 / n^2 or in general: n^(−a) = 1 / n^(a).</p>
<p>Excellent. We not only expanded our exponents to negative numbers, we were able to use something we already had and just needed to connect the dots.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) What is n^(0) supposed to be?<br />
Like MischaBurns posted above already, we now can use our new understanding of negative exponents to get:<br />
n^(0) = n^(a−a) = n^(a) / n^(a) = 1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) What is n^(1/2) supposed to be?<br />
Our formula tells us that<br />
n^(1/2) × n^(1/2) = n^(1/2 + 1/2) = n^(1) = n<br />
So we need some kind of number d (not using x here because that looks too much like the multiplication sign) that makes this equation work:<br />
d × d = n</p>
<p>And again we eventually realize that we know this concept already. It is the square root. √n × √n = n</p>
<p>Consequently the same follows for other fractions, so n^(1/3) is the third root or cube root of n and n^(1/7) is the seventh root of n, meaning you need to multiply three or seven of these things together to arrive at n.</p>
<p>Great. What's with fractions that don't come with a 1 as the numerator though? Well, that's actually very close to what we started with:<br />
n^(3/4) = n^(1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4) = n^(1/4) × n^(1/4) × n^(1/4) = ^(4)√n × ^(4)√n × ^(4)√n<br />
And sure, 4th roots are not exactly intuitive, but they are better than &quot;multiplying with itself one quarter of a time&quot;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And finally we can mix everything together and arrive at horrible messes like<br />
n^(−2/5) = 1 / ^(5)√n^(2), so &quot;1 divided by the fifth root of n squared&quot;.</p>
<p>If someone had shown n^(−2/5) to you to start with and said &quot;here, that's the definition&quot;, the correct response would have been: Yeah, screw you. But knowing that it all just follows from puzzling results together to keep the original idea of exponents intact, I hope it now actually makes sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you don’t believe that 0.999...=1 then why would you believe that 0.333... =1/3? A deeper explanation that 0.999...=1 is because of the sum formula for a geometric series. You can also show that 0.333... converges to 1/3 through the same method.</p></div>		</li>
