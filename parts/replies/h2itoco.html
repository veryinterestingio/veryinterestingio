			<div class="markdown"><p>One egg + 2 sperm have too many chromosomes. May be a living embryo with a heartbeat but still doomed. Partial molar pregnancy, usually terminated due to the risk of cancer and unlikelihood of survival. </p>
<p>One egg that is empty of mother’s chromosomes or for some reason hers are deactivated and two sperm results in a uterus full of grape like cysts and a serious danger of cancer. There is no option but to terminate. It’s not alive anyhow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is called a molar pregnancy or a partial molar pregnancy. It can form an embryo that can be viable for several weeks, well long enough for the woman to know she is pregnant and even see a heartbeat on a monitor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks.  And does a molar pregnancy happen at random or can there be underlying factors that make it more likely?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It usually takes some time, but I would expect it to be variable. Having too much DNA will means that all sorts of biological functions will not take place normally, which will ultimately lead to cell death. Though I don't know the exact answer to this question, I would assume that the embryo would be lost within the first few days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just want to point out that the outcome of the embryo implanting is possible. It will result in a partial or complete molar pregnancy. Partial may have a fully formed embryo with a heartbeat, but is doomed. Usually the result of two sperm and the egg cell combining successfully. Complete has no formed embryo but clumps of cysts because the egg was either empty or mother cells were deactivated. The mass is the result of DNA from the 2 sperm only. </p>
<p>Both are dangerous to the mother and  may turn cancerous.</p></div>		</li>
