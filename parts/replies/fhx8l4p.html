			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that true? I get the bit about thermo being derived from pure mathematics, but aren't things like enthalpies and latent heats for various compounds measured empirically or derived from other empirical measurements?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, this is terribly incorrect. The kinds of things you can derive &quot;from pure mathematics&quot; actually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_recurrence_theorem" target="_blank">contradict (y)our cherished principles of thermodynamics</a>. Poincaré recurrence is a (pure mathematical) feature of many dynamical systems that says that, given sufficient^1 time, you will return as close as you like to your original configuration. That means, if all your gas molecules are on one side of a room, and you want them back there, you can do the following: just wait. Eventually they'll return there. All Hamiltonian systems exhibit this pathology. Ouch!</p>
<p>The idea that &quot;things must spread out in phase space&quot; and they &quot;always seek to maximize disorder&quot; are, like all fairy tales you tell your children at bedtime, gross simplifications or outright lies. </p>
<p>What kinds of systems will, in fact, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermalisation" target="_blank">thermalize</a> is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many_body_localization" target="_blank">open field of research</a>. It's fascinating and beautiful, but by no means solved.</p>
<p>1: And there's the rub: the length of time it would take a macroscopic system to &quot;recur&quot; in this way is fantastically long.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really hurts how much bogus people present as ultimate truth.
Just to clarify (maybe i am not the first one, i did not read all of the responses to this comment): as long as you try to calculate physical results, you will need to rely on empirical measurements one way or the other.
No physical law is directly derived purely from mathematics, you allways! need empirical evidence first to make sure your hypothesis is right, and at the foundation level it allways comes down to quantum dynamics and statistics (which does not mean it's purely mathematical).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not going to put you on blast since you seem genuinely interested in science and physics, which I can appreciate. However, we often rely on mathematical descriptions (laws) of repeatedly observed phenomena so we don’t have to keep repeating experiments. Second, you should understand how ironic the statement you made is, claiming we always need empirical results, yet also claiming that everything in the entire universe boils down to quantum mechanics and thermodynamics, which are exactly the theoretical frameworks you claimed are useless without continued experiment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You've misunderstood the comment you replied to. It isn't discounting the role theory plays in physics. It's noting that all theories are grounded in empiricism and are not created out of pure math alone.</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics isn't derived from a set of mathematical axioms, it's a theory that was written that does an incredibly good job of describing a huge range of experiments. But without experiments, no one would have even considered anything remotely like QM. The Schrodinger Equation wasn't derived. It was, in a sense, a guess. It was a guess motivated by deep insight and physical intuition, but it was a guess. Thermodynamics depends on the fact that all microstates are equally probable. You cannot prove that they are, mathematically. That was a guess that Boltzmann made and it was shown to be a good one through experiment.</p>
<p>There is a reason math and physics are different fields of study. The difference is: with physics <em>everything</em> is founded on observation. How would you even go about, say, <em>proving</em> that masses have to attract each other with an inverse square potential? Or that a changing electric field produces a magnetic field? The only way you can have any indication these things happen is from doing experiments. The theories are devised later as a generalization of many experimental results.</p>
<p>Which means nothing in physics is discovered from first principles, in a fundamental sense.</p></div>		</li>
