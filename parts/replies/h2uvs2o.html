			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not expert… but it sounds like swelling came about because if your joints swelled up more than other folks you were more like to have another 60 seconds of fight left in you and therefore more likely to survive and make babies one day. Thus passing the… likeliness to swell??… down to your offspring. The long term benefits or damage swelling causes weren’t the issue. It was not dying in the moment. Sprained ankles do heal eventually.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's closer to the opposite, since swelling tends to make you far less mobile. Inflammation helps other stages of your immune response, reducing the chances of serious infection, and helps immobilize you so you don't reinjure yourself as the injury heals. Homicide and predation definitely put a non-zero amount of selective pressure on our ancestors, but accidents, child birth and malnutrition/starvation were bigger players.</p>
<p>In modern medicine infection can almost always be prevented or treated with enough medical attention, and a large portion of hard to treat infections are a product of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The levels of inflammation produced by a body that evolved under circumstances where a stubbed toe could become life threatening are completely inappropriate in a world with antibiotics, x rays and physical therapy, so reducing inflammation generally helps with comfort and quick recoveries.</p>
