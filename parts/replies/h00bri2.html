			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup! That’s kinda what I meant by saying they get the original cake batter recipe/original mix. They just rebake the original recipe of the batter in new and improved ovens.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to go in to too much detail of what those “ovens” and “bakers” do because I’m not a mastering engineer and don’t know enough to be able to dumb it down in ELI5 format. </p>
<p>For me who has mastered albums before but not in a sense I could say I’m good at it, I’ll explain it like this:</p>
<p>I mix the instruments/ingredients in each song to be a tasty well balanced dish. That’s the mix/song.</p>
<p>I mix each individual dish’s volume/portion size so they go together as a full, well curated dining/listening experience. That’s a master.</p>
<p>High end too loud on track 8? I got tools to make it sound less harsh.
Track 4 too muddy compared to all the others? I got tools to make it sound more clear.
Some tracks quieter/louder than others? Adjust the volume of each one, put limiters on some, adjust those etc...</p>
<p>Instead of mixing the instruments in a song, you’re mixing the songs in an album. So instead of Kick drum, snare, guitar, vocals etc, you’re adjusting “song name 1, song name 2, etc.” You’re literally in the same type of program file. </p>
<p>Now some engineers specialize in mastering. I don’t. So if a band I recorded gets big I wouldn’t be surprised if they go back and get their older albums “remastered” because I was upfront saying I’m not great at it but I’m a hell of a lot cheaper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. A remastering in the analogy would be &quot;taking the same batter and re-baking it with a better oven + chef&quot; whereas a re-recording would be &quot;using the same general recipe but slightly modifying it and making some new batter to bake&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Explaining rerecording is kinda easy, process is almost the same as recording a new album but you're doing exactly what you did with the material you're basing the rerecording on. Because you're more skilled and/or have better equipment now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you please elaborate a bit on the mastering engineer (a.k.a. the &quot;baker&quot;)? What do they adjust or modify other than, like, changing the loudness of the bass or treble? Do they cut and re-arrange the different segments, and add sound effects or pauses to the song?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer is almost never will a mastering engineer have creative influence like that. </p>
<p>This might put it in to better perspective. After recording a band I’ll start mixing often times with band members in the same room giving me creative pointers. Certain effects here, certain things being higher or louder there. Often times you’ll hear me mute everything but one instrument and do “my thing” to it. That’s called soloing, exactly what it sounds like. I just want to hear one thing. And I will keep switching between different instruments doing that. </p>
<p>Mastering engineers do that with songs. They will hit play from the beginning and flip from song to song. Obviously if they “unsolo” a song all of them play at once and it sounds exactly what you think it would sound like, a bunch of songs playing at once. The idea is to switch back and forth to make sure they sound similar in dynamics. The loudest parts sound just like the other loudest parts in the album and vice versa. </p>
<p>I’ve noticed by being a fly on the wall that they tend to switch between songs faster and faster the closer they get to being done. Sometimes they focus on certain songs at different parts for longer. </p>
<p>Many times bands or artists don’t even know what the mastered finished product is til it’s done and they listen to it. Those with out ear training KNOW it sounds better but can’t quite put it in to words. But for the most part it will sound decent on any speakers you play it out of. Shitty ear buds? Car stereo? Professional level monitors. The visualization of the software, the trained ears, frequency analyzers, and last but not least, experienced engineers make it so it sounds that way.</p>
<p>As technology gets better and stereo systems simultaneously get better, and worse (think playing out of a tiny portable mini Bluetooth speaker), the more we need older albums and projects to be remastered so we can listen to them on our respective range of devices. </p>
<p>Sorry for the long response but that’s my ELI am an intern level of describing it.</p></div>		</li>
