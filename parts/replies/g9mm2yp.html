<p>Which matters very much for accurate time keeping like for a GPS satellite were nano seconds matter.</p>
<p>For the approximate age of the universe it makes virtually no difference. What's a million years compared to 13 billions?</p></div>		</li>

<p>And in particular, much smaller than the current uncertainty of our measurements. If that changes in the future we can take it into account easily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, even satelites in orbit have to account for relativity to account for the gravitational time dilation caused by the earth. It's a very small difference to account for but for GPS to work, these things have to be extremely precise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's a rapidly rotating black hole, the frame dragging is strong enough that <em>technically</em> you do get stable orbits there. I really don't think it's a great place for planet formation though, let alone a planet with e.g. liquid water and a thick atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok so what we want to look at here is the 'ISCO', the innermost stable <strong>circular</strong> orbit. </p>
<p>This PBS space time vid about Kerr (spinning but no charge) black holes: <a href="https://youtu.be/UjgGdGzDFiM?t=343" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/UjgGdGzDFiM?t=343</a></p>
<p>Non rotating black holes are 3 radius yes. But rotating changes things, up at top speed (nearly light speed) you can get down to near the event horizon going one way, but the other way can go up to 9 radii before finding a stable circular orbit. </p>
<p>This is not a mere technicality for non realistic cases, with the conservation of angular momentum and tiny size of these things, their spin is immense. The few we have measured are indeed spinning at significant speeds, 70% the speed of light like the  ASASSN-14li one. </p>
<p>So orbits quite a bit closer are not only possible in theory, but what actually occurs.</p></div>		</li>
