			<div class="markdown"><p>I do similarly, not super hot but warm enough. Anecdotally, I've heard that hot water can disrupt some lens coatings and I'd rather just not mess with that.</p>
<p>Typically I wash them with warm water and dish soap, shake them out to get rid of most of the water, dry the frames carefully with a paper towel or rag, then get the lenses with the microfiber cloth to reduce the water absorption. Then I use high purity (&gt;90%, typically 99%) isopropyl alcohol to evaporate off the remaining water and get rid of any soap residue then use the microfiber cloth again to buff out any streaks. </p>
<p>Takes 5 min, works like a charm, and only have to do it once a week or so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wash my glasses this way sometimes, and I use just my fingers. When it comes to streaks, as long as you're getting a good clean (I.e. not just spreading oils around), you only need to consider your last actions before it dries. If you have a really clean cloth to finish up, you'll be good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I rinse them under fast running water to shift any grit. Then add a little drop of dish soap to each lens, then gently rub the soap around on both sides with my finger tips. Rinse (using the lamina flow method) and the dab the bottom edge of the frame on my shirt to soak up the tiny bit of water sticking to the frame.</p>
<p>Zero streaks 95% of the time, crystal clear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like others said, I usually just use my fingers. If my fingers are dirty I just wash my hands first then continue on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Been using this method weekly for 5 years with my $500 Serengettis, they're still just as clear/perfect as the day I got them. Dish soap tends to be pretty gentle, apparently.</p></div>		</li>
