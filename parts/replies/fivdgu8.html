<p>These pain receptors are poorly mapped by the brain, which is why heart attack pain can be felt as jaw or arm pain, and pain in the liver can be felt as shoulder pain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this also why patients with pneumonia sometimes feel shoulder pain?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes exactly - lung pain (visceral) is very non-specific. But if the infection reaches the pleura (thin membrane which covers the lungs and has pain receptors similar to the skin), it becomes very localised.</p>
<p>The same thing happens with appendicitis - when the appendix becomes inflamed, it causes generalised tummy pain. But once the inflamed appendix enlarges enough to press up against the peritoneum (membrane/bag which holds you guts and also has pain receptors similar to your skin), the pain localises to the right lower quadrant (above where the appendix lies).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vet here, we (mammals in general) have pain receptors in the peritoneum and pleura (the lining of of abdominal organs and lungs). That is why it hurts.</p></div>		</li>
