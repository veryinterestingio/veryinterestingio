			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Note, some 1.0 versions have not been successful in various countries, e.g. Australia, notably. But, nobody has made modifications, in the US (and likely most places), the medicine has to be identical to what was trialed. Any changes require new trials, typically. Not sure how that works for influenza, tbh, maybe someone else can comment.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do you mean not approved or not effective?</p></div>		</li>

<p><em>The backers of Australia’s homegrown COVID-19 vaccine candidate today announced a halt to its further development, after some of the first people to receive the vaccine in a safety trial generated antibodies to an unintended target, the AIDS virus. A small fragment of an HIV protein is a component of the vaccine used to add stability to the intended antibody target, the spike protein of the pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.</em></p>
<p><em>Although the added component didn’t represent an actual infection with HIV, the vaccine developers and the Australian government concluded a widespread rollout of the candidate would interfere with HIV diagnostic tests and decided not to proceed to larger clinical trials that would have measured its protection against COVID-19. Given the strong efficacy shown by several recent COVID-19 vaccines, it’s likely that other candidates still in development will now have a higher bar to clear to move forward.</em></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I didn't think about regulations when I originally thought of the question. Makes me wonder how much R&amp;D we're missing out on in regards to variant specific vaccines since companies are likely to avoid the additional hurdles and stick with producing already approved vaccines. Same with boosters. Are they just going to say 1 dose of the original vaccine is fine as a booster or is the booster actually going to be different and more effective?</p></div>		</li>

<p>That said, because of the natural and inherent variability of the antibodies you generate against spike protein, it's likely that boosters of the exact same sequence will continue to be effective against new variants, at least for a while. The boosters would be just to ensure your antibodies are always high enough that enough of the assortment of slightly different antibodies which are effective against the particular spike protein floating around in your blood are present to prevent infection, or at least serious illness.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Or are there really dozens of flu vaccines, each with their own separate approval, and each year we just pick the four most common ones?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The vaccine formulation and production process is approved, which is a lengthy process. Once approved, the production protocol and formulation cannot deviate from what has been approved. Each year, the new vaccines then undergo an accelerated approval process.</p>
<p>For completely new influenza vaccines, they need to go through the usual lengthy approval process first. For example, the FluMist had to go through its own approval process eventhough traditional influenza vaccines are already approved and on the market.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that the way the influenza vaccine annual approval is set up is an exception to the usual process.</p></div>		</li>
