			<div class="markdown"><p>Also because it allows them to set the parking lot cost. If a random person has extra tickets, they might be willing to accept an even lower price just to get something. The scalpers don’t want random people selling for very low prices, so they’ll buy all the spare tickets to make sure they’re the only sellers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably because they can sometimes buy tickets outside the venue for even <em>less</em> than the group rate. Then if they sell them all they make even more money.</p></div>		</li>
