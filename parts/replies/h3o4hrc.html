			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;speed of electricity&quot; has nothing to do with the speed of electrons. Typical travel speed of the electron in the copper cable under household type load is measured in millimetres per second. The electromagnetic wave, on the other hand, travels close to the speed of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well not only that but electrons themselves don’t really move much <em>along</em> the length of the wire. It’s energy transfer from electron to electron that is moving really fast (the tennis balls in a drainpipe idea).</p>
<p>I guess the drift velocity of the electrons might be slightly lower in a wire where they were drifting upwards… it’s probably an effect so small that it would very hard to measure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, gravity is a very weak force. Think about the size of the earth. It takes all of that to make gravity. But a very small magnet can hold something up, aka exert as much force as gravity.</p></div>		</li>
