			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this really nails it. Next time you go out walking or driving, pay attention to just how much space there is between any two points of interest. </p>
<p>Walking through typical american suburbs, there might be 10-12 houses between intersections on larger roads, with the space behind them filled with cul de sacs (culs de sac?) And more houses. In the game, you can get the same feel with only 3-5 houses between intersections and a single cul de sac in the middle. </p>
<p>Similarly, you can condense 200 miles of empty highway to the equivalent of maybe 3-4 miles, and you'll still feel like it was a decent distance because those 3-4 minutes of driving are a significant change of pace from in-game city driving.</p>
<p>If you compare the GTA V map to the real Los Angeles, the four hour drive the game is imitating would have dozens of largely identical highway exits to small towns you've never heard of. When you make that drive you barely register most of them, so the game just needs to throw in a few.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You make a good point.  Most of driving is tedious.  When I drive up north to see my folks, there are few landmarks.  It's about 260 miles from my house but, once I'm out of the cities, there are only a handful of places of note.  It's basically, the place that has donuts, the place where I use the bathroom, the place where I merge, &quot;The Range&quot;, the place I sometimes use the bathroom again and sometimes get gas, then I'm at my folks place half an hour later.</p>
<p>You could easily condense those together and make the drive interesting without having to literally just maintain speed for 4 and a half hours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The monotony of highway driving in particular is actually a problem for partial self drive systems. Driving requires a lot of attention and people are really bad at paying attention to things they aren’t actively involved in. So a lot of accidents can happen because the person who is supposed to take over of the ai driver messes up isn’t as engaged as they need to be to notice the problem in time.</p></div>		</li>
