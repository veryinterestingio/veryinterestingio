IRL the cashier will naturally slow down these attempts and eventually refuse the card/service.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that when trying to force a password, 99% of the time it doesn't happen through the online service, instead it happens offline.</p>
<p>Typically, when a service is breached, the attacker will get access to the database of (hopefully hashed) passwords. The attacker can download this data on his computer and then make as many guess as they want. This is orders of magnitude faster than through the online service.</p></div>		</li>

<p>99% of the time you'll be able to call and explain the situation. As long as they can verify you over the phone you should be able to almost instantly try to use the card again after they reset your PIN tries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately I was in India and my visa card was read incorrectly and the (right) pin I entered screwed it up.  Caleb to try to get them to reset it.  No, I had to go in a store.... In Canada.  No they would not main a new visa card until I went back to Canada. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Truth be told, your financial is doing good work by not sending you a card in that scenario:</p>
<ol>
<li>Financials are usually out of compliance if they send dc/cc's to an address other than the one listed in your account. Unless your financial has no standards at all, they will <em>never</em> send you a CC to a hotel room outside of your originating country from them. They shouldn't entertain it domestically either.
<ol>
<li>They <em>should</em> have only asked you to come into a branch for a PIN reset if they weren't able to verify you over the phone. Sometimes front-line isn't the best with understanding the procedure though.</li>
<li>VISA-911 is a service that can mail you emergency CC's internationally, though. The number should be on the back of your CC. I believe they overnight the card to you as well.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>If you didn't set travel dates through your financial, that would ideally also block your card immediately. (I'm assuming you did though).
<ol>
<li>Lastly, transactions from India have extremely high values for the likelihood of fraud. One of my institutions flat-out removed the ability for cardholders to perform transactions in India for this reason.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Lastly lastly...Good on you for having another card.</p>
<p><em>NEVER TRAVEL DOMESTICALLY OR INTERNATIONALLY WITH ONLY ONE CARD</em></p>
