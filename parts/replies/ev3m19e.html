<p>It changes a lot, but not notably (to the human eye) within a human life span. Supernovae are an exception.</p>

<p>Isnâ€™t the change to a black hole almost equally as rapid? Or have I been thinking about this all wrong?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Mira is an extreme example. It varies by a factor of more than 1000 with a period of a few months</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So does that mean that if Earth was orbiting Mira instead of the Sun, certain days would appear 1000 times brighter than other days?  I read that on Earth we get about 1Kw/m^2 of solar energy, does that mean that if we orbited Mira that number could bump up to 1Mw/m^2 over just a few months?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ask an astrophysicist for details, but it is an oscillation pattern in the star. Contraction, heating, expansion, cooling. There is a whole class of stars with this pattern named after Mira: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mira_variable" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mira_variable</a></p></div>		</li>
