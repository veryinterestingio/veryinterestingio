<p>Only reason I know is cause I had to do this for the water I gave my hermit crabs to drink</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe.</p>
<p>This used to be true, when chlorine was used everywhere, but now chloramine is becoming more common in water treatment.</p>
<p>It's more stable, so it won't dissipate if you just let it sit like chlorine does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right! The original Keurig had instructions to use filtered water or tap water that has set out out for an hour. </p>
<p>My wife and I use the big Berkey gravity water filter. It's got a pair of either carbon or ceramic block filters in the upper chamber, and Set a chemical filters on the lower side. It is really great water! It's a couple hundred bucks to get set up, but it lasts forever!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I turn my faucet on so it doesn't bubble up the water, its just a smooth stream, if i drink from that, the water tastes great. If i turn the faucet on more or put it in a cup, it tastes like shit. I don't get it, but meh, whatever works.</p></div>		</li>

<p>After time of sitting out, the water tastes &quot;stale&quot; that just means that It tastes different than what we are accustomed to, it is not actually bad water.</p>
