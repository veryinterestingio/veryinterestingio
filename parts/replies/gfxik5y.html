			<div class="markdown"><p>This puzzles me because the reward for scratching an itch can be borderline orgasmic. Almost like your body is trying to convince you to do it. With normal itches it's fine, but with wounds or burns it's actually pretty disadvantageous to scratch at them, so why does it feel SO GOOOOODDD?!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes it helps to cause a light pain just upwards of the wound. (Your fingers/toes are down, your shoulders/hips are up...) The pain can be simply pressing your nail in your skin, and if really stubborn itch, press it on the wound itself.</p>
<p>The idea is that your brain can't differentiate between two very close sensations, and the signals from the one closest to your spine will reach the brain first. So you'll feel a little pain close to the wound, but the itch signal is ignored.</p>
<p>This definitely helps me, especially in hands and arms, but less on my lower legs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True. but the addition of itching is pretty deep in our evolutionary patchnotes, as evidenced by the fact that just about every mammal does it, and I'm pretty sure birds and reptiles do too. A narrow birth canal is a relatively recent problem that's more or less specific to homo sapiens because we decided we needed to walk on two legs. What a huge mistake that was.</p></div>		</li>
