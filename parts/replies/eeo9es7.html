			<div class="markdown"><p>They do, tons of pressure.  That's how it goes through 6&quot;-8&quot; of paper at a time.  They also cut at a bit of an angle, and have a slicing motion as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This gets back to the original question- why is a slicing motion more efficient at cutting than a straight up and down motion? Even if you're using a perfectly sharpened blade and lots of hydraulic pressure, a slicing motion is used. Why?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. They do slice. A paper cutter, (in an office setting, not commercial) begins its cut as soon as it makes contact with the top of the paper. Therefore, it begins to slice through the rest. Just without the sawing method. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, hydraulics and shit. I think even a blunt, overused blade, 1.5 inches thick and 32 inches long, would fuck your fingers up if it fell on you straight on. Not a good comparison to the original example of cutting yourself/not cutting yourself with a paring knife.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, if a blade is dull enough it's effectively just a club.</p>
<p>Clubs can still fuck people up, so yeah.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, when he said guillotine, my head pictures a traditional one, with a blade that sets at an angle. So as it applies pressure, the blade is not flat against the paper (or neck), so itâ€™s basically not cutting/pressing straight down, which really goes back to your original question. </p></div>		</li>
