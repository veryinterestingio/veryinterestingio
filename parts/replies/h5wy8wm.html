			<div class="markdown"><p>In a way, yes.  It's an evolutionary arms race:  Fungi evolve antibiotics, bacteria evolve resistance, then fungi evolve better antibiotics.  Rinse and repeat indefinitely.</p>
<p>Antibiotic resistance is mostly a concern for humans because we can't just evolve new antibiotics, we have to discover them and then figure out how to mass produce them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not better. It's just different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but the bacteria that grow in the natural environment of a such fungi and the bacteria that can grow in humans (and damage them) are quite different.</p>
<p>These fungi with their chemicals have been around for millions of years, yet the resistant bacteria we have do deal with in hospitals just appeared in the last decades.</p></div>		</li>
