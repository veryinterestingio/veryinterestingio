Anyone who relied on the app to drive the car would experie the same problem if they parked somewhere without cell coverage.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It however is not &quot;BS&quot; because it did cause issues and reminded people that network based features are dependent on oem support.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is BS because you can still use the phone as a key even without network coverage. The TechCrunch article is very misleading.</p>
<p>Is it possible for Tesla to fuck with people on network-dependent features? Sure, they could, but they haven't done anything like that. And even in this case of an accidental network issue, it didn't affect anyone's ability to drive their cars.</p></div>		</li>
