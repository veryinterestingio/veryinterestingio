			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps tangentially, I know that Vyvanse, a psychostimulant (typically used to treat ADHD) was recently approved by the FDA to treat â€˜binge eating disorderâ€™.</p>
<p>I believe the FDA has historical been reluctant to approve stimulants for dieting purposesâ€”even though amphetamines were the original â€˜miracle diet pillsâ€™ of the 1950sâ€”because of their addictive nature and potentially serious side effects.</p>
<p>But apparently theyâ€™ve decided that stimulants are a potentially beneficial drug to safely curb appetite in this instance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here with my ADHD meds. They all do it to some degree - mine is methylphenidate. When I started taking it, it was really dramatic. I would just completely forget to eat. When I did remember, I would take a bite of something and it would turn to goopy ash in my mouth. If I kept trying to eat I would feel sick.</p>
<p>I ended up losing more than 5 pounds in just two weeks. It was a little concerning because I didn't really have any weight to lose. Luckily, my appetite came back pretty quickly after that. Now I don't get any suppressive effects. In fact about the only negative side effect I feel anymore is a dry mouth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For hypersomnia, with Adderall I had to continually increase the dose. With Vyvanse, despite being a nearly identical drug, I didn't need to increase it in several years.</p>
<p>Adderall was better for appetite suppression, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Either that or go on a lower dose for a few days then back to the normal dose so you're less tolerant of the drug.  I have adhd as well and have done this but it's too complicated asking for different amounts and all from doctors who treat adhd patients like drug addicts.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I started therapy on that recently (for ADHD) and can certainly confirm the effect. I also had an eating disorder that pretty much went away over night. Taking it for close to 2 months now and consistently loosing 2 kgs per week (keep in mind though: I <em>could</em> eat if I wanted and I am closely monitoring my intake - the drug rather makes it so I no longer feel the need to and makes it very easy to resist. Also heavily overweight, so the drastic weight-loss is intended).</p>
<p>But gotta admit that I am not sure it would really be a great idea for people to take it for the weight-loss alone, as the main effect of the drug is increasing overall dopamine levels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Saying prescribed for weight loss is a little misleading; Desoxyn is RARELY prescribed in cases of extremely lifestyle-intervention resistant and first/second-line med refractory obesity. But thatâ€™s just the indication for it; Iâ€™ve never seen a patient prescribed it for anything outside of narcolepsy and ADHD. Most physicians will stop their prescription-approach to weight loss at oh enter mine, before they opt to consult surgery or demand a hand-off to specialists (dietary, behavioral)</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not sufficiently convinced that focalin, adderall and even meth are all that different, except for their release curves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup! Naltrexone blocks dopamine release in the rewards pathway of the brain (or something along those lines - that lecture in pharmacy school was a long time agoðŸ˜…), so thatâ€™s how it reduces cravings. Essentially it take the fun out of the persons drug of choice (food, alcohol, drugs, etc)</p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/rocketparrotlet" target="_blank">rocketparrotlet</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>Naltrexone is an opioid receptor antagonist, meaning that it blocks the effects of opioids at the receptors.  Naturally occurring opioids, such as endorphins and enkephalins, result in dopamine signaling (and thus reward), so blocking those opioids from binding affects the reinforcing nature of addictive activities when naltrexone is taken.</p></div>		</li>
