			<div class="markdown"><p>To start with, I made a mistake in my previous comment.  The turbine speed and torque is going to be based on super complicated fluid mechanics stuff that I don't know to well.  </p>
<p>No, it won't have the same energy output.  Lets say that substance 1 has a boiling point of 50 degrees Celsius and substance 2 has a boiling point of 100 degrees Celsius.  Lets also say that they require the same amount of energy to heat up 1 degree Celsius (1 kj).  Substance 1 absorbs 50 kj of energy but substance 2 absorbs 100 kj.  This means that substance 2 can have more energy extracted by the turbine.  </p>
<p>The pressure doesn't actually have much to do with it, it's actually held constant during the boiling process and a pump is used to get the liquid to the right pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, this explanation is all compatible with thermodynamics (more energy in=more energy out), but why? Why doesn't a gas molecule at the same pressure affecting the same surface area and moving at the same speed, just at a different temperature, not move the turbine the same amount? The turbine extracts energy by spinning. It doesn't convert heat energy at all, it converts the kinetic energy of the paddles spinning to electricity, and that kinetic energy is generated by pressure.</p></div>		</li>
