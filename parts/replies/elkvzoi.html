			<div class="markdown"><p>The thc get spread throughout all fat cells. Fat cells swell when you're getting fatter and only divide under certain conditions. So if you smoke there is thc in most of your fat. It is detectible because the body taps the fat reserves, which happens throughout the day and definitely at night while sleeping.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If a lean individual smokes marijuana at the same amounts and rates as someone who is obese, it would be reasonable to assume that the leaner individual would be able to pass a test on a much shorter time frame (because of water intake, sweating, more frequent urination, and less THC in the fat cells) right? Or am i reading this wrong?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The amount of thc in the fat would ideally be the same, but really it depends. If they both did the exact same strenuous activity for their relative body weight then it would be the same to my knowledge, however as typically leaner people are more active that's what makes them more likely to pass. However a bit of a weird problem arises with the obese person in that if they intake a ton of fatty foods, it'll &quot;lock&quot; the thc in a lower layer of lipids for a short time, and they will still pass a drug test because the urine is pulling from the top layer of fat. So really the answer is it depends.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If they are a chronic user it would definitely show in obese people longer, assuming all other factors such as exercise and metabolism are the same. The THC metabolite is stored in fat and your fat cells are going to have a saturation limit where they cant hold any more of the metabolite.</p>
<p>So an obese person would be able to hold onto a higher total amount of the metabolite, but the amount per fat cell would be the same in both cases. If the level you intake is below the saturation amount in the lean person than the time to clear your system would be similar. </p>
<p>The rate that these metabolites leave your system is similar to how radioactive decay, in that its almost like the metabolites have a half life. Meaning that the more you have in your system, the faster it will leave it. Because of this, being twice as fat as someone does not mean it would stay in your system twice as long. If it takes the lean person 2 weeks to have a clean test it might take someone with twice as much fat 3 weeks. (This probably isnt the exact relationship but my point is that its not linear).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Even when mot gaining or losing weight your body pulls from and adds to your fat stores, but at an equal rate per day. Once the THC is in fat it will go everywhere in the body. It won't be on a top &quot;layer&quot; because fat is more like a water balloon and doesn't fill in layers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your body doesn't store the psychoactive compounds. It stores a metabolite in fat.</p>
<p>So you won't get high off that. It's also measured in nanograms. That's billionths of a gram, so even if it was psychoactive that's a definite no.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have nothing to back this up other than a degree in biochem but I would think that for weight loss to trigger a urine test there would have to be some dramatic conditions. I’m talking like, smoked heavily every day and then didn’t eat anything for long enough that your body gets to the point where fat cells are literally the only source of energy. Even then though your body will still take from muscle cells. </p>
<p>I guess what I’m trying to say is that if you’re trying to lose weight, don’t let a potential drug test stop you. You’d have to lose weight in a very unhealthy manner for it to even MAYBE harm your chances of passing a urine test.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excessive weight loss will most def cause you to trigger higher nanogram levels of THC versus the same person whose not burning that same fat. It allows the thc not able to be broken down trapped in that fat to finally metabolize and pass through your urine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the test, and body concentrations. Some tests are very accurate and have very low thresholds. Strips are usually around 200 ng per ml, which generally means there's about a week of detection. A lab can detect trace amounts, often months can go by and still be detectable, though perhaps under the threshold, as broccoli could trigger false positives if set too low.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>THC and metabolite concentrations are measured in ng/mL [of urine/blood/saliva], not in ng. So these concentrations can still be psychoactive (not saying THCCOOH is psychoactive, just clarifying that your characterization of the unit is misleading).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know from experience, that extensive exercise helps prolong the positive results. It is why they recommend to stop exercising and dieting a few days before the test, and to go on a heavy diet of fatty, greasy foods. Yeah, the metabolites are in your body, but not in your blood at high enough levels.</p></div>		</li>
