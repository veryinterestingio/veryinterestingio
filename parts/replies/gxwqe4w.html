			<div class="markdown"><p>Jaw punches are usually a cross. The head turns about 45 degrees, not 360 or 180 like you might be picturing.</p>
<p>But even just a small angle of rotation, when it happens fast, is really bad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a rotation that happens when you hit the jaw.  The rotation of the skull (even just an inch or two) will cause a shearing force between the skull and the brain.  This shearing force will create lots of micro trauma (and some not-so-micro trauma). There are various reasons why this will affect consciousness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got hit in the jaw by my ex husband (who had about 130 pounds on me) and my jaw was out of alignment for at least a week. I think I passed out as well because I don't really recall the punch or the immediate aftermath, just waking up on the floor. But it scared the shit out of me that my teeth didn't meet for awhile. I thought it would be permanent. Thank God it wasn't.</p></div>		</li>
