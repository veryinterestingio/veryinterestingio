			<div class="markdown"><p>When I asked that question as a kid, I was told that when they tried seatbelts on school buses, the kids wouldn't wear them and, at worst, would just use them to hit each other as kids are wont to do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>School I went to, still had the belts and we were required to wear them. Before taking us home, the driver would walk the aisle and check if everyone was buckled. They were allowed to stop and park, and do surprise seatbelt checks. Repeated offense got you barred from riding the bus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a Canadian  short documentary on bus seatbelts. </p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/bcnSpQdeG3M" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/bcnSpQdeG3M</a></p>
<p>It included footage of actual accidents: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/OBEsUPI" target="_blank">https://imgur.com/a/OBEsUPI</a></p>
<p>In Canada at least they did a test in the 80s that showed kids were safer in front end collisions <em>without</em> seatbelts. Some newer data has shown that's not really the case. Side impacts and rollovers have everyone flying. </p>
<p>On the flip side it's worth mentioning only 20 odd people have died in bus crashes in over 30 years. That's really really really low. </p>
<p>That all being said I think seatbelts should be a thing. It only adds a bit more to the bus cost and keeps people safely restrained in the event of a side impact or rollover. Even in the nonfatal crashes I'd prefer to be strapped in rather than get thrown at 45 mph into other people and ceilings.</p></div>		</li>
