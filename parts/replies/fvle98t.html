Whatever bacteria or virus  on the surface of the object and other surfaces thereafter would be introduced into their immunocompromised system. It's more of a precaution. Walking barefoot with a fully functional immune system is practically harmless, but if your immune system is compromised then that means it's much easier to get sick and normal nonfatal diseases can become deadly.</p></div>		</li>
