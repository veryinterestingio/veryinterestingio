			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC, via QI at least , they said that they had shown Pigeons, like dogs, to have regional &quot;accents&quot; and that under audio analysis you could map where a bird likely lived based on its cooing</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if this could evolve with the environments that they’re in, less being genetic and more being like a city with a lot of high frequency noises produces pidgeon calls at a lower range and vice versa?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So... Theoretically, in the future, someone could make an app that allows you to figure out where you are not by GPS or any other reasonable method, but by listening to pigeons and figuring out if they're Bronx pigeons or Queens pigeons???</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd imagine its actually harder for CA pidgeons. West Coast cities aren't as dense as East Coast cities because there's more room all around. The West still isn't fully settled like the East. This means less shelters, more visibility for predators etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can’t read the whole thing because of the paywall, but I also feel like pigeons don’t have a huge incentive to go to other cities. They don’t migrate AFAIK, all their food and shelter is in the city, they’re safer from predators there...seems like an easy life.</p></div>		</li>
