			<div class="markdown"><p>the thing about faces fascinates me. It's just a complex and very particular relationship of size, distance, and proportion. We can recognize faces instantly, yet most people struggle to describe the features of someone accurately unless they've seen them multiple times. we can also instantly determine &quot;attractive/unattractive&quot; without necessarily being able to say why.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeh faces we’re very good at but yeh it’s very important. There is a condition where you can’t remember faces, prosopagnosia, which is an interesting one, where they can’t even recognise parents or siblings from face alone, and it’s something to do with not being able to abstract a whole from individual features. And yeh attractiveness is generally symmetry, but it’s an interesting field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have prosopagnosia. My colleagues think it's hilarious that I don't always recognise them even after working together for years. But many persons get hurt, because if we've been talking for a while and I don't recognise them five minutes later... It really seems as if I don't care.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I understand it, symetry is important, but not exclusively and not even half of the determining factors of attractiveness in the face. An attractive male face is obviously very different from an attractive female face. That is to say, a woman with Brad Pitts face wouldn't be seen as VERY good looking...</p>
<p>edit: that is to say, one could have a very symmetrical face (such as a woman with Brad Pitts [whos face is both symetrical and attractive] face) and still be considered unattractive..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have this too!</p>
<p>I get around it by how people walk, move their hand when talking, certain facial expressions they pull, rhythm of speech and so on. </p>
<p>Everyone has their own unique idle animations!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand, the races you're around when you're developing also affects your brain's differentiator.  Different races have different 'distinguishing features' so your brain learns to discern those aspects but ignore others.  This plays a roll in why people of other races can then all look alike, because the distinguishing features your brain looks too are more uniform in that race.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Props for &quot;races you're around&quot; rather than the often used &quot;your own race&quot; when explaining this. (For some of us, the two are far from the same thing and being able to differentiate &quot;my own race&quot; would not nearly be as accurate as being able to differentiate within the race I was around most growing up.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but this is most of the time argued because while some races have more different features than just shapes etc. I mean shape can be a distinguishing factor for all races but other features are not.For example it is easier to run into people with different color of hair and eyes with some races and not so with others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a condition called &quot;prosopagnosia&quot; or &quot;face blindness&quot; where someone is unable to remember or recognize faces. I have a mild version of it; I need a lot of times to be able to recognize someone. If there is someone I don't see often, I may not recognize them, especially if the setting is different (like in a street). Finding my group for the yearly project every Wednesday at school was sometimes... hard. (and yes, I picked the wrong group maybe once or twice)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>can you tell the difference between the moo’s of two different cows?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>that's actually very interesting because i know a bunch of farmers who naturally grew up with cattle always around them. Recently we talked about something similar and they said they can actually tell apart their cows by only hearing them moo because they work and interact with them on a daily basis. So what you are saying is pretty accurate and not only for human-human relations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Similar to how we can tell &quot;our dog&quot; from a group, but picking out &quot;some dog&quot; that you've never met before, from a group is almost impossible, unless they're otherwise recognizable. This is also why it's common for even human groups that we find unfamiliar, it's difficult to pick out a face in a crowd, but rather easy among people we find familiar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both my neighbors have german shepherds. One has 3 of them and another has one. I have a German shepherd as well. I always found it interesting that I can be in the upstairs bathroom at the far end of the house and tell whether or not its my dog that's barking at something outside just by the tone of the bark. Not only that but I can tell when he's scared, when he's just phoning it in and when I should be genuinely concerned. The other 4 sound exactly the same to me. I also had a completely generic looking grey and black striped tiger cat as a kid and somehow I could pick it out of a lineup of other ones even tho they all look exactly the same to me now.</p></div>		</li>
