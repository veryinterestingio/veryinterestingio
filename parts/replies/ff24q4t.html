			<div class="markdown"><p>I was under the impression that febrile seizures could occur with any degree of fever, and that they had more to do with how quickly the body’s temperature rose rather than the max temperature it reached. My daughter used to get temps in the 105-106 range with pretty much every illness, so I investigated this a bit when she was younger. It’s been 4 or 5 years since she’s had one that high, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There isn’t really a way to predict if they will happen or not it’s just that they become more common / likely as the fever gets higher. So they are much more common in the 105-106 range than say the 103-104 range. The rate of change in the temp may play a role but I’m not exactly sure on any specifics here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can’t seem to find any evidence to support that they are more common at higher temps. A little more googling this morning led me to <a href="https://cyberleninka.org/article/n/911417.pdf" target="_blank">this study</a>. It seems like if a child’s first febrile seizure occurs at a lower temp, they are more likely to have a recurrence (they have a lower threshold for them). Shorter duration of fever before the seizure is also correlated with higher risk of recurrence. All of which I find super interesting. Guess I’m reading about febrile seizures today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fevers are the body’s attempt at heating up to kill the foreign bodies. In many cases, not all, the fever can do it’s job just fine. So yeah, it does help sometimes. </p>
<p>Especially if you are in a situation where you don’t have access to antibiotics or other medicine to help stop the cause of the fever.</p></div>		</li>
