			<div class="markdown"><p>Your question is one that the scientific community also spends a lot of time thinking about!  It is certainly reasonable to start the search for life with an open mind and consider that there might be more than one way to &quot;skin the cat&quot; biochemically.  (For some bedside reading, have a look at this report:  <a href="https://www.nap.edu/catalog/11919/the-limits-of-organic-life-in-planetary-systems" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.nap.edu/catalog/11919/the-limits-of-organic-life-in-planetary-systems" target="_blank">https://www.nap.edu/catalog/11919/the-limits-of-organic-life-in-planetary-systems</a></a>).</p>
<p>Researchers have been looking into this possibility, either to see if different carbon-based molecules with similar functions could store genetic information, or even investigating other chemical systems that may be non-carbon or water-based.  For example, could there be a type of biomolecule or cellular structure that would operate in the hydrocarbon seas of Titan?</p>
<p>Stay tuned ... no matter what the result, it will give us a lot of insight into the uniqueness of our biochemistry. - Melissa</p></div>		</li>
