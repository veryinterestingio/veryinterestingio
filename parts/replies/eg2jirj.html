			<div class="markdown"><p>Except they don't.  Other than tabloids that hype healing crystals and think the Bush and Clinton families are literal lizard people, pretty much every article on a cancer breakthrough specifies the type of cancer.  If people read that as &quot;Cure Found For All Cancers&quot;, that's just something they've added in their own minds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is one of the reasons. Another reason is that journalists are not scientists. They just don't understand the implications of the studies they read. So, what they do is ask scientists loaded questions, like: &quot;Is it possible that this discovery will lead to a cure for cancer?&quot;, to which some scientists will reply something like, &quot;well, it is possible.... but...&quot; then tehy'll get cut off and the article is written.</p>
<p>As an example take that Star with the &quot;alien megastructure&quot; around it. Articles said something like &quot; Astronomer confirms data suggests alien megastructure&quot;, but he just said it is A possibility...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That level exists: it's university media relations offices, dedicated to promoting the university.  For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://news.mit.edu/" target="_blank">http://news.mit.edu/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://news.stanford.edu/press-releases/" target="_blank">https://news.stanford.edu/press-releases/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>That's another factor to answer OP's questions: one of the reasons you see neverending hyped-up science news stories is because the universities and research institutions promote themselves by doing a lot of the work for journalists to write it up without as much effort.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another example is how journalists fail to report uncertainty of scientific papers. Scientists always make room for doubt, journalists interpret that doubt as if the scientific evidence is poor, even if the conclusions are the current opinion of the field. </p>
<p>I believe this is the reason why they failed to report the urgency of climate change for so long (and some still do). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah my friend just got her work published in a major medical journal. She combined a new therapy for (and dont quote me on this I dont remember the exact area) bladder cancer with an already existing drug. The treatment was extremely effect and barely left enough substance to test because it was that good at killing cancer cells. However the treatment will only work on that specific type of cancer and even then only in about a third of patients because it relies on the patient having a certain genetic marker to produce a very specific enzyme. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its definitely possible. The new drug she was testing worked by unspooling DNA to keep it from properly replicating and the old drug works by attacking DNA when it unspools during transcription. I don't understand a lot of the more technical stuff but if they found a way to artificially generate that enzyme or its effects it's possible. She seemed fairly optimistic about the method and shes obviously waaaaay more knowledgable than me on the issue </p></div>		</li>
