			<div class="markdown"><p>According to <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/will-we-run-out-of-helium-3975959" target="_blank">this site I've never heard of before</a>, it looks like we have 25-30 years of helium at current usage. This would put it just out of the range of the chart.</p>
<p>I looked around for a couple minutes, didn't find anything I felt was reliable, so take the above with the appropriate grain of salt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The trouble with helium is that when you release it, you can never get it back (it escapes the Earth's atmosphere). Metals can be recycled almost infinitely. And even if we don't know how, or it's not worth recycling right now, you can just throw it in a pile until it's really needed. The only earthly source of helium is oil and gas wells. And we all know that's not going to last forever. So yeah, the helium crisis is probably more than 30 years away, but we're screwed, big time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Geologist working in Africa claim they found a huge helium deposit in the East Rift Valley, in Tanzania. It diffuses out of the mantle, due to volcanic activity, and gets trapped in rocks of the East Rift. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The newly discovered gas field in Tanzania holds enough helium &quot;to fill over 1.2 million medical MRI scanners,&quot; he said: &quot;This is a game changer for the future security of society's helium needs, and similar finds in the future may not be far away.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A follow-up, on some non-metal elements people have mentioned:</p>
<p>Nitrogen: Nitrates are synthesized from atmospheric nitrogen, limited only by energy availability.</p>
<p>Phosphorus: R/P estimates for phosphate vary from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_phosphorus" target="_blank">50 to 250 years.</a>  The usual caveat about &quot;50 years reserve doesn't mean we'll run out in 50 years&quot; applies.</p>
<p>Helium: difficult to assess R/P, dominated by economic / political factors, but there's a lot out there we haven't bothered to mine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The phosphorus situation concerns me the most. The US is close to exhausting our phosphorus mines and will make us dependant on foreign sources. There goes our food security. The British used to raid mass graveyards for bones for phosphorus just to be able to feed their empire. We really need to stop flushing our piss down the toilet, dumping our food waste in landfills, and allowing agricultural practices that cause massive runoff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does R/P ratio take usage into account? On the face of it, it seems reserves = what you have, and production = adding to what you have. So where is &quot;taking away from what you have&quot; figured in?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Production, here, means how much we take from reserves. The reserves are in-ground reserves that we don’t actually “have” yet. We just know they’re there. Production is generally pretty close to usage and far easier to calculate. </p>
<p>So reserves is how much we can use that we know of right now and production is how much of that is taken out each year. Their ratio is the number of years until there’s no more left to mine.</p>
<p>That still leaves recycling, discovering more deposits, inventing better extraction methods, etc…</p></div>		</li>
