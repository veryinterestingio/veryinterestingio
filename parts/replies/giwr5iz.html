			<div class="markdown"><p>My treatise on Engineers: (note, this is not about ALL engineers, but just a disproportionate number of them.  That number varies depending on what type of engineer you are. I've met many fine engineers.  I've met many MORE that couldn't figure out, through the process of elimination, which way to turn the lug wrench to remove a lug-nut...and yes, I met one that couldn't)</p>
<p>Engineers, for the most part, are people who are educated far beyond their intelligence.   They know how things work on paper, but not in real life.  I believe each engineer should spend at least a year PRACTICING what they're engineering. Example: A mechanical engineer should shadow a plant's maintenance crew to learn what he will be designing for. </p>
<p>I worked at a plant where every newly hired engineer was issued a bicycle (it was a large plant).  When the engineer made his first major mistake, the maintenance crew would steal his bike, paint it pink and weld HUGE training wheels on it.  Legend had it that no new engineer made it past the first six months without a pink bike. </p>
<p>Also Engineers, for the most part, end up marrying Elementary School teachers or Day care Providers. Why? Because both are used to dealing with children. </p>
<p>I was getting a hair cut one day and discussing the above with my barber.  A old gentleman in the next chair looked at me and said, &quot;I'll have you know that I'm a retired engineer and should take offense at what you said.&quot;</p>
<p>I apologize and said it was not a universal truth, but only my own experience, and asked him, &quot;Why didn't you take offense at that what I said?&quot;</p>
<p>He replied,&quot;Well, about half way through I realized that my wife was a retired 2nd Grade Teacher.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>And a sprocket is a cogwheel that links to another cogwheel by means of a chain. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So does that mean the &quot;gears&quot; on our bicycles are actually sprockets?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. When we talk about gears on a bicycle, often we're talking about the gear ratio given by the currently selected sprocket and chainring (the term for the sprockets in the front). From Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In transmissions with multiple gear ratios—such as bicycles, motorcycles, and cars—the term &quot;gear&quot; (e.g., &quot;first gear&quot;) refers to a gear ratio rather than an actual physical gear.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So &quot;shifting gears&quot; and &quot;higher/lower gear&quot; are perfectly valid and correct terms as far as bicycles go, but the actual components are called sprockets. For further reading, in addition to the ones in the front being called chainrings, the ones in the back are usually part of a cluster called a cassette.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What u/flaquito_ said regarding &quot;shifting gears,&quot; &quot;third gear,&quot; etc.</p>
<p>But if we're referring to the actual, physical toothed wheels, then yes, they are all technically sprockets. Confusingly, in cycling lingo, &quot;sprocket&quot; usually means a <em>rear</em> sprocket specifically; the <em>front</em> sprockets are called &quot;chainrings.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Terminology also varies depending on the type of bike. BMX bikes favor the term sprocket over chainwheel and use the term driver for the rear. It's common to have people in a BMX shop talk about 25 tooth sprockets and 9 tooth drivers</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Minor unimportant tidbit: the company names are Spacely Space Sprockets and Cogswell's Cogs. (I like this because it specifies that the sprockets made by Spacely's company are specifically <em>space</em> sprockets, and not some other mundane earthly sprocket variety. Cogswell should've named his company Cogswell's Cosmic Cogs or something to keep ahead of Spacely.)</p></div>		</li>
