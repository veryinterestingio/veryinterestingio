			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. When two ocean currents, one warm and other other cold, meet, they do behave like air currents in that the colder current will slip beneath the warmer current.</p>
<p>But the similarity ends there. The air current uniquely has water vapour that can condense when the warmer current is lifted past the dew line. The massive amount of energy released by this condensation is what drives all storm events (tornado, supercell, hurricane, microburst).</p>
<p>Ocean currents don't have anything in it that can condense as the warmer current gets lifted, also the adiabatic cooling effect doesn't exist in an incompressible fluid like water, so there's no underwater hurricane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At the very least, the ocean has &quot;weather&quot;. The oceanic equivalent of high and low pressure systems are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_\(fluid_dynamics\)#Mesoscale_ocean_eddies" target="_blank">mesoscale eddies</a> and they are ubiquitous throughout the ocean, particularly in regions with rapid ocean currents which generate oceanic fronts. You can clearly see these eddies in the ocean if you look at the ocean currents (e.g. <a href="https://www.windy.com/-Currents-currents?currents,36.333,-61.304,5,i:pressure" target="_blank">this live model output from windy</a>) and you'll notice that these currents look very similar to the<a href="https://www.windy.com/?36.333,-61.304,5,i:pressure" target="_blank"> flow around low and high pressure systems in the atmosphere</a>. Ocean &quot;weather&quot; systems are generally around 10x smaller than weather systems in the atmosphere and are significantly slower, but other than that they're physically pretty analogous. For example, just like high and low pressure systems are actively generated by the baroclinic instability of the jet stream in the atmosphere, mesoscale eddies are prolifically generated by the baroclinic instability of energetic ocean currents in the oceann. Although these oceanic 'weather' systems might look a bit crap compared to atmospheric weather systems, they're extremely important in transporting heat around the ocean and for many biological processes such as plankton growth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really - temperature change and the resultant lift and fall of currents wouldn't be so dramatic in water due to density and viscosity so wouldn't lead to the more extreme conditions that result in a storm. Gravity and friction also play a part in dissipating energy.</p></div>		</li>
