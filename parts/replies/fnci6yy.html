			<div class="markdown"><p>I literally just looked all of that up, mostly because I was intrigued because a whale producing 200+ dB sounded ridiculous on the face of it, and it was.</p>
<p>I did already know that sound in water <em>had</em> to work very differently from in air due to the massively different density, and that a lot of the energy would be lost at the boundary, but I didn't know the specifics about how the reference pressure is different, or exactly how the density difference affects the relationship between energy and pressure, or exactly what attenuation you get across a water-air boundary.</p>
<p>I also knew about the balloon thing, because I'm the kind of nerd who watches videos of people doing stuff in anechoic chambers.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why didn't you just post it on Reddit and wait 12-24 hours for an answer that may or may not be true?</p></div>		</li>
