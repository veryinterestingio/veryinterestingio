			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever stood up too quickly, and seen little white worms or specks flash across your visual field? (Or behind your closed eyes?) Those are the shadows of cells and tiny floating objects in the gel of your eyeball. You are glimpsing the trace effects of your own cells, from inside your body looking out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You seem to know shit;</p>
<p>Every time I look at the blue sky, I see a bunch of little dots all shooting across the background, colliding and breaking apart in a ”tv-static” kind of fashion.
I also see little ”worms” made up of cell-looking dots that I can’t look directly at, because they seem to move away as I look towards them (like they’re glued tomy retina or something)</p>
<p>Can you explain these to me?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the worm thing you sometimes see depending on how the light is shining into your eye is actually a remnant from when you were developing inside the womb. Their needed to be a vein to allow blood flow to some part of the eye to develop but once fully developed you don’t need it anymore so it becomes semi transparent and you can sometimes see the outline.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When I learn something that I never had the thought or words to articulate something that puzzles, those are LOVE. Never hate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just want to chime in to say, from my understanding (im sure there is somebody more educated than myself on the topic that will say im explaining wrong too) that “stars” from blood pressure change are actually NOT due to misfires, technically.  The blood pressure change essentially creates low pressure pockets between your flowing blood, which, to the photosensitive cells in your eyes which have LEARNED TO IGNORE the appearance of blood vessels in the eye, suddenly there is “too much light” shining through in places that it expects to be “dark”, therefore it stands out more than usual.  This is why the stars tend to move in a line and not just flail about randomly.</p></div>		</li>
