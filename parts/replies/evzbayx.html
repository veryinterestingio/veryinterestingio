			<div class="markdown"><p>Muscle cells swell or shrink in response to use, rather than reducing in number or dividing to make more.</p>
<p>People with heart failure late in life have big swollen heart walls, but the same number of muscle cells. Atrophy and hypertrophy are good words to look up in relation to this!</p>
<p>The lack of cellular replication gives less opportunity for cancer mutations to express themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So this article talks about that.</p>
<p>Apparently some other organisms can regrow heart cells better by regressing the cell to a different state that can renter the cell growth cycle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MacLellan believes the reason adult human cardiac myocytes can't do this is quite simple -- when the myocytes are in a more primitive state, they are not as good at contracting, which is vital for proper heart function. Because humans are much larger than newts and salamanders, we needed more heart contraction to maintain optimum blood pressure and circulation.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don’t need to divide to work.  Your bones work a lot and they don’t divide (too much).  Your nerve cells work a lot and there is little division.</p>
<p>Division is more about expected growth/turnover.  At some point our cells expect our bodies to stop growing, and only some cells (skin, blood, etc) have high turnover</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The neurons that make up the neural network of your brain do not divide (much), but there are several types of support cells in the brain, the glial cells, that maintain the myelin that wraps around axons, moves electrolytes around, and form the blood brain barrier. Many of the cancers of the brain come from these cells and not neurons. Glial cells can divide normally, so they are more likely to become malignant than neurons.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why do the glia cells end up dividing in such a way that allows cancer? (Meaning how/why are they dividing so much in the first place.)</p>
<p>I totally understand skin cells dividing (or the cells of any other more-exposed organ), but the brain has like...the ultimate barrier within the skull. There's not as much room to expand [the number of cells] right?</p>
<p>Thank you so much!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what u/Kashmir_Slippers said about glia being the more common cause of a primary brain cancer than neurons, I would also like to point out that when you discuss brain cancer in general, secondary is more common than primary. In other words, if look across all the people with cancer in their brain, you will find more cancers that metastasized from other sites in the body (breast, lung, etc) than you will find cancers that actually developed in the brain first. But u/Kashmir_Slippers is completely right in saying that tumors that actually develop from nervous tissue (aka “primary”) are almost always glial and not neuronal.</p></div>		</li>
