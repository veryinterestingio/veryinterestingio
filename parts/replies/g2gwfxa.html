			<div class="markdown"><p>The 10-tonne “Grand Slam” bombs dropped over Europe by RAF 617 Squadron in 1945 had an issue where they’d fall faster than sound and destabilize and tumble over as a result. Since these “earthquake” bombs were designed to penetrate the ground and create massive voids underneath structures, this tumbling was a major problem. So they added tail fins to make the bomb spin rapidly as it fell, which stabilised it and allowed it to exceed Mach 1 without tumbling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point, although they were dropped from a horizontal velocity and so had an initially zero vertical velocity component, there’s also going to be some conversion of horizontal velocity to vertical velocity as it “steers” towards ground-facing attitude, so fair call.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The terminal velocity at sea level, yes. Felix Baumgartner would not have reached supersonic speeds if it weren't for the much lower density of the atmosphere at the altitude of his jump.</p>
<p>Even then, streamlined objects like airplanes or bombs, or just very large and/or dense objects, can have supersonic terminal velocities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Odd question.</p>
<p>Would it be possible to design something who's terminal velocity changes over it becomes transonic/supersonic.</p>
<p>eg. If just falling, it'll have a subsonic terminal velocity, but if given a push to supersonic, it now has a supersonic terminal velocity.</p>
<p>Reason I ask is that I know that objects that are stable subsonic are rarely stable when supersonic, and that things that work well while supersonic don't always work while subsonic</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The obvious thing would be to make the object have a large surface area, and have it crumple when it hits sonic speeds. </p>
<p>Supersonic aircraft don't fly well subsonic because they are designed to ignore as much of the effect of air as possible, where as subsonic planes use air currents to generate lift. Scramjet engines don't work at low speeds because they rely on having high-pressure airflow. </p>
<p>Faster moving air creates more drag, that's why terminal velocity is a thing. Breaking the sonic barrier slows things down even more, so it would be incredibly challenging to design something that used turbulence to accelerate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not very thought out but you could potentially use the effect of varying shock angle to have a flow that's high drag up to and around Mach 1, but then at higher Mach numbers the nose shocks angle further back and redirect flow to avoid certain features on the body. I'm not really sure how this would look, but I'm picturing something analogous to a supersonic intake where the flow doesn't go through smoothly without sufficiently strong shocks to redirect it.</p>
<p>I think there's a lot of shapes where you could have a drag <em>coefficient</em> which is lower when supersonic, but I don't think the drag itself would be lower. Drag would increase slower than V^2 but it would still increase. What you're looking for is something so drastic that the absolute value of drag drops down again when supersonic. As drag is (approximately) proportional to the square of velocity, you'd need a many order of magnitude drop in drag coefficient to achieve what you're suggesting.</p>
<p>I suppose you could view the transonic regime as a 'hump' which then divides two lower drag regimes, but again that hump is only in terms of drag coefficient. In terms of absolute drag it's just a steeper curve between velocity and drag.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've sometimes briefly pondered if you could make something like the supercavitating torpedoes, but in a gas (air). Technically it's not supercavitating any more, but if at speeds very significantly above the speed of sound (which isn't a requirement for case cavitation in water) you could employ a similar metod of a very small flat nose, and then stabilize with skates  reaction riding on the shock wave, or more likely - reaction trusters</p>
<p>Even if it would turn out to be theoretically possible, which I doubt, surviving the combined pressure and heat loads veers into science fiction. To have the entire body of a craft avoid interference from a gas, especially as the gas will be heated by the compression, you might end up needing a velocity of several km/s per meter of length of craft.</p></div>		</li>
