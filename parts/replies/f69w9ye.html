			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The output controller monitors every conductor in the cables simultaneously.</p>
<p>It basically makes sure that every wire it inputs something into is consuming exactly (well, not exactly but close to) the amount of Ampere it did at a reference check done at installation. If the load goes down, a light must be out. If lights are out, it’s a big deal if too many are out at the same time and the controller turns itself off.</p>
<p>And, to make things a bit more complicated, it constantly checks if there is voltage in all the wires in the cable. Ensuring voltage is output when it’s supposed to (no burnt fuses!) and that there is no voltage coming back when it ain’t supposed to (cable integrity questionable - lights that are not supposed to be on get power feed) and turns itself off if it detects anything strange.</p>
<p>And, when I say “turns itself off” I actually mean that the controller starts to signal that it’s malfunctioning by flashing lights in the intersection.</p>
<p>Where I live, that means constantly blinking all the yellow’s, which in our traffic regulations means “this is currently an unregulated intersection. Signs and usual yield rules apply.”</p>
<p>But. To get back to your question; a controller is never smarter than its programmer. If the controller is told that two greens are allowed to be green at the same time, it’ll have no way of knowing if those two greens interfere with each other. You can’t avoid the fact that some intersections are incredibly complicated and the operations scheme the controller works by needs to be constructed by someone who actually has a brain.</p></div>		</li>
