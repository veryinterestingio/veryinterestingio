			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a paper published in Nature a couple of years back that finds evidence that harmony that we like only sounds nice because we were brought up with it culturally.</p>
<p>In other words, if you are brought up in an isolated tribe your idea of nice sounding harmony is completely different.</p>
<p>As such, if you want to mathematically model it you are not programming it to write music that is 'intrinsically  good', but just music that sounds to relative to how our brains have been trained.</p>
<p>I will find the paper later when im not on my phone, I imagine people will want the source. I think it was summer 2015 or 2016 in Natures main journal. And it was about isolated tribes and harmonic preference.</p>
<p>Edit: here you go, I think: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27409816" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27409816" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27409816</a></a> still on phone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That does sound interesting, but I don’t think the Tsimane have a ‘music culture’ at all do they?</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure the Tymoczko book goes through different musical cultures, such as some east-Asian tradition, middle-eastern tradition and Indian tradition, and selects the things that they all exhibit. </p>
<p>So, in all of them, pentatonic scales have been ‘discovered’ and the use of drone has been ‘discovered’, but certain aspects of that have been altered. Like the use of quarter tones. Or the construction of scales. Then there’s 5ths, everyone seems to like perfect 5ths. </p>
<p>Western harmonic tradition seems to be the only one that came up with triads and complex chords, which move stepwise into other complex chords for the entire duration of a piece. So that does seem entirely cultural.</p>
<p>Of course now western harmonic tradition has been spread globally, into all those areas and become standard modern practice, especially in the music industry. So it’s hard to separate out the traditional cultural stuff in the sea of modern western influences music. </p>
<p>So, anyway, it would seem to indicate that there’s a progression from no music culture to fifths, drones and pentatonic scales, to more complex scales, to more complex harmony, to chords, to chords in sequence, to complex chords, to complex chords in sequence. Similarly how there’s a progression in different languages for the amount of colours that have distinct names, which has also been studied and is believed to be cultural. </p>
<p>So yeah, interesting stuff. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if anyone has looked at the effect of transmission practice on musical content.  Did Western music evolve tonal harmony because it has the only written representational system that could easily evolve to represent it?  Whereas primarily aural systems often evolve complex systems of mode and interval which are primarily audio phenomena?</p></div>		</li>

<p>This makes me wonder how similar it is to language. Supposedly, the more unique sounds of another language you are exposed to when you are a baby/child the easier it is to learn to speak with it later.</p>
<p>Since I've heard about the language thing I've been curious about whether or not there was some sort of universal audible &quot;rosetta stone&quot; (not the most accurate metaphor, but the most relevant reference I can think of while nodding off) that makes it easy for kids to hear, absorb, and replicate all the known unique sounds in human language.</p>
<p>Seeing your comment has me asking the same thing about harmony. Is there any piece that actually includes most of the different varieties of harmony that would be relevant to this phenomena. Could a kid listen to that occasionally and have a more universally trained ear than people than people who grew up with more culturally restrained sounds?</p></div>		</li>
