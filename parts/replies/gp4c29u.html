</blockquote>
<p>No.  I mean, it can be a factor, but it is not required for suction(negative pressure).</p>
<p>You can have suction between two completely flat surfaces.</p>
<p>When you lift a sheet of paper and the next sheet sticks to it that's suction.</p>
<p>The same thing happens with panes of glass or metal or wood when freely stacked on edge and you try to pull in just one rapidly.  Other places people commonly see it is CD/DVD/Records all stacked on edge and in a box, move one too quick and the one behind follows along.</p>
<p>The pressure between the plates is so low and the gap between is so narrow that air, which does have a viscosity, can't easily flow between them.</p>
<p>Suction cups capitalize on this by having flexibility on the edges to maintain low pressure and disrtupt the flow of air.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbsd2OpPOMw" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbsd2OpPOMw</a></p>
<p>The inverse of suction is positive pressure, which you also see on super flat surfaces when all the air isn't wrung out(as in the end of the above video, so watch the whole thing), or in more common observation, air hockey tables and hovercraft.</p></div>		</li>
