			<div class="markdown"><p>White and white patterned animals (tho not necessarily just albinos) also have a tendency to be deaf because melanin plays a role in the hairs in your ears that allow you to hear, iirc. I may not be 100% on the details but it's along those lines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. Your answer also makes me wonder if albino animals might be &quot;shunned&quot; (ex-communicated, pushed out, etc.) specifically because of said camoflauge issues. Do you think that could be a possibility?</p></div>		</li>

There are now about 300 white deer.  I've seen one in person and they are beautiful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also a fairly large herd of albino deer that lives between Sparta and Smithville TN. The few times I've seen them there were between 20 and 30 in sight. No idea how many there actually are. Absolutely beautiful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This happened on Belle Isle in Detroit too. Fallow deer, not native to Michigan, were released from the zoo and were isolated on the island. The herd had little to no predators and ballooned quickly. <a href="https://www.upi.com/Science_News/2004/07/09/Deer-removed-from-Detroit-island-park/55791089412370/?ur3=1" target="_blank">Here</a> is some info on them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>zebra camoflage is specifically for group camoglage. it's not strictly for hiding the individual zebra (black and white are shit for that practically everywhere) but the shifting stripe patterns of a herd make it really difficult to pick out an individual to attack (asuming you're a normal predator without guns), so the predator is just left confused and not picking out a target.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember hearing in a podcast about a white buffalo being shunned and beat to hell by his herd so he would stay away. The main theory was that since he was a such a different color it threw off the visual of being one giant animal and put the herd at risk (even though they were in captivity)</p></div>		</li>
