			<div class="markdown"><p>At 11, I burned the back of my leg from a recently driven motorcycle that I didn't notice earlier while dancing until my leg started to feel it was bubbling and moved away to notice a second degree burn that sort of appears as a fried egg white.
The scar remained for 15 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I learned that when I was 13 and my friend across the street blew something up on himself, burnt over 80% of his body, and got 3rd and 4th degree burns all over him and 2nd degree burns in his lungs- I had to help my mom put the hose over some towels and wrap him in them so his skin wouldn't continue to fall off while we waited for an ambulance. Ngl it was probably the most violent thing I've ever seen. The paramedics said we saved his life but it was fucked up.</p></div>		</li>
