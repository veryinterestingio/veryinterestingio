<p>A solution - not a great one - but a solution that often worked, was to hold the entire machine about 11-18&quot; above the desk surface and drop it. </p>

<p>This exact method was in an official service guide for an early Apple computer. Want to say the Apple II?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're right. It wasn't just a matter of opening the lid and lifting the top from the bottom. Floppy or something else had to be removed first to get to the chips.   </p>
