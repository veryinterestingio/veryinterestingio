			<div class="markdown"><p>My guess is that since modern power starions run with much tighter tolerances they need to make sure there are not any big contaminants in the water, so it is simpler to recondense the water instead of putting in a big on-the-fly water filtration/purification system.</p>
<p>Also probably a lot of environmental regulations that regulate any discharge from the facility. . .  Actually this is probably the main reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a former navy nuke, I can confirm that this is the reason. Water may be cheap and common, but chemistry-controlled contaminant-free water is a bit of a bother to make, so it's cheaper to recycle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well that water you want nice and clean to not corrode the turbines. Its more efficient to clean it once and recycle the water. The other water sources are for the waste heat, no power plant is 100% efficient. If i remember right both gas and nuclear plants have to bleed off about 40% of the heat as waste</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because, when you have the space to do it well, you can get a really low pressure in the condenser, which pulls the stream through the turbines, increasing the efficiency.</p>
<p>But a train is going to struggle to condense that stream, because there is no room for a good condenser, leading to a high condenser pressure reducing the engine's efficiency.</p></div>		</li>
