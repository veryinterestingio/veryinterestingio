			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, for years, actually. I see a neurologist that specializes in headaches and have an ongoing treatment. Despite this treatment, what I mentioned above still happens. This is pretty normal for migraine sufferers, unfortunately.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How far have they gotten with you? I’ve had chronic migraine (the actual clinical “more than 15 a month” type) my whole life (to the point that I have a massive tolerance for any painkiller with paracetamol in them - at this point they barely work at all). Right now I’m on beta blockers daily and sumatriptan for attacks. If that stops working, it’s probably that Botox treatment next.</p></div>		</li>
