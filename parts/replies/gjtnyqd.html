			<div class="markdown"><p>It is perhaps easier to think of insects (at least those in hives/colonies) as cells in a human body. They are extremely simple minded to the point of it being comical. Like some ants give off a smell that says &quot;I'm dead&quot; which causes another ants to bring them to basically a graveyard. This makes sense of course, but the problem comes from if you rub that scent onto a living ant the other ants will bring them to the graveyard even if the clearly living ant is trying to escape. In some instances the living ant will make the even odder decision of just going along with it in a kind of 'well I guess I must be dead' kind of way.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>A not so uncommon way for colonies to die can be easily described as 'the workers walked in circles until they died' (not to pick on religion but if you watch a video of the kabaa/the cube in islam. imagine that but instead of new people joining and other people leaving it is the same group forever)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>how is this relevant? The insects are so dumb that their internal self preservation is either nonexistent or overridden by something else.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Dumb is the wrong word really. They can't reproduce individually. Their reproductive success is tied to the success of the hive rather than the individual.</p>
<p>And that matters. Even many if not most complex life forms have moments where their biological imperatives compel them to risk or even sacrifice their own lives for their offspring or group mates.</p>
<p>Even humans do it. For much of our history personal survival often took a backseat to the survival of the group.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The truly fascinating thing is that science has shown that insect colonies are capable of decision-making and reasoning <em>as a colony</em>, while no one individual knows what the colony is doing. Essentially, the individual insects become &quot;neurons&quot; with legs and wings. Each insect's instincts are driven to meet the requirements of the whole colony, not their own needs.</p></div>		</li>

<p>By following simple rules the hive can generate intelligence, just as by following simple rules your cells can generate intelligence.</p></div>		</li>
