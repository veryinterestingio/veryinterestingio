			<div class="markdown"><p>For those that don’t understand why you certainly couldn’t have color in an electron microscope it’s because you’re seeing something smaller than the wavelength of visible light, so as a result light (IE color) doesn’t exist</p>
<p>Edit: lots of good EM info in the comments below! Article for the basis of what I said/more info <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/new-technique-brings-color-electron-microscope-images-cells-180961188/" target="_blank">First paragraph</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another question, because I have been legitimately wondering about the color of COVID19, but you answered that.
But. If one could magically make it larger, what color might it appear?</p>
<p>Edit: thank you all so much for these truly awesome answers! I wanted to respond but the recent current events distracted me.
You guys are all great! The idea of a giant, milky white, COVID flying around like a monster movie is utterly terrifying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has a lipid membrane studded with proteins, just like a cell but smaller, and when you pellet a bunch of cells together, they're usually white or off white. So if you made a huge volume of pure virus and compressed it into a mass large enough that it was visible, probably white.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To give some context to help you try and understand, in order to view bacteria and many other types of cells under a microscope, we have to stain them, because they might otherwise be translucent and very hard or even impossible to see.  So unfortunately you'll just have to take others' word for this, that it just doesn't really have a &quot;color&quot;, because light doesn't reflect off of it in a way that allows us to &quot;see&quot; the virus.</p>
<p>I think you may be asking what a giant blob of lots of virus particles might look like.  I personally do not have the answer to that question, but it looks like viral plaques (basically blobs of virus) are a cloudy white color, as seen in the image on this website:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Things don't really... scale like that. Most organic things are most a combination of carbon oxygen and nitrogen but can have widely different colours based on their surface shape.  These things don't rally have surfaces like that. How would they scale? You can't make their melcules larger so you either make them thicker or separate the atons</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're asking how they took a picture of the virus while it's smaller than the wavelength of visible light, it's because the electron microscopes don't use light. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope" target="_blank">From wiki</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An electron microscope is a microscope that uses a beam of accelerated electrons as a source of illumination. As the wavelength of an electron can be up to 100,000 times shorter than that of visible light photons, electron microscopes have a higher resolving power than light microscopes and can reveal the structure of smaller objects. A scanning transmission electron microscope has achieved better than 50 pm resolution in annular dark-field imaging mode[1] and magnifications of up to about 10,000,000× whereas most light microscopes are limited by diffraction to about 200 nm resolution and useful magnifications below 2000×.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a crazy concept called Fourier Transformation. It's a pretty complex mathematical process, but essentially: electrons are accelerated toward an object and then scatter after hitting it. Using Fourier Transformations, you can calculate the shape of an object based on where the electrons hit the detector. This is how Rosalind Franklin knew that the &quot;boxy, X&quot; shape from her X-Ray crystallography experiment of DNA meant DNA is shaped as a double helix.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It sounds like you have the correct understanding of color being determined by the wavelength it emits, not its size. But there's one important thing to clarify:</p>
<p>Electron microscopy shoots electrons at an object and than transforms the scatter of those electrons on a detector to reconstruct the shape of the object. There is no visible image being captured. The image we see is a calculation of the shape based on the electron's scatter. So the lack of color is because this is a reconstructed image based on an electrons location. There is no color data. </p>
<p>The resolution of an EM image is actually way higher than that of a light microscope image. Resolution as a technical term refers to the distances that can be distinguished apart in an image. EM typically achieves resolution under 10 angstroms. Light microscopy can only distinguish objects over 10,000 angstroms apart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chlorophyll is a very solid point. But the rule about light not being able to resolve details smaller than the wavelength is still mostly true (<a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/popular-chemistryprize2014.pdf" target="_blank">Bypassing it gained the Nobelprize 2014)</a>.</p>
<p>I think the difference is the uncertainty in position, which leads to blur. For the Chlorophyll, it does not matter from where and at which angle the photons is coming - it just wants its energy, wheras for microscopy, it is the main information.</p>
<p><a href="https://physicsworld.com/a/is-photosynthesis-quantum-ish/" target="_blank">Also Chlorophyll forms a regular crystals, which acts as a unit via quantum entanglement.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was looking for a comment like this, because I had doubts about the statement you're replying to too. I don't see why the size of an object determines the maximum wavelength (or energy level) photons. I do agree that it is not possible to image the object of a size smaller than the diffraction limit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They have no way to produce or even store energy, so they cannot move on their own, only by passive interaction with the environment can viruses move.</p>
<p>E.g. the corona virus changes the shape of the spike protein (a threefold opening up), when interacting with the ACE receptor on cells. This reveals the active site, it uses to enter the cell, that needs to be very specific to work. By having it hidden before, the immune system has less chance to learn and recognize it.</p></div>		</li>

(For anyone else having trouble with the image, the big snake is Ebolavirus at 80x970nm. The first row is Variola virus 360nm, Herpesvirus 200nm, Rabies 180x80nm, Measles 150nm, HIV-1 120nm, and SARS 120nm. The middle row on the right is Influenza virus 100nm, Adenovirus 90nm and Rotavirus 80nm. The bottom row is Papillomavirus 60nm, Dengue virus &amp; Zika virus 50nm, Hepatitis C virus 50nm, Hepatitis B virus 42nm, Hepatitus A virus and Poliovirus 30nm and finally Parvovirus 20nm.)</p></div>		</li>
