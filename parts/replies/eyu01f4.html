			<div class="markdown"><p>Jesus, that seems pretty irresponsible by the parents to not cover that up in any way. If you can afford a pool with a big slide, you should be able to afford a pool with a big slide that won't maim anyone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny, when i was around 15, i did exactly this, it was a really tall slide, i'm used to slide in this things as i love feeling the adrenaline, but this time at my 15 time trying the slider, i panicked mid way and grabbed the borders, and somehow i twisted, flown and got in an inverted position, with my feet facing the sky. i got a small burn in my hands.</p>
<p>I tried the slide a few times more that day, but i learned to never grab the sides.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a tandem, you only cross your arms until the drogue is open (about 3 seconds after leaving the plane) just to make sure nothing gets tangled. After that, you want to assume standard position to make sure you're stable.</p></div>		</li>
