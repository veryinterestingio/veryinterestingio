			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll hijack the top comment and add another super cool visualization:   <a href="http://www.stuffin.space/" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.stuffin.space/" target="_blank">http://www.stuffin.space/</a></a> </p>
<p>Now permit me to give you two reasons why this isn't as terrifying as it looks:</p>
<ol>
<li>This visualization represents car-sized objects with dots the size of cities.  If the dots were real size, you couldn't see them.  There's still plenty of room up there.  Also keep in mind that you have 3 dimensions to work with.</li>
<li>The most crowded area, the shell around Earth called Low Earth Orbit, is not stable in the long term.  This is because the atmosphere doesn't just abruptly cut off above a certain point, but gradually gets less dense, and there's still a small but significant amount of atmosphere in Low Earth Orbit.  Satellites there, including the International Space Station, need to use onboard thrusters to maintain their orbit.  Once the satellite becomes incapacitated, its orbit slowly lowers until it gets too low and the atmosphere burns it up.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since I work in aerospace, people often ask me about the space junk problem, especially in context of the 42000 satellites that SpaceX is busily launching. I like to help them realize how unimaginably large space is. I'm totally using your visualization about cars and cities in the future!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something like using brightness to indicate swept volume over the period the object is in the area covered by the pixel would be interesting. I’m not sure how you account for 3D depth though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like the panoramic view makes it seem “busier”. Not that I disagree with the point but there’s a lot more going on in this field of view than a normal person would actually see.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should be a 360° video, so you can see exactly what would be in a normal person's field of view.</p>
<p>EDIT: turns out my comment is ambiguous and everyone is misunderstanding. I watched it on mobile and yes, I do know it is 360°. It was an &quot;it is 360°, so I don't know why you're experiencing panorama instead&quot; not an &quot;it ought to be&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
