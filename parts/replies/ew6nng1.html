			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll try to give another example. Take a sponge, and glue two planks on the opposite sides. You now can't force those planks together because there is a sponge between them, and also you can still move them relative to each other because a sponge is soft. </p>
<p>Continuing that example. Imagine the way sponge would deform if you tried to move the planks. Divide the sponge into &quot;layers&quot; based on how much they move relative to the glued layer. That is <em>basically</em> how &quot;layers&quot; of liquid behave as well, more or less.</p></div>		</li>
