<p>While I agree with that, this would cause another problem: How to hire some specialized manager when everything is tight - someone who's job it is to turn things around?</p>
<p>I mean, if I knew that there is a 50-80% chance I will not get paid for the job, I won't even try to start there.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is it really about being paid for the job? Most of the things people are talking about here are bonuses and &quot;golden parachute&quot; type payouts. Shouldn't a salary be good enough? Once the company is out of money, then the salary stops being paid... but it's not like they are doing work that they are not getting paid for right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about a case where a firm is in liquidation, but the CEO was hired two years prior as the company was on the edge of failure, and he was hired because he was known as the best at turning around companies in that industry? In order to attract this candidate, a company already in dire straits needs to give a great comp package, because this CEO is taking a huge risk jumping on to a sinking ship. So fast forward 2 years and the company was not saveable and enters liquidation. In your view, this CEO should not get paid? If that's how it worked, nobody worth anything would even try to save near-failing companies. </p>
<p>I see the point you're making, but it's not usually as black and white as you imply, and in many cases the management who failed the company is gone well before liquidation is in play.</p></div>		</li>
