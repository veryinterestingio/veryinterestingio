			<div class="markdown"><p>And it’s worth pointing out that oil has none of these problems:   </p>
<ol>
<li>⁠Oil is a great lubricant.   </li>
<li>⁠Oil protects metal from rusting.   </li>
<li>⁠Oil has a very low freezing temperature and a very high boiling point.   </li>
<li>⁠Oil is easily filtered and shouldn’t contain any impurities, being a manufactured product.   </li>
<li>⁠Oil is not a very good solvent.     </li>
<li>⁠Oil can sustain much vacuum before boiling.   </li>
</ol>
<p>Although I don’t know why we use hygroscopic oil for brakes though. (Water can be absorbed by and contaminate the brake fluid)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Moisture inevitably enters braking systems at some point or another - using brake fluid that water is even distributed throughout the system. Otherwise it would pool - causing boiling or freezing much more easily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's a great answer to why you want the water to be absorbed in a brake system. I'm short, it prevents water collecting in pockets where it can corrode or boil, allowing a gradual decline in performance as more water is absorbed.</p>

<p>Edit: this isn't a constraint for typical hydraulic systems because there's a constant flow going around a loop to mix any water in. The fluid in brake systems is virtually static by comparison, allowing water to collect in pockets.</p></div>		</li>
