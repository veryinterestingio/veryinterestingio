			<div class="markdown"><p>Awesome explanation! I love the analogy. To add a little color, you undersell the strength of updrafts in thunderstorms. They're intense! 5000 fpm (60 mph, 100kph) is normal, and they can get much stronger still. It's no wonder raindrops don't fall through it, that's enough updraft to keep a lot of things aloft. Small planes have been known to get sucked in the bottom and tossed out the top of big thunderstorms. So how does rain eventually fall? Well it's heat that's driving the updraft (hot air rises) and all that enormous mass of water is being pushed up to where it is extremely cold. Eventually all that water is cold enough to cool that updraft until it's not quite powerful enough to hold the water aloft, and it all starts coming down. As it starts falling it chills the updraft from bottom to top, killing it off, while dragging cold air downward with it. All those millions of tons of water just drop in one big, massive SPLAT of rain, now driven by a powerful downdraft of very cold air called a microburst. (In a big Midwestern supercell the winds at high levels push the updraft a little diagonal, so when the cold rain falls it misses the updraft and didn't cool and kill the it at all. That's why those thunderstorms get really really ridiculously powerful).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also how hail forms. It gets sent way up and freezes, then as it falls it doesn't have enough time to melt before the next updraft shoots it way back up to freeze with all the rain it collected on the way down. The stronger the drafts the bigger the hail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a great documentary on a woman who was paragliding in Australia and got sucked up by one of those storm updrafts faster than she could descend, passed out from the altitude and came to after her wing collapsed and she had fallen to an altitude where there was enough oxygen. She nearly died from exposure and the low oxygen. Can't remember the name unfortunately, but I'm sure it's on the internet somewhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, you are thinking of Ewa Wisnierska, the German para-glider pilot who reached almost 10KM in altitude without oxygen or pressure -- All verified by her on board GPS.</p>
<p>She was extremely lucky to not be killed. Another pilot was hit by lightning in the same storm and died instantly.</p>

<p>I realized a little later that when you sweat the water evaporates off you skin, which cools you.  Obviously your body doesn't reach 212F but just being in the sun dries it out.  </p>
<p>Also kinda like when you pour water on a driveway; it doesn't boil but it evaporates.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's also worth pointing out just how weak gravity is. Gravity is very very very weak, as forces go. As an example, you can use a tiny magnet to lift up a paperclip. That paperclip is being pulled down by all the gravity force of every atom on the planet, and being pulled up by the magnetic force of the little magnet. The magnet wins.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does that mean gravity has a stronger pull on something that has more mass? Like say a metal ball compared to a paper clip?</p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/trabbaro" target="_blank">trabbaro</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>It does! However, because it has more mass it takes more force to move it, by exactly the same proportion. </p>
<p>So an object twice as massive has twice the gravity pulling it. But because it's twice as massive, you need twice as much force to move it the same amount. The end result: all things accelerate due to gravity by the same amount.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, the magnetic force of a tiny magnet pulling an item up does not increase by the size of the object being pulled. This is why a little magnet can pick up little things but can't pick up big things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It gives everything the same acceleration, but the <em>force</em> is acceleration multiplied by mass. A metal ball is essentially a bunch of paperclips each being pulled down.</p></div>		</li>
