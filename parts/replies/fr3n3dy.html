They actually don't send down a taproot at all, so you've got to keep the soil moist. They won't draw water up from deep underground like an oak or a maple.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually where the sequoias are there can be some summer thunderstorms, but overall yes much cooler temps and also they get most of their moisture outside of the warm season.  Also you're right they grow around creeks which are fed in large part by snowmelt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you’re interested in helping establish a threatened or endangered tree species in North Carolina, I’d recommend American Chestnuts, Chinquapin, Ash, Elm, or Birch trees, which have all been hit pretty hard here on the east coast due to invasives.</p>
<p>Redwoods are native to the west coast, and wouldn’t be well adapted to our climates, making them difficult to grow round these parts.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I have tried to grow small specimens in western North Carolina and found it not easy. The small trees, at least, are not at all drought tolerant and are easily killed by extended periods of hot, dry weather such as sometimes happen here, even though overall rainfall is sufficient. The mature trees are undoubtedly tougher, but for the species fully to thrive requires a very special set of circumstances</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a reason sequoias and redwoods are only found by the coast, where temperatures are milder, droughts are rarer, and precipitation is plentiful and constant.</p></div>		</li>
