			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes sense, thanks. I wondered if it was a change in phone transmission, or the electronics themselves. Sounds like it's a bit of both!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of unrelated, but if you're ever streaming something over wi-fi on the 2.4ghz bandwidth and your phone is right beside a microwave, if you turn the microwave on it'll garble the audio signal. This is because microwaves also have a frequency of 2.4ghz.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is not the correct explanation.</p>
<p>The correct explanation is that 2G system like GSM used Time-division multiple access (TDMA) and 3G and later used Code-division multiple access (CDMA), Some 2G system used CDMA like cdmaOne but if I am mistaken none of the used 3G and later standards use TDMA</p>
<p>The idea is for multiple phones to share the same frequency. In TDMA you send data in short bursts and then you are quiet when the other phones send data. It is a bit like if you talk with a friend and when one speaks the other are quite but the pone change who talks may time per second. In GSM you send a short burst 216 times per second and it is this start and stop sending many times per second that have the effect on a speaker.</p>
<p>Even if you filter out the carrier frequency that is in the gigahertz range you will still have the low frequency on and off a signal that induces a current in the conductor at an audible frequency you can filter that out in the sound system. You can isolate them the reject the interference but not filter out the low-frequency component that is at audio frequency without distorting the sound.</p>
<p>Use a tone generator like <a href="http://onlinetonegenerator.com/" target="_blank"><a href="http://onlinetonegenerator.com/" target="_blank">http://onlinetonegenerator.com/</a></a> and use 216Hz square wave for an example of how the induced should be in the ideal case.</p>
<p>If CDMA every cellphone transmits data all the time. With special codes of how you send the data, the receiver can pick the signal apart. It is a bit like how even if two people talk at the same time you can hear what both are saying but it is hard.</p>
<p>There is no low-frequency stoping and start sending at an audible frequency so there is no sound in speakers. You could have a single sound that is created when the radio initially starts to send but nothing more.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So it is not a power or frequency of the phone signal that is important but in what way you encode the data and shape a single frequency.</p>
<p>You can in android in the &quot;Settings/Network &amp; Internet/Mobile network/Preferred network type&quot; force it to 2G and you will hear the sound again. The name of the setting might not be identical on all phones  and I have not idea if you can do that on an iPhone</p></div>		</li>

<p>Listen at 2:30.</p>
<p>(Then listen to the whole song because it rocks)</p>
<p>Took me the longest time to realize it was the song and not my stereo (‘cause when this album came out I was using an aux port Bluetooth that would make this noise when my phone was pulling data/calls/texts).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish there weren't so many typos and grammar mistakes so I could understand this better. Are you saying the TDMA induced a current that created a tone in electronics with speakers due to the pulse repetition frequency being in the audible range?</p></div>		</li>
