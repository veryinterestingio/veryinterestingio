			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm really surprised I havent seen anyone mention this yet. One of the most common ways of finding water was with pigs. Humans dont have smell or taste receptors for water (what you taste when you drink water is the dissolved solids or impurities in it) but pigs do, they can smell water and people could and did use pigs to hunt for where a well should be dug. That's still used today but it's been a common practice as long as humans have been around pigs, even before they were domesticated (bc just noticing where wild pigs found water was an option before domestication).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Actually, in the last few years there's been evidence that we might, at least taste receptors! Our tastebuds for &quot;sour&quot; and &quot;salt&quot; also have detectable reactions to pure water, and one experiment where gene-modded mice had their &quot;sour&quot; tastebuds (which appear to work the same as ours) altered to respond to blue light instead of acid, thirsty mice tried to &quot;drink&quot; the light and reacted as if they were tasting water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't say that I really notice that myself, but taste buds need water to be in your mouth to work. So, it's not quite the same as being able to smell it. You couldn't really find a well that way. Also, a noticeable reaction might just be sensing liquid in the mouth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In rural Iowa it's called &quot;witching&quot; and I know a guy (owns his own plumbing company) who witches for water (he claims to be able to locate water pipes and leaks). Out here it's not a Y stick, they use two long heavy wires bent in an L shape. They hold the short end of the L in each hand, and where the wires cross, there's water. All I can say is that he genuinely believes in it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I know that no one has been able to prove that dowsing actually works in a double-blind controlled study, and yet there are plenty of people who use it in the field. This includes plenty of people who don't fall for pseudoscience and who should know better.</p>
<p>I have to wonder if dowsing is like the placebo effect, where <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/placebo-can-work-even-know-placebo-201607079926" target="_blank">it still works when you know it's a placebo.</a></p>
<p>The guy in the video link says he had a general idea of where the pipe was located. I guess you could theorize that he's just using the rods as a memory aid, which IMHO isn't any worse than using a grocery shopping list to help you access things you can't quite remember.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yep. I tend to call bullshit on pseudo-science, but as a kid holidaying in the opal fields miners would use bronzing rods to look for fissures because that's where opal forms. I used to walk around and find water pipes in the yard. Never used to grip the rods to be able to move them myself, they just rested loosely in my hands. </p>
<p>As an adult, I know it's bullshit, but I still occasionally want to get a couple of rods to confirm it. But that's countered by not wanting to walk around the front yard looking like an idiot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I use dowsing rods to get a general idea where cables and pipes are situated below pavements and such. I use them to verify the pipe and cable charts I am supplied with to mitigate unnecesary pipe or cable damage. Dowsing works 100% of the time if you know how to hold the rods in your hand. People that do not believe it works are quickly acknowledged if they see me do it and after I teach them how. It's very easy and effective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where I grew up we used a ground water supply, it ran dry, so we got an old fella known for his water divining skills come to locate a new spot for us to drill down to, I was only 8 or 9 at the time but this guy said the water was 26 feet down, so we drilled down and sure enough we hit water, that same boar hole has been used by my father since the 80s.
I don't subscribe to supernatural or magical things but I don't know how to explain what happened, this was on a flat 2 acre bit of Land in a small township of around 200 homes on the top of a hill</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I found a water pipe using a Y-shaped stick as a kid and I still cannot explain it. I'm a firm believer in science, and to me it's just a strange experience I cannot explain. Perhaps a freak coincidence.. This was the one and only time I tried.</p>
<p>My cousin and I where about 10-12 years old, playing out on a field near the house. Roughly the size of a football field. For fun, because we'd heard and seen about dowsing, we cut a branch off a tree into a Y-shape and started walking around the field. At one point the stick actually pulled down. I remember it as a fairly noticeable force, but I know a kids mind can play tricks. Anyway, what wasn't in my mind - right at that spot, we started digging a hole. It wasn't wide at all, and we didn't get too far down before we hit directly on an older, concrete pipe. </p>
<p>My uncle had seen us out there and came out. When we saw what we were doing, he told us to stop. He explained that was a main water supply line, and if we had continued to hit it, we might crack it open.</p></div>		</li>
