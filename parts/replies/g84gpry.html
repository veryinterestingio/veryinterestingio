			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe #2 is the answer.  You don't need to consciously think which is what between up and down... it does it for you with the feeling of gravity.  As a scuba diver... there are times you are neutrally buoyant... and have no frame of reference.  Without checking your bubbles you can get easily confused what is up and down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well we're not really 100% symetrical. The hearth is on the left side and you can feel it, if you put your hand on your chest. And notice how most people don't like pictures of themselves? Because they are NOT mirrored, we're used to see ourself as mirror and thats why a non mirrored picture looks &quot;off&quot;.</p>
<p>Anyway, but you're right in, we're much more left-right similar than we're bottom up. My upper body looks very different to my lower, so I hardly ever confuse them. For left/right I need to pay attention to more details...</p></div>		</li>
