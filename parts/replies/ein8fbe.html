<p>If you are ever stuck in a fire such as a burning house/apartment, and the only way out is through the inferno, try to find a water source and a blanket/towel/etc. Wet this stuff as much as you can and wrap it around your body. This will allow you to sprint through the fire and heat safely and without being burned.</p>

<p>While I understand the scientific basis for your statement, in reality most house and apartment fires would not be conducive to that tactic.  Unlike hollywood and dramatic media portrayals of large open spaces with bright flames and good visibility, if you are in a house or apartment with a sizeable fire (eg not one contained to its point of origin or in the incipient stage but rather a room and contents or the structure on fire) you would likely be unable to sprint through a fire.  First, visibility would be extremely low due to the smoke and bi products of combustion, second the heat would drive you to the floor as temeperatures near the ceiling can reach well over 1000 dg F, and thermal layers closer to the floor <em>may</em> be lower, near 200F (still survivable for a short period).  But in few if any cases would you be able to sprint, as if running and jumping over a camp fire.  And if caught in a structure fire, you will likely be so inhibited by the heat, smoke, and shear panic that trying to find a blanket and water is by no means practical.  This might suffice in a controlled laboratory experiment, but not a house fire.</p>
<p>In reality, you absolutely should find the most direct and quickest way out of the building.  If you are trapped above the fire or your egress is blocked, your next best bet would be to isolate yourself in a room behind a closed door.  The door can keep smoke and heat back for a sufficient time before the fire is extinguished and search and rescue conducted.  The Underwriters Laboratory and several government and commercial entities have undertaken a large campaign recently to &quot;Close before you doze&quot; that is, to close your bedroom door before going to sleep since it can prevent spread of smoke and fire and create survivable spaces.  Id encourage people to look at some of the stories and profiles theyve put up online (facebook and other social media) and you can see drastic differences between rooms involved in fire and those with closed doors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't wetting a towel make it a better conductor for heat though? I know if you wetc an oven mitt and use it you'll burn yourself. So why wouldn't a dry towel work better similarly to oven mitt?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are thinking of conductive heat transfer, which is heat moving between two solids. A liquid interface typically helps in this case. Radiant heat is what you would feel from a fire, and it would have to work itâ€™s way through the water before it could really start heating you up </p></div>		</li>

<p>Water conducts heat, but you're trying to avoid combusting</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The wet towel works because the water can take up a lot of energy while heating up very little. So it will conduct better, but mostly absorb the heat.</p>
<p>Oven mitts, instead of absorbing the energy, isolate you from hot objects by holding in a layer of air and fabric with very low heat conductivity. A dry towel could do this too, but would be very susceptible to burning as it will see much higher temperatures.</p></div>		</li>
