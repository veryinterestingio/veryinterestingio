			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm just guessing here, but I think the best thing you can do is to try to calm down. Breathing exercises help me the most when I'm anxious or sad. Breathe in for around four seconds, hold it for another four, breathe out over four more seconds and then hold that without breathing in for four more. And repeat. The last step is the hardest at first because we have a natural instinct to breathe in as soon as we've breathed out, but the more often you do it, the faster your body gets used to it in the long term. Also, try to breathe into your diaphragm. All that means is, feel your stomach rise when you breathe in, rather than your chest. This also gets easier with practice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You probably already can, you just don't realise that's what you're doing. Have you ever done that thing where you hold your breath and kinda press your lungs to get rid of hiccups? You're consciously closing your epiglottis there, and pushing against it with your diaphragm (your lung muscles). But it feels different when you do it consciously vs subconsciously, cause that's just how we experience our bodies.</p>
<p>Similarly, when you tense your back muscles consciously it feels like you're flexing. When your back muscles automatically tense because of injury or stress, it feels like a knot in your back. The muscle itself is doing the same thing though.</p></div>		</li>
