			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely. Launched a few days ago. Probably spread enough to be individually discernible, yet still low enough to reflect light and appear as a dotted line. </p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/y4xBFHjkUvw" target="_blank">Go watch their launch. </a> The landing of a 10 story firecracker on a drone ship in a the middle of the Atlantic never gets old.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. I saw the first ones a month or so ago and was very confused. And then have been tracking them. The new ones look more like a cluster, close together and see multiple at once. The older launches are more spread out and have 10-20 second intervals between them.</p>
<p>I spend weekends in Rural N Idaho and it is fun to watch them, although takes away from some of the fun we used to have of spotting satalites.</p></div>		</li>

Awesome thing to see, for sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. They will also be in an unusually low orbit, so need to have the ability to periodically boost themselves. They also communicate with each other with lasers, so they need to turn and orient themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Small correction.  The laser communication is planned, but not in the version of the satellites that have been launched so far.  That tech likely won't be added to the satellites they are launching for at least a year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every time I see star link I just think how full earth's orbit will be in the next hundred years.</p>
<p>Mostly because private space exploration scares me in that I imagine all the harm that will be done in the name of profit and the marketing that will be used to cover up any lasting damage.</p>
<p>But maybe I'm just paranoid. Like space x helps with this by having reusable rockets and what not but the satellites are still an issue as far as I can tell. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dont. Its not about just polluting the orbit though, it can easily cascade into a much larger issue and I feel accountability is EXTREMELY important when it comes to the future of space travel.</p></div>		</li>
