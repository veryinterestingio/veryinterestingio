			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, thank you for all the information. So if I'm understanding you correctly, with all the new technologies in the past couple of decades, toxicity testing now includes a combination of animal models with computer modelling, genetic comparison and knowledge of cell biology?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it’s a culmination of In Silico, In Vitro, and In Vivo models to characterize the safety profile.  Ideally we’d love to move away from using animals in any research, but we’re just not at that point, still too many unknown variables to contend with.  To put it in perspective, we still struggle with differences in how drugs affect and are metabolized in different racial backgrounds.  So it’s important to look at the difference between Caucasian vs Asian vs African data, there are metabolic differences between each that can change the kinetics of the drug you’re testing, which lead to different efficacious results.</p>
<p>If there is something specific you’d like more information on in regards to toxicity testing in a pharmaceutical setting, I’d be happy to help, just shoot me a msg!</p></div>		</li>
