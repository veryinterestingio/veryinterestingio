			<div class="markdown"><p>As a materials engineer i agree. To add to this, in the simplest terms possible, transparency occurs only when light travels through a uniform medium. So as general rule semi-crystalline polymers are opaque because light bounces off at the interface of differently oriented “patches” of macromolecules. Same goes for reinforced polymers! However if the dimension of the reinforcement is nanometric this is no longer true.</p>
<p><strong>ELI5version</strong>: Imagine light as a flow of particles (for analogy’s sake) traveling through a solid. If this solid is very uniform, meaning at a microscopic scale the atoms are all arranged in the same way, our flow of “light particles” will propagate without ever changing direction, making the solid transparent. This means that the light that bounces off the walls of a room can penetrate the solid and get to your eyes for example. However if the solid is made up of stuff which is oriented in space in various ways this will cause the flow to go in different directions ( diffusing or better yet diffracting). This will cause the solid to be opaque.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, so heads up as I also have a degree in materials engineering so can perhaps help.</p>
<p>For your reference I am currently doing a PhD so haven't looked at the industrial career route per se. That being said, I have secured 3 industrial work opportunities. One in R&amp;D for fire retardants, one for a global FMCG division vetting the sustainability of alternative carbon sources, and another for a group of circularity and waste experts in the fields of plastics/textiles/food.</p>
<p>So my advice would be to try and expand your net. Oil and gas are huge industries but you can apply your knowledge further than you think, much further just the fundamentals of an engineering degree.</p>
<p>Note I say this without knowing your interests/specialties/location etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe stupid question, but how come that polymers are more uniform in their relaxed state, opposed to the more crystallised structure? I guess I am thinking about it in a wrong way, because it seems counter intuitive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Polymers in their relaxed state can either be amorphous ( uniform as you say ) or crystallized, depending on their chemical nature. For example in polyethylene the fact that it doesn’t have large lateral groups means that it will organize its macromolecules in an orderly manner. This is not the case for PMMA ( the stuff that makes rigid contact lenses for instance ) which is amorphous and has great optical qualities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know this is probably closer to a particle physics question but are you able to please ELI15 why an ordered structure of these specific crystals diffuses light, whereas conversely some other crystallised structures are the opposite and allow light to pass through, eg. rubies, diamonds, etc?</p>
<p>EDIT: removed glass as an example, which the OP explains is amorphous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't a particle physics question, just another materials science question (maybe condensed matter if you want to get into it).</p>
<p>The issue here is all about boundaries.  Diamonds and other transparent gemstones are single crystals with no boundaries between crystalline domains. Because the crystals are transparent, light passes through uninterrupted and they are optically clear.</p>
<p>When polymers crystallize from an amorphous state, they don't form a single crystal. Instead, thousands of small crystalline domains are formed, separated by amorphous regions. Whenever light passes from a crystalline to an amorphous region, light is transmitted, but it is also reflected (see Fresnel Equations). Due to light passing through thousands of domains, it is not coherent coming out of the other side, and thus it looks very dull and the object is translucent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes sense thank you! So presumably the spaghetti of polymers version are so closely wound into each other that there are much fewer domains, whereas the straightened versions can't fit around each other and leave lots of gaps?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both single crystal and amorphous materials are often transparent. Polycrystalline materials scatter light when they have feature sizes on the same order of magnitude as light (roughly 0.5 microns). The variation in refractive index causes the scattering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I remember correctly from some material science classes (X-ray crystallography?) an ordered structure allows defined planar boundaries that can have interactions with the particular wavelengths of light. A non-ordered structure has no...structure. I’m blanking on a better word but the light needs an actual shape to bounce off of.</p></div>		</li>
