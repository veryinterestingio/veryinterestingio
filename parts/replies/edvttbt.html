			<div class="markdown"><p>Right on! Well said. This is why I suggest that ppl take these interactions seriously as opportunities to grow. The morrow may be different as a result! I look at all interactions as a &quot;give&quot; or a &quot;get&quot;. It encourages me to get down to business instead of just chitchatting about things of no importance. That has it's place and time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Zero problems with satellites, including GPS. Zero problems with GPS based navigation.  There’s already a method for dealing with the difference between true and magnetic north, called “declination”. It can accommodate a 180 degree flop, and my guess is that folks won’t really even think about it after a few months.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think Horizon or Nova had a great special a few years back regarding magnetic poles shifting and iron filings in clay pots. Will post if i remember more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember that special. Key things I took away from it are (1) that the flip happens about every 250 million years and it's been over 700 since the last flip and (2) that we should expect higher cancer rates since Earth's magnetic &quot;shield&quot; is going to be compromised while the flip happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely nothing. People say satellites but lets be honest here we already deal with the South Atlantic Anomaly (an abnormally weak part of the field) by turning them off when they pass over it. Reversals take so long that it is unlikely we do not adapt our technology significantly faster than the consequences.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We just have to make sure the changes are not organised by German officials.</p>
<p>[edit] Disclaimer: I <em>am</em> German. This country is incredibly slow at adapting to <em>anything</em>.</p>
<p>We still have magnetic stripes on our banking cards, and contactless is still not available everywhere.</p></div>		</li>
