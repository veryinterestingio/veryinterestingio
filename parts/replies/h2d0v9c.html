Think of casinos as a place where you pay someone to serve you drinks while they entertain you and will feel better about the transaction. Don’t believe you are ever playing on an even playing field. You are not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Last time I was in Vegas, I noticed most casinos were actually trying to attract novice card counters. They had a couple single-deck tables, but the betting limits were much lower and blackjack paid less. </p>
<p>Regular tables used 6 decks and were shuffled pretty often, even if you're counting and playing the perfect strategy, you're not making much.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, that's just your average tourist trap because normal gamblers don't understand the casino advantage. One of the basic rules of card-counting is avoiding 6:5 blackjack payouts like the plague; it's not profitable to count.</p>
<p>No casino is &quot;attracting novice card counters&quot;. I would guess most casinos (especially wealthy Vegas casinos) <em>ignore</em> novice card counters at the low-limit/poor-rules games, because novice counters generally suck, and don't have the bankroll or discipline to ever make any real money; they are harmless. 90% of them will make mistakes, lose and/or give up on their own in due time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Counting cards is easy in the peace and quiet of a kitchen table. Add in the distractions of a casino, the game pace, etc. And it's a much more difficult task so many ways for them to break a players concentration. Plus you're there to have fun, counting cards is serious attrition the game, and that means no emotional bets, no looking away from the table.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you look at it, casinos actually encourage novice card counting in various movies and tv shows. This encourages more people to gamble thinking that they can beat the house. They have already setup a lot of ways to counter this such as more decks on the table, burning of cards, shuffling halfway through the deck etc...</p></div>		</li>
