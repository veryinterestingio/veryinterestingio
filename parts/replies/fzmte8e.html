			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;islands&quot; actually extend all the way to Russia (really the Aleutian Trench near the Kamchatka peninsula), but only the Hawaiian Islands are above the surface; the rest have eroded below the waves (but still far, far above the surrounding seafloor).  </p>
<p>The oldest is 82 million years old (and will be subducted &quot;soon&quot;) while Manu Loa (on the Big Island) is only 700,000 years old; the oldest Hawaiian Island, Ni'ihau, is 6 million years old.  </p>
<p>The chain of undersea mountains stretching up to the Aleutians is called the Hawaiian-Emperor Seamount Chain.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Mona loa has died down while Kilauea has become more active.</p>
<p>Lo'ihi has formed south of the big island, and is expected to rise above the sea in a few thousand years. </p>
<p>It is about 3/4's there now.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It looks like, based on the other peaks and the proximity, that the new one would likely merge with the big island rather than become its own island. </p>
<p>I wonder if all the islands used to be as big as Hawaii but eroded or if the big islands formation is indicative of an increase in lava flow since it's birth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theres a docuseries by the BBC called 'South Pacific' that has, in my opinion, the most majestic demonstration of this. The entire series is phenomenal, but episode 4, &quot;Ocean of Volcanoes&quot; is probably my favorite geologic documentary ever made. It actually makes me tear up a bit..</p></div>		</li>
