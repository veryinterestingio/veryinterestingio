			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing I haven't seen discussed much for safety/reliability is auto-rotation. Traditional helicopters can somewhat safely land with an engine failure by using the air movement (due to falling) to turn the rotor and create enough lift(drag?) to slow descent. I'm no expert but I would imagine that isn't really an option with a quad/hex copter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes I think that's a big reason why human-piloted multirotors don't have very good prospects. </p>
<p>Planes can glide, helis can autorotate, but multirotors just fall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a human scale multi-rotor would be awesome for transportation, but it would be using ground-effect lift. In case of failure, you crash down 2 feet or so. Advantages would be great in areas of poor road conditions like snow and ice.  OK I guess I just invented the hovercraft.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only that, but if only one rotor or engine fails the thing would instantly become very unstable and crash, even if it theoretically had the capability to autorotate down</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We currently employ dual thrust lifting systems (Chinook, Osprey) and multiple thrust (Harrier). </p>
<p>If you balance the airframe between four points of thrust, would it not be possible to shut down the opposing thrust in the event of a failure and use two opposing thrust sources to emergency land the craft? </p>
<p>I expect it would require computer controlled thrust for a fast enough reaction to a failed motor or engine,  but that's already a thing.</p>
<p>Complexity and risk of increasing the number of motors/engines aside...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that wholly depends on the design philosophy and mechanics you employ to get it in the air, the quad/hex-copters, double main rotor Chinook, single main rotor helicopters, dual main rotor helicopters, osprey monstrosity and jet powered harrier all have different mechanics and design philosophies behind them to keep them in the air, it's not as easy to interchange one system to another and &quot;just make it work&quot;.:</p>
<p>A simple quad-copter uses 4 fixed blade propellers (hex-copter uses 6 and as long as its symmetrical the same applies), loose one engine/propeller and you might be able to correct the instability if you have a computer react fast enough to counter the loss of thrust/torque by altering the speeds of the other 3 engines, but it will not be stable and you need all engines to have enough power to lift the device when 1 or 2 (if diagonal loss occurs) propellers fail, it will not be stable especially if you lose an arm and the center of mass compared to center of thrust changes (if you have 3 arms functional you can balance this too, but loose an arm and on the diagonal side the power and you have an incorrectable weight difference).</p>
<p>however a helicopter with a single main and torque balancing tail rotor,  or a dual main rotor helicopter like a Chinook, these rely on variable pitch (turning/twist-able blades) rotors that makes them able to auto-rotate and land safely (if they don't loose the rotor itself, only if just losing the engine/power) with a high chance that the single main rotor helicopter starts to spin if the pilot makes n error due to the tail no longer providing counter torque.</p>
<p>the osprey system falls like a brick regardless when it loses power and the Russian Kamov helicopter style dual rotors can auto-rotate like single main rotor helicopters but wont spin around if they lose power, but are a much more complex system in a tighter package.</p>
<p>if you were to create a quad-copter with variable pitch rotors, its not only incredibly complex and would definitely require computer aid to keep balanced and while it would be a very stable platform it would be highly prone to malfunctions, and while you would be able to auto-rotate to safety if you lose and entire arm (with computer help to balance, lose that and its RIP)  you still have the imbalance issues like the simple quad-copter has (a double rotor Chinook losing a single rotor entirely also falls like a brick due to center of mass compared to center of thrust imbalance).</p>
<p>lastly a harrier uses a jet engine system to gain vertical lift-off, which is another beast entirely and does not apply here, it can be done, linking 4 of these into a quad system, but is highly inefficient and impractical for a multitude of reasons (like complexity, weight, fuel and construction/maintenance/operation costs to start with.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Awesome call on why a quadcopter for real people is a bad idea.</p>
<p>Isn't every quadcopter computer controlled in some way? They fly by constantly compensating rotorspeed, calculated from a central brain.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, failure tolerant quad rotor control software can maintain control through and engine failure as long as you have the power budget (because you are essentially losing 2 engines for main thrust). I've worked on a failure tolerant 6 rotor controller which could lose up to 2 engines (provided they weren't adjacent) and still maintain the 4 DoF.</p>
<p>As long as you have the power to spare (and a compatible layout), you need a minimum of one rotor per DoF on a simple collective only system. Helicopters can squeeze 3 DoF out of a single rotor through quadrant based pitch control.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not so much less faulty as it is harder to control them and keep stable versus a quadcopter couterpart, the biggest difference lies in the difference of scale, their smaller size, lower weight and faster reaction times makes for a less stable platform that is easier to make errors with.</p>
<p>Ps, scale is also the variable in stabillity when it comes to the differences in design philosophy that both types of machines employ.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>RC helicopters do have a mechanical auto-stabilizing function which is their link between main rotor and tail rotor that counters the main rotor its torque preventing it from spinning around like an idiot (or in case of the kamov double rotor designs, the blades pitch controller) but it doesn't nearly depend on the auto-stabilizing as much as a quad-copter does to stay in the air (quad-copters cannot do without), if you were to change the 4 fixed propellers into variable pitch rotor systems the quad-copter would have a much increased survivability  (at the expense of costs, weight and complexity and possible mechanical failures.).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To properly fly an rc helo, you need to really understand the mechanics of helicopter flight.  I can give my 4 yr old the remote to my dj drone and she can do ok.  Hover, and land are easy enough.</p>
<p>When I got my first rc helo it took me a week before I was able to get it higher than 3 inches off the ground. It’s not that they are faulty, it’s that they are like a helicopter and people just gun the throttle when they don’t know what they are doing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OTOH I have a conventional heli RC that my 3yo can fly. It auto-stablizes, keeps the tail rotor balanced unless you order yaw, and is generally amazingly idiot proof.</p>
<p>It has fixed pitch and relies on brute force power to maintain flight though. It effectively never leaves hover to enter the flight.</p>
<p>It flies like crap because it wants to fly in a level attitude and control heading only with yaw.</p>
<p>Really flying a heli takes skill. But they can be made to hover around just as badly as a quadracopter drone....</p></div>		</li>
