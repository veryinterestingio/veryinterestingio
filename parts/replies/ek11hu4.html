			<div class="markdown"><p>By passing air through the vocal cords and out of the nasal passage. humming. Which still uses the same airways as the mouth does. Try humming with your mouth shut and holding your nose closed. You can make sounds until your mouth fills up with air that you are expelling through your lungs. Then it becomes impossible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually not quite true. Although the respiratory tube is disconnected, there is a section where it crosses the esophagus. We have seen cases where dolphins apparently suffocated by inhaling food into the respiratory passages. Basically, the larynx goes through the esophagus at one point but it is not a sealed connection -- the larnyx can be pushed aside which exposes the respiratory passages to water, or blockages.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In some cases this is because they eat fish that are too large, which pushes the larnyx aside and disconnects it, which means that attempts to breath are impossible. In one unique case there was a flatfish of sort that apparently caused some complication, and it was inhaled into the larynx. The flatfish, being the shape it is, ended up being rolled tightly in the larnyx and there was no way out of that one.</p></div>		</li>
