			<p>I dunno, as I'm not a dev. But that does affects how the refunds work. It's not really a refund if the money doesn't come back from Valve's pocket, right? You end up forced to make use of that money by buying a game or something.</p>		</li>

			<p>See, all of these are true, at least in part, but they're just problems inherent to the early days of making anything that was once free a valuable commodity. <br><br>Your post doesn't in any way say why the idea of this system is so horrible we should all boycott valve, like people are saying. If the modders want to sell their mods using this system despite the flaws you have outlined, that is their choice. None of these complaints apply to working, non-stolen mods being sold on this platform (minus the price sharing, but its up to the modder to determine whether they think the split is fair. If they don't like the split, no one is forcing them to sell it. ). It just boils down to people making a ton of noise about being upset about paying for something that used to be free.<br><br>It does suck. But if studios, and modders agree to these terms, the situation with modding before was unstable, and this was going to happen eventually. Hiccups in the early days as this big change rips through are obviously going to happen. If the vocal gamers on reddit are right, we will see no adoption of this program by modders, but I doubt it.  People like being paid for doing work. <br><br>In conclusion: yeah this is bad for gamers, but thats just because we now have to share the costs in a way that is more fair. if a mod improves your experience enough to make it valuable to you, then now you'll have to pay for it. Sucks, but that's the case with almost everything else in the world. Modding was an oasis perpetuated by the impossibility of modders to negotiate a deal directly with game companies and the legal gray areas associated with selling a mod without an deal. The oasis is being paved, which sucks for us, but can you blame them for wanting some compensation? <br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>Never said we should boycott Valve. But there are lots of issues that needs to be addressed to make sure the entire enterprise doesn't become a shit hole. It will be a big problem for everyone if the workshop, which had lots of cool mods, become a microtransaction heaven. Asking 99 bucks for realistic horse dicks is not okay. Also, there are lots of stolen work that needs to be removed ASAP. And the distribution of the money (25% for the modder, 75% for Valve/Bethesda) makes it so modders don't sell their work cheap because of fear of making no money at all. Valve needs to acknowledge those issues somehow.</p>		</li>

			<p>It's still new. I think the clusterfuckity of it will go down over the next few weeks, and there will be adjustments to the system to make it work better. For modders who like the percentage cut and want payment, it's a positive thing though.<br><br>Sorry to imply you were for a boycott, just been a lot of very reactionary talk the last few days. Many people are demanding boycott for the things you mentioned.</p>		</li>

			<p>There's a bit of misinformation, so I'd like to clear some things up.<br><br>&gt; The Skyrim workshop was flooded with people trying to sell minor items, like swords or armor.<br><br>&quot;Flooded&quot; is a rich term. At the moment there are only 17 mods which can be bought. The most expensive one is $6, and the cheapest is 25 cents. There are some swords.<br><br>More will arrive in time, larger mods of course will take longer to develop.<br><br>The free market will figure out how much it is willing to pay for a mod. Just because somebody tries list a sword for $10 doesn't mean anyone will actually pay for it. Ultimately low-effort mods should be cheap or free, and high-effort mods can ask for more money (or even be free, it's up to the modder).<br><br>There is an 'under review' page, where mods are vetted by the community before they can be purchased. There are currently 81 mods on this list. This is the list people have been referring to whenever they've said &quot;people uploading&quot;, no mods have progressed from here to the actual for sale section since the program was launched.<br><br>&gt; Some scummy users are grabbing free mods from Nexus and uploading them with a pricetag.<br><br>While possible it is intended that these users will be caught by the community/curators during the review phase (i.e. before the mod is even sold). If a stolen mod does make it through to actually being on sale Valve encourages users to report the issue, and have a simple form which can be used to take legal action on the matter with a DMCA notice (if the mod really is stolen then there should be no problem taking this action).<br><br>&gt; A modder only gets 25% of the value the users pay for the mods. The excuse from Valve and Bethesda is that they're the ones providing exposure and hosting.<br><br>And IP, and tools, and handling transactions, and marketing, plus &quot;Workshop authors can select from a pre-approved list of organizations, users, and toolmakers to receive a percentage of Valve's revenue from sale of their items.&quot;.<br><br>If modders (not the players, the developers) feel their piece of the pie is too small then it is an issue that they collectively need to take up with Valve and Bethesda. Remembering of course that until this program it was against Bethesda's terms of service to make money from a mod.<br><br>&gt; Valve doesn't let the modders take down a mod once it's for sale<br><br>Valve will allow a mod to be unlisted and unpurchaseable at the creator's request. They can't take it away from users who have already paid for it unless legally compelled to do so.<br><br>&gt; Notice that when all mods were free, there wasn't any problem with mods using other mods for assets.<br><br>Strictly speaking this was a problem, as long as you consider a mod to be the intellectual property of the person who created it (and therefore has copyright over it). It is just that, until now, people didn't have a vested interest in defending their copyright.<br><br>Beyond this, Valve actually caters to co-contribution. An uploader can list other contributors, as well as propose a revenue split between them. Valve will contact each contributor to get their ok on the submission as well as the revenue arrangements. So if your mod contains assets from another modder, you are free to contact them and arrange licencing.<br><br>Note that this has nothing to do with Mod A requiring Mod B. It is only an issue if Mod A can only be distributed with Mod B inside it.<br><br>&gt; If a mod you paid for breaks and the modder refuses to fix, the user who bought it just wasted his money.<br><br>This is a risk. But in some parts of the world consumer law will protect users, but in other places it won't. Users who don't want to take the risk can always stick to free mods.<br><br>&gt; Valve offers too little time to see if a mod works before it stops you from getting a refund in case it's a piece of shit. And the money doesn't even come back to you: it goes to your Steam Wallet, so you can only spend it on Steam.<br><br>Again, in some places consumer law has your back with longer return periods and for getting cash. In other places, this is a risk, users need to weigh it up before they purchase.<br><br>Note that these last two points apply to many other markets. For example app stores by both Apple and Google have a very large number of low quality apps with no curation, on top of this Apple has no formal returns policy and Google has a 2 hour window, and of course there's no guarantee that an app will still work a week from when you bought it. Somehow, people seem to manage alright in that market.<br><br>&gt; have to scavenge good mods in a sea of microtransactions<br><br>This is why Steam has curators, who can help flag quality mods to users, as well as reviews. </p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; &quot;Flooded&quot; is a rich term. At the moment there are only 17 mods which can be bought. The most expensive one is $6, and the cheapest is 25 cents. There are some swords.<br><br>Valve seems to be moderating the workshop. I remember people posting lots of mods stolen from Nexus, and gag items, like <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=430955234" target="_blank">an extra apple for the Whiterun Tavern for 30 dollars</a>. Then there was a moment when all mods couldn't be bought and now it seems to be &quot;under control&quot;.<br><br>Things were going so out of hand that I thought Valve would pull the plug on the whole shebang. But it seems they really want the mod store to work. Not sure how it gonna be if they have to moderate every submission though.<br><br>&gt; &gt;  A modder only gets 25% of the value the users pay for the mods. The excuse from Valve and Bethesda is that they're the ones providing exposure and hosting.<br><br>&gt; And IP, and tools, and handling transactions, and marketing, plus &quot;Workshop authors can select from a pre-approved list of organizations, users, and toolmakers to receive a percentage of Valve's revenue from sale of their items.&quot;.<br><br>Pile up any excuses you want. The modder is the one who actually made the mod and spent time programming, making meshes, etc. <strong>Licensing shouldn't cost more than actual work.</strong><br><br>Another proof that it's bullshit: mods still can be free. What? Don't they have costs with licensing, managing IP, storage, tools, etc? How can mods be free then? These costs weren't a problem before, they shouldn't be a problem now.<br><br>&gt; Valve will allow a mod to be unlisted and unpurchaseable at the creator's request. They can't take it away from users who have already paid for it unless legally compelled to do so.<br><br>Only because they don't wanna make refunds.<br><br>Okay, they don't wanna allow the mods to take advantage over Valve, but that doesn't mean Valve gets to take advantage over the modders too. Wouldn't be better to, you know, not sell the mods in the first place?<br><br>If someone steals my mod and sells it, the user will still use it when they shoudn't and I still won't get any money from it or take it down, all because Valve doesn't wanna make refunds.<br><br>&gt; Strictly speaking this was a problem, as long as you consider a mod to be the intellectual property of the person who created it (and therefore has copyright over it). It is just that, until now, people didn't have a vested interest in defending their copyright.<br><br>Mods were distributed under copyrights similar to creative commons. As long as you told people it uses assets from other users, making sure to give credit, it was okay. But now, with money involved, people get afraid of being taken advantage of. Modders are mostly common people who have no idea of licensing fees and whatnots. They'll say no if they even think they might have been taken advantage of, even though they wouldn't get a single penny before.<br><br>It's a mess that didn't existed before, and that will affect the quality of the mods. And the reason this mess exists is only because Valve, not the modders, got greedy.<br><br>&gt; This is a risk. But in some parts of the world consumer law will protect users, but in other places it won't. Users who don't want to take the risk can always stick to free mods.<br><br>Didn't EU complain about the refund policy from Valve? Or how you can't resell your games? Did you ever needed some customer support from Valve? Ask anyone who needed help from them about anything. Pretty sure the way they operates would be considered illegal in my country if it bothered enough to look into it.<br><br>Protect users, yeah right… They ignore consumer protection law for a living. Just because I use Steam doesn't mean I'm not aware of it's faults. But lots of users will really get hurt if they spend money on mods that stop working later. Not everyone knows how mods are made.<br><br>Will it become a mess like App Store or Google Play Store? Probably. But why should it? Mods were free, sometimes asked for donations and everyone was happy.</p>		</li>
