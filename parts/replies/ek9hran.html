			<div class="markdown"><p>My question arised because I read the argument that nazis didn't use chemical weapons because they wouldn't be as effective as in WWI. But the allies didn't know that nerve gases existed, so masks could be ineffective. It seems that they had 12000 tonnes of tabun and a couple of tonnes of sarin. Do you know how toxic they are through skin absorption in open field?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While there are a lot of factors involved in your question, the short answer is in an open field, if you have been exposed to the primary source of contamination, youre probably going to die without immediate (like within minutes) treatment. Some stuff to think about though, exposure can happen through a many different methods, you can air drop a liquid onto an enemy column, use chemical mortars, aerisol release via pressurized containers etc, and each of those methods is dangerous in different ways, but can also be avoided.</p>
<p>IIRC both tabun and sarin are non-persitant, meaning they will not naturally last more than 24 hours in its intended form. They will evaporate quickly and become less and less potent over time, so even secondary exposure (like some that soaked into your buddies clothes and is off-gassing after being moved to another area) can be significantly less lethal but still extremely dangerous without treatment. I dont remember the exact numbers, but i do remember in one of the training videos ive seen, some animals (goats and a bird i think) died within minutes of exposure to the primary source (an artillery round with a chemical payload) while they were sitting inside of a bunker, so even a small amount of gas can quickly reach extended areas based off of weather conditions and climate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically carbon monoxide is not considered a VOC. VOCs are heavier (relatively) organic compounds with high vapor pressures so they readily evaporate at room temperature. Basically stuff that gives of &quot;fumes&quot; like alcohol, acetone, gasoline, formaldehyde, CFCs, etc.</p>
<p>While you are right that CO could not be filtered out with cartridges and requires a forced air system, most true VOCs can be filtered out with activated charcoal based systems.</p>
<p>I'm slightly concerned if you do this for a living.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After reading your comment i went about fact checking myself, a simple google search turned up that you are indeed correct, CO is not a VOC, so while wondering why i conflated the two i went back to some of my study texts and found that the gear we use to check for VOCs we also use to detect CO, so that one's my bad. Thanks for the correction!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would you be willing to relate this to a specific example, specifically the half mask common to industrial applications? Specifically the ones with both a particulate filter and an organic vapor cartridge (if I recall the terminology correctly). I used these regularly in pest control.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So carbon monoxide is not considered a VOC. VOCs actually CAN be readily filtered out using the those organic vapor cartridges you use. The particulate filter is just that fiber piece that snaps over the cartridge if it has an N rating. P rated particulate filters are oil proof and have that pink cover. The cartridge itself is basically just activated charcoal that absorbs the VOCs from the air.</p>
<p>True VOCs as far as the EPA (air quality), OSHA (workplace safety), and chemists are concerned are organic (carbon/hydrocarbon based) chemicals that readily evaporate at room temperature, which makes them &quot;volatile.&quot; So stuff that gives off fumes are volatile, like alcohol, acetone, gasoline, etc.</p></div>		</li>
