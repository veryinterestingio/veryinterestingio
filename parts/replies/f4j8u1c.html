<p>Why didn't they just put some kind of device on deep sea creatures and tracked when they were not moving?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would certainly be interesting, but probably quite challenging logistically.  Tracking devices have been used successfully with many marine animals; Ocearch even maintains a <a href="https://www.ocearch.org/tracker/?list" target="_blank">map with live updates</a> for several of them.  However, most of the species this has been done with are a) fairly large, allowing them to carry a larger tracking device with more room for batteries, etc.; and b) not exclusively deep water species.  These animals are typically <a href="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f8463e63fc64ff8b84b65bd9205260465042b373/c=114-0-1934-1365/local/-/media/2016/07/30/TreasureCoast/katharine_6_6379241_ver1..jpg?width=540&amp;height=405&amp;fit=crop" target="_blank">caught and manually tagged</a> before being released, but species that are not adapted for living at the surface are unlikely to survive being brought up and returned.  It might eventually be possible to tag animals remotely or with submarines (as was recently done for the first time <a href="http://www.oceanx.org/shark-deep-sea-shark-tagging-submersible-first-ever/" target="_blank">with a sixgill shark</a>), but I don't think this kind of thing is feasible for smaller fish or invertebrates just yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't really my area of research so I can't say I follow this literature very closely, but if you specifically want a recent publication related to this topic, check out <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-49971-8" target="_blank">Haro et al. 2019</a> from last month.  They studied the daily vertical migration I mentioned above and used some neat methods to separate out the influence of light and tidal cycles in driving this pattern.  For the microorganisms examined in this study at least, it seems like light and dark cycles are required to maintain a regular pattern, since they stopped migrating when exposed to constant light conditions for a few days.</p></div>		</li>
