<p>There are nutrients like leutein which are not classified as a vitamin but are needed for sight. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutein#Role_in_human_eyes" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutein#Role_in_human_eyes</a></p>
<p>There are also numerous nutrients in plants that switch on genes. Broccoli sprouts have been shown to reduce cancer. For plants, personally I think describing them in term of a few vitamins instead of thousands of phytonutrients is grossly simplistic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since first isolated from broccoli and demonstrated to have cancer chemoprotective properties in rats in the early 1990s, over 3000 publications have described its efficacy in rodent disease models, underlying mechanisms of action or, to date, over 50 clinical trials examining pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and disease mitigation.</p>

<p>So is  broccoli not a vitamin but an anti cancer drug?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I assume it would be more like testing patients with various disorders, including healthy control patients, and recording their diets.</p>
<p>People who came in with discoloration of the skin and eyes, along with recording an abundance of carrot in their diet would indicate that something in the carrots (Vitamin A or Beta Carotene) is leaving unhealthy deposits in the body.</p>
<p>People with low amounts of Vitamin A or Beta Carotene in their diets showed more problems with eyesight, indicating a need in the body for certain amounts of it, leading to recommendations between the unhealthily low levels and the unhealthily high levels.</p></div>		</li>
