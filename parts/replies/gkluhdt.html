			<div class="markdown"><p>follow up question, how is the core of the earth remaining hot? Is it just super well insulated and therefore it's still hot from when the planet was made or is there some process that generates the heat down there?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>About half of the heat is from radioactive decay/fission (~21 TW per <a href="https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2011/07/17/kamland-geoneutrinos/" target="_blank">https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2011/07/17/kamland-geoneutrinos/</a>)</p>
<p>The rest is primordial heat: heat leftover from the formation of the planet, from the kinetic energy of meteorite/comet impacts, and also from friction when iron rich material sinks in the mantle (and also silica rich materials rise.) Other things, too, and it's still an active area of research. Some are looking into if there's other fission and even fusion reactions going on in Earth's interior.</p>
<p>Also, remember the Sun still dominates Earth's heat budget. The Sun contributes about 173,000 TW of solar radiation, while the heat &quot;loss&quot; from the Earth's interior (i.e. the flow of heat from the interior to the surface) is somewhere around 44 TW to 47 TW depending on your source. A drop in the bucket in terms of influence on surface temperature. Rocks and space are pretty good insulators.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Something is missing in this picture, it would mean at quick glance that the Earth (core) should warm up not cool down. So how much of these 173,000 TW is actually radiated back?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Simply put, it isn't remaining hot. It's still cooling, but it's so gigantic that it's going to take a very, very long time until it's finished. Especially considering the fact that Earth is in the vacuum of space, the only mechanism for it to lose heat through is infrared radiation, which isn't terribly efficient. And that's disregarding the radioactive decay happening in the core, which releases more heat into the system.</p></div>		</li>
