<p>It is in the case of new builds, which are increasingly unaffordable and can certainly be accused of gouging.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Idk man. I’m not arguing with you that there are pockets of extremes everywhere, but even the price of new builds is largely determined by the buying and selling of comparable homes in the area. In other words, the homes developers are choosing to build in a given area is based on the surrounding market. You’re not going to see a middle class neighborhood pop up in a sea of mansions, for example. </p>
<p>I live in an area that’s seeing 12% YOY growth in home value on average, and it’s being driven almost entirely by people’s desire to get into the school district. It’s not like some areas in the western US and all of Canada, but on paper 12% YOY growth is unsustainable. However, in this case, it’s organic demand which has material value.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, it sucks to be looking to buy a house right now.  But it didn't 'not suck,' before COVID in a lot of the country.   There may have been fewer offers, but there was still competition.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Depends on the area. There's people who make of buying and renting or reselling houses a long term investment business. Sometimes people like these own most of the houses in a city.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In which case I guess you have to retroactive price where possible and implement an emergency mode for all automated systems which makes sure pricing stays in line with laws.</p>
<p>It's a good example of unintended harm of automation. Where the person who made it obviously didn't intend to break the law ( or I would hope so, at the very least it's not something everyone thinks about ) but when shit hits the fan and automation kicks in to make a bad situation worse. It's interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah… but I doubt you can credibly call housing price gouging when in my area you have people complaining that it’s somehow unfair that their $899k bid lost out to a $1.2 million bid?</p>
<p>Is <em>buying</em> a McMansion really an essential need?!?</p>
<p>Affordable housing is one thing but what price point is it no longer considered affordable housing but rather “aspirational housing”?  Is purchasing/owning a house an essential need because simply having access to affordable rental housing seems good enough to me?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Arguably though that’s still an apples to oranges comparison.</p>
<p>A 2bd 1 bath “starter” house vs a 8bd 6 bath mansion is more of the “Honda Fit vs Porsche 911 Turbo” you’re looking for.</p>
<p>Renting is the bicycle or motorcycle of housing; it works in some scenarios, but a hell of a lot fewer than the Porsche or the Honda.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I liked a lot of what you said so I wanted to touch on this to highlight something.</p>
<p>Rental housing is absolutely good enough for someone’s “needs”. The issue is multi fold though, we aren’t just talking about people’s physical well being, but their place in society, how America has presented (in general nothing super explicit) success, and most importantly (imo) the coalescing of wealth/wealth disparity/inequality.</p>
<p>Before I touch on the last point I’d like to point out that there was an idea once that if you worked hard and were somewhat frugal you could eventually own a piece of property and retire, imaginary or real (it was real for a time but I don’t think it exists now), they called it the American dream. This is important to point out imo because while there is no right to own a home, people have been sold the idea that it would be feasible. Yes people’s ideas of success shift with the time but on some level buying your first home as a lower/newly middle class person is a milestone, an assertion of their ability to strike out on their own and be independent. This stuff matters towards mindset even if it might seem trivial on paper, it can have a great effect on people’s well being. Not many people want to have to live with their parents indefinitely or pay exorbitant rent costs that don’t contribute to any equity, taking the ability to even <em>try</em> to do that away from people contributes imo to a lot of the apathy we see among younger people and even millennials. Why would you bust your ass for something that likely can’t be achieved without huge sacrifices and even then might not be feasible depending on your life circumstances? </p>
<p>Now the more important point imo is that we are seeing some of the negative and perhaps not well understood or researched effects of capitalism. This is hard to sort of attack in some ways since money is so intertwined with the government but I think most average people would agree that the system we have currently is at minimum somewhat of a bastardization of capitalism. So what am I getting at here? Essentially that money begets more money, that’s kind of inherent in the nature of capitalism where those with the means get first opportunity to use/build/buy whatever and it begins to spiral as it compounds. You can see this taking place in almost any American market, businesses are normally either local or nationwide with not much in between and at the national level there are often only 3-4 serious competitors (constituting a type oligarchy in a sense but I digress) with medium sized businesses mostly being consumed or stripped by their large competitors. What does this have to do with housing? Simply put the wealthy have so much means and housing is a limited resource and this is pricing people out. This matters because it will concentrate wealth in the hands of a few people over time who will then basically extract wealth from those who have no other option but to rent. The issue isn’t that rental housing doesn’t meet the physical needs of people, but rather that if left unchecked rental housing will be the only option for most people and will further entrench those who simply happened to have resources at the time of coalescence. </p>
<p>There are tons of issues that stem from the housing market as well. People denying new building simply because it would hurt their homes value by decreasing scarcity, San Francisco refusing to build high rises at a rate commensurate with growth is a p easy example of this. Then you got stuff like low income or reasonably priced multiroom rentals (that could support a family) not even being built because there is less profit than building “deluxe” single bedroom apartments, Seattle and DC has some of this going on. The issue is that the value of homes and ergo the interests of those who own them/use them as investments is directly at odds with some measures we might take to alleviate the housing issues in the first place. Houses as investments is another issue, people park money in the housing market knowing it will go up overtime, this artificially increases scarcity further driving up prices, you see this play out particularly in Vancouver but really all along the west coast in major cities. Essentially the need to make money is vastly outpacing our common sense on how we <em>should</em> be building or even the current availability of houses, further compounded by stuff like AirBnB. All these things serve to simply entrench those who have already and stick those who don’t with a choice of some fairly shit options. </p>
<p>We are seeing it play out in real time that self interest outweighs a lot of the ways we could mitigate these issues so it seems to me if we don’t take some kind of regulatory action the system is bound to continue perpetually until all but the upper middle class are priced out of owning homes in desirable areas (which is important because that’s where the work is for most people). </p>
<p>Im not here to say I have solutions but I did want to highlight a bit on why simply access to affordable rental housing isn’t a total solution and that word affordable is doing some heavy lifting as a qualifier as renting is not really affordable/cheap. </p>
<p>You mention buying a McMansion but it’s not just McMansions it’s regular houses. My parents bought a home in 2011, it was a 25ish min drive to town, it was 4bed 2 bad with a pool they got it for 120k iirc. They eventually got foreclosed on in 2014 and it sold for 200k, that same house is now 400k. It was a nice house don’t get me wrong but that’s a family home not a McMansion, sure maybe the pool is excessive but that alone doesn’t make the place worth almost half a mill. This is to highlight that all the extra money floating around and being used to invest in houses is driving up prices on way more than McMansions, you can see this waaaaay worse in places like San Fran where a “house” might be half of a duplex and still run you a million+ (might be slight hyperbole here). </p>
<p>I typed all this out because I’m not opposed to most of what your saying but wanted to give some of my perspective on why what you suggested isn’t necessarily a silver bullet and also see what you had to say about it. Thoughts?</p></div>		</li>
