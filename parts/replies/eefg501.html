			<div class="markdown"><p>Same! Age and lack of wisdom teeth. My orthodontist went ahead with braces earlier than he normally would since wisdom teeth wouldn't come mess up his work. I like telling people I'm evolved. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Baby tooth roots are resorbed by the erupting adult tooth.  Thatâ€™s why when you pull your baby tooth out there is almost no root.  The eruption cyst that surrounds the adult tooth bud is whatâ€™s responsible for this resorption and it also resorbs bone thatâ€™s in the way.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact. If an adult tooth is pulled out its roots are usually long enough that it'll pull jaw bone out with it. You can spitting out slivers of sharp bone for a few days after an extraction. </p>
