			<div class="markdown"><p>it's also called cold welding.  In some cases, gold, indium, copper to aluminium, the fucking bolts on bikes i need to repair, it doesn't need the vacuum.  When it's unintentional, like the bolts, it's called galling.<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just look up Cold welding and you find lots of info about it.</p>
<p>I have to say I do not know if it would happen with normal aluminum if it has been exposed is oxygen in the atmosphere because the top layer will be aluminum oxide. It is the formation of oxides and other stuff on the surface that is why is not occurring on earth.</p>
<p>If the aluminum part was rubbed against something and the oxide remove the cold welding seams a lot more reasonable. It might happen even if there is oxide on it too but you will not have a uniform metal like if the oxide was not there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Omg I can actually contribute for once! Cold welding can happen to aluminum even after exposure to oxygen through the exact process you describe. The aluminum oxide can be rubbed off (through abrasion) to expose pure AL underneath. In fact, the two surfaces welding together don't even have to be the same material. During abrasion some material can be transferred from one surface to the other creating two uniform clean surfaces. Typically the softer will preferentially transfer to the harder one. Since AL is soft it gets worn away very readily and easily sticks (adheres) to the other surface. There is a paper titled &quot;Observed Effects of vibrationally Induced Fretting of Bearing Shaft Systems in Flywheel Energy Storage Systems&quot; that addresses this exact topic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like many people have said you can google &quot;cold welding&quot; to learn more in detail. If you want to really dig into it you can use Google scholar and look up the same term. This will provide you a list of scientific papers in the topic. There was a recent paper published in 2018 titled Observed Effects of Vibrationally Induced Fretting on Bearing–Shaft Systems in Flywheel Energy Storage Systems that might be of interest if you're looking for a deep dive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t like this explanation. The rules that govern metals have very little to do with what happens between two sheets of paper. Metallic bond are just fundamentally different of covalent bonds.</p>
<p>Cold welding may be a thing but it’s such a fringe effect that it’s counterproductive as an answer to a question that is about household objects.</p>
<p>The fact is that there is a certain way an atom “knows” it belongs to a piece of paper or at the very least to the cellulose molecule making up that paper. Intramolecular bonds aren’t going to break spontaneously, not even in a vacuum. This has absolutely nothing to do with dirt and debris.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah. its not a good explanation but the part about cold welding is good information but irrelevant</p>
<p>pulling a sheet of paper apart isnt exactly the same as splitting or fusing atoms to each other on an atomic level with metals</p>
<p>it's a physical reaction, no atoms are being split apart from each other when u cut paper. i think the confusion with what OP is asking is essentially that he is thinking all atoms that are part of something necessarily connect and bond with each other on an atomic level. we shouldn't be talking about individual atoms but molecules instead. even when u cut paper, u arent breaking covalent bonds within the molecules, u are pulling molecules away from molecules physically because of whatever force (friction i think) that keeps them close together (but not chemically bonded) is lesser than the force of pulling these physical bonds apart</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it’s relevant because it’s an example of “atoms not knowing.” He should’ve specified it was general, but he does go on to say paper is different. It’s like a little blurb to give a little more context to the question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm don't think your answer to part 1 applies to paper. Metals are kind of unusual because their atoms share a pool of free-moving electrons that aren't especially attached to a given pair of atoms. Individual paper fibers are held together by covalent bonds, where two electron orbitals from different atoms combine to form a new orbital. Covalent bonds require energy to break, and for paper, there isn't enough energy for this to happen at room temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Covalent bonding? That’s only between the atoms in a molecule, paper isn’t one giant molecule. It’s much easier to break the intermolecular forces than the actual covalent bonds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed. The individual fibres in the paper are intertwined, and so don't generally have too much freedom to move around - but there is absolutely no distinction for that fiber between one sheet and another.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point is that the fibres are &quot;well defined&quot; from the point of view of the atoms. The paper is basically a mesh of fibres, theres no reason for the 2 meshes to spontaneously entangle with each other, nor the fibres within one mesh to &quot;fuse&quot; with the fibres of another.</p></div>		</li>
