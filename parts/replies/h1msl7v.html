			<div class="markdown"><p>It is an excellent explanation. But many other comments here generalize too far and assume that because all insects have small brains and low resolution vision, they are all &quot;dumb&quot; in how they behave when encountering glass. But I do not think it is necessarily true. Here is an episode that I witnessed some years ago.</p>
<p>I was sitting by an open window, and noticed a large wasp-like insect flying in. At first I did not pay much attention to this. But in a few minutes the same insect, (or another one just like it) came in through the window again, and continued into the kitchen. This made me curious. In the next half an hour or so, I watched how this insect, probably one and the same individual, repeatedly flew into the dining room window, flew directly into the kitchen, and exited through an open door there, taking a shortcut through the house.</p>
<p>The most curious thing happened when we closed the door. The insect came in through the window, as usual went straight into the kitchen, approached the now closed door (which had several large glazed panes), hovered for a second in front of the door, then turned around, and to my astonishment retraced its path without any hesitation and exited back through the window. For as long as I watched, it never came back that evening.</p>
<p>In this episode, the insect seemed to be navigating very deliberately, with no random trial and error, unlike what we usually see in house flies. Once the path was closed, the insect appropriately detoured on the first try, and stopped using the shortcut.</p>
<p>This of course is just one anecdote, and not a study of insect behavior. But to me, this episode showed very clearly that there is a range of rudimentary intelligence that various insects are capable of -- despite all having comparatively small brains.</p>
<p>We just need to be careful not to go into the other extreme and assume that because the insect has dealt with a particular situation in what seemed like a marvelously intelligent manner, the same insect would behave &quot;intelligently&quot; in other, seemingly equivalent to humans situations. What seems &quot;easy&quot; or the &quot;same problem&quot; for our brains with their 100 billion neurons, is not necessarily so for an animal with probably just a million of neurons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But what they are saying applies for most insects. Eusocial insects like ants, bees, wasps are capable of much more coordinated behavior. I'm pretty sure wasps have photographic memories, makes sense because these type of insects need to go back to their hive/nest. Ants use chemical signals to make their way back to the nest, probably can do what you described but its not intelligence just following a scent</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, at least some insects can definitely recognize their nests by sight.</p>
<p>I was still very surprised when this creature was able to fly back so easily. Until the door was closed, it only went from the window through the house and out of the door -- I have not seen it going in the other direction.</p></div>		</li>
