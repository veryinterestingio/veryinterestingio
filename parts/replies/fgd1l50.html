So something with 2x the mass but 1/2 the velocity will have the same momentum as something with 1x mass and 1x velocity. In regards to your comment. If the truck weighs 10x the car with velocity 1/2x the car, then the truck has 5x the momentum. This is enough to overcome the direction the car is moving and force it to go backwards. To find out how fast, you simply calculated the net momentum before the impact, then divide that by the truck and cars mass combined.</p></div>		</li>
