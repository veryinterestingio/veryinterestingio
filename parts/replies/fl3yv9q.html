			<div class="markdown"><p>Both are used in the most advanced “battery fuel gauges” nowadays. Semiconductor companies often make ICs that do cell voltage measurements and sense current through a tiny resistor for coulomb counting. The most advanced ones in the newest generations of phones and tablets have proprietary “mixing” algorithms in them that choose how much and when to trust the coulomb counter or the battery voltage measurement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm guessing it can be made so the amount of energy considered for the coulomb counter updates with time, can't it?</p></div>		</li>
