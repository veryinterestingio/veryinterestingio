			<div class="markdown"><p>Long ass time for things outside of LEO. Once you get to geosynchronous it's practically forever. There are some molecules out there to impact and solar winds have a push/pull effect that could be imbalanced, but thousands and thousands of years is a safe bet for some junk up there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a nice picture on the german wikipedia about this:
The labels are height of orbit above sea level (horizontal) and &quot;survival duration&quot; in years before it drops to ground (vertical)

			<div class="markdown"><p>Playing the gravity levels of an old steam game called Osmos will help you here. You can do a lot to the momentum of an object before you doom it to fall into its orbital body. You're gonna deform the orbit a lot. If an object breaks into many pieces that break off in different directions, lots of those objects will end up in New orbita rather than immediately falling in. Lots will fall in too of course.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Such a great and maddeningly difficult game!</p>
<p>Definitely a good hands-on way to play with how adjustments to mass or speed or both can have similar effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's very true.  Should be recommended for more things.  I remember getting to level 10 or 11 of those ones which start with nothing moving just  the whole map filled with massive orbs.  Such fun.</p></div>		</li>
