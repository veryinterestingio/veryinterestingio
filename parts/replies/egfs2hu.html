			<div class="markdown"><p>I like how you break it down into steps.</p>
<p>Can you clarify some terms you use (probably very basic to you)? Like: Special Relativity (vs &quot;normal&quot; Relativity?), Momentum (vs acceleration?), &quot;The object is (not) moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light&quot; (≈not fast?).</p>
<p>So is the famous E=mc² something Einstein wouldn't have actually used in his calculations? Is it overly simplistic or just plain wrong?</p>
<p>Thx!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Special Relativity is used to distinguish it from General Relativity, which includes gravity. Special relativity is the special case where gravity is negligible.</p>
<p>Momentum is a physical concept like mass and velocity. For slow speeds it is approximately mass times velocity.</p>

<p>Not fast, yes, but with a more precise way to say what is fast and what is not (several kilometers per second is not fast in this context).</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Well, that equation gives you the total energy of an object with mass m when it doesn't move. It is a special case of the more general equation /u/AsAChemicalEngineer posted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if Momentum is something left out in special relativity (ie no gravity), can I think of Momentum as the speed or force that &quot;actually&quot; matters between two objects? In other words if I throw a rock at Billy's face, you could go all technical and argue the rock is also travelling through space at several km/s², as it is gravitationally tied to the spinning &amp; moving earth as it revolves the sun etc... but what matters for Billy's face is the Momentum it has at the point of impact (?). What &quot;matters&quot; is an interesting, but unintended choice of words here.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also to distinguish from <em>Galilean</em> relativity, which preceded it, and could reasonable be called &quot;normal&quot; relativity, insofar as it is the relativity that applies to everyday life, and that seems much more intuitive to most people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll just add one more comment since /u/mfb- handled the other questions,</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>He in fact did use it in his calculations. Specifically it first appeared in his 1905 paper <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einstein/E_mc2/e_mc2.pdf" target="_blank">&quot;Does the inertia of a body depend on its energy-content?&quot;</a></p>
<p>If you open up the paper and scroll to the top of the last page he calculated that a particle that has emitted radiation (through decay, not radiation from accelerated charge) should have its mass reduced by L/c^(2) where L is the energy of the radiation. In our modern notation this is just m=E/c^(2).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Just reiterating this poster's point that Einstein didn't write the equation as E=mc^2 but had the equivalent in the 1905 paper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People gave good answers, but I want to point out one more thing. As said &quot;special relativity&quot; means &quot;special case of General Relativity&quot;. In sciences (at least physics) the word &quot;General&quot; essentially means &quot;always true or applicable&quot;. This is different than the every day usage where it means &quot;usually&quot;. So I could tell you &quot;I generally have cereal for breakfast, but today I had eggs instead&quot;, but if I try to publish that statement in an academic paper, I'll get laughed at, because it's paradoxical (and also because researchers don't seem to care about my personal breakfast habits for some reason...).</p>
<p>So the &quot;General Theory of Relativity&quot; always works to solve problems of relative motion, but you can reduce complexity if you know there is no gravity and then use special relativity which is <em>much</em> more simple.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The energy is then the square root of this,  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>E = √(m^(2)c^(4)+p^(2)c^(2))</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we divide out the mass, we're left with a function that looks like,  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>f(x) = √(1+x^(2))</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where x = p/mc.... </p>
</blockquote>
<p>To make this step a bit clearer for those who had trouble following:    </p>
<ol>
<li>E = √(m^(2)c^(4)+p^(2)c^(2))  [then factor out m^(2)c^(4) from both terms under the radical sign; c^(2)  in the denominator of the second term is left after simplifying]  </li>
<li>E = √[m^(2)c^(<strong>4</strong>)(1+p^(2)/m^(2)c^(<strong>2</strong>))]  [then pull the factor out of the radical]  </li>
<li>E = [mc^(2)]√(1+p^(2)/m^(2)c^(2))  [then divide both sides by mc^(2)]  </li>
<li>E/mc^(2) = √(1+p^(2)/m^(2)c^(2))  </li>
<li>let x = p/mc, then E/mc^(2) = f(x) =  √(1+x^(2))  </li>
</ol>
<p>Later, when /u/AsAChemicalEngineer &quot;undid the substitution of x = p/mc&quot;, s/he also multiplied both sides of the equation by mc^(2) to get E on its own again.  The result shown in that line is after simplifying again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol, you wouldn't believe how much Taylor series are used in physics.  It's pretty common to see that approximate theories end up just being the first couple terms using the Taylor expansion of the actual solution around a quantity that's normally very small.</p></div>		</li>
