<p>Doesn't the double slit experiment show that photons do not simply travel in straight lines?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, but the difference is subtle. The double slit experiment shows that until the photon is measured, it has a probability distribution of positions and momentums, and thus when un-measured it will create interference patterns. But an uncertain momentum is not the same as a &quot;wiggling&quot; momentum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Light <em>does</em> move in straight lines, except for things like diffraction and momentum... I don't think photons are considered &quot;one model,&quot; they just have different degrees of freedom and what we think of as &quot;motion&quot; for light is difficult to pin down with any simple analogy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, this experiment backs up that photons only travel in straight lines. This experiment was to verify general relativity, which said that gravity bends space. So, since we know photons travel in straight lines, and they appeared to bend, we knew that the photons were traveling straight, and space itself was bent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, not doubting anything, but could one construct a system in which space is not bent and photons and gravity and such curve accordingly? Like a different frame of reference? Or would that take such hideously complex math that it's probably not that way? There would be no way to determine a &quot;true&quot; frame of reference, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to quantum electrodynamics (QED) the probability of measuring a photon at a certain point is determined by all possible paths to that point. In most cases all non-straight paths cancel each other and light does travel in a straight line.</p>
<p>However one can construct situations in which this is not the case: If you have a wall and make a little hole into it, the different paths do not cancel anymore once the hole is small enough. The light can travel in all directions after that hole and not in just one.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A properly-designed pinhole camera will have the light go (mostly) straight through the hole with as little diffraction as possible.</p></div>		</li>
