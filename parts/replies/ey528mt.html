			<div class="markdown"><p>It's much more efficient to make genetic changes in sperm/eggs and then let those be carried naturally into all or nearly all the cells of the adult vs. trying to engineer a trait into cells in an adult. However, it might be possible to make traits in adults via something like CRISPR if you can deliver it into enough cells. You might have to use a viral approach such that if you transduce say 20% of cells in a given tissue to try to make a trait change, then those cells would themselves make more of the same virus to infect their surrounding cells and so on. Or you could use something kind of like a gene drive but at the cellular level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's called germline editing and it's the most frightening use case of gene editing - the potential for misuse is sky-high. Hopefully there will be an international effort to ban or severely restrict it, like what was done with human cloning.</p></div>		</li>
