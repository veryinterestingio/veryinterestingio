			<div class="markdown"><p>In German it's similar, we also say &quot;Kalifornien&quot;. There used to be other names like &quot;Virginien&quot; or &quot;Neuyork&quot; or &quot;Süddakota&quot;, but that's fallen out of use. You sometimes stumble upon them in old movies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Süddakota&quot; lol; how was South Dakota important enough to swedish culture to have a name? Cali and New York I get, but SD? (no shade on SD people, but we all know what I mean)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Dakotas, Montana, and Idaho were largely settled by German and Scandinavian people during colonization. Even today those areas are hugely of scandinavian descent. Tons of blue-eyed platinum blondes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like other states have more subtle pronunciation differences, like Hawaii is pronounced &quot;Havaii&quot; and states like Alaska and Colorado are often pronounced with Swedish vowel sounds (compared to states like Indiana that are always pronounced the American way: &quot;Indiäna&quot;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Small correction. California is the only state with a swedified spelling, but there are others with Swedish pronunciations. Kansas is one that comes to mind. It should also be noted that some of the states has had swedified names that no uses anymore. Syddakota for South Dakota, it's even on the Swedish wiki pages as an alternative name for the state.</p></div>		</li>
