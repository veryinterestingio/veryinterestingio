			<div class="markdown"><p>Just speaking in general and not necessarily with human pandemics is it possible that a virus could effectively cause a species to go extinct, if it were virulent enough? </p>
<p>*RIP my inbox. Ok my question has been answered thanks to all the responders. If you want to further the discussion, I’d suggest you reply to one of the replies downthread.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very unlikely. Infectivity generally goes down as lethality goes up because dead hosts don't actively spread the contagion.</p>
<p>Probably the most dangerous disease to an entire species would be one that is highly infectuous with very mild symptoms that somehow causes sterility in the hosts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is the biggest flaw in the movie Contagion. it is often touted as the most accurate depiction of a real world pandemic, but in reality, the virus is far too deadly to have been able to spread the way it did in that film.</p>
<p>edit for clarity: the virus in the movie, killed people too quickly. <em>that</em> is the movies flaw.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This is not true in all cases -- it really depends on the method of transmission. Anything with a long latency period where it is contagious but not significantly symptomatic could spread readily regardless of whether it is lethal to almost all infected individuals. And there are many diseases that cross species boundaries (i.e. the disease is transmitted in one host that is not injured to another host that is killed), in which case something that is incredibly lethal incredibly quickly can <em>still</em> spread because it has a reservoir. Myxomatosis, which is an extremely lethal infectious disease of rabbits intentionally introduced for pest control in Australia, spreads through the bites of mosquitoes, fleas, and other insects. These insects don't care how rapidly the rabbit is killed by the disease - they can fly (or hop) to another rabbit and feed regardless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Possible? Yes.</p>
<p>Likely? No.</p>
<p>More likely: the disease causes a ripple effect that disrupts the species food chain, general immune system, or ability to procreate (behavioral or biological) and the species dies out due to the secondary effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking of diseases more broadly - we don't know whether they will actually cause extinction, but <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3427566/" target="_blank">there are two diseases in Australia right now that pose a significant existential threat to Tasmanian devils and certain species of amphibians.</a> Koalas are dying off as the result of chlamydia infections. There is &quot;good evidence that avian malaria and birdpox were responsible for the extinction of a substantial proportion of the Hawaiian avifauna in the late nineteenth century&quot; (ibid.). </p>
<p>In general, a virus or other disease doesn't need to kill <em>all</em> individuals of a species, just enough to make its continued existence nonviable. Maybe that's because of group fragmentation (individuals can no longer find mates) or reduced genetic diversity (inbreeding catastrophe) or there are no longer enough individuals to survive the other &quot;routine&quot; causes of death.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This leaves off the fact that herd immunity doesn't mean the disease goes away. Smallpox killed huge numbers (millions each year in the 1900s) over the course of centuries, and was only eradicated because we developed effective vaccines</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. I know the covid hasn't been killing children, although that weird inflammatory condition seems to be related. But imagine a scenario where kids could die. Even if every person on the planet was immune from prior exposure, the disease would still circulate, and could infect &quot;new people&quot;, i.e. babies, that don't have immunity yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Smallpox is a almost a special case. Smallpox along with whooping cough and a few others have R0 of over 15. The immune fraction of population required for herd immunity is 1 - 1/R0,
so for these super infectious diseases, you need 95%+ of the population to be immune. This just wasn’t feasible without a vaccine apparently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people got it and then developed immunity, which led to semi-herd immunity. It took a while though, and really many people died. More than in the World War I that raged then. </p>
<p>And then, well, the flu virus changes rapidly every year so the next one that emerged was less deadly.</p></div>		</li>
