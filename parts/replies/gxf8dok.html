			<div class="markdown"><p>For those curious what led to the advent of standardized frame rates - it was the addition of sound to the film in 1927. There were actually phonographic soundtracks to some movies before that time, but adding a sound track to the actual film itself led to the need for a consistent frame speed.</p></div>		</li>
