<blockquote>
<p>Blue whales are still around and are pretty big.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I want to emphasise this point of yours, seeing as they are the biggest animal that we know of to have ever existed. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>There were quite a few big animals that went extinct only recently, likely due to human intervention (we either ate them or their food source) Wolly Mammoth is as big as a T-Rex.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I want to emphasise this point too, because people often lump dinosaurs in with everything prehistoric and get confused that way. There were hundreds of millions of years of animals before the dinosaurs existed, and a good 66 million years since they existed. </p>
<p>Other than the woolly mammoth, more examples of crazy big megafauna that existed since the dinosaurs include the giant coal turtle <em>Carbonemys</em> and giant snake <em>Titanoboa</em> (60-58 million years ago), ‘terror birds’ (62-2 million years ago), the giant ground sloth <em>Megatherium</em> (5 million years ago to 10,000 years ago), the giant armadillo <em>Glyptodon</em> (2.5 million years ago to 11,000 years ago), and the giant shark <em>Megalodon</em> (23-3.6 million years ago). I encourage anyone reading to look up fossils and artistic reconstructions of those, preferably with something in the pics for scale!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dinos were around for quite a while, lots of races came and went. It wasn't just one 'period'. As such you can pick the biggest and meanest of them even if they didn't live around the same time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is such an important point too. Such a hugely diverse variety of species which filled many ecological niches in many different environments, from deserts to jungles to temperate forests to swamps and marshland. There were even dinosaurs in forests in Antarctica and up in the Arctic during the Cretaceous. Along with diversity in habitat and diet and all that, came diversity in size. <em>Many dinosaurs were very small</em>, something that people tend to forget.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The interesting bit is, there could have be marine prehistoric life-forms so gigantic in the deeps, we might get mind-blown one day, when we can find some fossils.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: now that you’ve clarified you’re talking about fossils or extinct animals that’s much more likely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Possible yes, but they would either have to be soft bodied, so that we don’t find their fossils despite finding fossil evidence of other large deep sea beasties... or limited to areas we have simply not explored at all. I guess current resolution levels of ocean exploration certainly permits that, but it’s not just about finding the organism itself. </p>
<p>To exist at the highest trophic levels means that we are likely to see indicators that lower trophic levels are being preyed upon, or that there are interactions occurring (and we don’t necessarily know who is the predator and who is the prey). For instance, we knew that giant squid existed long before any recoveries of their bodies because of sucker marks and lacerations on sperm whale skin. People speculated that giant squid ate small sperm whales for a bit, but it’s now pretty much universally accepted that sperm whales include giant squid in their diet. We also knew about megalodon before any recovery of their skeletons, due to finding their fossilised teeth and matching them up to puncture marks and wounds on whale fossils. </p>
<p>We can’t rule out the existence of bigger things in the geologic past than we already know about, but it is a window of possibility which gets gradually slightly smaller as we interrogate the fossil record more and more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something else to keep in mind is that the fossil record is naturally biased towards bigger organisms. Think about it, which one is more likely to be preserved, the fragile bones of a mouse or the strong bones of an elephant? Bones are subject to being carried away by water, moved by other animals, being crushed by earth, and other processes. Now ask yourself which one is easier to find, a little mouse on a field or a big elephant on the same field? It's easier to find something big. The fossil record is heavily skewed towards big organisms because there's filters that make it easier to find them, compared to smaller organisms.</p>
<p>Something else to consider is that the media and the public give more attention to bigger findings. Showing off the <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QyygIrYecgE/maxresdefault.jpg" target="_blank">skeleton of a blue whale</a> on your museum exhibit is more awe inspiring than showing off a rock with microfossil that can't be seen with the naked eye.</p>
<p>Yeah, past ages had bigger animals, but they weren't the norm. They're more likely to be preserved on the fossil record, it's more likely to find them, and they're more flashy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also assuming that all the big things have bones is another huge bias. I mean, we're still trying to estimate the size of Megalodon and that dude lived &quot;yesterday&quot; in geological terms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely true! I said bones because that's what people usually think about when they hear &quot;fossil&quot;. But, yeah, fossil is any type of evidence of past life, from hard tissue to soft tissue and even non-body structures, like footprints or nests.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With regards to whales, I believe they grew as they evolved when the first whale ancestors entered the water, then many stayed at similar sizes for a long while, then some more grew larger when <em>Megalodon</em> went extinct. </p>
<p>There are many examples of size evolution in both directions, it can go either way really. Another well documented example of a mammal evolving to be bigger is the horse, which cane from small, dog-sized ancestor. </p>
<p>There’s even some scientists who say that the general rule is that <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2015/02/19/body-size-evolution-021915/" target="_blank">animals tend to evolve to be bigger over time</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stupid stupid stupid question here.... How do we know Megalodon has gone extinct? I mean, we haven't seen a living example, but aren't we only aware of like, 2% of earth's oceans and the rest is basically unobserved and completely unknown?</p></div>		</li>

<p>A real documentary, or a Youtube &quot;documentary&quot;?</p>
<p>Whales are in <em>no way</em> &quot;one of the few&quot; species that evolved to be bigger. There's even <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2015/02/19/body-size-evolution-021915/" target="_blank">a general trend for most animals to evolve to larger sizes</a>, often given the name <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cope's_rule" target="_blank">&quot;Cope's Rule&quot;</a>.</p>
<p>The original mammals were tiny creatures the size of shrews, so there are literally hundreds of species of mammals that evolved to be bigger, including apes. And that includes us: we're bigger than some of our ancestors, such as <em>Australopithecus</em> (about 4-5 feet tall on average).</p>
<p>The classic dinosaurs themselves also evolved from smaller dinosaurs. Most dinosaurs were small: if you want to imagine the typical dinosaur, don't think of T Rex or sauropods or triceratops, think of things about the size of a chicken.</p>
<p>Triceratops itself, a rather large dinosaur (up to 9 metres, or 30 feet long, and weighing up to 12 tonnes, making it about 5-6 times the size of rhinoceros), possibly evolved from Protoceratops, which was about the size of a sheep.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that <em>most</em> animal species evolve to be bigger. Whales are unusual only because the blue whale happens to be the largest animal know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hell; even humans tend to evolve taller.</p>
<p>I'm taller than either of my parents by a few inches. My dad is taller than his dad, and my mom is taller than her mom. Every subsequent generation in my family tree for the last hundred years has been a smidgen taller than the prior, and while it could be a localized thing caused by my family members being attracted to other taller-than-average people, I don't know of any of my peers that didn't meet or surpass the height of their same-sex parent.</p>
<p>In every country on earth, the average height is increasing. In every state in the US, the average height is increasing. And perhaps a portion is due to better nutritional uptake, but to look to western and northern European countries that haven't had a dramatic shift in health since the end of WWII, they follow the height trend even better.</p></div>		</li>
