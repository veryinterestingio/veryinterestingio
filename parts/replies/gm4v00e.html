			<div class="markdown"><p>Replying to both of you:</p>
<p>One thing is that we should include presymptomatic with asympomatic in the question. Presymptomatic being someone who is/was infected with SARS-CoV-2, but prior to symptom onset. A truly asymptomatic infection would never develop symptoms during the course of that infection. While these are technically two different things, with potentially different courses of viral load, I believe it necessary to include both if we are to assess the transmission risk of a person who is not <em>currently</em> symptomatic. The only thing I can say confidently is that presymptomatic &amp; asympomatic people do have viral replication happening in their bodies. If that replication is in the upper respiratory airways (and perhaps lower respiratory), which appears to be the vast, vast majority of cases, then they should be able to transmit. I would suggest that the question is not 'can they transmit' but 'to what degree do they transmit'.</p>
<p>Best I can find is this <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4851" target="_blank">BMJ article</a>, but you will need to read it to get the full picture. The article references a lot of studies in order to try to get to the bottom of this question. I think it is worth noting that not all of the cited studies were testing exactly the same thing or using exactly the same methodology, so we can't really get a perfect idea from this article. Think of it as a summarized best-guess.</p>
<p>The other question was about fomite transmission (surfaces). Pretty much every study I'm aware of suggests that the risk of infection from surfaces is low. It is important to note that low /=no risk, so washing hands as well as suspected contaminated surfaces is still wise. Not touching your face is also a good practice. These things help prevent lots of other infections too, so it is a good habit regardless of the current pandemic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your answer.  So if an asymptomatic person transmits the virus it just depends on the person who contracts it as to their severity of symptoms?  Or is it the viral load count that makes for a more severe case?  It seems like an asymptomatic person would have to test at a nearly impossible rate to see if they ever got it, unless they knew they were exposed by a family member and went just cause.  Seems like taking the vaccine too soon after a case could also be not recommended due to insufficient build up of natural antibodies and potential relapse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can’t quote specific studies but I don’t think anyone proved asymptomatics don’t transmit it so it’s fair to assume they do, given the numbers we see all around the globe and the knowledge we have from other respiratory diseases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems crazy that we couldn’t have proof of that yet. You’d think one elderly person who doesn’t leave the house and has a sole caregiver/relative living with them would’ve contracted the disease by now with no symptoms having been present for said caregiver/relative.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s hard to track that even if you have that scenario. Even the concept of asymptomatic is a bit hard to nail down because some people aren’t really assymptomatic, they just don’t report the symptoms because they are very light or don’t associate it with the disease. I’ve seen some studies where they really try to pinpoint the asymptomatics and it turns out they have symptoms, just very mild ones or things they associate with other pathologies they frequently have. </p>
<p>But no, I don’t think we have “certainties” in that regard</p></div>		</li>
