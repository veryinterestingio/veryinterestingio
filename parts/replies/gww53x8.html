			<div class="markdown"><p>Out of curiosity what is an &quot;overuse&quot; of aspirin. Are we talking chugging a bottle a day levels of overuse, or are we talking like a single pill a week for 4 years straight could do it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first would be an overdose, but I'll try to explain it. edit: I said overuse initially but its really 'chronic use' that's the more correct term. </p>
<p>NSAIDs and aspirin works because there's two enzymes called COX-1 and COX-2. I won't go into detail but basically COX-2 is involved in inflammation and some other stuff while COX-1 is important does a bunch of important regulatory stuff in your body. One of the functions is it promotes the production of that mucus lining in your stomach. NSAIDs (Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory drugs) like ibuprofen and aspirin block COX-1 and COX-2. So you get less inflammation but it also means you also don't get that COX-1 effect of keeping your stomach lining intact.</p>
<p>When you use these drugs over a long time, eventually the repeated thin areas of lining can get eaten away by the acid and cause an ulcer. One pill a week for 4 years might not do it, but you <em>generally</em> don't want to be taking these things long term without medical supervision and keeping an eye on things.</p>
<p>Drugs that only block COX-2 exist, but they also increase your risk of heart attacks and strokes. So if you choose between your brain/heart and your stomach, the former is more important. The reason why (iirc) NSAIDs and aspirin doesn't also increase your risk (because it also blocks COX-2) is because the substrate (molecule) can either be processed by COX-1 or COX-2. If you block both, its all good. If you block COX-2, everything goes down COX-1 which also causes platelets to stick together and cause thrombi ('clots') to form.</p>
<hr />
<p>This isn't a substitute for medical advice, its definitely a discussion to be had with your doctor about the right balance if you're on one of these drugs and it would've come up in the initial discussion when the plan was put in place to start an NSAID or aspirin long term.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay so. i was in pain. Because it was on my right side/chest, I assumed it was shoulder pain. So I took more ibuprofen for it. But it kept getting worse. So I took even more for it. It eventually got so bad that i had to lay down for a lot of the day, to stop the agony. And I took more ibuprofen.</p>
<p>So one day I can't stand up. too dizzy. not that I'd want to try, because Id throw up if I did. Apparently I became unresponsive on the way to the hospital. My hemoglobin level had fallen to like 5 g/dl which is really bad. massive peptic ulcer.</p>
<p>it was only weeks later when I noticed the pain in my 'shoulder' was gone that I figured out what had happened. If i had known pain from my stomach could be referred to the other side of my body, I'd have seen a doctor before it got anywhere near that bad.</p>
<p>So yeah. Be careful with the stuff XD</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My friend takes two ibuprofen every morning and drinks a shit ton of energy drinks. He went to hospital last week with stomach pains and he is coming up with excuses like chrohns disease. I tried telling him it’s the ibu and drinks but he’s not having it! Reading what you just put explains a lot. Do energy drinks cause the same issues as ibuprofen?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Caffeine is known to be a stomach irritant. It's also a bladder irritant.</p>
<p>And if your friend DID have crohns then energy drinks would still be a terrrrrible idea. Here's hoping the doctors have told him off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a sub-thread with the explanation with why ibuprofen causes ulcers. I don't think there's any solid evidence that suggests that energy drinks cause ulcers but they can give you reflux.</p>
<p>Crohn's is pretty serious and it could be Crohn's causing him stomach pains but he might not actually have an ulcer. Hard to tell without more info</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm prescribed a 325 mg tablet of aspirin a day I've taking for years, I had a blood clot at a young age and instead of putting me on blood thinners yet they put me on a full dose of aspirin used as a blood thinner.They've never mentioned chronic use of aspirin and what it could do to my tummy. Interesting</p></div>		</li>
