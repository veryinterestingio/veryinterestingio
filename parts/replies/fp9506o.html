			<div class="markdown"><p>So let us assume I want to eat raw cookie dough in an ungodly amount. I assume one could simply bake the flour before hand, at 180c (high enough right?) for several minutes. Would this affect the taste or consistency of the cookie dough?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can also bake the raw cookie dough itself. Usually it's best to drop spoonfuls onto a pan with space between them for even heat distribution. 180°C/356°F for 10-12 minutes should do the trick.</p>
<p>This method will affect the consistency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can both pre-bake the flour to sterilize it (spread it out on a pan, 350F for 5 minutes), and pasteurize the eggs.  If you have a sous vide machine, 135F for 1:15 will pasteurize eggs without cooking them, so they can be safely used in recipes that include uncooked egg. </p>
<p>The flour's flavor will change, but you may actually prefer it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the quick and helpful response. I am tempted to try it. I am practicing my cookie baking skills at the moment; would gently roasting the flour before hand result in a more interesting taste for a cookie? I wonder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can also buy pasteurized eggs at the grocery stores in the US. They usually come in a half dozen which is why everyone ignores them and nobody notices that they are widely available. Those are pressure pasteurized I believe.</p></div>		</li>
