			<div class="markdown"><p>Once again, a plausible theory but a counter argument would be how the body reacts to painful stimuli differently given different conditions. Just like how athletes play through sprains and fractures, without being bothered by pain only long after a match. This is due to adrenaline and perhaps the brain being too focused on one task that it sets aside these normally painful stimuli and ignores them until later on, when it has already dealt with the task. it's possible microtears could be present hours or days before the onset of pain related to it.</p></div>		</li>
