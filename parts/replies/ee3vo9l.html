			<div class="markdown"><p><em>Every</em> ELI5 about banking or payments reveals that the US is still stuck in the 80s. That's why there's all these &quot;exciting&quot; banking start-ups that are basically just doing what first direct etc were doing 25 years ago but with an app - they are basically remaking the wheel because the banks won't catch up.</p>
<p>It's super weird to us foreigners because normally america is perceived as ahead on lots of things and it's seen as the home of technical consumer innovation (and it's where credit cards are from!)</p>
<p>I remember being amazed how many americans are paid by cheque! It is pretty rare here to not be paid directly into your account unless you're doing some low-skilled temp work</p>
<p>edit: to make it clearer I'm talking about perceptions</p></div>		</li>

I was like no, he‘s not an idiot, he’s probably just a 20 year old European kid who’s never seen a check in his life it’s so antiquated in his home country.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My parents received a check (Europe) a couple years ago, and it was a major hassle getting it deposited. It took weeks finding a bank that accepted it and was open after their working hours.</p>
<p>Edit: many has made me aware that there is apps that can take a picture of the check, as a hybrid analog/digital solution. Unfortunately, I think if the banks here would have a feature like that, my parents would for sure not be able to use it, haha. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, the UK was actually going to genuinely ban/remove the ability to use cheques in 2018 until a public uproar got it delayed a bit.</p>
<p>but really, the uproar is one of those things where if they just forced it through, a year later people would say 'what cheques'?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I emigrated from the UK to the US nearly a couple of years now. My first pay cheque was indeed a cheque and I couldn’t believe it as I hadn’t seen one in about 15 years.</p>
<p>Thing is, in the US if it’s not going to make money it isn’t going to get done. Like we still have to sign card transactions here, where as back home the government essentially made it law by saying if a shop accepted a signature and it was fraud, they had to pay the costs of it.</p>
<p>There are also only about 5 banks back home
compared to the hundreds in the US, makes it very easy to standardise processes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AFAIK the only places still giving cheques in the UK are auction houses, tax rebates and lottery wins over £500.</p>
<p>This is mainly because the three day wait allows them to stop a cheque if, for example, the documentation on the product you sold through the auction house turned out to be falsified.</p></div>		</li>

<p>also to be fair they were very quick to take up contactless, even if the solution in the US is more fragmented. </p></div>		</li>
