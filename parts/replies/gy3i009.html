			<div class="markdown"><p>Once when I was at the optometrist, they were not able to get an accurate reading from the puff machine. They had to numb my eyes and check the pressure using a little device that pushes on your eyeball. Did you know that your eye can feel when you blink, but your brain basically ignores it? My brain certainly certainly noticed that my eyes could not feel me blinking. It was a really weird sensation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are so many things your brain ignores.  There’s a thing called “saccadic masking” where you will just ignore the fraction of a second while your eye is flicking to look at some new object, because the visual info is blurred and useless, but your brain fills in the time gap so you don’t notice.</p></div>		</li>

The effects can be felt if a tablet is missed as little as twelve hours later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a doctor use the device that touches your eye, but he didn’t tell me beforehand that it was supposed to do that. I also didn’t have my eyes numbed, so I when this thing touched my eye I thought he had done it on accident and I jumped back about five feet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had that done with the pen thing? exactly once. And the woman that was doing it had like, 3 inch long nails. She yelled at me for flinching before she could touch the eye. Sorry lady, you and your talons are coming straight toward my eyeball and I have a history in your office of blinking when they give me numbing drops anyway. Chill out.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some doctor offices and cooking schools won't allow their employees/students to even have polish on. Why are you allowed to have literal claws when your hands are getting near peoples' eyes? But no, my flinching during a new procedure is the issue here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had this non-invasive thing about two months ago. </p>
<p>It was terrifying in its own way because I kept bracing myself for the air. I kept thinking, they’ll do it after this or this or this. It never came. Eventually I asked if they were going to do the air puff, and he explained they had already gathered the measurements 15 minutes prior. </p>
<p>The waiting for it around every corner was like a Halloween haunted house. Just constantly waiting for the air puff to chase me with a chainsaw out the door.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been going to my current optimotrist for a few years now. They've never done the puff test and I even confirmed my first visit they don't use that machine (they do the numbing eye method, which I find to be better). Despite this, I always ask and brace for impact for the first machine they use which gets a rough estimate of your eye focus. I'm always bracing and ready for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is how I got my brain tumour diagnosis. I had a pressure in the back of my eyes and this was the test that found it.
Thank you for explaining it because I had no idea what it did but it saved my life.</p></div>		</li>
