<p>At night, heat loss by radiation to the vault of the sky. No clouds, so the heat goes straight into space.</p>
<p>>parked car in summer: the hot air can't escape, so it gets unbearable hot.</p>
<p>High emissivity &amp; absorption factor for metal surfaces, as well, it absorbs a lot of the incident radiation from the sun. Solar thermal panels are metal sheets with water cooling channels and insulation to stop heat loss to the adjacent structure. If you leave them in the sun, before the water is connected, they can get upwards of 300 degC.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>wrong answer, high-altitude plains are colder than low-altitude plains, at identical heights above local ground level. it's solely the effect of the lower pressure.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Examples?
It's probably that the warm air rises and is replaced by cold air from the surroundings. At ground level, the incoming horizontal air has been in close contact with the ground, has been warmed up and so the air temperature is higher. For high altitude plains it is incoming cold high-altitude air, so the ambient air temperature is lower. </p>
<p>It has very little to do with the pressure difference, it's just the energy balance, energy in minus energy out. The expansion only produces a significant cooling effect when there are compressors involved, i.e., expand from 6 bar to 1 bar, say.</p></div>		</li>
