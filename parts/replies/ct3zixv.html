			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to the tragedy of errors, they used a real gun rather than a prop. A lot of times the guns in movies and in television are just convincing looking (or not so convincing looking if it is a background character who is too far away to be seen clearly) fakes. </p>
<p>For The Crow, however, there was a crucial scene that took place at a pawn shop. The production company bought up the stock from a real pawn shop to make it look more authentic. In that collection were real guns. One of those was used as the &quot;prop&quot; for the scene. </p>
<p>Oh! By the way, just as a reminder - Brandon Lee wasn't even the first time a real gun used as a prop killed an actor.</p>
<p>In the 1980s Jon-Erik Hexum was a rising star. He was the star of the show <em>Voyagers</em> (a time travel show to teach kids history) and just started working on a show called <em>Cover Up</em> where he played a Green Beret turned fashion model (the 80s were a different time).  Production was delayed and he got bored and frustrated. He picked up a real .44 Magnum loaded with blanks and jokingly &quot;shot himself in the head.&quot;</p>
<p>He apparently didn't know that blanks do something more than make a loud noise. The explosion punched a hole in his skull and he died a few hours later.</p>
<p>So . . .  yeah. People unfamiliar with guns should not play with them like they are toys.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First of all, Voyagers was fucking GREAT. And the tragedy of Jon-Erik Hexum is something that nobody remembers, probably because his dad wasn't Bruce Lee. I've remembered this story forever because I couldn't understand how it happened, how someone could shoot off his head with &quot;blanks.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I asked my father that same question. He was a former marine. I don't know if this is true, but it is what he told me.</p>
<p>The cartridge uses plastic or paper as wadding to hold the gunpowder in place. When the blank is fired the wadding gets propelled out of the muzzle. This wadding normally isn't that dangerous as it is small and doesn't go very far. But when the target is right there pressed right to the end of the muzzle it hits almost as hard as a real bullet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's exactly right, but what baffles me is this (perhaps it's because I'm European) : if I were an actor and involved in any scene with an actual gun, there is no way in hell that I would allow it to proceed without 1) personally checking the gun, and 2) having had a credible expert explain to me what safety measures are being taken.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of actors probably don't even put much thought into how prop guns work. It's all make believe to them unless they are trained properly. Before Brandon, the expense of training actors in the intricacies of firearms props was most likely seen as a corner that could be cut, especially if they didn't even feel the need to have the firearms expert on set. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's easy to say that, but when you're actually in the thick of it, it may not occur to you.  Or you may not want to speak up.  Especially since gun accidents are incredibly rare on movie sets.  Helicopters and automobiles kill way more people working on movies.  </p>
<p>&quot;The Crow&quot; was the first real shot Brandon Lee had at making the big time.  He wanted the movie to succeed.  If I knew the movie was over time, and over budget, and I'm in the middle of a two-week stretch working 12-18 hour days, I'd quite probably be focusing on my job more than other people's.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I still don't get why a real gun was on a set though. Every prop gun I have ever handled could not fire anything period. The barrel is always sealed, so even if a live round somehow got in it, it would blow up in your hand before anything could ever go down the barrel. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say they were trying to save a few bucks and just borrowed a gun from whoever rather than going through the proper channels to get a prop gun. I realize this would only save literally a few dollars, but that interview makes it seem that way.</p></div>		</li>
