			<div class="markdown"><p>Because of coronavirus, consumers aren’t using coins as much as they used to (instead using credit remotely more than average). The system depends on a constant exchange to maintain proper proportions of all the denominations. So vendors are the ones lacking coins while consumers are sitting on whatever they happen to have. Vendors are still doing (less) business in person such that they need change, but the lack of <em>exchange</em> of coins has ruined those proportions</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's <em>because</em> nobody's using them. If they're not being used, they're not in circulation and they're just accumulating somewhere (as someone else said, change jars). Currency, and money in general, is only useful when it's in motion. Moving money is what drives economies, storing money does nothing. It's like a water wheel, if the water is stagnant, the wheel doesn't turn.</p>
<p>This is why giving tax breaks and economic stimulus to people (and small businesses) who don't have much to begin with does so much more than giving them to the wealthy. They'll spend it much more readily, while the wealthy, who already have plenty, will just store it away. </p>
<p>A piece of advice the wealthy always try to give is to only spend what you don't save, rather than save what you don't spend. Good advice, in theory, but that doesn't work if you can barely live on your entire income.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So to my knowledge a good chunk of the US seems to be lacking tap options on their credit and debit cards, and only recently seen wider adoption of chip technology, both of these things have been almost universal in Canada (where im from) and other countries, as well as relying on apps and services like venmo in order to send money peer to peer when again in Canada our banking apps allow us to do this free of charge for the most part</p></div>		</li>
