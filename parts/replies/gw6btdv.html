			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard that the reason base 12 is also fairly common historically is that we have 12 finger joints (plus the thumb) so the base 12 cultures were probably also counting on their fingers, just in a somewhat different way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its also easier to divide 12 into other whole numbers. A lot of math around base 12 is a lot more intuitive because in general there is no need to decimalize.  (not that it won't occur)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh. I never thought about it but Is ‘decimalize’ still the right word for base 12, or any base not 10? </p>
<p>Since deci refers to 10 I believe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always thought a base of 8 made the most sense. It's a natural progression of doubling 1 (2,4,8) so you can easily keep dividing by 2</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, if you look at the joint lines on your fingers you have 3 distinct segments per finger.  It makes halving and quarters much easier to do quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also with different base systems, no matter which one us use, they will have an equivalent value in a different base. So even though 1000 in base 12 is 1728 in base 10. They still represent the same value.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Incorrect. Celsius to Farenheight is an addition, multiplied by a factor (C*1.8)+32=F or (F-32)*1.8 = C</p>
<p>Thus, two times C converted to F and four times C converted to F does not have the same relationship as doubling C and doubling F.</p>
<p>Example: 20C = 68F, double it, 40C = 104F</p></div>		</li>
