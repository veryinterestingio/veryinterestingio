<p>Having a lot of fatty foods in your stomach can slow down this process considerably because of the hydrophobic property of fat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As in the water would float? I also have a few follow-up questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is stomach acid readily soluble in the water?</li>
<li>When you drink a lot of water (or eat a lot of food) how does your stomach know how much stomach acid to generate (and when to stop generating it)?</li>
<li>If you have a full meal, and let's say an hour later you eat a little more when there's still food in your stomach from your last meal, what happens then? Does your body stop passing food to the small intestines when you start eating and the food that was already digested enough stay there until the rest is too? Or do you still start passing food to the small intestines and some just enters as a more &quot;raw&quot; state than the stuff that passes through at a later time?</li>

<ol>
<li>Acids are very polar (or water) soluble. One definition of an acid is the dissociation of the hydrogen ion (hence the term power of Hydrogen, pH) from the rest of the acid molecule, called the conjugate base. Ions are quite &quot;electrically charged&quot; which makes them more soluble in polar liquids, like water. </li>
<li>Your gut contains an incredible number of neurons, many of which are sensory. Just like you can sense your skin being stretched, similar nerve endings in you stomach can sense being full and react accordingly. This includes stomach acid production and release of the appetite/satiety hormones ghrelin and leptin. Your gut also have chemoreceptors that can get (kinda) a sense of food composition and if it detects fats, slows gastric motility to give you more time to digest.</li>
<li>Which brings me here, your stomach can (kinda) sense a change in chemical composition of &quot;raw&quot; food entering and your stomach expanding once again, and will once again slow gastric motility to give you more time. Once again, the process is not exact but gives you a sense of how it works.</li>

<p>Does the hardness of water have any effect on the solubility of acid and/or the time taken for water to pass through the digestive system?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gastric acid production is regulated by both the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomic_nervous_system" target="_blank">autonomic nervous system</a> and several <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone" target="_blank">hormones</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasympathetic_nervous_system" target="_blank">parasympathetic nervous system</a>, via the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagus_nerve" target="_blank">vagus nerve</a>, and the hormone <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrin" target="_blank">gastrin</a> stimulate the parietal cell to produce gastric acid, both directly acting on parietal cells and indirectly, through the stimulation of the secretion of the hormone <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histamine" target="_blank">histamine</a> from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterochromaffine-like_cell" target="_blank">enterochromaffine-like cells</a> (ECL). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasoactive_intestinal_peptide" target="_blank">Vasoactive intestinal peptide</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystokinin" target="_blank">cholecystokinin</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretin" target="_blank">secretin</a> all inhibit production.</p>
<p>The production of gastric acid in the stomach is tightly regulated by positive regulators and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_feedback" target="_blank">negative feedback</a> mechanisms. Four types of cells are involved in this process: parietal cells, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_cell" target="_blank">G cells</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_cell_(biology)" target="_blank">D cells</a> and enterochromaffine-like cells. Besides this, the endings of the vagus nerve (CN X) and the intramural nervous plexus in the digestive tract influence the secretion significantly.</p>
<p>Nerve endings in the stomach secrete two stimulatory <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter" target="_blank">neurotransmitters</a>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcholine" target="_blank">acetylcholine</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrin-releasing_peptide" target="_blank">gastrin-releasing peptide</a>. Their action is both direct on parietal cells and mediated through the secretion of gastrin from G cells and histamine from enterochromaffine-like cells. Gastrin acts on parietal cells directly and indirectly too, by stimulating the release of histamine.</p>
<p>The release of histamine is the most important positive regulation mechanism of the secretion of gastric acid in the stomach. Its release is stimulated by gastrin and acetylcholine and inhibited by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatostatin" target="_blank">somatostatin</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd just like to note that while there is no consensus amongst chemistry historians, it does seem (at least to me) like the p in pH does not stand for &quot;power of&quot;, or potenz, or anything related, and more likely is just the result of the labelling of the experiment S.S. was performing. The hydrogen electrode being labelled p, and the calomel electrode being labelled q. In fact, if you read his actual study (it's in German), you see that he seems to have considered pH as a single thing. It isn't p and H, it's just pH.</p>
<p>In fact, he literally says in that study (translated with Google Translate, transcribed by me, page 159-160)</p>
<p>&quot;For the number p I suggest the name &quot;hydrogen ion exponent&quot; and the notation pH. The hydrogen ion exponent (pH) of a solution is then understood to be the Brigg's logarithm of the reciprocal value of the normality factor of the solution related to hydrogen ions.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fur die Zahl p schlage ich den namen &quot;Wasserstoffionenexponent&quot; und die Schreibweise pH vor. Unter dem Wasserstoffionenexponenten (pH) einer Losung wird dan der Briggsche Logarithmus des reziproken Wertes des auf Wasserstoffionen bezogenen Normalitatsfaktors der Losung verstanden.&quot;</p>
<p>The pH in the document is a lowercase p, and a subscript capital H, with a dot or something beside it.</p>
<p>S.S. Paper: <a href="http://publikationen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/files/17417/E001399646.pdf" target="_blank">http://publikationen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/files/17417/E001399646.pdf</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1) Stomach acid is itself already already dissolved in water when produced; it's primarily hydrochloric acid which is an aqueous solution of HCl.</p>
<p>2) There are several mechanisms which control production of stomach acid. It starts with sensory input (smelling, tasting, even seeing food) which gets the process going. Gastric distention (having a full, stretched stomach) keeps the production of acid going.</p>
<p>3) There are different regions even within the stomach, and the food passes through the regions and then eventually exits into the duodenum as chyme. Liquids will transit the stomach more quickly while solids will take longer as they're moved along by peristalsis, allowing more time for them to be broken down.</p>
<p>One thing to note is that while stomach acid is a critical component of the digestive process in your stomach, much of the actual digestion is done by enzymes rather than the acid itself. Pepsin is one of the big ones, and is responsible for breaking down proteins. It's produced as pepsinogen and then turns into the active form pepsin once it combines with HCl.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For a brief moment, I thought I thought I was about to learn we had extra senses within the stomach itself!!!<br />
That was exciting.</p></div>		</li>

<li>
<p>Yes. Stomach acid is hydrochloric acid which is absolutely soluble. All acids are, by definition, soluble in water. Technically acids work by dissociating and increasing the hydrogen concentration in an aqueous (water) solution. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More than just adding more food to the stomach, the very act of thinking about food, chewing, and the expansion of the stomach and changes of stomach acidity will all trigger hormone release that will cause gastric cells to increase stomach acid with hydrogen\potassium pumps.  This shuts off when appetite is suppressed, this also controlled hormonally, but hunger is as much a psychological state as a physical one. </p>
</li>
<li>The presence of amino acids, certain proteins, and the stomach acidity play a role in triggering the pyloric sphincter to open and for chyme to move into the duodenum - so food being moved into the small intestine somewhat depends on it being digested.</li>

<p>Not really. Very long chain fatty acids are generally insoluble in water, for example.</p></div>		</li>
