			<div class="markdown"><p>And that same bell curve even applies to top level athletes when it comes down to how long their career can last before injuries or wear and tear start to add up.  You look at someone like Kobe Bryant, who spent around 14 years as a dominant player before his injury-plagued years where he suffered a lot of joint and tendon damage, or Kevin Garnett, whose 21-year career was only plagued by a handful of injuries that took him out for extended periods - those guys are the top end of the bell curve, lasting long past most of their contemporaries.</p>
<p>And then you look at someone like Greg Oden, who won just about every award as a freshman in college, and was then drafted first overall in the 2007 NBA draft (ahead of Kevin Durant!).  And his career was tragically short and plagued by injuries, mostly due to a bad knee.  He's considered one of the most disappointing first draft picks of all time, mostly because he happened to fall at the low end of that curve, where his joints just couldn't hold up through years of strain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's crazy to think Marleau started playing hockey when I was in kindergarten, and now nearly 10 years removed from graduating college and the madlad is still playing in the NHL. To say nothing of Jagr who is still playing professionally in the Czech Liiga at nearly 50...I'm gonna go and get another helping of mac and cheese now...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to this, pretty much every top level athlete will have a designated team of people trained in looking after their bodies. Detailed training plans with rest days, dieticians, physio etc. The average person has none of these luxuries</p></div>		</li>

<p>I mean sure, they are in peak physical condition, but that doesn't really mean it's healthy, especially in long term.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. I was playing top level women's football and the same year got told my joints were all fucked and I need to stop playing. People still look at me and assume I'm healthy and not in pain because I'm a young, slim woman who has a gym membership. (Which I use for my physiotherapy exercises)!</p>
<p>In fact I was misdiagnosed with fibromyalgia before they actually discovered all my degenerative joints because even doctors often don't take young women seriously when they are in pain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same goes for weight. </p>
<p>While it's true you can be hulked out and &quot;technically obese&quot; by BMI, despite being ripped, <em>it's still bad for you</em> to be that big. A dude who is 300lb and all muscle is still damaging his body simply by being that heavy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Case in point, CTE amongst athletes experiencing regular impacts, notably American football. Joints is another huge one, and why I would never want my children to do acrobatics for example. </p>
<p>I'm not sure if swimming has any long-term issues except for asthma and hamstrings if you do breaststroke, but that one is an exception due to water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re precisely spot on. I was an athlete. Multi sports, professionally in extreme sports. I’ve had a ton of injuries and quite a few surgeries. Luckily my bone density is off the charts, but my connective tissue is not good. In my 40’s and already have arthritis in most joints on top of it all. I used to joke that I was sponsored by Motrin. Thankfully I never used more than prescribed Vicodin and didn’t abuse it like so many slip into. My take was/is living with the pain is much better than any chance of pain killer issues. Funny side note: I had the same surgeon for a few ops &amp; he would say the same thing right before they’d put me under, “your muscles only have so many contractions in their life. You might want to save a few”. I’ve blown both knees twice, both elbows, both shoulders, tore my abdomen in 13 places, ski pole in my r kidney, and more. The mental side of not being able to do all the cool shit you used to is the hardest part. Everything hurts &amp; is a constant reminder. Seeing the progression in extreme sports makes me think how much worse these people will have it. It was a ton of fun though.</p></div>		</li>
