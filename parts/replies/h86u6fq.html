<p>I just almost cackled. Peer reviewers can be so catty but that's half the fun, I guess. Thanks for the chuckle!</p></div>		</li>

As an author, I was never informed the identity of the reviewers (now and then one would let me know if we were close friends), and as a reviewer, I always knew the identity of the authors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yuuup. My wife's a PhD student, and her supervisors keep telling her that she doesn't need to work so hard, don't burn out, don't take on too many projects, etc, as they continue to compulsively say yes to everything and pump out paper after paper that has little, if any, real impact on the field.</p>
<p>The treadmill is self-sustaining by that point, and the urge to pump out research quickly and continuously drowns out the desire to do truly thoughtful, sustainably paced work.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sort of.  It <em>is</em> possible to fire a tenured professor for incompetence or for not doing their job.  It is difficult, but if they completely stopped publishing and showed no signs of doing any work at all it would definitely happen.</p>
<p>But it's important to understand why tenure is necessary.  Many forms of research require devoting your entire life to them to get anywhere, and nobody would do that if they could get fired the moment the political winds changed.  Tenure ensures that professors are mostly free to speak their minds and research unpopular or controversial things, largely immune to outside pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stability and prestige, primarily.</p>
<p>That said, most universities are fundamentally run by the tenured faculty.  They're enormous and messy direct-democracies.  Day-to-day stuff is delegated to an administrative branch, but ultimate legislative power is held by the faculty.</p>
<p>Sooo... the people running the university like tenure, so they keep it.</p></div>		</li>
