			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also worth mentioning that many of the simple formulas we learn aren't <em>actually</em> simple, they are simplified to facilitate learning. Good example being free fall speed formula not considering the weight of the object because it is quite irrelevant (not to be confused with non existent) compared to the weight of the earth</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on this lots of equations have higher order terms. Often we just look at the main ones. </p>
<p>V=IR neglects a bunch of things. It neglects the time dependence. It neglects non-linearity due to heating effects, magnetic effects, semi conductors etc. It is a great equation lots of the time, but it isn't THE equation for electromagnetism.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So which one is that? Some fella called Maxwell would like to know!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>V = IR is more of a definition than anything. It doesn't neglect temperature or nonlinearities, it just relates current, voltage, and impedance. Any of these quantities may also be functions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, a lot of the &quot;simple&quot; equations arent simple.  We just use si.plified versions because they are accurate enough for our purposes. Other simplifications are because we define them to be so: like taking a complicated number and defining it as a constant to clean up an equation.</p></div>		</li>
