			<div class="markdown"><p>Cosmic billiards FTW.  All the planets roughly orbit in the plane of the ecliptic (except for Pluto, which is a planet, dammit), but do tilt some degrees to each other.  Their axial inclinations vary as well, and speeds of rotation vary a lot, and it's mostly due to impacts.  Interestingly, Mars has nearly the same angles of inclination and  length of day (the rotation rate) as Earth.</p>
<p>I should define the plane of the ecliptic--strictly speaking, it's the path the Sun follows across the sky as seen from Earth.  In other words, it's earth's orbital plane around the Sun projected into space.  All the planets (except Pluto) and most asteroids roughly follow the same orbital plane, the Moon does so as well, though its orbit around the Earth is tilted 5 degrees to Earth's orbit around the Sun.  All those variations in tilt, inclination and such happened because something hit something else.  Angular momentum rules!</p>
<p>Remember seeing that figure 8 shape on Earth maps and globes, usually out in the empty middle of the Pacific Ocean, maybe when you were in school? That's called the analemma, and defines the Sun's daily position in Earth's sky at the same time, over the course of the year.  The sun runs high and low along the 8 over the course of the year (defines the seasons), and side to side (sun runs early or late).  Earth's 23.4 degree axial inclination causes the north to south variation, and Earth's elliptical orbit the east to west changes.  And ultimately the shape of that figure 8, and that it exists at all, were caused by impact events.  It is possible that Earth's axial tilt and such were caused by the impact event that formed the Moon!</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is not quite true. The dominant mechanism for perturbations to orbits is actually gravitational interactions rather than impacts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is also true for the galatic plane as well. although when galaxies collide they will tend to have &quot;bulges&quot; in the middle until everything settles down.</p></div>		</li>
