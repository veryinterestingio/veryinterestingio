			<div class="markdown"><p>If the formula 1 car seats weren't molded to the individual driver, they would nearly get beaten to death by flopping around in the seat. They enter a 90° turn at 320km/h, instantly slow to like 80, complete the turn and back up to 300 in a few seconds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a little fyi. Race car drivers don't get the same g force effect as pilots. Pilots get it from the vertical while drivers get it applied on the lateral. </p>
<p>F1 cars could go faster but blacking out in them is a problem, a g-suit can't fix this issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m a runner. I was told that this is one reason side stitches are most common in novice runners. Your guts are not used to being jostled around like that. After a bit of training, things adjust quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not a doctor so I suppose you can take it with a grain of salt, but it makes sense intuitively. If your guts are accustomed to sitting on the couch, and you start running, they might fuss a bit at all the movement. But once they realize it it is ok, they can “go with the flow” better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve noticed that as I get older, I’m 51 now, it doesn’t affect me like it did when I was in my 20s for even teens. My kids hoot and holler when I go over bumps or dips and it really doesn’t even phase me anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As in you don't feel the same physical sensations, or don't get the same excitement?</p>
<p>I'm only 19, but I've been on a lot of rollercoasters, so they don't typically scare me or excite me in the same way that it excites others. They are still enjoyable and thrilling, but not scary. Some really light rollercoasters aren't even thrilling anymore.</p>
<p>If you mean the physical sensation, then I don't know. Perhaps you have more muscle and/or fat that holds everything a bit tighter together?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My stomach doesn’t drop. So I guess it’s more of a physical issue because I really like windy roads and hilly roads and what not but that feeling I remember getting when I was a kid where your stomach drops out of your body doesn’t happen anymore.</p></div>		</li>
