<p>Another example is if you put one hand under hot water and the other under cold water, then put both in lukewarm water, the first hand thinks it is cold, while the second thinks it is hot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is this purely due to the brain or is there some thermodynamics involved here? This isn't meant to poke holes because I understand the analogy but I'm curious if there's more at play for this specific example. </p>
<p>If you move immediately without letting the exterior temperature of your hands go back to room temperature, you're basically throwing your hands in with a larger temperature differential which will cause this kind of effect. Temperature differentials can make you feel hot or colder depending on what's going on.</p>
<p>Imagine you've been outside all day in the hot sun and you run into a walk-in freezer. Someone who's been indoors all day that goes into the freezer the same time as you won't &quot;feel&quot; as cold as you because their temperature is closer to the freezer than yours is. You might feel like it's cold as shit because your exterior temperature is further away from the freezer's temperature. Thermodynamics states that the person in the freezer that was sitting in the hot sun will &quot;lose heat&quot; faster than the guy  that was not in the sun, thus causing him to feel colder as he's losing heat faster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Our thermodynamics professor explained it pretty well I think. If you stand in 72°F air it feels fine because air is not a very good thermal conductor. If you jump into 72°F water it's miserably cold because water is a great conductor and heat is flowing out of you much faster. </p>
<p>Another example is carpet vs tile floor. The tile floor in your bathroom is the same temperature as the carpet or rug right next to it, but it feels much colder because it pulls heat out of your feet a lot faster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct that the effect is also due to thermodynamics, but it is exacerbated by the effect of thermoreceptor c-fibres. Like the brain is taking the real world temperature gradient and magnifying the difference. There used to be a demonstration at my local science centre with two pipe coils that wove inside each other, one hot and one cold. Looked like this:</p>
<p>HHHHHHCHCHCHCCCCCC</p>
<p>Holding both at the same time with one hand after holding only the hot part or only the cold part was really confusing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The combo of warm and cold at the same time feels like burning pain. Even though both temperatures are quite comfortable.</p>
<p>Its been known for a long time, but isn’t very well understood.</p></div>		</li>
