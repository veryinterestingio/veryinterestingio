			<div class="markdown"><p>My mom worked as a real estate agent for a bit.  The correlation between being dumb/careless enough to muck up your credit rating and being dumb/careless enough to have absolutely no idea that you can not get a loan is strong.  So you put a deal together, taken the buyer to the property a bunch of times, negotiated the deal, got all the legal stuff done, got title insurance, inspections, approvals and everybody together in a room to sign the docs.  Then the buyer gets cold feet and calls up, saying he can't get the loan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow.  When my husband and I were looking for a house we met with a mortgage lender early to see what we could get financed for.  Turned out to be about 200K more than we wanted to spend, which is a much better surprise than the other direction (we ended up buying a house in exactly our ideal price range). But even knowing we could be approved, there was still the risk that the bank would evaluate the house as being worth significantly different from the negotiated cost, and that would foul the deal.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, did the same with my first house.  They told me how much I could &quot;afford&quot;.  I was like &quot;you use that word, but I do not think you know what it means.&quot;  It was crazy what they would give me - with a crazy payment to match!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or* you could have happened to my wife and I - get everything lined up, earnest money in, appraisals done, inspection done, closing date set, and then a week before closing the lender calls and says your closing costs will be double what you thought because they need you to buy points or they don't approve. </p>
<p>So you back out because if you go through with it you don't have enough cash left over in savings to protect yourself if something goes wrong.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When my partner and I walk in we bring with us the proposition that within the next couple weeks the seller will have money in their account.</p>
<p>Versus a buyer with a bank loan may need to have multiple inspections and property assessments and re-inspections and bank approval and contingencies and a host of other factors that could tie up the deal for months. All along the way this buyer could have a setback at work, or miss a payment on a credit card or a number of other things which could mean the bank drops the deal.</p>
<p>Cash is king. Money talks</p></div>		</li>
