			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the micro tears are the cause for soreness. Lactic acid build up is the muscley burny sensation you feel during a workout. When the muscle can’t keep up with metabolism. </p>
<p>Source - I’m a strength coach and have a BS in kinesiology</p>
<p>EDIT: holy hell. I gave a very brief comment explaining that lactic acid wasn’t the cause for soreness. My intention, without getting into the complexities of the metabolic process, was to explain the burning sensation within a workout comes from that process. But muscle soreness after 24 hours is from the micro tears in the muscles and the inflammatory responses that brings. I never claimed to be an expert on physiology, but my expertise lies beyond coaching people to do push ups. I have a bachelor of science and took the same course load as those in the pre-med track. Plenty of chemistry, biology, physiology, physics and of course anatomy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the micro tear thing has recently been refuted as the cause for soreness, with a specific chemical mix now being the preferred theory for DOMS. I’d have to dive a little deeper into the research, but I do know we can’t definitively say it’s micro tear issue. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't explain the delay though. If you are tearing muscles when you workout wouldn't that be painful straight away?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But you only get DOMS when you're getting back into it or just starting up? Yet microtears happen every time you lift, even if you've been lifting constantly for years (in which case you will definitely not be dealing with DOMS)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bingo. The soreness is the inflammatory cascade that normally happens after most any injury. Sprain your ankle? 24-72 hours is the peak time for swelling and soreness. Similar process with blasting your glutes, bro.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not really that simple.  The tears presumably happen at the time of loading, during exercise.  Then there is some sort of inflammatory response that happens in response to that.  But it seems to happen more with eccentric than concentric exercise.  It's not just &quot;microtears.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Concentric is the micro tears and inflammatory response. Eccentric adds the plastic components of the muscle, like epimisio, endomisio, tendons and such. Inflammation there, hurts more AND reduces the movement range.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For clarification: Eccentric meaning <del>letting the muscle relax</del> lengthening of the muscle  i.e letting the barbell coming to your chest In a bench press or letting your biceps extend in an bicep curl. Concentric is the shortening of the muscle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re right about the concentric phase being the shortening phase. The eccentric is the lengthening phase of the muscle contraction rather than relaxing. The muscle is actually very active and tense in its eccentric phase.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is some valuable info. Loading a muscle and repeatedly stretching it is a great way to increase the amount of stress you put on it. This would result in greater muscle cell damage (more cells being damaged) and ultimately, more gains for the number of reps you're doing.. methinks..</p></div>		</li>
