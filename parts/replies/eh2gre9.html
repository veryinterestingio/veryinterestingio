			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that really true? Our water pipes work on demand too with the water molecules sitting in the lines pressurized up and ready to move again when needed. In both cases, the flow (current) stops once the demand is met and the tap is closed (regulator cuts off current). When demand exceeds supply, a power plant does something to generate more electricity and similarly a water plant needs to adjust hydraulics to provide the pressure for flow as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, you water pipes work on force. Only an obstruction such as a faucet stops the water from flowing, but the pressure is still there as long as the pump is running. Turn the pump off and the water will sit in the pipes once the pressure dissipates.</p>
<p>Electricity has to have something to draw it. In this case an uncharged battery. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water still needs something to &quot;draw&quot; it. For water, the draw is a lower pressure disposition such as your sink or a vessel. If you fill up a vessel such that the pressure gets too high then the water will stop flowing just as a phone will stop charging when at 100%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With water, pumps (or gravity wells) supply positive pressure, and it is possible to provide more water pressure than is needed and have water shoot out of a faucet like a water jet or blow up pipes if too much pressure is
supplied.  </p>
<p>With electricity, it's quite different.  A generator source can potentially supply much more electricity than is needed, but the device on the receiving end can only draw so much current.  You can not force more current to flow than is demanded by the circuit.  That's not saying that more current can't flow through a circuit because of a malfunction, such as an electrical short, because it certainly can.  </p>
<p>Think of it in terms of water is pushed and electricity is pulled.  Electricity is pulled by the consuming device because the consuming device provides a pathway for the voltage to go to its ultimate destination, ground.  If a short does occur which allows more current to flow than the circuit was designed to carry, then wherever the current flows the most (across the short to ground), then that part of the circuit will basically turn into a heating element and burn up or melt.  That's actually the point of circuit breakers, not to protect the device pulling power through them, but to protect the wiring so that the wiring does not become a long heating element and catch on fire in case too much current flows through it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Oh you certainly can. I find it easier to visualize voltage like water pressure, if you plug a 110v device into a 240v supply, you'll quickly realize that it gets way more &quot;pressure&quot; than it expected and will be damaged.</p>
<p>Modern cellphones negotiate the voltage that they'd like, they'll start at 5V and negotiate with the charger to get supplied at 12V but that's done with a complex signaling protocol and not just blindly feeding more volts down the line.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You definitely can. That's the reason you have to unplug things when there is an electrical storm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water and electricity can be seen as the same. (Voltage=pressure, current=flow) but the faucet and bucket analogy is not correct here. A battery charging situation would be more a sealed tank with some leakage rigidly connected to the faucet with a hose. Once you open the faucet there’s a lot of flow going into the tank. Once the tank is full backpressure builds and the flow stops. edit: removed my thought on compressible / non compressible liquids since it doesn’t add to the analogy here</p></div>		</li>
