<p>Get even close to it, and the energies involved push into black hole territory.</p>
<p>The actual 'pixel' may turn out to be larger (makes for cool physics) or smaller (ie we will never know).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no reason to think it is discrete like a pixel. It is NOT a resolution, except in some hypothesis. It is not a fact. </p>
<p>Plank energy also does not push into black hole territory. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That whole black hole energy thing doesn’t really make any sense. Maybe I’m missing something? </p>
<p>Btw I’m well versed in physics concepts, but I just can’t really get where that black hole thing comes from. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. The Planck length comes from combining fundamental constants to see what length comes out. There's no physical motivation to take it too seriously outside of &quot;maybe all these constants become important at these distances.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We're still pretty far away from the Planck Length.</p>
<p>If <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(length\)#Subatomic_scale" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> is to be believed, the upper limit for quarks size is 10^(-18) m. The Planck scale is 10^(-35) m. </p>
<p>This is 17 orders of magnitude apart. To get an idea, 17 orders of magnitude is the difference between the width of human hair and the distance between Pluto and the Sun.  Or the difference between the Eiffel Tower and a proton. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The ELI5 version is that we are trying to zoom in and we're getting pixels.</p>

<p>This is hands down the best and most effective analogy I've <em>ever</em> seen to describe the issues around examining quantum mechanics. Well done! I imagine a <em>lot</em> of people who generally find this stuff to confusing to read further into will have a lightbulb suddenly click on for them after reading this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is, but I fear people are going to think that the universe is <em>literally</em> granulated with Plank-length pixels at the smallest scale. It's not. You can have particles and structures much smaller and finer than a Plank length.</p>
<p>Plank units (Plank length, Plank time, etc) are convenient units used in quantum physics; they come from dimensional analysis, and have no actual physical significance. It's around the scale that we can't keep zooming in, but there's nothing to suggest there isn't structure on sub-Plank-length scales.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course - to try and piggyback on your analogy, it's not pixelating because the universe doesn't have any deeper resolution, it's pixelating because we haven't been able to build a high enough definition monitor to view it with. And due to various laws of physics at that scale, it will almost certainly never be possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hope not, because it's wrong. There's no reason to think that the universe is pixel-like at the Planck scale. Also, the question of quark compositeness has nothing to do with the Planck scale.</p></div>		</li>
