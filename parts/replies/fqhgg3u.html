<p>Yes, there are shorter versions of space elevators proposed that don't reach the ground, but they also don't sit in a geostationary orbit so they move and need to be intercepted, with the idea being these cables would be much easier to construct without pulling themselves apart in Earth's gravity.</p>
<p>They rely on either rockets lifting the payload up ( but not needing to reach full orbital speed) or on intercepts with aircraft or high altitude craft.</p>
<p>Some concepts are just a partial elevator that gives the payload a lift to it's higher orbit then reboosts its own orbit, others are bolo type rotating devices that capture a high altitude craft at an intercept point and then going it into a higher orbit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Except, if you're going to the top of the elevator, you are <em>necessarily</em> at orbital velocity. And you exerted forces on the way up and pulled the satellite out of its established orbit; you could mitigate that with a counterbalance, but you can't eliminate it, unless you load the counter on the satellite with the same mass that you're sending up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure what you are taking exception to... <em>All</em> space elevators and similar tether concepts rely on stored momentum and must be reboosted to maintain orbit.  The point is just that you don't have to use so much propellant and can use mostly electricity and efficient ion engines to do it over time rather than rockets.</p>
<p>Also, the rockets I referred to were to reach the bottom of a partial or non geostationary elevator, not to leave the top of it.  The elevator is still lifting the payload to orbit.  They use less propellant because the rocket doesn't need to provide the boost to orbit, just to intercept and dump the payload on the elevator.  These elevators or skyhooks are more likely to be physically possible/feasible than the 'true' full height geostationary elevator, and could likely be made with more conventional materials like steel cable.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Uhh, a &quot;traditional&quot; space elevator has its centre of mass <em>above</em> geostationary orbit and most definitely <em>is</em> tethered to Earth to hold it down. The top end of the tether is anchored to a captured asteroid or similar massive object positioned above geostationary orbit.</p>
<p>The anchor point (being above geostationary orbit) would tend to lag behind the base of the elevator on Earth, but the tether drags it along and forces it to match speed. It's not orbiting freely; it's tethered to the Earth to keep its orbit artificially low for its speed (or fast for its height, if you prefer), and this creates the tension needed to support the weight of the tether, elevator cars, etc.</p>
<p>If your upper anchor is <em>in</em> geostationary orbit, then it's the orbital equivalent of &quot;neutrally buoyant&quot; - it won't do anything to support the weight of the tether dangling below it, and this unbalanced force will eventually decay the orbit and drag the anchor below geostationary, and then everything is horrible for everyone as the whole rig comes crashing down along the equator.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a concept, known as a skyhook, that would work roughly like that. </p>
<p>You build a long structure that is in orbit around earth, and spinning so that when it's point straight up/down the lower tip is deep inside the atmosphere (yes, drag problems will apply). You can make it so that the effective speed of the tip in the atmosphere is well within what airplanes can achieve, so that, with well calculated timing and sufficient balls of steel, you could rendezvous with the tip and dock with it. As the skyhook keeps spinning, you're easily and cheaply lifted into orbit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1) A space elevator is made because it's difficult to get things up there and not cheap. Planes won't help.</p>
<p>2) It keeps the cable nice and straight. As hilarious as a massive cable swinging around the sky is, probably not great.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the cable could be steady with some winglets the same way a tanker refuels a jet fighter.  if each cargo load had it's own motor set to climb up the elevator, even at a slow pace, we can get a significant gain in materials to space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqwpQarrDwk" target="_blank">a concept like that called a skyhook</a>. It's not a space elevator, but instead a momentum exchange tether, but it basically functions using a heavy rotating space station that sends down a cable into the atmosphere, a craft them connects with the cable and is &quot;catapulted&quot; into higher orbit (or even to another planet).</p>
<p>Once space travel moves into a more industrial phase it would have a few key advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>It does not require a cable nearly as strong or long as a space elevator.</li>
<li>Spacecraft could be much smaller and more efficient.</li>
<li>If there is regular traffic going down (for example if there was a material exchange between earth and mars) the incoming traffic could be used to give the orbital station more energy.</li>
