			<div class="markdown"><p>This. My buddy is a Sr. Relationship Exec at NYSE and he tours people around the Exchange and gets them photo ops with Media folks and for the Opening/Closing Bell. When I asked why the NYSE never went the same direction as the AMEX (which lost its floor space around 2000) he said media mostly and confessed it largely is for show and preservation of the iconic marketplace. There is a skeleton crew of traders on the floor compared to what it was like before online platforms and mostly reporters hanging out in between segments on CNBC etc. Aside I worked on the floor of the AMEX in the 90’s and it was crazy - right when things were going mainstream digital. It was a mix of old school Traders flashing hand signals and calm(er) traders with handhelds plugging in bids. Batteries lasted 40mins so we were constantly running juice out to the floor from charging stations. Also - tech bubble was nuts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are Traders for different organizations, basically they are area focused and watch a sector or a subset of names and are experts in that domain. Which is why you see them in hubs. They could easily do it from anywhere but big brokerages/ institutions like to keep a presence on the floor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a few that do trades on the floor, but it's not like the scenes from 80s movies. I've toured the floor a few times and they're mainly talking to each other, punching numbers into the computer and occasionally on the phone. The only time there's any real commotion on the floor is at the closing bell when some company poses for pictures above the bell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They moved into the trading desks at institutions, or into other functions. At one point Barclays had trading floor in CT that sat ~500-1000 desks. Gone now. But still most financial organizations have a trading desk or a couple of them. Electronic trading changed the modality of the security exchange handshake - still need teams to create and execute strategy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it’s more than that. The NYSE is a symbol and icon. People believe that if the floor is busy and the money is flowing, the economy is healthy. It represents the economy and how America is the hub where all money flows. If one day someone looked out on the floor and there was no one there, it would look like not only the NYSE has died, but the entire economy is dead and America is no longer as important as it once was. </p>
<p>Yes it’s functionally obsolete. But it still has value in what it represents. The Statue of Liberty and Ellis island no longer welcomes immigrants coming by boat from Europe, but we don’t tear them down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked in finance, can confirm this is correct. </p>
<p>They used to do stuff but are now completely obsolete. The explanations above (the one about being quicker to the bid than someone “calling in” or the one that basically gives a definition of an OTC trade) are absolute bullshit. </p>
<p>But sadly the correct answer is also a pretty boring answer so that’s why it’s not the top-rated one. Welcome to reddit.</p></div>		</li>
