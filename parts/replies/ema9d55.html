			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the 20% figure is because it gets absorbed sublingually (that is the mucosa under your tongue/floor of your mouth.</p>
<p>Theoretically yes, if you held some alcohol for an infinite time you can get it all absorbed by never swallowing it.</p>
<p>Practically, it's going to be very difficult because of the dessicating(drying) effect of alcohol on the mucus membranes as well as the burning feeling.</p>
<p>The sublingual route of absorption is used in medicine to treat an acute angina attack by administering sublingual nitrate tablets. It is absorbed so rapidly that it provides relief within minutes and if continued to be retained in the mouth, causes hypotension/dizziness. Hence it is advised to literally spit it out once the pain subsides.</p>
<p>Sorry for going off on a tangent there, but all this is fascinating to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh. So when they tell me to put my anti-emitic under my tongue they actually really mean under my tongue? I thought they had other reasons, like making sure i dont chew or swallow it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's always neat to note odd little facts like that. For years I've had migraine tablets that dissolve and absorb in the mouth. I was told to take it by holding it underneath my tongue and moving it around for a minute until fully dissolved.</p>
<p>I swear that is some of the fastest and most effective medicine I've ever had. Which makes sense in a way since it's basically going straight into the bloodstream. It's also great since really bad migraines can make it impossible to keep most pills down long enough to take effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a number of drugs administered sublingually! For instance, I take estradiol valerate either sublingually or via skin patch. This bypasses the liver, at least somewhat, which is a good thing in this case. Probably a bad thing for some other drugs, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh you definitely can. It's way more dangerous though because the alcohol basically bypasses the liver and goes straight into the blood stream. Apparently the Mayans did it though.  <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_enema" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_enema</a></p></div>		</li>
