			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the black seas entrance to the Mediterranean is too small for significant tidal turnover and the black sea itself is too small to generate tides or currents of its own.
The only turnover is due to surface heating from the sun to a few feet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have to disagree with your assessment here. </p>
<p>By itself the addition of freshwater would have very little impact on seawater pH and also its oxygenation (anoxia). Heating also does not add acid to the ocean.</p>
<p>Ocean acidification is caused by higher atmospheric CO2, which decreases ocean pH (makes it more acidic) by the dissolution of the CO2 in the water forming carbonic acid.</p>
<p>Anoxia is the lack of oxygen in waters. The oxygen in water is controlled by a number of things including: </p>
<p>> the temperature of the water (warmer = lower oxygen)</p>
<p>> the ventilation or length of time the water has been out of contact with the atmosphere (sluggish mixing = lower oxygen).</p>
<p>> the oxygen demand caused by respiration (more decaying matter = lower oxygen)</p>
<p>There is a link between water oxygenation and acidity through the sulphur cycle, but it is of minor importance on modern timescales compared to the processes listed above.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well my hypothesis is the fresh water going in would release the co2 dissolved in the ice into the atmosphere, the additional co2 heat retention increases water temperature and also pushes the equilibrium of gasses dissolved in the ocean to favor absorbing more co2 from the atmosphere. With additional extinction, carcasses form additional carbonic acid, further decreasing ratio of dissolved oxygen. The oceans will favor anoxic conditions in a runaway greenhouse effect. Am I still not seeing something?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not so much the addition of freshwater but the mixing of increased atmospheric CO2 with ocean water reducing carbonate ions/reducing pH. </p>
<p>While some weathering processes act as a CO2 sink (e.g. silicate weathering), it isn’t really understood how an influx of nutrients/solutes will alter the carbon cycle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something I've heard or read at some point said something along the lines of the more dense fresh water sinking and interrupting thermohaline circulation in the Atlantic, which is the primary avenue in which warm water is circulated from the gulf and Caribbean up to the eastern coast of north America as well as to western Europe, which can result in a negative crash in atmospheric temperature as less warm water is circulated, causing intense and exacerbated winters and snow coverage across eastern North America and Western Europe, causing higher snow and ice coverage than usual, increasing albedo and compounding decreasing temperature in a positive feedback loop that results in the triggering of an ice age.</p>
<p>Can anyone say if there is any merit to this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There may be harsher winters as part of climate change but also hotter summers and more intense hurricanes taking over heat redistribution. The air and water currents are the slow and steady mixers but the storms are natures emergency shifting of heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately I'm on mobile and can't link papers and sources easily, but look up Heinrich and D-O events and you can find some good info pretty quickly.</p>
<p>It <em>can</em> change AMOC, and we've seen evidence for it happening in Heinrich Events and Dansgaard-Oeschger events: large volumes of fresh water are dumped into the North Atlantic, generally assumed to be from ice cap melting, and this causes a   <em>very</em> rapid drop in temperature (upwards of 10°C in a few decades). This has huge knock on effects around earth, changing aridity over the continents, particularly around the ITCZ, etc. </p>
<p>It is important to note however that whatever temperature drop we observe in the Northern Hemisphere, an opposite rise in temperature occurs in the Southern Hemisphere* (The Bipolar seesaw effect), though it does often lag behind NH change due to the buffering climate system around Antarctica. </p>
<p>This doesn't mean that current melting <em>will</em> change AMOC. I'm not sure if we know how much would have to go to manage that. As for resulting in an ice age, I don't think that's too likely. For the past 800,000 years or so ice volume has been a very &quot;saw tooth&quot; path, with relatively slow build ups and then rapid collapses (it's more symmetrical before that). IIRC, most Heinrich Events - the large dumping of denser fresh water from ice melting - occur near/coincidental with the termination of ice ages. And again, the input of fresh water doesn't mean Earth <em>as a whole</em> gets cooler: as the Northern Hemisphere cools in these events, the Southern hemisphere warms. Ice is melting due to the Earth warming, and while it does cause pretty large regional cooling, the Earth as a whole continues to warm.</p>
<p>*(Despite this, I am surprised that, to my knowledge, no climate deniers have taken this &quot;clear evidence of past rapid temperature change&quot; (Which <em>is</em> true, Greenland temperature in DO events changes by up to 15°C in a way shorter timescale than we've been managing) in these events as &quot;proof&quot; that they're right (even though they're not of course - the energy balance stays roughly the same as the hemispheres change opposite to each other)).</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Nice explanation, but you got this part backwards. D-O events are characterized by rapid <em>warming</em> in the North Atlantic, followed by centuries of slow cooling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure. I can look, but I think this was something one of my environmental science professors talked to us about one day, saying that once interrupted, the thermohaline cycle doesn't easily restart. This would mean that the winters would progressively get colder and more intense across Europa and North America, and average surface reflectivity would increase, winter-like conditions would effectively begin sooner and end later until to some degree ice coverage occurred more often that not.</p></div>		</li>
