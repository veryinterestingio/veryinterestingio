<p>Related news stories about the PS5 seem to be trending in the direction of &quot;Unless Sony is willing to take a loss again, the PS5 will be expensive AF due to component shortages&quot;, which likely is going to mean Sony takes a loss to move units in cash-strapped homes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I dunno man, the nintendo switch has parts that add up to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/4/5/15195638/nintendo-switch-component-cost-estimate" target="_blank">almost the entire retail price</a>.   Add in packaging, distribution, and the profit margin for retailers, and nintendo could very well be selling consoles at a loss.    It's still a sweet business, of course-  nintendo makes a killing with their high quality first-party exclusives selling for full price as digital downloads.</p>
<p>*edit:  okay guys, thanks for the multiple explanations.  I can tell you all put a lot of time into them.   Consider the point clarified.  ;-)</p></div>		</li>

<p>You're assuming they have one.</p>
<p>Retailers often use big ticket items as loss leaders for high-profit things like accessories and extended warranties.</p>
<p>Game companies also pretty much hate Gamestop's business model of &quot;Sell it twice, keep 100% of the profit&quot;, so they have negative incentive to build in a profit margin for the end retailer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with a teardown analysis like that is that its really only telling you how much <em>similar</em> components cost if you buy them from a wholesaler and assemble them into a board.</p>
<p>That doesn't tell you anything about how much the company in question actually paid for the components because:</p>
<p>a) The company isn't buying them piecemeal from a wholesaler</p>
<p>b) Just because a component has similar performance doesn't mean it has a similar cost.  Console manufacturers engineer their own components in which they take OEM designs and then gut a substantial amount of stuff that isn't necessary for what the console is doing.</p>
<p>To use the Switch as an example, the Switch uses a custom Nvidia Tegra X1 chipset.  The OEM reference documentation for that chipset shows that its an 8 core processor.  When people started getting their hands on the actual processors they noticed that it only shows as having 4 cores.  </p>
<p>What happened was that Nintendo gutted 4 of the cores from the OEM design.  Nintendo was the main buyer for the Tegra X1 chipset, so when Nvidia began producing Tegra X1's for its own use it just continued to use the Nintendo design, rather than go back to the original OEM specs.  </p>
<p>But if you were to go to Nvidia and ask for a wholesale quote on the Tegra X1 around the time that the Switch came out, the quote would have been for the 8 core version of the processor (which is what Nvidia was trying to sell to people other than Nintendo).</p></div>		</li>
