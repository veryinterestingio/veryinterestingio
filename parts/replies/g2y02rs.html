			<div class="markdown"><p>Iirc, newborns can't see facial expressions on people's faces.  They just see shadows of people.  Yet, I've heard of newborn babies smiling when cooed at.</p>
<p>I think it's natural.</p>
<p>Or maybe they're just farting/pooping and the effort of the exertion is literally causing their face to contort.  I choose to believe they're smiling :)</p></div>		</li>
