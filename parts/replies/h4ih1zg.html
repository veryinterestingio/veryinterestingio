			<div class="markdown"><p>My uneducated guess:
Recordings preserve high tones well.  Echoes preserve low tones well and lose high tones over distance.  Echoes require distance hence losing most of the high tones.  The bone resonance that people are referring to above is most effective with low tones and does not pick up on the high tones nearly as well.  It is just a similar effect.</p></div>		</li>
