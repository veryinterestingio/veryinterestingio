			<div class="markdown"><p>The correct answer is that nobody knows. The only thing we do know is that you don't want it to get too high because that can cause other damage. It's not necessarily bad at reasonable temperatures, though, so you can safely sweat it out without treatment if you wish. That said, a lot of the discomfort that goes along with a fever, like muscle aches and soreness, can be made better by the same medicine that would treat fevers (ibuprofen, acetaminophen) and are given for that purpose instead. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't stand the muscle ache that comes with the fever so I would always take paracetamol and lower my fever that way. I don't care what some people say that the fever is good since it helps weaken the bacteria. I'll just get the right dose of antibiotics for that</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just remember, viruses can make you sick too, and you can't just take antibiotics for those.</p>
<p>Also, general note, while other pain relievers are fine, children and teenagers shouldn't be given aspirin when they have a fever.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'd always imagined that an increase into the dangerous temperatures would be accompanied by other symptoms (hallucination, unresponsiveness) that would alert me that I needed to seek outside help. Am I being naive?</p></div>		</li>

You probably should monitor your temperature and understand the risks associated with maintaining a high temperature, or having temperatures above 103F. </p></div>		</li>
