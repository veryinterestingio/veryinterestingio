			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s a serious, chronic psychiatric disorder. Its presentation is heterogeneous (differs from person to person), but the most famous symptoms are hallucinations and delusions. See: <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/schizophrenia/index.shtml" target="_blank">https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/schizophrenia/index.shtml</a> for a more detailed summary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically many others like him and me are looking for a definition from which the symptoms are deducible and not a definition made up of symptoms, just like a mathematical equation can be deduced from an accurate definition in Physics. It's like everyone is talking about what happens in schizophrenia but nobody knows what exactly is schizophrenia. </p>
<p>The closest one I've known is that schizophrenia is when a person loses touch with reality or when he can't tell on his own what's real or what isn't (which can explain hallucinations and delusions). Things start to fall in grey zone once we get into defining what is reality or hallucination or delusions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the basic diagnostic criteria from the DSM-5:</p>
<p>A. Two (or more) of the following, each present for a significant portion of time during a
1 -month period (or less if successfully treated). At least one of these must be (1 ), (2), or (3):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Delusions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hallucinations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disorganized speech (e.g., frequent derailment or incoherence).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior.</p>
</li>
<li>Negative symptoms (i.e., diminished emotional expression or avolition).</li>
</ol>
<p>B. For a significant portion of the time since the onset of the disturbance, level of functioning
in one or more major areas, such as work, interpersonal relations, or self-care, is
markedly below the level achieved prior to the onset (or when the onset is in childhood
or adolescence, there is failure to achieve expected level of interpersonal, academic,
or occupational functioning).</p>
<p>C. Continuous signs of the disturbance persist for at least 6 months. This 6-month period
must include at least 1 month of symptoms (or less if successfully treated) that meet Criterion
A (i.e., active-phase symptoms) and may include periods of prodromal or residual
symptoms. During these prodromal or residual periods, the signs of the disturbance may
be manifested by only negative symptoms or by two or more symptoms listed in Criterion
A present in an attenuated form (e.g., odd beliefs, unusual perceptual experiences).</p>
<p>D. Schizoaffective disorder and depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features
have been ruled out because either 1 ) no major depressive or manic episodes have
occurred concurrently with the active-phase symptoms, or 2) if mood episodes have
occurred during active-phase symptoms, they have been present for a minority of the
total duration of the active and residual periods of the illness.</p>
<p>E. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a
drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition.</p>
<p>F. If there is a history of autism spectrum disorder or a communication disorder of childhood
onset, the additional diagnosis of schizophrenia is made only if prominent delusions
or hallucinations, in addition to the other required symptoms of schizophrenia,
are also present for at least 1 month (or less if successfully treated).</p></div>		</li>
