			<div class="markdown"><p>I do a lot of road work and construction.</p>
<p>This is right. Often times, it takes a lot of manpower to move all of those barrels. It's too expensive (and a pain in the ass) to spend 2-4 hours every day putting them out and moving them back in. That's a lot of lost productivity.</p>
<p>Some roads, like highways, we <em>have</em> put them back because the department of transportation doesn't want to hinder traffic, especially in the morning and evening.</p>
<p>But if it's a very long stretch they'll usually make an exception and have us put detour signs out to redirect traffic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess it depends where you are, I'm on Long Island, lots of traffic. They almost always put all the barrels on the side at the end of every night (they only do night work) and put them back in the morning. They even spray paint their positions onto the road to make the process faster. And I've seen the movie them, it's certainly not a 2 hour job, they move fast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They have a machine that moves them, really more of an attachment that I don’t understand why it’s not used more.... it’s like a front loader with a bar that just moves the barrels as it drives into them.... similar to a bull dozer with a tilted blade.... or a road grader</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yup. If you come on out to the wide open spaces of the western states, you will see long stretches of highway where the barrels are in place for months at a time.</p></div>		</li>

We have a couple guys with a rickety trailer slinging cones into the road (or back onto the trailer).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also work in highway construction, have for the last 7 years, and while everything said prior has been 100% correct I want to add one thing. You people do not remember how to drive at fucking all the second you see a cone/barrel or any change (no matter now small it is) to your usual route. You (speaking in general) have absolutely no idea how fucking dumb you drivers are until you work a season in road/highway construction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a legit question, not trying to be a dick at all, but why every time I drive through a road construction job it looks as if nobody is ever working? The work obviously gets done but it looks like everyone is always standing around in groups of 2-4 and talking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While you're right, part of that is on the construction company too.<br />
Most of the time, the actual signs put around on constructing sites (at least around here) are utterly stupidly insufficient.<br />
&quot;Road work ahead&quot; well, the orange cones everywhere kinda clued me in on it already, but good.<br />
And then... nothing... you have to guess which lane (if any) is closed.  </p>
<p>That detour you put out? well, that's good, but there's another crew doing work in the same neighborhood and they too have put detour signs... on the same stretch. Here hope you have GPS navigation to get back on track because there's 50/50 chance you're following the wrong detour signs now. </p>
<p>&quot;Pedestrians, use the sidewalk on the other side&quot;  except there's also a concrete barrier and absolutely no safe way to cross anywhere, but also no sidewalk on the other side anyway.</p>
<p>Some construction sites are fine obviously,  but some places are a fucking joke.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok but like... for <em>MONTHS</em> on end though? if its gonna be less than a few days then yeah sure leave em, up, but anything longer than that without anyone actually doing any work on the site is just insanity.</p>
<p>I cant count the number of times Ive seen a road or bridge shut down for construction, cones are put up, lanes are shut down, and then MONTHS go by with absolutely no work being done at all. Then they come back and actually start DOING the work, and theyre done in like a week.</p>
<p>The 9th street bridge has been &quot;closed for construction&quot; for more than FOUR YEARS! And in that time, I have never ONCE seen a single person working on it, despite passing by it multiple times a day, every day.</p>
<p>The 10 street bridge was closed for a year and a half with nobody ever working on it, and then they finally came back and started doing work and they were done in under a week.</p>
<p>A huge chunk of the tail end of Sawmill run BLVD has been shut down for at least two years now, and in all the times Ive driven through there, Ive never once seen anyone working on it OR noticed any changes from how it was the last time I went past.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know the specifics of the bridges you reference, but one possible reason for the long closures is that it’s not safe for the bridges to carry the full capacity of traffic, so a lane is closed to limit traffic.</p>
<p>Four years may seem like a long time for a bridge to be closed, but that could be due to lack of funding; repairing the structure could cost hundreds of thousands, even millions of dollars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funding could be the issue there if no work was being done.
Some people just get tenders then leave with the money or make bad decisions.</p>
<p>Then the project gets halted till that all gets sorted out.</p>
<p>Had a huge road construction stop twice over nearly 6 years because of management and funding issues in my old town.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes perfect sense! I also thought it was to condition drivers to impending construction. Get them used to slowing down in that particular stretch months before workers are present.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Acutally this isn't half wrong. Part of engineering is human theory and designing for people (let along does it actually perform).</p>
<p>Take highway design for example. On a highway, the curves in the road are designed with a changing incoming and outgoing curve until an optimal radius is found. This makes the turn feel natural to the driver. Years and years ago it was a simple curve, so you have a tangent road, to a curve, to a tangent. This makes it feel like you are abruptly turning and that's uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Also highways are designed for faster speeds than people normally drice. This is because engineers know that people drive faster than the posted speed limit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a highway by me that was going to be part of the Interstate system but for various reasons the project ended up getting killed. the state built it anyways for the state highway system. this caused a fun situation where we have a road that was designed for a 75mph speed limit but state highways have a cap of 55mph. I think most people drive 80 down that stretch of road.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>And this practice has had negative consequences for urban areas when the same design ideas intended for highways are applied to city streets. <a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2017/10/30/the-stroad" target="_blank">The &quot;stroad&quot;</a> is the futon of urban infrastructure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Similar thing when they install new traffic lights at an intersection. They’ll often set the lights up, but cover them with tarps for a couple of weeks before actually putting them into action, so regular commuters become aware that a change to their normal pattern is coming.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, although it a double edge sword. On my project we typically would put devices on the shoulder and a message board warning people that something will happen in a week or so.</p>
<p>By putting out devices and setting it up too early you run the risk of crying wolf and end up training people to ignore the situation. Same with roadway signs. If left in the background for to long it just becomes more background noise.</p></div>		</li>
