<p>Finally, how can people like business owners, airlines and other folks know whether you got an vaccine or if you just don’t like masks? Creates a potential logistical nightmare.</p>

<p>Some countries require you to have certain vaccinations before visiting, like Yellow Fever vaccination for Brazil. I'm like 90% sure that by end of next year you wouldn't be able to go on a plane without showing a proof of vaccination. And even if you are, especially in US (because &quot;freedom&quot; and whatnot) you wouldn't be able to enter many countries without it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, I agree with your premise, but just FYI Brazil doesn’t require that. I’ve been there several times and I never had to show proof. In fact, you really only need that vaccine if you are going to Manaus, if you are outside the rainforest it’s not really a concern. But even going into Manaus I never had to prove my vaccination status. Sorry I hate correcting people but I didn’t want you to end up using this argument again and getting shut down.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm sure we can provide some sort of authenticatable and non-transferrable indication of vaccination. I'm sure no one would ever have cause to object to such a simple common-sense measure.</p></div>		</li>
