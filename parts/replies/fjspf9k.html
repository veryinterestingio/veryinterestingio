<p>Bilateral symmetry is mostly prevalent on vertebrates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about internal organs? Heart, lungs, appendix, spleen, liver, stomach, intestines, (probably others i cant think of right now) are not symmetrical.</p>
<p>What about the brain? Physically it is symmetrical but the hemispheres may differ in function.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, I'm at home, I can finally answer your questions.</p>
<p>To understand why those organs that you mentioned aren't following the bilateral symmetry rule, we have to look at how they evolved, which will take us on a long journey through time.</p>
<h1>Evolution of the Heart</h1>
<p>I'll begin with the heart. What does the heart do? It pumps blood. Why does it have to pump blood? For blood to circulate. Why does blood have to circulate? To deliver oxygen to the body. Why do we need blood to deliver oxygen to the body? Because the body is big enough that oxygen can't diffuse at an enough rate by itself, and it has to do with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square%E2%80%93cube_law" target="_blank">square-cube law</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/om0xmuFbAF4" target="_blank">The evolution of the heart</a> begins with the rise of blood vessels, which could contract by themselves to push blood. This happens by the same process that moves poop through your intestines: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peristalsis" target="_blank">Peristalsis</a>. The bigger, more active and more complex animals got, natural selection favoured those which developed a heart. Or something alike. It should be noticed that even though the blood vessels behave more like branches, <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/4d/31/52/4d3152fdfad0fdb14ddcd6dcd6ee8ed6.jpg" target="_blank">they seem bilateral because they follow the shape of the body</a>.</p>
<p>Hearts throughout the animal kingdom vary in shape, disposition and even quantity! Here's the <a href="https://www.anatomynote.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/13594/Honey-bee-internal-organ-anatomy-diagram.jpg" target="_blank">heart of a bee</a>, or the <a href="https://www.canaryzoo.com/Around%20World%20QA/Octopus%20Hearts.jpg" target="_blank">three hearts of a cephalopod</a>.</p>
<p>That's why the heart doesn't follow the bilateral symmetry rule, because it didn't evolve from something that was bilateral in the first place. Although it could be argued that <a href="https://d97410b2-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/cardiacresearch83/heart-anatomy-on-different-vertebrates/vertebrate%20circulatory%20system.jpg?attachauth=ANoY7coICuBueUnTL_vzpTjjiFIwGCuMOZNhsMRqJwDlnQj4OQYcd-NmnxMHRIOxq0GLoXnMwbfIJqnFIBEpchWhzRvVBI5tmwf1rldKD9t_Aq_mPlI-zkm8W_CdpA6AE-qCTCd2YTzrcOr-3FbyNojUOMJ8KhRuhaAb8CCH2qzPUJGs-cYba330_I3WDUPTUmmdHjxLDw7A2v2ef855a1qWPIkLRKZKmOFmjIf_B4szLZiJcMyAe-DeajCpilEsu-2QIb0X4PYyvYUlGW2YDSB-LNCCQww1vhBbfoo44HC7XTXbiaiXfCI%3D&amp;attredirects=0" target="_blank">vertebrate heart has bilateral symmetry</a>, because it's a system that folds onto itself, to form the chambers.</p>
<h1>Evolution of the Lungs</h1>
<p>I'll begin this section by stating that lungs are symmetrical, even though you listed them as asymmetrical. I suppose you listed them that way because they aren't perfect copies of each other, looked through a mirror, like your hands. They aren't perfectly symmetrical because they have to make room for the hearth, which is slightly tilted to the left. <a href="https://youtu.be/idkPch61aMw" target="_blank">And that has to do with the function of the heart</a>.</p>
<p>The evolutive history of lungs follow bilateral symmetry and it begins with gills. To understand this, we have to travel to a time when animals were more like tubes, than what you would think about when imagining an animal. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Billie_Swalla/publication/309413064/figure/fig3/AS:421434582159367@1477489242974/Images-of-Hemichordate-Species-found-around-the-World-A-Ptychodera-flava-the-Hawaiian.png" target="_blank">Something like this</a>.</p>
<p>In those ancient animals, feeding was an act of letting water filled with nutrients and organic matter to flow through your mouth. Then, something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharyngeal_slit" target="_blank">pharyngeal slits</a> appeared, which are openings slightly next to the mouth, which allow the animal to control the flow. If you only had one of them on one side, the pressure wouldn't be evenly distributed, thus, they evolved to be in both sides of the animals, leading to bilateral symmetry.</p>
<p>From there, we can trace the evolution of gills, which evolved as sacs surrounding the slits and being filled with vessels to better distribute oxygen and onwards to lungs. That's why we have two lungs instead of one or three.</p>
<h1>The Remaining Organs</h1>
<p>To prevent me from making an even longer reply, I'll simply say that those organs that aren't bilateral, are like that because they didn't evolve from a bilateral structure. Such structure usually evolved in that manner because it's more favourable than having only one. I'll leave some further readings about those organs, if you're interested in learning more about them.</p>

<p>I couldn't find readings on the other organs you mentioned (and I'm quite surprised there aren't any), but here's a thorough read about the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-008-0076-1#Abs1" target="_blank">evolution of complex organs</a>.</p>
<h1>Misconceptions About the Brain</h1>
<p>One of the biggest myths about the brain is that each hemisphere (term which points out directly to its bilateral symmetry) has different functions and that people can be left brained or right brained. That conception of the brain comes from a misunderstanding of the brain from the 19th century, when we barely understood the anatomy of the brain, and even less how it works. Some readings <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/16/left-right-brain-distinction-myth" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/5-common-myths-about-the-brain/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>		</li>
