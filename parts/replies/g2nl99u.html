			<div class="markdown"><p>The fireman doesn't know when the next load of coal will show up, but if the train stops, he dies. As soon as he makes room for it, he wants more coal. As much as he can just in case the coal stops coming in. He isn't the smartest, so even as the train starts creaking under the weight of so much coal he wants more. Rather, now that he has a whole mountain of it stashed away, he can't possibly imagine having just a single cart. That would be crazy, that's asking to starve.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. It's not the fireman's job to monitor the size of the fuel reserves. Really, the train designers never expected the idea of <em>too much coal</em> to ever be a thing to design for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, for the first 99.99% of the existence of this train engine, “too much coal” wasn’t an issue. We’re living in a unique time in that we’re part of one of the first generations ever in history where your primary health issue is “too much coal” instead of “not enough coal”.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your body is like an airplane. The airplaneman gets a load of coal (food) and either shovels it into the engine (your body's metabolism) or shovels it into the tender (your fat reserves).</p>
<p>Hunger is the airplaneman saying &quot;hey, just so you know I'm not getting any coal right now... could be an issue.&quot; He doesn't care that the tender has plenty, just that no more new stuff is coming in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TL:DR; Fuel storage. I don't think I've ever seen this word used this way, so TIL, I guess.</p>
<p>A tender or coal-car is a special rail vehicle hauled by a steam locomotive containing its fuel (wood, coal, or oil) and water. Steam locomotives consume large quantities of water compared to the quantity of fuel, so their tenders are necessary to keep them running over long distances. A locomotive that pulls a tender is called a tender locomotive. Locomotives that do not have tenders and carry all their fuel and water on board the locomotive itself are called tank locomotives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey that's fantastic news! You're a god damn warrior, keep up the good work!!</p>
<p>And just remember the battle isn't over when you reach your goal weight, it never ends. Don't make the same mistake I did, I lost 51.5 kilos roughly 7 years ago and over the years it has slowly crept back on... now I'm slowly but surely in round 2 of the weight loss battle.</p>
<p>It's all worth it in the end!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you weight almost twice as much as you should, and you're 1/3rd of the way to your goal weight, know what that means?</p>
<p>If you hadn't put in the work to get where you are now, you'd be OVER twice the weight you should be. Yeah it can sometimes feel like &quot;oh I've still got so far to go...&quot; but a lot of people dont even get 1/3rd towards their goal, and, shit a lot of people don't even start</p>
<p>Keep up the good work, and you'll hit that goal someday! And when you do, you'll look back at your old self and wonder how you functioned. You start realizing everything feels better in general</p></div>		</li>
