<p>there are concerns about the security of such numbers - many cryptographic algorithms rely on high quality random numbers, and since hardware is very hard to inspect for backdoors, you have to trust the manufacturer. A slightly different way to generate random numbers based on physical phenomenon was demonstrated by Cloudflare - they use the live video feed of a bunch of lava lamps to generate high quality random numbers.</p>

<p>It was done earlier by SGI, called Lavarand.</p>
<p>I think it's fair to say that the wall of lavalamps at Cloudflare is largely a showpiece. It's only used to 'help' with the RNG, meaning it's one source of entropy among many others (as any seeding should be).<br />
As security goes, if you feel that you can't trust basic hardware* to generate high quality entropy, then you definitely shouldn't be trusting entire camera systems and the software that takes the images and breaks them down to something usable. And if you do trust the those systems, you might as well lock them in a dark room and go off the sensor noise alone.<br />
But it looks pretty, so it has that going for it.</p>
<p>* by basic hardware I don't mean a CPU. Whether or not you can trust the CPU is certainly up for debate. There's several completely open source (hardware and software) TRNG implementations, many of which have as the most complex module a USB-Serial chip (gotta hook it up to a computer somehow, though anyone paranoid enough could certainly work with the raw outputs and skip that bridge chip altogether), with plenty of throughput.</p></div>		</li>
