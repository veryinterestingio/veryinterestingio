<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Though the saltwater tends to intrude farther at depth, because it's denser.  So even with a perched freshwater lens from precipitation input, you could have saltwater underneath.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Layman here, why don't they naturally mix together and average the salinity if they are in contact?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First off, in the absence of flow, material moves <em>really</em> slowly.  Diffusive processes go with x ~ sqrt(2Dt).. that is, stuff doesn't move at constant velocity, but rather goes with square root of time.  So, as an example, let's say you throw salt in a glass at the bottom (don't stir it) and it takes e.g. 1 minute to diffuse 10cm.  You're looking at 100minutes (~2h) to go 1m.  200h (~1 week) to go 10m.  2 years to go 100m.  200 to go 1km. 20 millennia to make it 10km.</p>
<p>If you have a fresh water aquifer, it had to come from somewhere.  If it's still connected to any kind of source, that additional water can provide a steady and slow flow to counteract that diffusion.  It doesn't take much water to make up the 1m/year linear flowrate that would be required to counteract diffusion through a 10km class barrier.</p>
<p>Combine that with a tendency for silt to clog up any passages water could get through and reduce flowrates even more.</p>
<p>Now, if you take that thing and pump water out, there's now a pressure difference.  <em>That</em> is going to be enough to force the water through the rock, which will carry salt with it as it moves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed.  You can see fantastic examples of this if you scuba dive in caves near a coastline, such as the cenotes in Mexico.  Do an image search for 'halocline' which is where the salt and fresh water meet, and enjoy the spectacular beauty.   Which still pales compared to actually diving through it in person!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nothing is ever average when you sample it.  How come only one out of 100 people is the exact average height of a human.  Take a sample of our air.  How often is it the average temperature of what it's supposed to be around the world.  You'll almost always have places where samples are higher and lower concentrations of what you're looking for.  It's the pattern of them that matters.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It is if the sample is homogeneous. If you dissolved salt into boiling water and stirred it, the salinity of the water would reach homogeneity very quickly. You would expect there to be the same amount of salt in all parts of water (at least to a very close degree). </p>
<p>Also, it's not like 1 out of 100 humans is going to be the average height. That would only be true if there was a uniform distribution across human heights (you're just as likely to be 3' 6'' as 5' 8''). A plurality of humans (at least by sex) are close to the mean height. That's called a normal distribution. </p>
<p>(Edit: linear -&gt; uniform)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can calculate a mean for a population of 100 and have zero people who are exactly that mean (or within a few percent), or you can have 100 people who are. Both cases are unlikely but they are possible.</p></div>		</li>
