			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no scientific method to determine that because there is no scientific method to determine the price of assets. It's all a big game of supply, demand and human emotions. At most you could do some fundamental analysis on that asset (Warren Buffet style) and try to determine its &quot;real&quot; value. You then monitor that asset and if nothing changes about it fundamentally (revenue, cashflow, profit, etc.) but the price still goes up, most likely it went up because of a surplus of money that siphoned into that asset via mutual funds, index funds, ETFs or investors with too much capital and nowhere to put it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those are the exact same thing.</p>
<p>Inflation means something increased in value, whatever the reason. Your house is worth 30 % more ? Means your house inflated by 30%</p>
<p>When calculating CPI (which is used as average inflation measure from the consumer point of view by US institutions), they don't discriminate why prices of products in their basket are changing, it can be that better computers exist and old ones are outdated so prices of last year's computers are divided by 2, or be because tomatoes suffered from a drought so their price increased.</p>
<p>You might rephrase your sentence as:  &quot;So how do you determine what amount of an assets increase in price is due to increasing money supply and what amount is due to an actual increase in value?&quot;. Won't answer that because it's a per product response.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The real definition of inflation is &quot;an increase in the supply of money&quot;.</p>

<p>I disagree. The real definition of inflation is simply an increase in price. Whatever the reason.</p>
<p>Inflation means increase.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can disagree all you want, it doesn't change the facts. That is the real definition of inflation and you can find it in any old dictionary or ask any old person.  This new definition based on CPI is being pushed because it ensures that people are not asking the right questions. You can't find the right answer when the question is wrong. </p>
<p>That was the point of OP's question in the first place. If interest rates are at 0% and people keep borrowing like crazy (supply of money increase), where is the inflation? It's a logical question and it makes sense, but if you try to answer it based on the new definition of inflation, the prices aren't increasing which means there's no inflation. You then have to go through mental gymnastics to explain how is it possible that the supply of money increases but inflation stays the same. You're at at a dead end.<br />
The correct answer is that prices ARE increasing, but they are increasing only for assets and not for fast-moving-consumer-goods which the CPI uses to determine &quot;inflation&quot;. </p>
<p>Every person who decides to believe in this new definition of inflation will not ask the question: &quot;what happens to all that printed money&quot; and will not look into the prices of assets. By the time they figure it out, they will be priced out from most asset classes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No it's not. I agree CPI does not measure inflations, it's not the point.</p>
<p>I was just correcting you in saying inflations are unrelated to why prices augment. Any augmentation is inflation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep’ like Gordon brown defining it and then blaming the house price bubble on other people .... if house price inflation had been included the need to cool the market would have been obvious even to him and other idiots. Instead they went and still go with the pleb definition and calculations.
Anyway the answer to the question like has been said before for the pleb definition is mainly the velocity of money is slow, so all this extra money doesn’t buy or do anything, just remains a number on a balance sheet and as such isn’t increasing the demand for anything real.
However the belief in the value of that currency may become an issue in due course, albeit everyone elses currency is a basket case so it all levels out</p></div>		</li>
