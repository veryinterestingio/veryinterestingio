<p>1) An inactivated virus vaccine can be made much quicker, and is arguably the safest approach to a vaccine with at least some probability of efficacy.  We obviously don't know much about the latter two &quot;on the ground&quot; in China, but they were inoculating military month(s) before the west rolled out Moderna and Pfizer.

<p>2) Yes, crossing over once you're fully vaccinated should not cause any problems, other than what you might expect with staying with the same brand - somewhat higher rates of severe side-effects (though incredibly minor numbers in the grand scheme of things.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey thanks so much for answering my questions!  I really appreciate you taking time out your day to do this.</p>
<p>Can I clarify point 2, why would you get higher rates of severe side effects with taking a booster?  I just don't want to take for example AZ, then find out 2 years later I am ineligible for an mRNA vaccine based on some sciency reason that is above my intellectual capacity ðŸ˜‚  thanks for the reassurance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'll be fine :)  The side effects I'm referring to are those we're currently seeing - soreness, occasionally fever and achyness, etc.  They tend to be worse after the second Moderna or Pfizer vaccine (we don't know about the AZ or J/J vaccines because people are only getting one!).  The reason is that after the first, your immune system is now &quot;primed,&quot; it recognizes the viral antigen being presented (the &quot;spike&quot; protein), and wants to contain the threat as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>There will be some discussion, but it will be discussed more by the media than by scientists because this whole thing has been the most public display of science ever.  Scientists will very quickly say that it's safe, and there'll be some studies showing that an mRNA booster is effective following the AZ or J/J initial vaccine.  I expect that Moderna and/or Pfizer may want a study looking at needing a second mRNA booster of their vaccine if a person only had the AZ or J/J vaccine previously, but that will probably turn out to be unnecessary.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see which vaccine makes it into a booster combo (I expect these to be paired with influenza for a few years at least).  The adenovirus vaccines like AZ and J/J have a slight advantage there, because they're inactivated viruses which have been included in other iterations of combo vaccines in the past.  We've obviously never used mRNA vaccines before, so we don't know how well they might work when combined with the annual flu vaccine.  I expect they will do fine, and Moderna and Pfizer are probably scrambling to adjust their formulations so that they can be added to the annual flu vaccines, and then they'll want to know if they're effective when added.  </p>
<p>I'm optimistic this will all work out, and that people who've received their full course of whatever vaccine will be very protected against most developing mutants and will otherwise be fine getting whatever version is included in the annual flu vaccine formulations.</p></div>		</li>
