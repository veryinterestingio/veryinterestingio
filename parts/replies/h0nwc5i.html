			<div class="markdown"><p>Can attest to the damage of cells underneath. I worked for dominos for 15ish years. After switching to cornmeal and 700k pizzas latter it took the lady at the sheriff's office 45 mins to fingerprint me for employment on the electronic fingerprint machine.</p>
<p>Another 10+ years later digital fingerprint scanners still have a hard time getting a good print</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just give up on fingerprint scanners, I must be born with 'wrong' fingerprints or sth. Always gotta through a human instead of a machine at the airport. My highschool had the bright idea to install fingerprint scanners for morning attendance. So I spent 15 minutes before school going to the IT office, showing them all 10 of my fingers couldnt pass the scanner, have them take the prints for all 10 again, so that I can try again tmr, rinse and repeat. Every morning for a whole year, until they ripped out all the scanners and pretended it never happened lmaoo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My university's library worked like that, with fingerprint-operated doors. The problem is, the sensor was absolute garbage, and it took forever for anyone to get through.</p>
<p>In most cases, one person would manage to get their print through after 5 minutes of trying, and ten other people would then pass before the door closed. Even the librarians, who were right in front of the doors, would not care at all that people did this, since they knew it was otherwise almost impossible.</p>
<p>And even more moronic? The computer to register your fingerprint was <em>inside</em> the library, which was accessed by the fingerprint you registered. So you were forced <em>by the school</em> to bypass their system at least once to register your prints.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fingerprint scanners (and this is in the UK so might be different) are much more prone to error and much less reliable and the reason for that is that they don't detect your fingerprint in the same way as police would do by using ridges/patterns.</p>
<p>They store a &quot;loose template&quot; of your finger. They don't need the type of accuracy crime investigation does and your fingerprints are incredibly specific. </p>
<p>The other reason they do this, is people do not want private companies to have their fingerprint on file. </p>
<p>When we had them installed at our workplace we were sent several letters of declaration by the scanner companies that the info would be stored securely, our employer did not have direct access to the data the data could not be shared without our consent and the data could not be used to identify us in legal proceedings as what they stored was fundamentally different from a &quot;normal&quot; fingerprint.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol no, me and a friend did a loose estimate on how many pizzas we made upto that point in time. It was based on how many pizzas made vs our estimate of how many of those we made each day.</p>
<p>At that time in our careers we could get a close estimate of pizzas made with x sales. Back then we did not have all this garbage that dominos and other chains have now days. His EST was around 1.4m mine was around 1.2m.  The difference was years worked. I actually averaged more pizzas per year, he just had more years over me.</p>
<p>Quick useless facts
Fasted 1 man makeline. 143 pie hour with a 14 min oven time.
Pizza Expo games are silly and people there are slow at pizza making
Fastest 2 man makeline average of 300/pies an hr of 10&quot; pizzas @ Carolina mudcats in a 18wheeler trailer</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a fun (now) example, I partially sliced off a corner of one of my fingertips.  It was a flap, so I cleaned it and stuck it back down.  Of course, not <em>perfectly</em> where it was before.</p>
<p>So now both sections have fingerprint, but they don't quite line up and connect properly, and there's and there's a line marking out the boarder between the sections.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I cut mine off entirely (said flap), stuffed it back on, then drove to the urgent care because I couldn't stop the bleeding.</p>
<p>I asked if they could leave it on because, you know, less healing, and they said no. So after a ton of really cool tries trying to stop the bleeding they eventually got it so it wasn't leaking much... and now 2 months later I have the same finger prints, just a little lower.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chemotherapy and radiation destroyed all fingerprints from my best friend before she passed away. It was the strangest thing I’ve seen. Her hands were constantly peeling and dry, and then one day, her fingertips were pretty much smooth. She was still volunteering at the time, and had to renew her live scan, and was unable to do it. They had to make an exception for her. Also, her phone wouldn’t pick up her fingerprint, and sometimes her touch either, so the Apple store set it up for her to be used with a pencil and a passcode only, and to bypass the center toggle button (so if anyone has this problem- they can do that, but you have to go in- it was originally made for amputees).
Just throwing it out there, bc it was one of those side effects no one ever thought of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, she just couldn’t get into the phone at all bc it was on, was fine, and then poof- no more fingerprint recognition. The tootle button (which isn’t in the newest phone anymore, but you know the one) also didn’t work for her anymore, at all, and the touch screen was hit and miss, so there’s some setting where they moved the toggle the the actual touch screen itself, and gave her a pencil to make everything easier. At any rate, it was really helpful.
Maybe everyone knew how to do it- I had no idea. I knew how to turn off touch, but when I was locked out? No clue. And I’d have no idea how to move the other stuff around, or even think of buying a pencil, and they just gave her one. I thought it was really nice.  I throw it out there in case anyone else has a similar problem.</p></div>		</li>
