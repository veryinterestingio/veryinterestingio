<p>Is there like an ELI3 to this ELI5?</p>
<p>Edit:
Today is the day I get to say: “RIP my inbox!” I’m actually excited to read all the replies.</p>
<p>Edit 2:
I’m glad I’m not the only schmuck in here who thinks this top reply does not dumb it down enough for the average reader.</p>
<p>And even after reading half the replies I still have no idea what a point means? And if it doesn’t really matter why does the “point” always gets thrown around?</p>
<p>Also if the ratio of point:dollar is NOT 1:1 then wtf is the ratio? Does this ratio ever change or does it remain constant?</p>
<p>Thank you for your time, most of the replies has been (surprisingly) very informational. I was expecting a bunch of smart remarks.</p></div>		</li>

There's a made up &quot;hey how are companies doing&quot; game called the Dow.  The rules keep on changing, but everyone kinda just runs with it. If the points are going up, people think companies are doing well!  If the points are going down, people think companies are doing poorly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Saying &quot;the Dow is up/down&quot; is a way people get a general idea for the health of the market. Someone picked a handful of big companies that account for a large amount of capital in the market and averages their performance. People tend to agree that if these companies are doing well, the market as a whole probably did well too.</p>
<p>It is 100% possible that while the Dow is down, the market as a whole is up - it just isn't super common.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the Dow is more a symptom than a cause of economic activity if that makes any sense.  Just because you have a cough doesn’t necessarily mean you have the flu, for example, but something worth noting.</p>
<p>Stocks are so ridiculously complex trying to do a ELI5 about them is self-defeating if I were to go any furthur.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's one measure of economic health, but it's not a great one. In real world terms, unless you're a capitalist (meaning you own capital - and odds are, if you're reading this, you're not, regardless of your economic viewpoint - you're labor) the stock market going up won't really mean much for you. Your wages will remain stagnant, and while you might be able to borrow money easier, and at slightly lower interest rates, ultimately all the growth that a rising stock market represents goes upward.</p>
<p>Dow hits record highs, but you're still making a fraction of your labor value. Company has record profits, and lays off half the staff. The stock market is not the economy, and there are ways to make more profit without actually selling more products. And so the supply side engorges while demand stays flat or falls, as more and more people are priced out of the economy.</p>
<p>Now, if the stock market falls, well, that's a different story. That can have a major effect on your life, especially if investors pull out of the company you're selling your labor to. That could see you taking a pay cut, or out of a job. Labor is seen as an expense, and when times are tough (or you need to eke out another 1% profit), expenses get cut.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One person’s up is often a different person’s down.   Remember that ownership of stock isn’t money.  In order to “sell” it at a certain price, you have to find someone willing to BUY it at that price.  </p>
<p>When someone says to me they love company X and supports it because they own lots of stock, I ask them how they are going to get any money from that. They have to decide they want less interest in that company to sell the stock and trade it for money.  In essence they will signal a loss of support by selling the stock. When enough people signal they want to sell company X, it becomes a buyer’s market and the asking price goes down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;As of the end of June 2018, the Dow divisor is 0.14748071991788. It means that for every $1 of change in price for any given stock within the index, the average – using the current Dow divisor – is equal to a 6.781-point movement in the market.&quot; - <a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/dow-divisor/" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
<p>So. 500 points means there was a ~ $73.74 change, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The DIJA is just adding up the prices of all 30 stocks and dividing it by the dow divisor.  Originally the divisor was just 30. So you were getting a literal average price of the 30 stocks.  So a 1 point change back then would be worth about $30 change in the sum of the stock prices.</p>
<p>However, stuff like stock splits happen in the investing world.  If Apple's $100 stock splits, then their price is $50 now, which would drop the DIJA quite a bit since you're now averaging the $50 price instead of $100.  Apple didn't have a bad day or anything.  They just split.  And the DIJA wouldn't be any good if we saw a dip in the DIJA even though apple was a-okay.  So they adjust that divisor so that stuff like stock splits don't fuck with the usefulness of the index.</p>
<p>Today a 1 point move means that the total price of the stocks in the index moved by about 14 or 15 cents.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don’t really have to worry about the essence of it, it’s just a bi product of the formula they use to calculate the index. Just look at it in relation to itself, if it was 20,000 and went down to 19,000 for example.</p>
<p>It’s literally just a formula to try to calculate the state of the overall economy, a “point” is the measuring unit for that formula.</p>
<p>They shouldn’t even use the term points since percentages are all that matter most of the time, but “went down 2%” doesn’t sound as clickbaity as “went down 500 points” to the media I guess. The DOW isn’t even a good index, inferior to the S&amp;P 500 in most the ways an investor would care about.</p></div>		</li>
