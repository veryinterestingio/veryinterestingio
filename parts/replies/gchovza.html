<li>
<p>We post our data on repositories like AAVSO (Transit of exoplanets), MPC (Asteroid) and EURASTER/IOTA (Occultation) and if the citizen astronomers agree, we add their name as observers.<br />
For the publication, we are planning to list the observers in the scientific papers (Table, acknowledgement) and offer co-authorship when possible.   </p>
</li>
<li>First we have created a community of observers and they communicate with each other, some of them are now leading their own scientific investigations. I think this is key  to keep the network active and energized. Secondly, we are also developing education programs for formal and informal education centers to include a large participation of a diverse audience for our project. Finally, every week something fun is happening in the sky, and we let our citizen observers know about it so they use their eVscope to see something fun and new as often as possible.</li>
