			<div class="markdown"><p>Google ads. I'm talking about how ads show up as the first search result. Sometimes they make up first half of the first page and the rest is usually organic results of the same ads</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The number of &quot;ad results&quot; in the search seems to have just gone up.</p>
<p>Used to be just one, now I can see a bunch. </p>
<p>If I type in &quot;Buy website&quot;, the first 4 are ads.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can’t pay them to prioritize the organic listings, but you can pay for ads, which are up to the first three listings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not accurate. You pay someone who specializes in manipulating the Google algorithm (an &quot;SEO Specialist&quot;) that person does not work for Google and no money goes to Google. </p>
<p>You can pay for a Google ad to appear above the search result, that is not technically a search result though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no paid prioritisation of Google search results. Ads are ads and say “Ad”.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>None of this is true. Chegg and Coursehero pay thousands for people who known SEO better than anyone else. Not to mention they probably pay for ads. Theyre not bribing anyone.</p></div>		</li>
