			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to add that sometimes we don’t fill out the cause-of-death correctly and leave out critical information as to the cause. For example if someone dies from cardiac arrest related to their hospital stay for Covid-19 or even a downward spiral lasting months that began with Covid-19 the cause of death should be Covid-19 but the form may just say “cardiac arrest”.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I fought with a friend yesterday about the exact two webpages in the OP. He is CONVINCED that hospitals are cooking the books and overreporting COVID-19. He says these stats prove it. He doesn't believe the lag time is going to make up the ~30k missing cases. I mentioned that it's probably the exact opposite...that things are being underreported. </p>
<p>I was actually quite shocked. This particular friend isn't prone to conspiracy and is quite intelligent. He's not even a COVID denier. He takes it all very seriously, but he has a real bug up his ass about the health care system and getting extra money for COVID reporting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just the sheer amount of conspiracy and distrust in recent years combined with high visibility of it all keeps it all fresh in our minds. </p>
<p>Now we add a life-altering, global, deadly pandemic and have no solutions. People are angry. They want something to blame, an enemy to fight against to feel like they're doing something. So they create one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve ran into the same situation hence why I posted this. Just look at the number of people claiming these numbers are overinflated in this very thread. I’m baffled by the general distrust of what was once reliable and more or less irrefutable sources of information (CDC). I think that’s something trump in particular has had a talent for, his innate ability to doublethink. He somehow simultaneously claims his authority is based on tenets of science while he refutes them. It leaves people confused and creates situations like what we are seeing today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only that, but if you look at the confirmed pneumonia deaths there’s been a huge spike right when this whole coronavirus thing kicked off. It was hovering around ~3,700 deaths a week during what is typically the worst time for pneumonia before doubling within a month. It’s very likely that a lot of people recorded as dying of pneumonia were untested Covid victims.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Given it looks like <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52526554" target="_blank">there was community transmission in France happening as early as late-December last year</a>, it's likely it was spreading on the US east coast (<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52526554" target="_blank">it's been shown the US east coast coronavirus originated in Europe</a>) well before authorities realised it.</p>
<p>Given the patient's wife worked in the vicinity of de Gaulle Airport it's likely the virus was on the US east coast early in January.</p></div>		</li>
