			<div class="markdown"><p>Or, you know, just buy a reusable water bottle and drink all of your water from the tap.  Seems to work for me and probably saves me a lot of money.  Most convenience stores also have a water dispenser on their soda fountain, so you can get nice, cold water and they typically don't charge if it's your own water bottle.</p></div>		</li>

Also I think we do have expiration dates on plastic bottled honey.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard of several studies that conclude that the plastic bottles do leach chemicals into the water over time under heat.  Here's one: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0043135407005246?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0043135407005246?via%3Dihub</a></p>
<p>That being said, this is only for water bottles heated above 140F. So if you live in AZ and leave your water in your car, you will may run into problems in as little as a year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand the concern is that during transportation of pallets of water bottles in a non-refrigerated 18 wheeler, the temperature inside the trailer can exceed 120° on a hot day, which causes those chemicals to leach into the water even before they hit the shelves</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A while back I took my gf shopping since she didn't have a car and <em>lived</em> in a dorm. She always bought bottled water.</p>
<p>We didn't have enough hands to carry all the groceries up to her dorm so we left the water in my trunk, planning to get it out when I left.</p>
<p>Of course we forgot. For several days. </p>
<p>My gf is kinda paranoid about BPAs so by the time we realized it wa still in my car, she didn't want it.</p>
<p>So it became &quot;car water&quot; basically any time we needed water and didn't have access to it (like spilling something in the car and needing to clean it, or washing our hands on the side of the road after doing something gross or dirty) we would open a bottle and use it. It stayed in my car for about a year and a half. We rarely were in a position where we needed water and didn't have access to it.</p>
<p>Edit. For something called autocorrect, it seems to make a lot of mistakes</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can tell when bottled water's been left in the heat for too long, it tastes like chemicals. If it tastes like chemicals I just throw it away. I used to live in AZ and would buy bottled water daily. I live in ID now and find a lot if the same 40 packs(GV) of bottled water I'd buy here tastes on average way more like chemicals than it did in AZ. I just came to the conclusion that it's probably been exposed to heat in semis for longer durations because of distribution. I switched to buying 5 gallon containers and refilling them because the water is usually filtered right where you buy it.</p></div>		</li>
