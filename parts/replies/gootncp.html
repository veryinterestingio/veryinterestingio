<p>A few missions have started to use ion thrusters in space, but it's still quite new and not extremely widespread.</p>

<p>They become popular options for communication satellites. Initially for station keeping, now increasingly also for raising the orbit. And if we go by raw numbers: At least 2/3 of all satellites launched in 2020 had ion thrusters. Not coincidentally, 2/3 of all satellites launched in 2020 were Starlink (~840 of ~1300).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Assuming they keep up their launch cadence, we could very well see most satellites on orbit being Starlink with ion thrusters by the end of the year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Going by the Starlink example it's actually the opposite. You use the continuous thrust to fight the de-acceleration due to atmospheric friction in low orbit-- that way the default action when the satellite reaches end-of-life is to naturally de-orbit itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, any thruster that can raise an orbit can also lower the orbit.</p>
<p>However, with spacex satellites, they actually need to keep using their thrusters to keep their orbit stable.  Their orbit is so low they would fall out of orbit on their own in a few years without the thrusters giving them an occasional boost.  This was means satellites that break will clean themselves from orbit no matter how they break.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The difficulty with de-orbiting satellites is that you usually want them up there working as long as possible. If they suddenly stop working/responding, then they can't receive a command to de-orbit themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>RTGs (Radioisotope thermoelectric generator) are usually only needed for spacecraft that venture very far from the sun or are otherwise in locations where direct sunlight isn't abundant. I could be wrong, but I believe for near-earth spacecraft solar panels produce more power than most RTGs do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll tack on to this answer. The Dawn space probe is a great example of a good mission for an ion drive. It explored two different objects within the asteroid belt, Vesta and Ceres. Staying within the inner solar system meant it could use solar panels to power the drive with reasonable efficiency. And the extreme fuel efficiency of the drive allowed it to move from one object to the other in different orbits around the sun with only a small amount of fuel. While the thrust was tiny, taking the craft four days at full thrust to go from 0-60mph, the probe held enough fuel to run the drive at full thrust for over a year. This gave it the highest delta v of any NASA probe (at least at the time).</p></div>		</li>
