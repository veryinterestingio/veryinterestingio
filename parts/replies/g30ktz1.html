			<div class="markdown"><p>I am an expert (in near surface geophysics, but don’t ask me about planetary geology because I don’t know) and I’m familiar with a lot of the papers referenced.</p>
<p>As an expert, I’m in awe of the parent comment you have replied to. You could have based a bloody masters thesis on the text in that comment.</p>
<p>It’s ace that you can ask a question and receive an answer that concise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah this definitely gave me a research paper vibe. All sentences are short and concise, with relevant sources at all necessary points.</p>
<p>Yeah there were some unnecessary parts but those were to account for the fact that the target audience is a layman, not a person with the same expertise.</p>
<p>Pretty amazing, really. Normally such a write-up would kill me to do, to do so for a reddit comment is unthinkable. Professors are something else</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow. Thankyou for your deeply (pun intended) detailed response. I feel like I've committed a crime by having you do so much work. I guess the response takes some of the mystery of the ocean away for me, nonetheless I'm glad I found the answers.</p></div>		</li>
