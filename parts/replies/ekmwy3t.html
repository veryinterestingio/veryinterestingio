			<div class="markdown"><p>This is really interesting, sometimes I'll notice a lack of sound when opening a can of soda and it definitely makes me anticipate liking it less. I haven't paid attention to which specific brand/flavor this applies to but it could very well be that the disappointing sound is the normal sound and I'm just expecting an engineered sound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd love reading about what car manufacturers do to make cars sound appealing to drive. Lots of tuning engines and exhaust systems to sound just right and satisfying, lots of tuning of insulation and other materials to reduce road noise, and so on.</p>
<p>IIRC a high performance manufacturer once tried playing higher-powered engine sounds through the car's speakers to make a car sound more powerful than it really was. This is also a technique used to reduce road noise- they sample the road noise and play it back through the speakers out of phase to quiet the sounds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Sun Chips noise was a side effect of trying to use PLA instead for OPP or PET. PLA is made from corn and can degrade in industrial composting (high heat and low oxygen). Frito was trying to make 'noise' in the market saying the packaging was bio based and could be compostable (implying backyard and not industrial). They knew about the noise but didn't think it was a big deal. </p>
<p>In the industry it is widely believed/known that they went back to the old film (quieter and not made of PLA) because the PLA was much more expensive and they had all the attention they were going to get and used the loud bag as the reason (to be fair it was a reason just not the primary one). Similar to the New Coke/Classic Coke event in the 80s.</p>
<p>PLA has come a long way and isn't as loud as it used to be but still costs a lot more than the natural gas derived stuff (OPP). I expect in the next 5 years you'll see it in the market more.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I had a question I hoped you could help with - I remember years ago when the inside of certain brands' packets were &quot;foil&quot;. They suggested this helped with freshness or something. Does this &quot;foil&quot; like appearance/change actually make any difference or is it just marketing?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Chip bag manufacturers in particular have been deemed to deliberately make their plastic bags especially prone to this buckling behavior by varying plastics, the thickness of the sheet, etc. They purportedly do this because a crispy bag connects you psychologically to crispy chips.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not true. I work for a food company that makes many types of packaging including potato chip bags and if we could make a quiet bag we would. There are many reasons why we use the plastics we use but at the bottom of the list is the noise generated. See my other thread below where I explain it. The noise is a correlation that exists but not by design.</p>
<p>TLDR: Not true. I design potato chip style bags f...</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I was skeptical of the claim, so I tried to word that carefully.  I mean, I've had 'louder'and 'quieter' bags from the same manufacturer for different chip products, so I'd imagine it's a side effect of the specific needs of ether product.  It does leave open that they <em>could</em> do this, just no solid evidence that they do.  Thanks for joining in!</p></div>		</li>
