			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a really good perspective. I’ll often serve guests food they go crazy over, but I’ve tasted the whole way through and think is just “meh”. The “nose blindness” could be part of it for sure, and the fact that the food is no longer novel to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve been focused on new recipes. I subscribe to several recipe sites that send out “what to cook this week” emails and I pick a recipe that looks good most weeks. It also helps that my long distance partner is here for a couple of months so I’ve had other people to cook for. </p>
<p>To continue that idea- I’ve been thinking about doing socially distant food swaps with friends. Like make a meal, pack 4 servings into individual containers and everyone meet up and share a container with the others. Like a cross between a cookie swap and a potluck, and you go home with 4 or so other meals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always wondered about why I get a little fed up with the thought of eating my own meal when it takes a lot to prepare. Is there a name for this effect?</p>
<p>Regardless, thank you. Very insightful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is 100% true. </p>
<p>My biggest complaint with using a slow cooker is being sick of the smell by the time I eat it. I think leftovers always taste better because I haven't been smelling it for the last hour while prepping whatever I just made.</p>
<p>I swear, even something stupid like Kraft Mac n Cheese tastes better when it's someone else in the kitchen making it and putting it into your bowl.</p></div>		</li>
