<p>I feel like the there is another answer here too. The irrational number is where long division fails to halt. The very idea of &quot;.3 repeating&quot; is an attempt to skirt the fact that long division decimal conversion never halts when the result is <del>irrational</del> can't be represented by the prime factors in the place value system </p>
<p>Clearly 1 divided by 3 and then multiplied by 3 MUST BE 1. </p>
<p>Really, these numbers are an artifact of the base of the number system. We have 10 unique digits, and 10 doesn't have any prime factors other than 5, 2, and 1. </p>
<p>If we switch to a base <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodecimal" target="_blank">12 number system</a>, then 1/3 is just .4 and 1/5 becomes a repeating number.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>.3 repeating isnt irrational, its 1/3. One way to think about this is as a geometric series (more ELI-college math student). .9 repeating is the same as </p>
<p>9×10^(-1) + 9×10^(-2) + 9×10^(-3) +...</p>
<p>If we factor the 9 out, then its the sum of the negative powers of 10 multiplied by 9. The sum of the negative powers of 10 can be shown to be 1/9. This leads to the value of 1.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe I am retarded, but what about this argument:
With 1, we can be certain that any decimal etc equals to 0. 1 is 1.000, and so on, like: 1.(0). Where the third digit of what after the &quot;.&quot; is 0, and that is true for each digit- which is completely untrue for 0.(9).</p>
<p>I understand the algebra for the proof of 0.(9) equalling 1, but isnt that just the byproduct of how we define numbers? What If we defined equality as what number is at each decimal, etc.  Why not?</p>
<p>Please some math person explain it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right: it is a byproduct of how we define equality. However, this definition of equality does not come out of nowhere. If we first define equality such that 0.333... = 1/3 and 1 = 3/3, then we must also conclude that 0.999... = 1. If instead we start by saying that 0.999... =/= 1, then 0.333... suddenly cannot be equal to 1/3 anymore. So it's all about defining things such that they are consistent.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Two issues.</p>
<p>Math with infinity does not behave the same as math with only finite quantities. For example, 1+1+1+...+1 (the sum of a finite number of 1's) has a specific value no matter how large a number of 1's you add together, but 1+1+1+... (the sum of an infinite number of 1's) doesn't.</p>
<p>Also, math doesn't depend on how something looks, but rather on what its value/meaning is. 1+2 has the same value as 3. So, anywhere the value 3 is used, 1+2 can be used in its place. So, just because 0.999... and 1 look different doesn't mean they are different.</p>
<p>You may say that the list 0, ., 9, 9, 9, ... is different from the list 1, ., 0, 0, 0, ... and you'd be correct. But then you're talking about lists, not the actual numbers 0.999... and 1.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1 or 0.(9) are representations of numbers,  not the numbers themselves.  Just like 2 in decimal represents the same number as 10 in binary. In our representation 1 and 0.(9) are the same number as if you subtract the difference is 0.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>By the way we represent it we know each decimal will be zero just as in the other case we know every decimal is a 9. </p>
<p>In fact in engineering and some other sciences 1.0  includes an implicit reference to the  precision with which you know the number or whatever you are measuring with the numbers.
1.0 means I know it's not 1.1 or 0.9 but it could be 1.0047 but I just haven't measured it or know precisely enough. </p>
<p>In your question you are comparing 1.(0) to 0.(9) which as mentioned before can be shown to be the same as the difference is zero. If you look at the nth decimal if you see a zero you still don't know the next one is also until you measure it or calculate it. If you do it for ever you will progressively find that the maximum possible difference between the 2 representations of the number has a limit of zero.
If we were talking of a measurement or representation without infinite precision,  you would have to round off.
And at whatever decimal you stop counting the rounding gives the same.</p></div>		</li>
