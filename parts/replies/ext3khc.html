			<div class="markdown"><p>I belive that there is a theory that the executive function issues could be caused by a lack of dopamine, causing the person with ADHD to take the quick and easy way of getting the dopamine. The stimulant provides some dopamine, bringing them to normal levels so the brain can focus on other things besides getting it's fix.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a pretty huge hole in that theory.  If it is an issue with dopamine, why don't L-DOPA (a dopamine precursor) or dopamine agonists work to treat ADHD? From what I've been able to tell, the dopamine theory fell out of favor more than 20 years ago.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's more about having difficulty deciding which things to do, especially deciding which things to do based on what you're supposed to be doing / future consequences.</p>

<p>This is really interesting to hear. I have a step-daughter who suffers from ADHD and although she is smart, she constantly gets in trouble for very minor things that it just seems like she didn't think through. Like knowing it's wrong to take food to a specific room, yet she does it anyway, and has multiple times, regardless of understanding that she will get in trouble for it.</p>
<p>We had her write a letter explaining why she did something one time and what she was going to do to avoid it in the future and she mentioned something about impulse control. I brushed it off as an excuse since her therapist didn't mention anything to us about impulse control being an issue, and she's been seeing her therapist for 2 years ...</p>
<p>So if that is truly the hallmark symptom and not her general 'excitedness,' then a lot of things suddenly make sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it helps, I am an adult with ADHD. I will do whatever I believe will make me feel good right now. As an intelligent adult I know there will be consequences further down the line but for me it's like the future doesn't exist. The only thing that matters is how I feel RIGHT NOW.</p>
<p>I will put off work until the last possible minute because I don't want to do it. Then I'll do it at the last minute and it sucks. As an adult I am aware of this pattern of behaviour but keep repeating it because, as I said, the only thing that matters is how I feel right now. </p>
<p>The future barely exists for me. If I have to think ahead I maybe think about a week ahead. Everything after that exists in some vague notion called &quot;the future&quot;. </p>
<p>Impulse control is extremely difficult. I know there are things that I NEED to do and there are things that I WANT to do, and the WANT always wins. </p>
<p>I feel sympathy for your daughter, going through this without the rational self awareness of an adult. </p>
<p>Anyway, I hope this gives you some insight into what she's going through.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm, this is an excellent summary of what it feels like. The cognitive dissonance between knowing you need to do something and yet being unable to summon the motivation to act  is actually frightening if you think about it too much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good write-up. One thing no one has talked about, that applies to my and some others ADHD, is <a href="https://www.additudemag.com/rejection-sensitive-dysphoria-and-adhd/" target="_blank">Rejection Sensitivity Dysphoria</a>. This link does a more concise job of describing it than I could, but it's basically similar to a mood disorder. When you're happy, you feel like you could take over the whole world with ease. When you make the slightest mistake or get sad, you internalize it super hard and beat the fuck out of yourself (inside) for it. Even as an adult, it is very hard to deal with, especially when you have awful impulse control, which just spawns more and more situations to feel awful about.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is me at work basically every night. &quot;I should get started, I'm going to be really mad at myself if I get into another stupid scramble to get done on time tonight.&quot; <em>(watches youtube and browses Reddit for two hours, orders some food, does literally no work at all)</em></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My 8yr old has adhd (and ODD) her impulse control had always been my first concern.  She's accident prone,  and never thinks of consequences, she doesn't focus on her work long enough to learn new things, always on the go etc etc.  I'm sure you know your child's ways well.  But low impulse and poor executive functioning seems to be a key thing with ADHD (though I could be wrong) it's like autism really in the way no two are alike.  My suggestion is,  do your research,  then sit with the therapist and ask questions,  as sometimes they assume you know it already. (Just seen another comment of yours,  also ask them the difference between ADD and Adhd )</p></div>		</li>

<p>We've done that numerous times. We have a group meeting twice a year. I've explained her poor decision making and her therapist has never mentioned it could be due to her ADHD. So this is news to me. She just says to &quot;be patient with her,&quot; which we have been.</p>
<p>Someone else mentioned it's time to find a new therapist and I think they're probably right. Sounds like this lady is not qualified - unfortunately it was who our insurance referred us to so I don't know if we'll even be allowed to go to someone else.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I can tell you now: There is currently no clinical distinction. ADD was folded into ADHD and ADHD was split into subtypes for Primary Inattentive, Primary Hyperactive, and Combined.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anecdote from my own struggles: when i was in school, i had a health class that gave out mid year progress reports that needed to be signed by a parent. I had an A in the class but still ended up with detention for failing to get the thing signed. My teacher was dumbfounded and i had no rational explanation for why i had not gotten it signed. I had been warned multiple times, but like many other things, it just got pushed aside in my brain by other stuff. </p>
<p>It was pretty frustrating growing up smart and ADD.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other caveat to smart and ADD: you don't normally struggle in school, so the typical warning signs aren't there to catch early. I was diagnosed at 27. I worked well in an well organized structure, but struggle to do well in adult life. Fortunately all my bills can be set to auto pay.</p></div>		</li>
