			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Random enough&quot; is &quot;random&quot; in this context (being a truly random number).  If it's not actually random, it's not random enough.</p>
<p>In both scenario you put forward, they are repeatable inputs.  If you did repeat the inputs, you'd get the same output.</p>
<p>A true random number is one where you cannot predict it, even knowing all of the inputs and algorithm used.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, &quot;random enough&quot; in this context means &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_randomness" target="_blank"><em>statistically</em> random</a>,&quot; meaning that there are no identifiable patterns in a dataset produced by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable" target="_blank">random variable</a> and produced datasets will pass appropriate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness_tests" target="_blank">tests for randomness</a>.</p>
<p>Statistical randomness is a distinct meaning of &quot;random&quot; which is different from both &quot;true randomness&quot; (unpredictability in principle) and pseudorandomness (unpredictability in practice).  Both a truly random process and a well-made pseudorandom process/algorithm will produce statistically random datasets, although having enough knowledge about and control over a pseudorandom process makes it possible to produce the same statistically random dataset repeatedly, or to produce a specific statistically random dataset (such as one containing a desired value or sequence).</p>
<p>Processes which generate encryption keys via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(computing\)" target="_blank">input or hardware entropy</a> are commonly pseudorandom, while processes which generate values from things like radioactive decay or perhaps atmospheric noise are thought to be truly random, at least as far as we know.</p></div>		</li>
