			<div class="markdown"><p>They've set a lower bound for the half life. Basically, &quot;we watched a lot of protons for a long time, and nothing happened, so we know the half life is at least 10^34 years.&quot; It doesn't establish that they decay at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are theories that state it might be possible for photons to have an extremely small rest mass which would allow decay to occur, however, it is still unknown whether this is possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But photons can't have rest mass though? If they had then that would mean they couldn't travel at the speed of light, and they could have an acceleration applied to them. Which means we could basically stop photons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, all we have so far are lower limits on the lifetime. &quot;If protons decay at all then their half life must be at least [giant time span]&quot;. These lower limits come from experiments not seeing decays.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heath death is the general burning out of stars and diffusion of energy. Proton decay, if it exists, may be the one of the last plausible things that ever &quot;happens&quot; in a dead universe. All stars burn out, all planets and stars get ejected from their orbits into deep space or get swallowed by black holes, black holes evaporate away via hawking radiation, quantum effects disrupt atoms so they either decay away or stabilize into iron, and eventually the balls of frozen iron slowly quantum-tunnel into blackholes which then evaporate as well.</p>
<p>These are unfathomably huge timescales though.</p></div>		</li>
