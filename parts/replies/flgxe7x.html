			<div class="markdown"><p>And what's more plenty of websites are built on content management systems like Wordpress, and you can't or really most admins shouldn't disable cookies for the user if you want basic functionality of your website to work. even if you have no ads or trackers or anything external from your own server.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Session cookies don’t require permission. It’s the tracking cookies you give permission to. If it’s only for session cookies, why ask for permission if you aren’t logging in? They could just wait to ask permission when you login...</p>
<p>The permission they’re asking for are tracking cookies, to track your interests based on the pages you’re visiting.</p>
<p>Imagine visiting 10 websites. All these websites make money by adding ads to their website. These ads are served by a 3rd party. This 3rd party looks at the page you’re visiting, looking at anything you’re doing (scrolling, viewing products, etc) and logs all of this and keeps all of these logs under a unique identifier.</p>
<p>This identifier is stored in a cookie, and you give permission to let your browser store this identifier and use it again next time you visit any other website with the same 3rd party ads.</p>
<p>This next visit, the 3rd party knows you’ve been looking at washing machines, or shoes, and serves you ads related to that. Even when you already bought that washing machine: that the 3rd party does not know. But it knows you looked for it, so enjoy seeing these washing machines everywhere.</p>
<p>That’s what you’re agreeing to, and agreed once on any site, you’ll be tracked on them all, even if you decline the cookie on the other sites: the cookie is already set, so you’re being tracked indefinitely.</p>
<p>Tracking cookies are a tool to keep track of anything you do online. One party knows exactly which webpages you are visiting, even if you’re not interacting with the ads.</p>
<p>The same for social media buttons: they also let facebook know what pages you’re visiting, even if you’re not a Facebook member.</p>
<p>With this data, you can guess or even determine the person’s:</p>
<ul>
<li>age</li>
<li>gender</li>
<li>race</li>
<li>hobbies</li>
<li>interests</li>
<li>location</li>
<li>whether the person is home</li>
<li>when the person is home regularly </li>
<li>when you go shopping</li>
<li>when you get your salary </li>
<li>job / profession</li>
<li>financial status</li>
<li>health, physical and mental</li>
<li>politic interests </li>
<li>whether you’re a furry or not</li>
<li>your favorite color</li>
<li>a lot more</li>
</ul>
<p>Because this data is very dangerous, governments are TRYING to regulate them. Waste of time IMO, but better than doing nothing.</p>
<p>Adblockers prevent tracking by blocking the 3rd parties from injecting code in the webpages, simply by blocking anything from the domains of these 3rd parties. That’s why adblockers are so effective and cannot be bypassed. Just block the advertising company’s servers. Of course, the website does know the scripts are blocked, but they cannot do anything about that except for telling you to turn off your adblocker.</p>
<p>Adblockers are the easiest way to prevent being tracked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Installed&quot; is a very inaccurate and misleading word to use here.</p>
<p>A cookie is basically the website's version of a &quot;Take A Number&quot; ticket, or the &quot;Table Number&quot; card that you get from a restaurant where you order at the counter and they deliver it to your table.</p>
<p>You go to the website and submit a request. The website says &quot;okay your number is 69 please take this cookie to the next page&quot;. The website processes your request, sends you to the next page, and gives you the information you want in exchange for that cookie. It only knows what information to give you because of the &quot;number&quot; associated with that  request.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cookies are not executable files -- they are pieces of text-based data that the website uses to keep track of things.</p>
<p>If it sets your mind at ease, the website doesn't need your permission from a <em>technical</em> perspective, they only ask for your permission because of new <em>legal</em> requirements.</p>
<p>That means that if a website is bothering to ask you, they're doing it for legitimate purposes. If they were going to install something malicious, they wouldn't ask.</p>
<p>The term &quot;special files&quot; and &quot;installed&quot; in the above response are not accurate or helpful.</p></div>		</li>
