			<div class="markdown"><p>Hello!  Quick question for you.. I had braces from age 13-16.  The last time I was at the dentist was when I was about 20.  I am 32 (yes I know this is horrible and I am about to pay for it when I visit soon).  I still have the &quot;permanent retainer&quot; behind my lower front teeth as the last time I'd been there, they wanted me to keep it on.  Do you expect that the removal will be the same as when they removed my braces?  It has been quite some time so I don't know if that would affect the removal.  I am dreading the day because I could not stand the feeling of the scraping or sanding during the regular braces removal.  Perhaps this is part of the reason I have avoided the dentist.  The other being that every time I had cavities taken care of, the shots hurt and would make my neck nerves feel like they were clenching as the medication went in.  I also have a hard time keeping my jaw open a long time as it seems to have TMJ.    </p>
<p>But long story short..  since I said it would be a quick question (oops!), do you think time will have an affect on the ease of removal of the permanent retainer?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So usually the lingual retainers can be first pulled off with a tool and then the same drill and bur are used to take off any remaining glue (in the same way as with braces), but generally there is much less glue applied to retainers vs. braces since it’s just glue dots on a wire, and many times the glue pops off with the retainer when it gets pulled off. So it shouldn’t be as bad as getting braces glue off. Hope that helps :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to piggyback on this one since I have a lingual retainer question, too! 30+ years ago after I got my braces off I received a permanent lower retainer. Unfortunately my ortho passed away shortly thereafter so I never got the full instructions on what happens next. 10+ years later I asked my (crappy) dentist if the thing was supposed to come off at some point and he popped it off, much to my surprise. Now decades later my lower front teeth are crowding/misaligning. Was I supposed to wear that thing to my grave?</p></div>		</li>
