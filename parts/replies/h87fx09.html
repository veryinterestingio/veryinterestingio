			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not much of a gambler but if casinos show their odds as 35 to 1 such as a single number in roulette and you hit that number, whatever you put on that spot will return 35x as much. </p>
<p>Is it different for sports wagers? Do the odds represent 2 decimal spaces to the left as you described?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Moneyline odds (so things like +350 and - 1000) represent the profit you'd make on a $100 bet. +350 odds means I'd get my wager plus 350 dollars back in a 100 dollar bet. -125 odds means that I have to bet 125 dollars to get my wager back plus 100 bucks. </p>

<li>bets are underdogs, and - bets are favorites.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, it's one of the worst bets in the casino. Most slot machines will even payout better than roulette</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s actually American roulette and exactly why American roulette sucks compared to European roulette. </p>
<p>Euro has only one 0. </p>
<p>It’s 36 to 1, as in 1 is your wager and you get 36 units back. </p>
<p>So it cost you the one chip, you receive 36 back in turn, only adding 35 to your stack.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No you are right.   The problem is that unless a team with odds worse than 32:1 actually wins the Superbowl,  you are going to lose money.</p>
<p>Even if a 30:1 mid-tier team gets in all together and wins,  you are still going to coming out negative on this.</p></div>		</li>
