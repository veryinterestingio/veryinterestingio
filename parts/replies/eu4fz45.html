			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven’t heard much about alligator die-offs from algae blooms…I can tell you that alligator blood has special properties that make it especially resistant to infection from a variety of strains of bacteria and for those reasons it's thought to be useful in the creation of new antibiotics. Other than that information though I don’t know much about the effect of toxic algae blooms/botulism on alligators but suspect that it could be negatively impacting them. I’ll have to look more into that!</p></div>		</li>
