			<div class="markdown"><p>I would add that the types of jobs we are preparing students for are primarily big city jobs. I personally wouldn't mind living in a smaller town, but I have no idea what I would do for a living to use the skills I've accumulated after 25 plus years working in an office, let alone something that would pay me the same amount.</p>

<p>Now young adults out of college are flocking to cities to get jobs in the field they just spend years learning. Where land is tight, homes are expensive and its overcrowded, making services more expensive too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that the land issue is hugely underrated. The previous generations (since the great wars, at least) were much more willing to move into a small town in the middle of a rural area. More recent generations are trying to all pile up in popular places like Silicon Valley, where the housing crisis is astronomical. There are various reasons for this, some cultural, some economic, and some political.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I currently live in a small town where all the rentals are owned by one family. The cheapest studio is $1200/mo, no utilities included, no pets allowed. $800/mo income reduced.</p>
<p>The highest paying job in town is $15/hr, and that's only part-time. Plus, everyone working there has worked there for twenty years already.</p>
<p>There is no future in staying in this small town. Every new business that opens fails within six months.</p>
<p>Granted, I don't know if this is common in small towns, but moving to a city is the only way my family will survive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I don't understand about stuff like this. You represent a potential for a small business to swoop in and hire you for much cheaper than other places in the country. Why don't they? This is why small business development is so incredibly important to the health of an economy as a whole. You can't run a small town like yours on purely big business, as they experience greater economies of scale and other advantages when closer to big cities. If a consortium of small businesses start up in an area, then maybe a local older guy who wants to invest some of his retirement money in real estate builds a lower-priced apartment complex. Everything depends so much on momentum unfortunately.</p>
<p>In my area there is a strong culture of small businesses, which drives wages up a bit. I actually just started one myself a few months ago when the corporation I was working for offered me severance. Things do look very different when you're looking for stuff to do in exchange for money rather than an available job.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The stock market has had the longest period of growth in the history of the United States until the last couple months.  Are you saying the housing market’s issues started just a couple months ago?   Are you claiming that the 2008 crash caused property prices to increase?  On the surface the logic seems wrong on this one without some further explanation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We're back to 2008 prices.  It was a bubble then and it was reinflated to protect the equity of <del>homeowners</del> banks.</p>
<p>Now there are no &quot;starter homes&quot; because why build them if you could put a 2500 sqft house on the same piece of land?</p>
<p>Everything that wasn't worth flipping is now a rental property thanks to the people who beat millennials to the property ladder.</p>
<p>So, now you have the choice of paying eternal mortgage insurance on your 30 year FHA loan on more house than you'll want to heat and cool for at least the next decade or you can pay your landlord's mortgage and watch home ownership fade in to the distance.</p></div>		</li>
