<p>The energy for the tides comes from the Earths rotation, this has been around since its formation and slowly decreasing since the moon was formed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That energy was stored in the earth at its formation as rotational kinetic energy, since it is rotating. It was rotating at the beginning because, like the rest of the solar system, it formed out of a collapsing gas cloud which had some initial angular momentum that had to be conserved. Slowly, that energy is being lost and going into the tides and also the potential energy of the moon, so the earth is now rotating slower than it once was. It's not that the earth is consistently generating <em>new</em> energy, it's just skimming some off the top of what it already has.</p></div>		</li>
