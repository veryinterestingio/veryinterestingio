			<div class="markdown"><p>They have a decent window to launch from, and they can make adjustments during the flight, and they plan for that with their fuel budget. Unless something goes terribly wrong, NASA had a pretty high degree of accuracy on their landing.</p>
<p>Imagine if a sniper had 7 months and remote controlled rocket controls on their bullet, and they knew exactly where the target was going to be when it gets there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as departing goes, it does matter which way the craft is going when it fires its engines (each orbit, that direction changes a full 360), so you can base that on the time of the launch, or do a partial orbit to get where you want to. For interplanetary missions, this isn't too big of a deal, since you also need to deal with other scheduling issues.</p>
<p>The date, though, is really important, since that's what sets ups the trajectory; a different time of year, and Mars wouldn't be where you want it to be. There's no hard line, though: there's a perfect point where the rocket would burn the least amount of fuel possible, but then it just gets a little worse when you miss it by a little bit. Three missions went to Mars in 2020, over the course of a few weeks. You can even it out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>thanks. By &quot;Date&quot; I really meant the specific day. I realize that months would make a big difference.</p></div>		</li>
