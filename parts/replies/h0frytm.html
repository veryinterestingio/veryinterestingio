			<div class="markdown"><p>Not them, but that number is about right for Earth atmosphere at typical pressures and temperatures.</p>
<p>Quickly looked it up in Wolfram Alpha, 1km^2 of earth air is about 1.3 million tons at sea level pressure and 60ÂºF.</p>
<p>It'll get lighter as you go up, but most clouds are lower than you'd expect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Earth atmospheric air in roughly ground-ish level conditions.</p>
<p>Technically at ground level it's more like 1.2, and as you get higher that drops.  At 2km it's <em>actually</em> 1.0, 8.5ish km is 0.5, etc.</p>
<p>Point is that air (the stuff we deal with normally) is actually pretty heavy.</p></div>		</li>
