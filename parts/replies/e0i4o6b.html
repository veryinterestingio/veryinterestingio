			<div class="markdown"><p>To add another analogy (and my favourite), memories are like numerous houses in a blizzard and it is constantly snowing. Every time we learn something, some guy shovels a path between two houses. If it is really important, a road gets built. If it is really really important, a highway gets built. </p>
<p>It takes a lot more snow to cover a highway than a small shovelled path, so we can more easily recall these memories. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One I've heard is like paths in a forest - the more people (neurons) that walk on the path, the more the foliage gets stomped out, like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_path" target="_blank">desire path</a>. An unused path has vegetation grow over it over time, and it becomes more unusable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't know everything simultaneously, so instead some information you use repeatedly is stored close by so you can use it faster, since it comes up more often.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As another analogy, which I'm making up right now, it's like a desk you put paperwork on every day.  Sometimes you organize the paperwork a little, and paperwork you have to use a lot you set in the corner... But a lot of paperwork stays in the big stack, getting lost to time in the middle and the bottom of the stack, but that's okay, because we don't use that paperwork often, if at all, anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good response, but I wanted to add a small correction - A computer database typically indexes records specifically to avoid looking at every item in the set.  One way to visualize this is with a Rolodex that stores the names and addresses of all your friends. You don’t have to go through every entry to find something in the Rolodex because it’s alphabetically ordered and you can quickly hone in on any given name in the list.</p>
<p>Another more sophisticated way that computers access data efficiently is through use of a hash table

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. From OP's description, it seems like recognition is sort of like indexing? A face has a &quot;hash&quot; that maps directly to a &quot;row&quot; (or a few rows. Identical twins are now called hash collisions ?), whereas recall is… something else? I mean, using a piece of data to find the most likely path, and then incorporating whether it was the right path back into future decisions about what's likely… sounds like a neural network, but that's not really a useful analogy, given where that term comes from.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very eloquently put!  I will add a bit of clarification as to how these “pathways” come to store the memories.</p>
<p>The pathways mentioned refer to a series of neurons in the brain. Any experience we have in our lives will activate a set of these neurons, essentially sending an electrical impulse down the length of one neuron that then gets passed along to the next neuron and so on. For example, if a mailman is taking a new route and he comes a cross a big scary dog, certain sets of neurons will increase their electrical activity. This essentially “revs up” those neurons. The more times a neuron is stimulated, the more revved up it becomes. Therefore, it becomes easier to stimulate that neuron again. The effect builds with repetitive activations of the same cell (or group of cells). Of note, all electrical impulses in neurons are the same strength. Since no signal is stronger or weaker than another, neurons use frequency (repetitive impulses) to signify intensity. </p>
<p>This is exactly why repeating a task over and over helps you commit it to memory. The more times you do something, the easier it is to remember. However, in the case of our mailman, it is also why he will remember the location of the dog after only one encounter (scary dog is an intense stimulus, so the brain experiences rapid and repetitive firing of the same neurons to signify intensity). In both cases, the neurons are stimulated again and again, making them easier to stimulate in the future (easier recall). This is a more specific explanation for the formation of short and medium term memories. These are actually two different cellular processes called short- and long-term potentiation (STP and LTP). </p>
<p>Long term memory formation involves structural changes in the cells that are described above. </p>
<p>Source: Eric Kandel wrote an excellent book describing his discovery of STP and LTP. His book is called, In Search of Memory. </p>
<p>Disclaimer: I apologize if this isn’t the most well-written post. I haven’t had much sleep.</p></div>		</li>
