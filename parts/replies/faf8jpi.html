<p>I remember going to some show for a few small local bands back in the day. my SO at the time really really liked this band that performed so she bought their album. Wasn't even close to sounding as good as they did live. Even the shitty short video she took of the show on her phone sounded better than the recorded album.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One aspect of what you are saying confuses me. I agree that two people harmonizing creates a third sound,. I'm having trouble seeing why playing a recording of each individual wouldnt do the same. After all, each sound wave is technically occurring at the same time, in the same room. </p>
<p>For example,on  YouTube, I watched a video where this guy sings all four parts of barbershop quartet himself. I'm assuming he sang each track separate, then used studio equipment to play each track at the same time.  The end result was four voices singing different notes. I dont see why it would make a difference if he had 3 friends singing at the same time.</p>
<p>Am I misunderstanding something key?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you record seperately in the same room you'll still get those same resonances.  The real reason why live harmony sounds better is that the singers are actively tuning themselves more accurately by feeling the resonance and, typically, live singers are better singers.</p></div>		</li>

Even if you provide the previously recorded singer for them in headphones, they play off each other better in person, live. Your brain can pick this out subconsciously as you listen, as their mood and inflections can play off each other in improvised ways. It’s almost impossible to get this when post processing individual recordings together. It’s the human factor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you record from a mic, you capture a single composite sound wave that encapsulates everything the mic picked up - the singers, the reverb of the room itself, and the sympathetic resonance of anything on the room, including mic stands, people, etc.  This complicated blend of resonance sounds, for lack of a better term, real, or organic.  The room itself is an extremely important component of recording, put your hand a few inches in front of your mouth and talk, and think about how drastic of a difference it makes.</p>
<p>When you record two people in two mics, you capture two separate composite sound waves that do not include some of those combined sympathetic resonances.  If you mix the two together, you get a composite sound wave of those two separate soundwaves, which are not going to have them either. You are then going to play that back through one single speaker (unless you split the tracks to left and right in a stereo or surround sound recording anyway). Those two soundwaves, the single track and mixed recording, are not going to look the same or sound the same. They'll this behave differently out of the same speaker setup.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This doesn't sound quite true from a physics point of view. But I could be wrong.</p>
<p>I think those same echos and resonances will also be present in the individual recordings if you recorded the singers one by one. And when you add up the tracks the result will match the recording if you recorded everything at once. Doesn't matter if you have the interference before recording or after recording, the end result after interference is the same.</p>
<p>One small thing does change, that's the sympathetic resonance effect of the instruments on other instruments. Ie. a piano will cause resonance on a guitar's strings. But this effect is slight, and I don't think it's important when we're talking about the sound of the singers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the great explanation.  I feel like another factor is the combined imperfections of recording and playback.  </p>
<p>Microphone frequency response isn't 100% perfect; different frequencies are picked up more or less strongly by each individual microphone.  The makings of a microphone and how it affects the frequency response is a hugely complex subject.  </p>
<p>Recording mediums also have a frequency response.  The voice data must be encoded and written to something for playback.  We all know how a vinyl record stores an analog waveform of the sound in the grooves.  The stylus rides in that groove and the cartridge which converts movement to signal will not have a flat response.  Digital storage is a relatively new concept and it involves chopping the voice data into samples at a speed of 44kHz.  Often times that data is compressed - and most audio compression algorithms (mp3, for example) use mathematical tricks to approximate the signal using less data.  The output is very different than the input, especially in digital mediums.</p>
<p>Once the signal is reproduced, however faithfully, it is played back through an amplifier and speaker.  Amplifiers are their own complicated world that bring sometimes desirable character into recordings.  Analog tube amplifiers are often prized for the &quot;warmth&quot; that they give to music.  Digital amplifiers however must break down the signal into frequency components and amplify those separately then recombine the signal.  This stage is usually rife with harmonic distortion - that means the frequency composition of the individual signals is true but the phase of those signals may be out of sync and once recombined - audible constructive interference occurs.  </p>
<p>Lastly the speakers translate that signal into sound.  The speaker itself may have several drivers within it, each tuned to a different tonal range.  Woofers, tweeters, etc.  We're all familiar with speakers of varying quality and sizes.  Typically in a recording studio, these speakers are called reference monitors and they're incredibly expensive because the tonal response is balanced for industrial use - almost perfectly flat.  The studio does not want to hear the speaker, they want to hear the sound the speaker is recreating.  But even then, it's not quite perfect.  </p>
<p>All of this adds up to make the sound different.  You generally don't care about compression losses when listening to audiobooks of human speech.  Crumby speaker drivers and a cheap amplifier might mean your favorite band doesn't sound as great in your car as they do in live performances.  The wax phonograph that recorded Lincoln sounds fucking awful but it is also a recording of Lincoln!  For most purposes, it does an adequate job.  But spectral analysis will show distinct and measurable differences from the original sound.  New features added during these steps like the harmonic distortion directly affect - you guessed it - harmonizing multiple singers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is one of the better answers here, but quite frankly I don't know that this is going to be fully answered in a ELI5 thread, which also happens to be full of misinformation. </p>
<p>There are a lot of differences between 60s music and music today that could account. For one, everything then was recorded in the world's best recording studios. The rooms were designed and professionally treated to sound amazing for recording, whereas many artists record in home studios these days, which can still be very good but aren't going to be at the same level. They typically don't need to be, because most music these days also includes a bunch of stuff that isn't recorded in the room (MIDI, samples, etc.) which brings me to my 2nd significant difference, which is that recordings today typically have a lot more going into them, so you can't necessarily hear that airy beauty of the harmonies. </p>
<p>And the 3rd difference is that in the 60s they used a lot of plate delays, which aren't nearly as popular now. Those things are super bright.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't understand this. </p>
<p>The sound waves are stacking at my end of the speaker too, aren't they?</p>
<p>It seems like a 2kHz melody plus say a 2.4kHz harmony is what creates some specific other kHz overtone(s).  Why does it matter whether the 2kHz+2.4kHz are happening inside that room or this room?</p>
<p>We're not talking about about ambient acoustic features are we?  Because I understand there are fidelity limitations in the playback chain.  But won't those limitations apply to the same overtones whether recorded or not?</p>
<p>I mean, if my earbuds (or the mix for that matter) can't distinctly produce some particular minute frequency, then it can't <em>reproduce</em> one that occurred in the live studio either.  Or can it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think its more the self-tempering phenomena described by posters deeper in the chain, but above this post. </p>
<p>Singers in the room recording vocals at the same time - the 2kHz melody might be harmonized with a 2.405kHz (when 2.4kHz is what the note is &quot;defined&quot; as) because when being sung at the same time, the third is 4/3 the root, and the fifth is 3/2 the root). Singing them accurately, but separately where you aren't actually singing next to someone singing the root or related harmonies out loud, might not let you pick up on the cues experienced singers internalize to make the very slight adjustments needed to sing a note just ever so slightly sharp or flat to make it perfectly right for that root.</p>
<p>To your speakers point, the speakers can reproduce whatever is inputted, basically, which is why the CSNY recording has that feel and we hear it, but I guess the theory rests on the idea that hearing the melody in an earpiece in order to match it isn't enough of a cue to get the singers singing the other parts to make the microtuning moves to come into &quot;perfect&quot; harmony that's better than &quot;well tempered&quot; harmony.    </p>
<p>I think that's the hypothesis distilled. I could definitely be misunderstanding above posters points. </p>
<p>My two cents is it might be a bit of that but also lots of decisions about vocal tone/breathiness, and the distance of the harmony from the melody that are just particular to certain artists. I mean <em>lots</em> of Iron &amp; Wine, especially the early stuff, has this effect, though isn't as &quot;Simon and Garfunkle-y&quot; to my ear mostly because the harmonies in I&amp;W are &quot;closer&quot; to the melody, <a href="https://youtu.be/GnhS1wJtZ_s?t=99" target="_blank">see this song for instance,</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg4CCy2kbuA" target="_blank">or this song.

<p>Listening from a distance of half a century there are lots of things that seem to stand out about CSNY including 1) Folk singers who were used to projecting, harmonizing and had a sense of time annealed by magnitudes more gigging than most working musicians today 1) Vocal arrangements unashamedly full of minor thirds 2) A simple 1960s mid-range mix down, and 3) 1960s sounding microphones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Career Producer and engineer fir more than 30 years: The relative overtone levels, and more importantly, phase relationships, will change slightly, depending on  performance and acoustics. The resonance of the room also affects the end result, as the room itself will color the sound differently if recorded all at once, vs track at a time. But my best explanation as to why there would be an audible difference is vibrato: the singers rate and depth of vibrato (repeating fluctuations away from “perfect” pitch) is much more easily “locked together”, instinctually, when they sing together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting question, I'll see if I can help you out here.</p>
<p>I'm trained in &quot;classical&quot; music, so we have to do a lot of this kind of work.</p>
<p>When you construct chords you don't just hit the notes, you have to re-tune them to match the needs of the chord. This is why pianos have multiple strings per key, each one is tuned <em>just slightly</em> differently.</p>
<p>Now say we wanted to make a chord using middle C and it's 5th, G. Well you'd normally say &quot;ok, we use a perfectly in tune c and a perfectly in tune g and  that's it. Problem is that it isn't it. It sounds nice, but it's not &quot;perfect&quot;. We actually have to re-tune that G up just a few cents (a few fractions of a wavelength).  </p>
<p>When you're side by side you can do that more easily because you hear the natural sound beside you. When you are in a recording booth and listening on a head set you're now affected by the limitations of the microphone and the headphones you're wearing. Because of this it becomes harder to properly identify what to do and when/how far to do it.</p>
<p>When I was in university I took great pride in being able to adjust my tuning to the needs of the harmony of the ensemble.</p>
<p>Our harmonic series is also super huge and complex and reproducing that electronically is surprisingly challenging given different instruments and materials respond to frequencies differently. So software like auto-tune may not be able to capture and reproduce the full richness of a sound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On a piano, each unison string being tuned slightly different from the next is a bug, not a feature. The real trick is in why most notes have three strings, which is exactly why an orchestra of threes sounds better than an orchestra of twos: beating is way less prominent with three sources than with two sources! The third one will either match one of the others (making one frequency louder, thus making the beating quieter) or they'll all be different (making disguised complex beating instead of obvious simple beating). As the strings get thicker for the low notes, three becomes infeasible (and the naturally slower beating is less of an issue anyway), and ultimately multiples become unnecessary/impossible altogether at the very bottom. Having more than one string in unison is actually for sustain.</p>
<p>Singers will sing with perfect intervals rather than equally tempered intervals, yes, although this is possible regardless of being in the same room or being isolated. I can see it being easier in the same room, though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This has to do with the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_temperament" target="_blank">equal temperament</a> for tuning, which means that no intervals but octaves will be exact ratios. This is compared to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_intonation" target="_blank">just intonation</a>, which makes some ratios exact (depending on which tuning is used), but other intervals are further off.</p></div>		</li>
