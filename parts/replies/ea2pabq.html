			<div class="markdown"><p>I think Rubber Soul better marks that moment, as it was pretty much the first “concept album”. Then of course Pet Sounds managed to perfect that idea, prompting the Beatles to follow suit with Sgt. Peppers. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is probably the 100th time that someone’s commented this in the thread, but by the late 60’s albums were changing. Originally, they were mainly just collections of singles with filler tracks and B-sides in order to make extra cash. There were obviously expections to this (there’s a Sinatra album who’s title currently escapes me that people like to use as an example), but I think Pepper was sort of a beacon that represented the switch. Albums were now pieces of art. You saw them all as one unit. A piece of art. It was a very interesting time. </p>
<p>People still do those kinds of albums today, but they’re definitely not the norm. </p></div>		</li>
