			<div class="markdown"><p>You clearly hear the robotnik when in the first call it said &quot;at 12 pm&quot; and uh... &quot;12 pm&quot;. </p>
<p>I'd definitely make note of it in a call, but there's no way in hell I'd guess it'd be an AI unless warned</p>
<p>The second call would be entirely different if it wasn't for either a language barrier, the dogshit audio quality in phone calls, or both</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha... the first time I heard this I misunderstood the context, so I thought the hair salon had the Google assistant. And I never suspecting it was the caller. So I thought it sounded great, but a little over the top with the &quot;dialect&quot; (not sure what it's called in English... the way her tone goes up at the end of each word...).   </p>
<p>So I was fooled!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. With those old bots like smarterchild on AIM, they were impressive(for the time) and yet it was pretty clear where their understanding ended. It was pretty simple for even me as a child to mess with it immensely. With this understanding context, its hard to see where it's limits are. Of course they exist, but they're not quite as obvious</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was another criticism of the calls, though. There were questions about if the calls were faked or edited. Your average Google Assistant can't typically understand accents that thick or parse questions that complex.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess it depends how and when you use it. Back when I bought my google home, I did so because alexa was shit at answering not-so-common questions about space that my son had. However, I just tested it again right now and it knows the answers. My point is they're all constantly-evolving and one might be better in some ways one month and worse the next.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have more issues with Google not being consistent with how it answers things. Latest example is trying to navigate to my friend's place. I added their address to their contact info so I could try out doing &quot;Hey Google, navigate me to Contact Name&quot;. Two weeks ago when I tried it, it was unable to interpret my friend's full name correctly, but was able to navigate if I said &quot;navigate me to Contact N.&quot;. This week, it's able to understand my friend's full name fine, but it would just say &quot;Sorry, I could not find a location by that name&quot;(or something similar) when I tried both their full name and their first name + initial.</p></div>		</li>
