			<div class="markdown"><p>In my experience, it’s basically when your brain just stops working. I can’t recall information, it’s really difficult to hold conversations, and everything become hazy - it’s a pretty severe impediment to productivity. A lot of people that experience chronic fatigue have trouble with brain fog.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel it’s probably a combination of stress, fatigue and hunger. As a manager in a high stress restaurant, I’ll occasionally find myself bombarded with a few things at once and loose all my multitasking skills and just start fucking shit up and unable to collect my thoughts. Usually takes about 60 seconds for me to breathe and come back out. I’ve noticed it only happens when I’m busting ass and not sleeping and forgetting to eat properly a few days in a row. This is just my experience though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have persistent depressive disorder and I was untreated for about 10 years with a brief 6 month in the middle while I was on meds. Being in that state for so long completely fucked up my cognitive abilities and they still haven’t fully recovered. But I had bad brain fog. I would “sundown” like a goddamn NFL player. Like around 6:00 I wouldn’t be able to think clearly or concentrate on anything and it would get worse until I went to bed. I was getting 8 hours of sleep a night usually. I was going to school and I had to get my work done at a certain time or I couldn’t read anymore because I couldn’t even make it through a couple sentences without forgetting what I read or otherwise not understanding. And your memory goes. I still have trouble remembering what I did yesterday or knowing what day it is or any number of things. I have to keep notes about things and people because I don’t remember. It was incredibly frustrating. And you can feel shit’s wrong. Like you can feel that your brain isn’t working right in some weird way.</p>
<p>I’m a bit better now and I’ve been on my meds for a while. I would not wish that kinda thing on anybody. It’s fucking horrible. That and clinical depression.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Brain fog is a colloquial term describing cognitive impairment. Memory, focus, mood, and decision making are typically cited. </p>
<p>Personally I have ADHD, which is like permanent brain fog if that helps.</p></div>		</li>
