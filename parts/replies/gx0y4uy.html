			<div class="markdown"><p>To break this down a little more (ha ha), the reason an object has color is because it is absorbing some wave lengths of light. So if you see something green, it appears green because the object is absorbing non-green wavelengths. That absorbed energy causes the color absorbing materials to break down.</p>
<p>EDIT: To clarify. the light that is in the visible spectrum is pretty weak as far as light goes. The bulk of sunlight's energy is in the UV spectrum, and that's what drives the bleaching. But pigments have cool carbon bonds that let them catch interesting spectrums of light, which is why the pigments are particularly susceptible (except for metal paints, which Kolahnut gets into below).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From a chemistry perspective, organic-based dyes show color due to their chemical structure (specifically, resonance and aromatic bonds). UV light has the particular energy to break apart these structures - resulting in less apparent color. </p>
<p>Metal-based pigments (titanium, zinc, copper) also produce color, but through a different mechanism. These do not have the same kinds of bonds as organic dyes, so they do not degrade when exposed to UV light.</p>
<p>However, the design challenge is that dyes only really work because they bond to the clothing. Dyes will partially bond to cotton and polyesters whereas metal-based paints will wash out in contact with water. There are some dyes that resist UV degradation, but it still remains a challenge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some things break down quickly/easily, some take a lot longer, and some are extremely stable and will last a long time. One interesting example of this is paintings: some pigments are less stable than others, so we know that there are old paintings that don’t look the same as when they were made because certain colors have faded. <a href="https://cen.acs.org/articles/94/i5/Van-Goghs-Fading-Colors-Inspire.html" target="_blank">This article</a> talks about how Van Gogh’s paintings have changed over time, and that in some cases it happened fast enough for him to notice during his lifetime. In a letter to his brother he said “Paintings fade like flowers. All the more reason to boldly use them too raw, time will only soften them too much. ”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theres also a thing called <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_coloration" target="_blank">structural coloring</a> whereby light interacts with and reflects off highly organized structures (usually on the nanoscale) to generate color. Examples include certain butterflies, fruit, peacock feathers, and chameleons (to a certain extent). </p>
<p>Since this is not pigment coloring as described in the top answer the color does not fade.</p></div>		</li>

<p>My understanding is that normal window glass cuts out most UV.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are different wavelengths of UV. Regular glass blocks the higher-energy UV photons, but UVA still pass through it. UVB causes sunburns, and is mostly blocked by window glass, which is where the idea that &quot;most UV is blocked by glass&quot; comes from. UVA causes tanning, skin aging, and cancer, and it can also bleach dyes and pigments. There are special films that can be applied to glass to reduce UVA as well, and those are used in museums or other archival applications.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I have some posters I hold dear frames. Looks like I need to invest in some of that film! Full UV protected frames are hella expensive I just learned</p></div>		</li>
