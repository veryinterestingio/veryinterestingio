			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great question. Our current picture and analysis have indeed shown that Einstein's theory is consistent with what we have observed but we still have a lot of data and other sources to analyze. Future analysis and observations could show that Einstein's theory can't fully explain what happens near the event horizon of a black hole. </p>

<p>In terms of what I predict, I don't know yet! I would love to see that the shadow has a shape that is different from what Einstein's theory predicts, but this is the fun part of science, nobody yet knows!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Literally the single greatest thing any real scientist can say.  The quest for knowledge is humanity's most significant endeavor imo.</p></div>		</li>
