			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding a quick example just to simplify it, during WW1 and 2 many countries began issuing War Bonds to citizens, which were EXCEPTIONALLY long yield short term bonds that the government would use to finance the military.</p>
<p>I.e. buy a war bond for $10, in five or ten years (depending on the bond) get $12 back. And you could buy quite a lot. </p>
<p>Anyway, imagine that but now on a multi billion dollar scale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm still a bit confused, because this seems like an endless cycle of ever-growing debt. The government needs your $10 today and promises to give you $12 in 5 years. But surely in 5 years if they have to give you $12, they'll need to borrow $12 from someone else by way of a savings bond to make up for it (unless they've magically reduced their spending to a manageable level). Meaning they'll owe that lender about $14 in another 5 years. Then around $17 five years after that. How does it end? It sounds like borrowing from one credit card to pay off your other one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a nitpick, but only 77% of the total debt is held by the public at all. 23%, $5.9 Trillion,  is intragovernmental holdings, like the Social Security Trust Fund. It brings in more revenue currently than it expends, so it takes the excess revenue and invests in US Treasurys, which serves to shift the excess revenue to the general fund where the government spends it as needed, and the SSTF collects on the notes as they mature. </p>
<p>Other major holders of intragovernmental debts are the Office of Personnel Management Retirement (Federal employee pension fund) with $929 Billion in Treasurys, the Military retirement fund at $913 Billion in Treasurys, Medicare (including the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund) at $226 Billion, all other retirement funds at $253 Billion, and cash on hand to to fund federal government operations at $671 Billion. </p>
<p>All of those agencies reinvest parts of their budget to fund their retirement funds. The government writes itself an IOU and banks that economic growth will outpace inflation enough to pay themselves off with interest. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Of the 77% that is held by the public ($20 trillion), roughly a third ($6.78 Trillion) is held by foreign governments, Japan with the most at $1.26 Trillion and China in second at $1.08 Trillion. </p>
<p>From there by far the biggest holders are the Federal Reserve at $2.3 Trillion, Mutual Funds at $2.3 Trillion, State and local governments (to include their pension funds) at $1 Trillion, Private corporate pension funds at $740 Billion, Insurance companies at $207 Billion, US Savings bonds at $151 Billion, and then all other individuals, government-sponsored enterprises, brokers and dealers, banks, bank personal trusts and estates, corporate and non-corporate businesses, and all other investors at $2.37 Trillion. </p>

<p>The government writes itself an IOU</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For anyone who's heard a phrase like this before -- or something like &quot;The runaway government spending has caused Washington to raid Social Security and replace the funds with a bunch of worthless IOUs&quot; -- the first paragraph in the comment is what that inflammatory rhetoric really means.</p>
<p>You know how most 401ks retirement funds have &quot;target funds&quot; that target your retirement date with a mix of stocks and bonds that shifts more towards bonds as you get closer to retirement? What do you think those &quot;bonds&quot; are? Government bonds. The same bonds that Social Security buys. The Social Security Trust Fund ends up with <em>more</em> money by buying these bonds than if it just let all the money sit in an account. Is you 401k being raided by the government when you invest some of it in government bonds? No? Well neither is Social Security.</p>
<p>The IOUs aren't empty promises that the government just writes itself and will never pay off. It's the same promise that backed war bonds, or that bond your great aunt bought you when you were 11, or all the bonds your pension or retirement fund invests in.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So the $1200 stimulus checks, those are added to our national debt? If we were to pay that debt back, who do we pay it to? Or is it not debt? Is it just extra printed money that waters down the value of the dollar? I'm so confused on how that works lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, but not really. </p>
<p>What the $1200 stimulus check was, was a refundable tax credit similar to the child tax credit. But instead of being claimed when you go to file your return next year (for this year), they fronted you the money. In other words, it was a prepayment on a refund of taxes that you will pay this year. The federal government is taking less tax revenue from you to cover it tomorrow, while fronting you that money today. </p>
<p>That money itself doesn't get added to the debt since that money is just the government taking fewer taxes in. Since the rest of the budget didn't change, there will need to be money borrowed to cover the new shortfall from the lack of revenue if the stimulus doesn't get spent in the economy buying goods and services (which are taxed).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually its the reverse. Its not that they spend more than they can raise, but that they do not raise what they need. The money and resources are available, otherwise they could not borrow them.</p>
<p>The elites capture the machine of government by controlling the politicians that handle said machine. They control them in many ways, not least of which by assuring them funds before, during, and a certainty of wealth (in many ways including easy cushy positions) after they retire.</p>
<p>Using this power, they stop Governments from taxing those with power and wealth for the funds they need; so they do not collect enough.</p>
<p>Then they have to borrow the difference - in effect allowing those to get away without paying, and passing on the debt to the future, while also assuring the elite permanent rents.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There seems to be an underlying assumption here that, just because the resources exist within their borders, they have some implicit moral claim to them. </p>

<p>Ah yes, the reddit anti-billionaire conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>First of all, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricardian_equivalence" target="_blank">there's an economic theory</a> that consumers internalize increases in public debt by lowering consumption today, knowing that they'll have to pay these taxes in the future. In theory, there should be no difference between raising taxes or debt. However, it turns out to not be empirically true. Consumers just keep spending. So, you're actually better off raising some debt rather than taxes in order to pay for government services because it doesn't have the same negative effect on growth.</p>
<p>The United States's federal borrowing rate is absurdly low: <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/14/us-bonds-10-year-and-30-year-amid-covid-vaccine-news.html" target="_blank">the yield on a 10 year note is 0.6715%</a>. GDP growth took a hit from Covid but it's around 3%. The United States's economy will outgrow its debt, which will shrink relative to the tax base over time.</p>
