			<div class="markdown"><p>On PC (and on console, if you’re downloading a digital game), the initial download can bundle all the updates together with the base game and install them at once. On a console, when installing from a disc, the disc is only the base game (it’s physically printed and distributed that way), so only the base game installs. Then it has to go online to download and install updates. </p>
<p>Personally, I’ve never run into this issue with any digital games on PC or Xbox. I don’t remember how PlayStation handles it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both Xbox and Steam work the same way -- you upload a new version and the system figures it out. There are no formal patch files.</p>
<p>Sony and Nintendo both do the manually-build-a-patch thing.</p></div>		</li>
