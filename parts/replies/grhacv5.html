			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it's in fact the main variable important in the situation with the difference of the refraction index (all this is due tu refraction). The two things to see is that each drop act approximately like a round prism, refracting light radially, and, you can only see the colours from red to purple (380 to 780nm). Each drop emites all the colours they receive but at different angles, and most of them are in such a position they send invisible light to you (or not at all), only a few of them send visible light, and as the position of the drops is variying continuously you can see a continuous variation of colours.
To see only a line of one colour it would need to have drops only on that curve where drops send this colour to you, or have non-round prism and choose their orientation in order to refract the right colour in your eyes. (Or the same result could be obtained with drops havjng a variable refraction index as it changes the angle at which light is sent)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The angle is super important, and has applications in physics beyond just light. </p>
<p>In experiments, you can launch atoms at each other and look at the angle at which they scatter (deflect) each other. Atoms either repel or attract each other based on how close they are (impact parameter, <em>b</em>). The rainbow angle is the scattering angle when <em>b</em> is such that attractive and repulsive forces are equal. This can be used to determine bond distance because attraction/repulsion in molecules is balanced for minimum potential energy).</p>
<p>Pretty neat stuff, there's another phenomena similar to rainbows, a Glory, which also has an angle named after it.</p></div>		</li>
