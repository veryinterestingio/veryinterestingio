			<div class="markdown"><p>So let's say someone was hit by a car, the damage only seems to on his leg but no one is sure, he's not bleeding, do we not give him water?, because I've been near one and everybody started giving him water and shit.
I really need to take a course on emergencies</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok so obviously I understand in a situation that someone is asking for food and water how difficult it would be to give them those things especially after a seemingly benign accident. </p>
<p>For a medical person, I would absolutely not give that person anything to eat or drink because first of all, I don’t know if it’s really just the leg that’s injured. It could literally be anything. Also it could potentially delay the surgery if it was something that needed surgery or if proceeding with surgery would put them at unnecessary risk. </p>
<p>That’s just me. Use your best judgement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if I suspect even a small chance of internal injury or bleeding, I do not give them water or food, got it, I really do have to sign up for some training.
Thank you very much sir, you may save a life one day</p></div>		</li>
