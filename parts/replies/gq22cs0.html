			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily stress but alertness could cause this. Generally your brain sort of turns off a bit at home since you feel so safe there and your body sees this signal and thinks &quot;this is the perfect time to poop&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the source of stress in this case isn't the errands, rather it's the knowledge that you don't have easy access to a restroom.  Once you get home and you know that you <em>do</em> have easy access to a restroom again, your body wants to get it done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fight or flight is an extreme response, adrenaline hitting the gut causes movement, and blood is redistributed throughout the body quickly which affects the digestive system.  It's theorized this is a holdover from animals who defensively defecate.  You also get enhanced muscle response during fight-or-flight so your body can usually hold it, despite the unpleasant sensation, so there's no evolutionary need for the response to be eliminated in humans.</p></div>		</li>
