			<div class="markdown"><p>This is only true for materials with small molecules. When you cut a polymers (long molecues) say Cotton fiber (which is a cellulosic polymer), the knife actually cuts the polymer chains. It is known as mechanical chain scission in polymer science. This happens as chains are too big to move out of the way or are locked in crystallized structures that are too rigid to disband and move out of the way of incoming mechanical force.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No.  As he indicated, they are polymers (molecules chained to each other to infinity).  Cutting the polymer chain or surface makes two polymer strands that are smaller in surface area or length.  The polymer strands are typically held together by weak hydrogen bonds and they break and reform all the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Obsidian is made out of molten stone with very high silica content. If the lava cools very quickly due to sudden contact with water, there is no time to form crystalline structures. As a result, it won't crumble off when you break it. That's how it can form extremely sharp edges.</p>
<p>Some scalpel blades are made of obsidian, but this is still experimental and should not be used on humans.</p></div>		</li>
