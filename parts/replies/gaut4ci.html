			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the right answer. If you find that this happens to you frequently and you feel unsatisfied with music because of it, I recommend that you intentionally try to find music that you don't like much at first and give those songs 5-10 listens. A lot of times, if a song is too complex for our brain to start figuring out on the first try, we won't like it. But if you give it a chance and relisten multiple times then eventually your brain will start to figure out the patterns and will enjoy it. And because it's a more complex song, you will likely get a longer more sustained stretch of enjoyment out of it as your brain will have a more complex puzzle to solve.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find this typically happens when discovering a new album. There will be one song that hooks me, but the rest of the music sounds meh or downright awful in comparison. Then after listening to it a few more times, I start to love those songs that initially sounded garbage to me.</p></div>		</li>

I was a country/classic rock only fan but one day a couple hard rock songs caught my ear on the radio, and by the next few months I had been completely converted to hard rock/heavy metal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, friend! And this is also why people’s taste in music evolves as we get older. As our brains develop we can decipher more complex patterns and appreciate a wider variety of music. Likewise as we get older and our brain’s connections start to slow down we fall back on simpler genres or very familiar songs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct, except that it's not endorphins, it's dopamine.</p>
<p>As a game director, we're always trying to hit just the right dopamine &quot;cocktail&quot; of quick familiarity with compelling surprises. It's probably why reboots are so rampant now.</p>
<p>(I strongly recommend Dr. Robert Sopalsky's &quot;Behave&quot; to dive deep into what cofactors affect our emotions and decisionmaking.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also a book called &quot;This is Your Brain on Music&quot; that explains the psychology of music and the dopamine stuff in great detail. It primarily focuses on why pop music is so addicting. Fascinating read, especially for musicians and songwriters!</p></div>		</li>
