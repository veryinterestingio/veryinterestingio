<p>Minor point, but Mass bends spacetime. Not gravity. </p>
<p>Current theory is that time is what causes gravity. As you get closer and closer to a mass, time slows down. So your feet experience time differently than your head when you're standing upright. The difference attracts you to the Earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im not good at explaining but i think it's something like this:
Imagine a ball. You push the ball from underneath. You apply more force (time is faster) on the right side than on the left side (analogy to time dilation).
The ball is going to move to the left (gravity).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The time gradient thing, although probably kind of true, isn't really a good explaination of what happens. Why would it make things fall?</p>
<p>A better and more counter-intuitive explaination is that objects seems attracted to each other because their internal pressure make them expend while the curvature of spacetime makes them seem to shrink, which balances things out.</p>
<p>It's more understandable when we are talking about one big object, like the earth, and a small one, like an apple. The Apple doesn't really fall on the, ground, it's the ground that is accelerating towards the apple. The size of the earth doesn't change because the curvature of spacetime perfectly balances its inside pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More confused than before. Earth accelerates towards apple? So if the apple fell towards the ground from a tree. The ground just under the apple accelerated to meet it, but the ground under the tree from which the apple fell stayed in place? </p>
<p>The theory about time causing gravity made more sense. But mostly because I can visualise it a little bit. Different sides of a moving ball face different amount of speed. The ball will obviously move towards the side that speeds up more. The speed in this analogy is equivalent to time dilation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Magnets were a bad example for that reason. I was looking more at how their force pulls on other objects, as opposed to gravity’s more abstract bending.</p></div>		</li>
