<p>I'd argue, that at that time, Jesus was a revolutionary and wanted to establish a &quot;new world order&quot; which was a Christian world. Now the same people try to defend it.</p>

<p>I think this is a good point. The fact that Jesus was progressive in his time doesn't mean that it is theologically necessary to be progressive forever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say that was a poor analysis. How many modern American Christians would be happy accepting prostitutes and the homeless into their homes and inviting them to share a meal? How many would demand the destruction of the banking system? How many would take everything they have to feed the hungry? How many would look to provide as much alcohol as possible to let everyone get merrily drunk? How many would agree that paying your taxes was important? How many would agree that defending themselves with a gun was a sin against god and that they should turn the other cheek when attacked? Who would pay for the medical care and treatment of strangers as a principal? Not Americans and definitely not the average right wing evangelicals.</p></div>		</li>
