			<div class="markdown"><p>How exactly was the carboniferous period named - was it these fires and high oxygen levels directly leaving a lot of carbon material around, or a coincidence that they occurred at the same time as other processes? (I seem to remember it being because of coal and other deposits being left from the time, and was wondering whether I'm correct and whether there was a link.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's named for the large coal deposits (Carboniferous meaning &quot;Coal Bearing&quot; in latin) left at the time. Lignin evolved in the Carboniferous period and was pretty resistant to most decomposers, resulting in the accumulation of woody remains in the fossil record. The buried carbon drove an increase in atmospheric oxygen, which drove the development of some of the characteristic fauna of the time, including giant insects. The increased fire risk may have also helped to select for further increased lignin content in the trees, since the structural polymer would have helped trees survive wildfires, driving a big positive feedback loop. </p>
<p>At the same time, the dropping sea levels exposed more low lying land allowing for extensive swampy forests, which would go on to produce more coal, bury more carbon, and continue to drive up the oxygen levels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So does this mean with more CO2 being put into the atmosphere by increase in wildfires and fossil fuel burning, we are significantly lowering the amount of O2 in the atmosphere?  ANd if so, maybe this is the earth's way of slowing down burning (of wildfires cause human caused fossil fuel burning will continue)? And if so, how much increase in CO2 and decrease in O2, has happend to date, or by say 2100?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some back-of-the-envelope math:</p>
<p>Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth" target="_blank">says</a> the atmosphere contains ~20.95% oxygen. Atmospheric carbon dioxide is about 0.04% (just passed through 400 ppm not too long ago).</p>
<p>For every mole of carbon, two moles of oxygen are consumed to make carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>So, to double atmospheric carbon dioxide from 200 ppm to 400 ppm (the difference between the pre-industrial period and today), that would be from 0.02% CO2 to 0.04% CO2, and the corresponding change in atmospheric oxygen would be about -0.04%. That difference is far less than that which we would expect between outdoor air and that inside a home with one or more occupants, busy respiring away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm really curious about that, and would like a response from someone more knowledgeable... But I would assume that any reduction in O2 levels that could be enough to arrest forest fire would already make things untenable for humans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More CO2 will help plant life to thrive which in turn also generates more O2. “Greenhouse” effect would stand to reason we’d lush the environment, but then, will we have higher humidity as well? The 10yr till apocalypse camp conjures images of a scorched earth, but then also flooded due to ice melt... and also a greenhouse. It seems like a lot of isolated theories in contradiction - that global warming leads to a greener planet, but perhaps still inhospitable for humans longer term.</p></div>		</li>
