			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry for the tangent, but man, this inspires me to own a rocking chair company so I can ask Dwayne Johnson to be in a commercial. </p>
<p>Scene: Focused on an old wood floor at the foot of the rocking chair. The floorboard squeaks gently as it rocks forwards and backwards. Slowly zoom out to a foot in a leather shoe, gently tapping along. Squeak, squeak, tap. Squeak, squeak, tap. </p>
<p>Zoom further out while the beat gets stronger. Squeaks and foot taps grow more vigorous with hand clapping added in. Eventually the whole scene comes into view as the camera pans up from floor to legs to chest and we settle on Dwayne‚Äôs face right as he launches into ‚Äúbuddy, you‚Äôre a boy, make a big noise‚Äù while sitting on a front porch.</p>
<p>We have The Rock rocking out in a rocking chair to We Will Rock You. I will go bankrupt trying to make this happen and have no regrets.</p></div>		</li>

Why do humans like to fuck? It releases endorphins on the brain.
Why do people line to be successful? It releases endorphins on the brain.</p></div>		</li>
