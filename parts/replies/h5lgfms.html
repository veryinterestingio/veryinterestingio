			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very similar to the formula used to calculate the weighted (Bayesian) score of the IMDb rating for their Top 250 movies list. They used to publish the formula on their site but I'm not seeing it now (but you can get it through the Internet Archive Wayback Machine).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and for anyone else curious, here's (<a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/169032/understanding-the-imdb-weighted-rating-function-for-usage-on-my-own-website" target="_blank">as documented in this StackExchange discussion</a>) the IMDb version at the time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>weighted rating (WR)=(v/(v+m))R+(m/(v+m))C</p>
<p>where:
R = average for the movie (mean) = (Rating)
v = number of votes for the movie = (votes)
m = minimum votes required to be listed in the Top 50 (currently 1000)
C = the mean vote across the whole report (currently 6.8)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure whether this is what they still do. There might be something in place now to try to account for the known biases like a movie being dishonestly bombed with negative reviews because of stirring up controversy, or the voting demographics being different from the audience demographics or something.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> actually, this following StackExchange discussion, different from the one I linked above, might be the most direct answer to the OP's question. <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/41459/how-can-i-calculate-most-popular-more-accurately/41513#41513" target="_blank">https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/41459/how-can-i-calculate-most-popular-more-accurately/41513#41513</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What programming language is that? Or is that some kind of mathematical notation standard I'm not aware of. Actually, after seeing the article, they pasted in LaTeX that produces the image above what you copied.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it's just LaTEX notation. (I know you probably figured that out already. For the benefits of any third party readers, LaTeX is a typesetting tool commonly used to (among other things) display mathematical figures.)</p></div>		</li>
