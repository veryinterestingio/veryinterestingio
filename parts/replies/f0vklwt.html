			<div class="markdown"><p>It is length of day. Less sunlight triggers deciduous trees to get to a point that photosynthesis is no longer viable and stop they producing chlorophyll. Without the green pigment of the chlorophyll the colour of the leaves underneath is revealed (they don't exactly &quot;change&quot; colour).</p>
<p>The tree then cuts off the food supply to the leaves - storing it in the trunk - and the leaves eventually die.</p>
<p>More or less, deciduous trees hybernate in winter.</p>
<p>This is all from an Understanding Colour course in uni some time ago; I am open to correction.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Just adding that there are wide swathes of the globe where deciduous trees drop their leaves due to a dry season.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe at least some trees 'color their leaves on purpose'. That is there are specific mecha nisms for the yellow and red colors. I could be wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really depends on what response we are talking about and what plant. Different plants may do the same thing for different reasons, or different things for the same reason.</p>
<p>And even &quot;reason&quot; should be in quotes, because its probably better to talk about signals and responses. Here is a study that looked at just one type of tree, spruce: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5591416/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5591416/</a></p>
<p>What they found was a dormancy cycle that seemed to be dependent on pairs of signals warm/cool days and long/short days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. We have trees at my school that loose their leaves every October - December and stays barren until February and/or March. I always wondered why this happened until someone told me they were seasonal trees and that they were a type of plant that originally grows in colder climates. I live in country near the equator btw.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s much more likely that they’re native to tropical monsoon seasons, dropping their leaves in the dry season (tropical dry seasons usually occur in the <em>winter</em> of that hemisphere).</p></div>		</li>
