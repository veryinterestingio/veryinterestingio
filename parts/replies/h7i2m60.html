<p>SARS-CoV-2's wide tropism is somewhat unusual for a coronavirus, but might not be unusual for its sarbecovirus family, because the enzyme ACE2 whose receptors they exploit is fairly similar across mammals. But the others we know, like SARS, MERS, and a big family tree of bat viruses, don't seem to infect humans as efficiently</p>

<p>What receptors do those viruses target to get into cells?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>SARS-CoV, like SARS-CoV-2, used the ACE2 receptor. These viruses are pretty closely related as well (hence the similarities in their names). </p>
<p>MERS-CoV, uses the DPP4 receptor</p></div>		</li>
