<p>Imagine flying over an invisible coastline and you can only see the waves of water crashing on the shore. The land itself is invisible, but the water can be seen. You have no problem seeing the shape of the coast, including bays, inlets, etc., but the waves can't show you the grains of sand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not so certain that's true.  From all the layman stuff I've landed on . . . all the weird quantum shit that makes people screw up their faces seems like genuine weird shit worth screwing up a face over.</p>
<p>If you know more, please correct here; my understanding is that it isn't exactly disentangling by smacking them exactly . . . so much as you know what spin both thingies have now so the magic unknown relationship where anything could be anything together doesn't exist anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct, the phsyics behind it is really interesting.
Basically, gluons are what &quot;glue&quot; quarks together, think of it like a spring, and the more you pull them apart, the more energy you need to put in to the spring to get it to stretch. Eventually you pull them far enough apart, and you've put so much energy in to the gluon, that it becomes more favourable to create a quark-antiquark pair. You've now effectively snapped the spring in to two smaller, un-stretched springs. So now instead of 2 separate quarks, you now have 2 separate <em>pairs</em> of quarks. </p>
<p>So without the surrounding space being energetic enough to provide the energy required for free quarks (say if it was <em>really REALLY</em> hot), they simply cannot be. These energies were seen close to the big bang event, and also <em>very briefly</em> in high energy collisions at the LHC.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quarks have a weird property called confinement which means that they're always bound to other quarks and can't be isolated. If you try to pull a hadron apart into its constituent quarks, the energy you put in to separate them gets turned into more quarks which bind to the original quarks. The exception to this is that quarks become asymptotically weaker in the high energy limit (~175MeV) which leads to a new state of matter called a quark-gluon plasma, so unless you want to totally annihilate whatever you're looking at, quark microscopes will never happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The major difference is that electrons have an electromagnetic charge (negative) which allows us to manipulate them, because we know how to manipulate electricity and magnetism. In fact, we're so good at this that we can make a device which can spit out individual electrons in a specific direction and then detect how they bounce off of whatever we want to look at, which gives us an impression of the shape of that thing. As long as the target object is large enough that the electrons don't move it around, we can get a fairly good image.</p>
<p>Quarks have some properties that differentiate them from one another, but most of those characteristics are inferred through experimental observation and lots of math. None of those characteristics is something that we know how to manipulate like we can electromagnetism, so we can't make a device that can shoot out a stream of quarks and then observe their movements.</p>
<p>To make it even more complicated, every material we know of is made up of protons, neutrons and electrons which are made up of quarks. Building a device to push individual quarks around with materials that we understand would be like trying to push around individual bricks using entire houses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also: different colors of light are affected differently by lenses, this is called &quot;chromatic aberration&quot;. As a result, the more or stronger lenses create more fuzziness in the picture, making it hard to see details (or anything at all).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just colors of light; lensing creates a level of overall distortion, and this obviously increases as more or stronger lenses are added. It's the same reason we can't just add more lenses to telescopes in space and see farther.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can avoid the aberration effects with sufficiently expensive optics (i.e. aspheric elements).</p>
<p>The reason you can't just add more lenses is that you're fundamentally diffraction-limited in terms of angular resolving power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not relevant. If this were truly the limiting factor you could use curved mirrors instead of lenses, which do not suffer from chromatic aberration. You could also use monochromatic light to illuminate your sample.</p>
<p>The actual limiting factor is diffraction and the wave nature of light. </p></div>		</li>
