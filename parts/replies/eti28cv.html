			<div class="markdown"><p>The cups and plates were used in the banquet as displays of wealth and ostentation. Kings often ceased banqueting sets of their Lords (looking at you King John) when they ran short of money.</p>

<p>Basically, they were to hand and valuable, and could be shown off through use</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. They're saying it became a tradition because these plates and cups were items that the wealthy and nobility owned and gifted as object of recognition. Now they've become symbolic of that recognition separate from the nobility themselves.</p></div>		</li>
