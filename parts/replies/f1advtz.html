<p>We're currently losing all of the Ash trees in the USA today </p>

<p>An absolute tragedy that doesn't get the attention it deserves, broadly speaking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only good news is about 20% of ash trees in the UK are resistant so they won’t disappear entirely. They’re also very prolific seeders and fast growing but at current rates it will take around 200 years for the ash to recover from dieback.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds similar to what we have going on in New Zealand with Kauri dieback, which is swiftly infecting and killing all of our beautiful native Kauri trees.</p>
<p>If you're coming to New Zealand soon, no matter how much you may want to do our nature reserve walks because you've heard how beautiful it is, if they're closed/restricted because of dieback, PLEASE heed the signs and go elsewhere. And if you're on one and come across one of the shoe cleaning stages, PLEASE take the minute to clean your shoes.</p></div>		</li>

There is no synthetic hurl that I used in my first year that comes close to the ash hurl I have now. Micro first world problem, but it's a hobby I love and I can see this hurting it world wide.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Michigan's DNR tried like hell to educate people about it but no one bothered reading or, maybe, caring about it, and the result is that Ash will likely exist as a bush from now on because the adolescents aren't attacked by the beetle.</p>
<p>Granted, the signs (that were on the freeways) never stated <em>why</em> not to transport fire wood.</p>
<p>That being said, a neighboring city to mine just announced that the Emerald Ash epidemic is over for them, because, get this, &quot;there are no more Ashes left.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had a guy pull into my place with a trailer full of fire wood. He asked if it was cool to park it in our lot while he golfed. I asked where it came from, he replied with a place that was a hundred miles away. I told him it was illegal to transport fire wood. He said, &quot;oh I take the back roads, they won't catch me&quot;. </p>
<p>We have now lost every oak on our 400 acre property to oak wilt. Transmits via beetle or the root system. The oaks are dying in Michigan. </p>
<p>The beech are dying in Michigan as well and there are some pretty interesting diseases effecting the maples. Hard wood trees in Michigan may soon be a forgone memory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The American chestnut used to be the dominating mast crop along the Appalachians. 1904  there were an estimated 4 billion trees comprising 25% of the trees in the appalacias. Within 50 years they were essentially wiped out. Today there are less than 100 wild trees (there are numerous planted specimens). There are anecdotes of the nuts literally covering the ground. When they died it completely changed the food chain.</p>
<p>There are many organizations trying to produce blight resistant trees without crossing them with other species. If you are at all interested and live on the east coast there is likely a state chapter where you can donate or just go see the young trees and learn more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard the project for inserting the resistance gene from Asian chestnut trees has been quagmired in regulations due to people being scared &quot;because it's a gmo&quot;.  Apparently these trees grow just fine, they just have resistance to the blight</p>
<p>It's a shame since this tree is a natural part of the ecosystem</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think people appreciate the extent to which wildlife populations in the Appalachians were hammered by the sudden loss of chestnuts as a food source.</p>
<p>The deer and squirrels we have now are basically descendants of the few who were able to survive a rapid transition from a chestnut-based diet to an acorn-based diet, and I've read that acorns are significantly less nutritious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate to say it, but you'll have to do this for a very long time, and by then your tree might just be one of the last ones. EAB has better cold tolerance than ash trees, so there's no limit to the ash borer range</p></div>		</li>

<p>Except for the prairie, thankfully. We've still got all our beautiful ashes on the west coast.</p></div>		</li>
