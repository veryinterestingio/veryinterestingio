In good heath, we are such a delicately balanced set of tissues working in such harmony.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, which is why pain relief methods are only half the story. After pain subsides, you ideally want to strengthen the muscles that caused the pain in the first place to prevent it from happening again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One time I fell asleep drunk on the couch sitting upright with my head looking down, chin against chest.  This caused pain in the back of my neck and shoulder blades but I didn't put 2 and 2 together for a few days so I thought, &quot;Hmm, must be some muscles that need to be stretched&quot; so I would try to stretch the muscles by looking down thinking the pain was a good thing (like when you stretch your legs by trying to touch your toes or something) but it was gradually making things worse.  I then realized that I should be stretching the muscles in the front of my neck by laying on my back with my head off the edge of my bed because they were actually tighter than they should be and sort of competing with the back side if that makes sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whole lotta people debating the semantics of what's 'positive' here with a lot of confidence even though it's irrelevant to why it's named that.</p>
<p>It comes from control theory. Essentially you come up with a mathematical equation which tells you how a system responds to a particular input (called a transfer function). This function has what are called 'poles'. If your function has positive poles, it's unstable and blows up over time. If all it's poles are negative, the system will return to equilibrium after being disturbed by some input.</p>
<p>No need for an existential discussion on 'what is positive anyway, what does it all mean'.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I didn't pay much attention in my control classes, so I might be a little bit wrong. Definitely less wrong than everyone else though....</p></div>		</li>

<p>Here's the thing though: <em>it doesn't</em>. Control theory has <em>one</em> definition, but medicine has an ENTIRELY different one. There is a definition for positive and negative feedback in medicine. We have a definition entirely separate from control theory's definition, because we have needs entirely separate from control theory's needs.</p></div>		</li>
