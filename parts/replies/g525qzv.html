			<div class="markdown"><p>Not always fry batter. Traditionally in Mexico they use a honey sweetened corn flaked cereal. Some placed use fry batter but neither holds the ice cream in. They super freeze it which is what keeps it from immediately melting.</p>
<p>Take an large ice cube and hold it with tongs and dip it in a pot of hot water. You'll notice it didn't completely melt. Using oil has fats which don't dissolve frozen items as quick as water, so that buys time, then the oil is so hot it burns and crisps as it cooks and fuses fats to the food which also helps  a tiny bit to keep the coating from wicking moisture and getting soggy.</p></div>		</li>
