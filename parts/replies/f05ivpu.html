<p>It's due to surface tension, i.e. intermolecular forces.</p>
<p>The effect you're describing is different.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The water in the capillary actually has a lower pressure than atmospheric pressure. This is a very typical property of capillaries of wetting liquids. Non-wetting liquids have greater pressures than atmosphere due to the capillary effect excluding liquid from the capillary. This is analogous to pressure increasing with liquid depth.</p>
<p>Of note: if the water in the capillary of a wetting liquid was at atmospheric pressure then you'd be able to pump water to anywhere for no cost in energy.</p></div>		</li>
