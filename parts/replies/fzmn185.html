			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question; helping people avoid problems with tigers in the first place is the key element. In the Leuser Ecosystem on Sumatra, we’ve found that helping people build very strong night corrals for livestock dramatically reduces the ability of tigers to kill stock. Conflict is also worst in this region where prey number are depleted, so having really good ranger patrols to prevent poaching is also essential. These interventions work: since 2010, not a single Critically Endangered Sumatran tiger has been killed in retaliation to conflict in the Leuser Ecosystem where these interventions are in place.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! In addition to solutions like that, are there ways to change local perceptions about tigers? I know that’s a major issue with apex predators in general. Does any aspect of conservation directly benefit local communities, or change perceptions so they see tigers as an asset rather than a danger?</p></div>		</li>
