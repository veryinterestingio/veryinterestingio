			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. My dog died back in May and I took it pretty hard. I had her for 15.5 years and she was a huge part of my life. Laying in my nice comfortable quiet bedroom gave me plenty of silence and I would hyper focus on her and the realization that she was gone. Which would eventually morph into my own mortality and my family and spouse and their mortality and I just couldn't sleep.</p>
<p>I would go out to the couch and fall asleep watching tv. Interestingly enough sleeping on the couch lately has seemed to get rid of my back pain I've had for the last couple of years. So as much as my wife hates the fact I'm sleeping on the couch. I'm riding the pain free train as long as I can. I know she has her concerns about my reasons for sleeping on the couch. But she is also very understanding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I appreciate the good thoughts. It was a rough summer I'll admit. Combine my dog dying with me losing my job and my mother getting cancer it was tough. But I'm pretty over the death of my dog. I mean you're never really over it. But I can talk about her and make jokes about her without getting all mopey. My mother just finished her cancer treatment 100% between chemo and radiation and surgery. Just waiting for official results but she will be an official survivor fairly soon. And I got a new job 2 months ago. One I really enjoy and I'm appreciated for my hard work. </p>
<p>So yeah 8 months ago things were super bleak. But I'm a big fan of everything happens for a reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's tough. And everyone deals in their own way. For me I had to push through the pain. I did my best to not think about her. But when I did I kind of just went with it. Eventually the emotions change from being sad to happy.</p>
<p>One of the stupidest things that made me cry after she died was I was cooking and I dropped a green bean on the floor. I didn't even think about picking it up because I always had my on demand Hoover to clean up small things like that. Well the next morning I came out and stepped on the damn green bean and my first thought was &quot;why didn't Boomer (my dog's name) clean that up&quot; then it kind of hit me that she didn't because she couldn't.</p>
<p>That was a week or so after she passed away. A few weeks ago I spilled some chips and ignored it until I got up to go to the bathroom. I'm not a slob per say but I'll do what needs to be done when I want. Well when I got up I forgot to grab the vacuum cleaner and I just looked at her urn and was like &quot;look you really need to get back to work Boomer&quot; and chuckled as I went to grab the vacuum.</p>
<p>So basically when a thought comes up it's going to be sad but I promise that eventually theyll end up being happy memories. I still have sad moments don't get me wrong. But theyve gone from 100% sad to about 95% happy and 5% sad/bittersweet. Basically time is what they need. That and maybe an outlet. I've made various rants on Reddit and Facebook just airing out my frustrations. I didn't need validation. Just putting words onto paper really helped me sort my emotions. That actually helped a lot in the begining.</p>
<p>If your friend has a Reddit account they are more than welcome to reach out to me and vent if you or they think it'll help out.</p></div>		</li>
