			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly the same. You probably wouldn't catch a kid sneak-playing cup stacking under the desk, or find a prima facie correlation between kids who cup-stack all day and beating kids in school with mugs and canisters</p>
<p>And as far as I can tell, cup stacking involves a bigger range of movements in the arms than mouse &amp; keyboard, sticks, or phones (though, probably less problem-solving, depending on the game)</p></div>		</li>

<p>this means 'first impression' for those who didn't take Latin. I just means 'at first glance' or in this case, 'with out much (or any) supporting evidence'</p></div>		</li>

<p>This really depends on the game, CS:GO for instance - most players use a low sensitivity, requiring greater arm/eye movement, the left hand is typically just holding shift or W, or both in combination on the keyboard - therefore doing nothing.</p>
<p>But I guess your right hand, and left hemisphere of the brain will benefit from games, at least I should. I guess all it's really doing is making me more right-hand dominant than I was before, when I was a kid I could throw pretty well with my left hand, now my right is better by a GOOD distance.</p></div>		</li>
