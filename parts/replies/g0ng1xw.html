<p>There are certain times from which a lot of records are preserved (old Rome) and other times from which a single new word would significantly increase what we know (early middle ages).</p>
<p>So besides survivor bias in the sense of &quot;what was preserved&quot; it is also &quot;what was preserved and survived until today&quot;?
For Europe the loss of books in the late antiquity is perhaps the most important. A huge part of what we know about the antiquity is not from originals but from copies made in the (early) middle ages and which have then been copied again and again.</p>
<p>For a text to survive it isn't enough to be written multiple times, it has to be written multiple times over a long stretch of time. (Or be literally set in stone)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's another example I find fascinating of this. A period we know very little about is the Bronze Age Collapse, mainly because the art of writing was lost, so there are no surviving accounts from the few hundred years afterwards, bits and pieces from Egypt excepted (which stayed more stable for longer, probably due to the presence of the Nile keeping a steady food supply going). The accounts we have don't tend to say 'this is what is happening' because everyone was too busy trying to survive in the chaos. One account we do have is the response to a request for aid from one minor king to another in the Levant that basically says 'sorry, we can't help, we're screwed too.' It was found in the remains of the kiln it was being hardened in (clay tablet), so some catastrophe overtook them between message being written and message being sent. I highly recommend the 'Extra Credits' YouTube channel's series on it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I find fascinating about the New World civilizations, and probably plenty of Old World ones too.  Imagine the loss of creativity and culture, stuff we'll never know about.  What sort of art did they have?  What was their government and economic systems like?  There could be so many ideas lost to history.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You know how we have so many niche hobbies and subcultures but not many people know about them because it's only like a few thousand people who are into them? I always wonder what niche subcultures existed back then thay have been lost to time</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely, its amazing how little we know about Aztecs or Mayans,
The Haudenosaunee Confederacy or Iroquois had a fascinating form of government designed to prevent civil wars</p>
<p>It's interesting technologies lost too, like Greek Fire, Damascus Steel, Roman Concrete and even some medical things like Silphium which was a Roman birth control plant thought to be harvested into extinction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I'm not mistaken, we know a lot about New World civilizations. You just don't hear about it as it's not really a studied topic in English.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We know some about the large ones like the Mayans and Aztecs because they left some stuff behind and we have accounts from the Spanish.  But many were wiped out by disease before colonizers arrived in mass.  And even with the Mayans and Aztecs there are a lot of holes because their own history didn't get passed down after being conquered.</p></div>		</li>
