			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why there's some space between FM radio stations in terms of frequency -- e.g., 91.3 MHz vs 91.5 MHz. </p>
<p>Wikipedia tells me the bandwidth is ±75 kHz, so that means the 91.3 MHz station is using from 91.2 MHz to 91.4 MHz, roughly; meanwhile, the 91.5 MHz station is using 91.4 MHz to 91.6 MHz, roughly. </p>
<p>The spacing between station frequencies is so they don't overlap / interfere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh, and that spacing would be why when you're adjusting the frequency, it fades in/becomes clearer, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even without any other stations, you would get that fade. You are calibrating your receptor. The more accurately calibrated for the signal you are trying to receive, the less fade.</p>
<p>A good analogy is an air vent. If your receptor is perfectly calibrated to the signal, it's like a fully opened vent. If it's slightly off, it's like a slightly closed vent. Still air, but it's partially blocked. The more you close it, the less air that gets through. That's kind of what you do with your radio dial. </p>
<p>There are other variables, as well. The strength of the signal (the more power put into the transmitter, the further the signal can be reached. Most places have laws limiting how much energy you're allowed to put behind a radio signal), obstacles in the way of the signal, solar flares, bad weather.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! that’s also why on a radio with a dial that mechanically changes the frequency you can land between two stations and hear both overlap</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>±75 kHz is actually the maximum deviation of a broadcast FM transmitter. Typically speaking for FM, the maximum deviation represents the highest analog frequency that a radio is able to reproduce. In the case of audio, humans can't typically hear above 24 kHz and most FM radio stations use low pass filters on their audio equipment to cut audio above 15-22 kHz (10 kHz for AM stations typically). So the extra 53 kHz is used for things like stereo audio, RDS and HD digital modulation. FM Broadcast channels are 200 kHz wide (the occupied bandwidth is a function of modulated frequency and maximum deviation). Per the FCC's Title 47 (which contains all things wireless) Part 2.202, B=2(M+DK) where M is a function of the maximum modulated frequency, D is the maximum deviation and K is a constant (1 typically). So at a 22 kHz maximum modulated frequency on 75 kHz maximum deviation...197 kHz of bandwidth is occupied (thus 200 kHz channels in the FM broadcast band).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have no idea what you're trying to say in this comment: it looks like gobbledygook, sorry. They don't take the audible frequencies and map them 1-to-1 to frequencies in the megahertz band. That's not how frequentcy modulation works, at all. The bandwidth of the megahertz band determines the signal's resolution, not it's frequency response range.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't go chasing waterfalls,
Please stick to the frequencies in bands that you're used to.
You know you're gonna have to filter and adjust the gain...
Sideband's way too fasssst.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you've done any research into Software defined radio there's some neat information you can see in effect. Today's modern FM stations may have up to 3 signals associated with the dial number. One is the audio, but the other two carry data. That maybe radio info like call letters or song info. The other band can carry traffic for traffic warning equipped radios.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe traffic data is broadcast over RDS (same as call letters and program info).  </p>
<p>HD radio (in US markets) is one or two bands of digital data on either side of the analog audio transmission.  In the digital data is a mix of digital audio and data like pictures or lyrics, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes this, the FM (frequency modulation) is a carrier freq.  the information broadcast, music/talk whatever is a single frequency which your tuner locks onto and demodulates into voice or music.</p></div>		</li>
