When I worked at Lowe's people would routinely come in and need more than we had or would come back after not paying attention to packaging and need locks rekeyed. When I worked there this was something we offered for free if you purchased the lock from us. Some brands are easier to rekey, such as Kwikset, who have made it so much quicker nowadays, while others, Schlage and Gatehouse (these were the rekeying kits we had at my store) need to be rekeyed by opening up the lock and changing the pins. For whatever reason (note: laziness) there were only 3 people that weren't management at the store who could rekey locks, but it wasn't actually all that difficult, just usually time consuming. The only locks we ever had trouble with were Gatehouse because they didn't open up the same way as the other 2.</p></div>		</li>
