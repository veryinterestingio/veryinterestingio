			<div class="markdown"><p>Also: there’s two ceilings. One is for hovering and a higher one is for forward flight, since in forward flight the rotor disk acts as a wing producing additional lift. The hover ceiling is thrust-bound (I.e. the air is too thin for a sufficient mass of it to be directed downward to overcome the weight of the aircraft) but the engine is likely able to produce power at lower densities (especially a turbine engine)</p>
<p>Edit: there’s actually three. Hover in ground effect (within 5 or 10 feet of the ground), hover out of ground effect (which is what this question is asking), and service ceiling (in forward flight). Hover in ground effect (HIGE, one of my favorite acronyms) is higher than HOGE because in ground effect the ground disrupts blade-tip vortexes that add a ton of drag and sap power that could be used to spin the rotor faster. <a href="https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/23730/what-is-the-significance-of-hover-performance-in-helicopters-hige-hoge#23732" target="_blank">Decent explanation here</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you know what would happen if we achieved the ceiling for forward flight and then quickly tried to bring a helicopter to just a hover? Would the helicopter quickly start to drop? Would it be able to support itself again at the hover ceiling? Or would that drop to the new ceiling result in something tragic?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It descends. If you are flying at your density altitude ceiling, as you slow down below your minimum power speed, you will lose altitude regardless of how much power you put into it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As you slow your forward speed the aerodynamic lift is also going to be reduced, so you just end up sinking as you slow until the air is dense enough for the force of the rotor blades to equal the force of gravity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Provided there isn't a mountain in the way, I think it would likely drop in altitude, but as you drop it would gradually gain more lifting force, and eventually that would equal the weight and the helicopter would come from a fall into a hover. Provided there weren't in an area that had ground far above sea level, they should easily be able to recover into a hover while still far above the ground.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The engine might die from lack of oxygen if it's bad enough, or the engine will just slowly lose power until you don't go up any more. There shouldn't be any reason for it to explode. </p>
<p>Even if it were to somehow fail, they can just autorotate downwards until they're able to kick the engine back on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The blades gradually start producing less lift and the engine gradually produces less power until you just can't climb anymore. So nothing goes kablooey, and it's not a hard ceiling you bounce against. Rather, your maximum rate of climb gradually drops to zero.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Potentially stupid question then - wouldn't the danger of flying around mountains be more a product of weather patterns than altitude in that case? Ie, you're either within operating altitude or you're not, and dangers flying at a certain height are more due to wind etc. I suppose the Max height is probably influenced by weather though so maybe that's a judgement call for the pilot.</p></div>		</li>

And she flies a jet up as high as she can before falling back into thicker atmosphere and resuming her course.</p></div>		</li>
