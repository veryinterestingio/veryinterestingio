			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you mean in total or number of species?
Remember, there is far more saltwater than freshwater.
We get nasty infections from species like Vibrio, which are saltwater bacteria.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably more.</p>
<p>But Salt Water and Dry Salt are different things for bacteria.</p>
<p>A solution is a thing dissolved in water. Water can hold X amount of salt. Then it is saturated. </p>
<p>If you put 1 drop of water onto 1 gram of salt, the salt will pull the water out of everything inside the water.</p>
<p>Saltwater bacteria live in 3.5% salt in the ocean. At 135% salt, they will usually die. Same way if you cover your lips in salt they get dry and seem to burn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot, but they likely won’t have access to the foods we eat the same way fresh water or “land” bacteria would. Even in seafoods those bacteria won’t typically survive by the time they get to your kitchen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do the lactobacillus even survive the very high salinity of preserved foods? Or is the food kept at a threshold high enough to kill most of everything else but not the lacto?<br />
Also wondering, won't the lactobacillus eventually hit a point where its own excreted acidity will prevent its growth?  </p>
<p>I'm not a food-biologist, so I'm curious :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lactobacilli (LABs) love the saline environment, and actually take advantage of it to outcompete other microbes. They eventually create a salt/pH environment that's ideal to them and to no other species. </p>
<p>They usually settle at a pH of around 3, depending on the food product, and live happily ever after. Most foods preserved by LABs (sauerkraut, etc) can last a long time with live microbes until the nutrients in the system run out. </p>
<p>Within limits of course. Above ~20% NaCl concentrations even the LABs have trouble surviving. But, most food preservation techniques use much lower concentrations. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lactobacillus loves loves loves high acid environments to the point where their growth is optimal when they're paired with a second fermenting bacteria such as S thermophilus because they can produce acid and drop the pH more and will grow better because the high acid levels will inhibit other bacterial growth and allow these two species to out compete other bacteria. Of course pH can be a limiting factor but each number in pH is a log base which is 10,100,1000 etc difference in H+ levels. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably a hunter that went for the stomach: veals, kids (baby goats) and lambs will have &quot;cheese&quot; in their stomachs due to the fermenting of their milk, herbivores will have &quot;pickles&quot;. And liked what he/she tasted.</p>
<p>Then the hunter just tried to reproduce it. For example, cheese used to be solely made by inoculating milk with a veal's, kid's or lamb's stomach juice; most of the traditional cheese available today are still made that way.</p></div>		</li>
