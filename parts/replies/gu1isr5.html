<p>I don't follow this. Healthy foods actually make your body feel better, it's the flavors and textures of unhealthy food that sends those signals of pleasure to the brain that we like so much, but we can mimick those flavors in some ways, but it's usually just more expensive to do it with actual fresh ingredients and not engineering zero-cal sweeteners, for example... so I don't think I understand your last comment...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you already hit the nail on the head there though: it’s more expensive.  Tasty and healthy food <em>does</em> exist.  It just costs a lot more because it takes a combination of things to create it: better ingredients, time, and knowledge of how to prepare the food.  For example, there is a service near me that makes whole, nutrient-dense meals that taste incredible.  The problem is they cost $14 per serving.  So the food is out there.  It’s a matter of either learning how to prepare it (and having the time to do so) or paying someone else to do that for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup! </p>
<p>And the economics of this will never change in a &quot;free market.&quot; Processed foods are less healthy, have fewer nutrients from the processing and time, and have tons of added sugars and salts to make it taste good for a wide audience. But it's high in calories, so it keeps people alive and relatively full of energy, and large-scale agriculture can pat itself on the back for &quot;feeding the masses.&quot; </p>
<p>Healthier foods, as you said, require fresher ingredients which spoil relatively quickly and so cannot be shipped long distances nor sit on shelves for long periods of time; they also require a non-trival amount of effort to prepare the food into something more interesting than raw vegetables, which is time and energy most people who work all day and have screaming kids don't have the energy for every day, but that work can be outsourced to other workers but then costs a lot more for the finished meal.</p>
<p>To really solve this we need better wages and lower working hours per week for the typical worker so they can balance buying fresh-made meals from cooks or spend more time cooking for themselves, in addition to infrastructure changes, less giant farms and more local farms, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can make some pretty decent tacos and food at home. I'd argue my steaks are getting pretty damn good now that I've gotten a meat thermometer and subjected my family to endless steak experiments. But there's something about a fast food burger or Taco Bell that I can't really replicate at home. I can get closer to Chipotle than I can Taco Bell, even though Chipotle is arguably higher quality.</p></div>		</li>

<p>While true, it's a different kind of tasty and I think the original point was not that healthy food can't taste good, but that it will not have the same appeal as a big fatty burger or a pint of ice cream. Now perhaps someone's palate can be evolved to find plates of super healthy food very appealing, but most people are not going to find the same kind of enjoyment with healthy food as they would with unhealthy food. Which is not to say the healthy food can't be tasty and appealing, it can be, but not to the same extreme because it's not the kind of food we are biologically designed to crave and enjoy. And modern processed food is designed to be highly palatable and highly satisfying, which is tough for healthy food to compete with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;healthy&quot; foods, salads etc don't fill you up the same as a big bowl of carbs, that's what he is saying. You can't just flavour something and expect to trick your body, this is easy to replicate with a regular coke vs zero, zero actually tastes pretty similar to me but if you're hungry it does nothing to satisfy that craving but a regular works almost immediately</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you are reducing &quot;healthy foods&quot; to a list which is not representative of the healthy foods one could actually eat. There are lots of healthy foods that are loaded with energy which can fill you up as well as some processed garbage. Arguably better as processed foods have been shown to make people more &quot;hungry&quot;, at least to the extent that they over eat even more processed garbage.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You don't need to erase carbs from a diet to be healthy, and definitely not to make it healthi<em>er.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's probably because there's no correlation with the amount of carbs and fats in food to how healthy it is. I think more as how bioavailable those are in that particular food. It's completely different eating 30g of sugar in an apple or 30g of gummies. The more refined the worst and  every processed food made in a standardized way needs to use refined products.</p></div>		</li>
