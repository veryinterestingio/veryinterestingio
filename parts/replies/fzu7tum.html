			<div class="markdown"><p>So Clostridium difficiile is difficult to kill because it produces endospores which are a kind of spore that forms inside the bacteria and help it survive a LOT of normally destructive things like heat and cold, acidic solutions, radiation etc. However, what CAN kill it is bleach so when in doubt...use bleach! Not on your hands though ðŸ˜‚</p>
<p>And by the way it causes the worst diarrhea you have had in your life. Often times people can't even make it to the bathroom. It has a very distinct smell too. C. diff is no joke.</p>

<p>I had C. Diff.  Lost 20lbs. It sucked horribly, but I've actually had worse.  I went through 4 gallons of bleach disinfecting my apartment afterwards.  </p>
<p>BTW, if anyone has the bright idea of adding bleach to your hand sanitizer, don't.  That's how you make chloroform.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2868609/" title="Efficacy of cleaning products for C difficile: Environmental strategies to reduce the spread of Clostridium difficileâ€“associated diarrhea in geriatric rehabilitation Nora MacLeod-Glover, Cheryl Sadowski Can Fam Physician. 2010 May; 56(5): 417â€“423." target="_blank">this paper</a>, IDK. They've not been directly compared for effectiveness with sample sizes large enough to draw statistically significant conclusions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A recent study explored the adequacy of cleaning procedures and disinfection practices on sporulation rates in a hospital environment. During the 6-week study, commonly touched surfaces in rooms of patients with CDAD were cultured before and after housekeeping cleaned and again after researchers performed a second cleaning. Housekeeping cleaning protocols included using a clean cloth or mop soaked in 10% bleach, and researchers applied a 10% bleach solution using a spray bottle. All of the 9 rooms tested had cultures positive for C difficile before cleaning, 7 (78%) had cultures positive for C difficile after being cleaned by housekeeping, and 1 (11%) had cultures positive for C difficile after being cleaned by research staff. The authors reported that after the study was complete, cleaning staff were given additional time for cleaning (30 minutes per room), were trained to disinfect frequently touched surfaces (eg, bed rails, bedside tables, call buttons, telephones), and were trained to complete their cleaning with a 10% bleach solution spray.</p>
<p>A second study assessed the level of environmental C difficile in a variety of clinical areas, including geriatric care wards, after dry-mist hydrogen peroxide decontamination. The clinical areas included were selected to represent high-, moderate-, and low-risk areas, based on the existing C difficile infection rates at the facilities enrolled in the study. Three geriatric wards (10 rooms) represented high-risk areas; 2 isolation rooms on a hematology unit represented moderate-risk areas; and 2 isolation rooms (1 in an obstetric ward and 1 in an elective orthopedic ward) represented low-risk areas. After cleaning but before decontamination, 100% of geriatric care rooms had at least 1 culture positive for C difficile. After decontamination, 5 rooms had 1 or more positive cultures for C difficile (P = .033). Of 203 cultures taken in the 10 rooms, 48 (24%) were positive for C difficile before decontamination and 7 (3%) were positive for C difficile after decontamination (P &lt; .0001). Although these benefits were not achieved in the moderate- and low-risk rooms, this suggests that additional cleaning strategies in high-risk areas might provide protection from exposure to C difficile spores.</p>

<p>A biofilm is literally a living hardened mass of bacteria and other organisms that can resist chemicals that would usually kill them. A  good example of this is dental plaque.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alcohol hand sanitizers should be used for most when hand washing isnâ€™t available. Clostridium difficile is something youâ€™re only at high risk of during prolonged healthcare treatment (nursing home or hospital) for people over 65. Outside of a healthcare setting this isnâ€™t a big risk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but alcohol doesn't kill it either so washing your hands is the best way to get rid of them if you're exposed to it. Scrubbing for at least 20 seconds, with warm soapy water, 6 inches up your wrist and using a paper towel to dry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iâ€™m not disagreeing with you about hand washing and C-diff. My point was only that the question asker brought up alcohol based sanitizers and viruses (probably due to the viral pandemic occurring). Not an endospore forming bacteria. Definitely dangerous, definitely serious, but definitely not what they were asking about. People have enough to worry about.</p></div>		</li>
