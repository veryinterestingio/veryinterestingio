			<div class="markdown"><p>Low Upswept wing configurations are self centering in flight, more efficient at takeoff, require less rigidity in the hulls support framing, and allow easier ground inspection.
Commercially they are a better choice for airlines.
As mentioned about the loading and runways for high mount wings they also downsweep the wings as it causes the forces to be a better tention structure while also allowing more reactive roll while being able to withstand higher tear away forces. If Upswept wings are used on a high mount aircraft they will require braces from the Hull to the wing as seen in small aircraft.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>most civilian jet airliners are built wth range, speed and fuel economy then passenger efficiency as the major considerations plus life cycle pressurization cycles as well as maintainance. compared to military transports the strength of the airframe for low level operations is a far more critical capability. it's not remotely a jet  fighter but especially doing pin point air drops of troops, supplies, cargo ammo, ect low speed survivability and responsiveness are paramount even more so in bad weather and/ or at night...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add onto this</p>
<p>Military cargo aircraft need realitively short landing gear for the cargo ramps they employ, and low wings with hanging engines below the body of the aircraft would make it so you need an abnormally long or abnormally steep cargo ramp.</p>
<p>The high wings with engines hanging around the middle of the aircraft allow for the cargo ramp to be just the right length and at a shallow angle.</p>
<p>If you compare the ground clearance of military cargo and civil aircraft you'll notice the military ones look like they're almost skidding along on their bellies, especially the heavy lift transports</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wrong, they are built with and anhedral instead of a dihedral. They are built up high for engine clearance, and if they are up high like that a dihedral wouldn't work, hence the anhedral. Take a fw190 vs an antonov. Low wing dihedral, high wing anhedral.</p>
<p>Dihedral and anhedral both add roll-slip stability, but in different ways.</p>
<p>Edit: roll-slip stability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This, exactly. You can see this very clearly on the <a href="https://youtu.be/riEmAvlrynk?t=73" target="_blank">B52.</a>  At ~1:20, you can see the pogo wheels on the wing tips are well off the ground, shortly before the aircraft lifts off.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/riEmAvlrynk?t=133" target="_blank">Same video</a> at 2:13, you can see the pogos are still well off the ground even after the drag chute is deployed</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Takeoff and landing are high lift conditions so the wings are going to get swept up more than usual because there’s more force on them. There’s still a bit of anhedral built into the wings for all flight conditions, even if it’s not as extreme as it seems on the ground.</p></div>		</li>
