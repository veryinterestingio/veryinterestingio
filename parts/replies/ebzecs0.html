Your explanation is very ELI5, but it is still really abstract to me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A pendulum would have been one <em>if it wouldn't slow down</em>. A pendulum without energy loss through friction, etc, would move with a constant frequency. All cycles would be identical.</p>
<p>The novel thing with these crystals are that they do not slow down, they don't lose their energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am extremely layman when it comes to physics, but this sounds to me to be very close to perpetual motion. I may be mistaken but I thought those were impossible. Everything that has mass and uses energy creates friction, which eventually slows it down to a stop. The only solution I can find is if something was feeding energy into these time crystals. Would that not make it impossible to be naturally occurring? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the only way no energy loss could be possible is if the entire structure is static and the only way that could be possible is the dispersion of the structure through time? Can this state be induced onto otherwise normal matter? What causes the time fluctuation? What I mean is, is it possible that other matter exists in these other dimensions as well but simply doesn't fluctuate?</p></div>		</li>

<p>By the third paragraph I could feel myself stretching through time space and was made aware that I'm changing in one direction, and now I have time crystal vertigo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alright, just listen. Everything is going to be fine. You're very high right now. You will probably be that way for five more hours. Try taking some Vitamin B complex, Vitamin C complex.. if you have beer, go ahead and drink it.</p>
<p>Just remember you're a living organism on this planet, and you're very safe. You've just taken a heavy drug. Relax, stay inside, and listen to some music. Do you have any Allman Brothers?</p></div>		</li>
