			<div class="markdown"><p>What's the simplest organism we know that sleeps?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can we analyze it to find out exactly why does it sleep? Not just: &quot;to rest, to regen, to rest his neurons&quot; or something like that. Precisely, why do neurons or something in those words require the action we call sleep?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What's stopping that same organism from working 24/7 ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The tricky bit is that we don't really have a clear, universal definition of what 'sleep' actually <em>is</em>. And since we can't define it, we can't say <em>why</em> we require it either, if that makes sense. We know it is to do with rest and recuperation, memory consolidation and general cleanup, but what <em>is</em> it? Why do we do it for eight hours a day but a giraffe does it in 20 minutes? Why do we dream? Is that necessary, or a byproduct? And because we dream, we can say with conviction that our brains are still very much active while we sleep... so why can't we just stay awake?  </p>
<p>Sleep is still one of those questions that we keep grappling with and where seemingly simple questions have surprisingly elusive answers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did some research on cyanobacteria in college in a lab that studies circadian rhythms. They have a set of proteins that form something akin to a little molecular clock that runs with a roughly 24 hour period and controls gene expression. Thought to be one of the earlier examples of simple circadian systems. You might call &quot;sleep&quot; a period of cyclic gene down-regulation, at least for this organism.</p>

<p>See the section on clock proteins. Seems intuitive that there might be some evolutionary advantage to synchronizing photosynthesis/nitrogen fixation to the sun, perhaps ramping up protein synthesis just ahead of sunrise for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can we start from the easiest sleeper?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You said the roundworm has 40 neurons, is there anything with one, two, three?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does it also sleep?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If all that criteria is met, can we analyze it in depth?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How I see it, smaller problems of a same task are easier to tackle than large ones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the simplest answer for &quot;why do we sleep?&quot; is &quot;because we can&quot;. We have survived for millions of years sleeping, and evolution doesn't care for optimization. If we do sleep (for whatever primordial reason) and can survive and pass our genes, or descendants will also sleep. And the more complex our brain got, the more it relied on that behavior for basic functionality.</p>
<p>If sleeping represented a major risk for survival, our ancestors wouldn't have developed that behavior.</p></div>		</li>
