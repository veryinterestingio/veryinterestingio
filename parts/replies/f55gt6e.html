			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a layman but from what I see human hair tends to be located around areas where it performs some useful role; hair on head protects the brain from heat and cold; eyebrows keep sweat out of the eyes; eyelashes, ear and nose hair helps exclude particles entering our orfices; pubic hair and armpit hair help to manage sweaty areas and prevent chafing, etc.</p>
<p>If I had to guess, as evolution progressed down through the centuries, humans born without hair in these places were at a disadvantage and did not progress, whereas humans born without hair in other places were not disadvantaged or possibly even advantaged and so progressed. Over time then, we lost most of our hair but kept it in the places that matter. </p>
<p>Just my take.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds plausible. However it's good to remember that not everything serves a direct adaptive purpose. For example, some features might be just side effects from other highly beneficial mutations. Some traits can even be disadvantageous if the associated benefits outweigh them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure but if a trait is pan global and pan cultural (like hair distribution) do you really think it's a side effect?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A small counter-argument - people tend overemphasize evolutionary theories related survival like dying in the wild or better hunter gathering, etc. Many many traits are derived from sexual selection pressures as opposed to fighting off bears or whatever. This would almost certainly be one that is a sexual selection because if it was purely survival based, the trait wouldn't be so rare in the rest of mammals. Hair is very common in mammals, yet hair our length is not. Plus the fact that it is specifically around our face, where we receive tons of social information and cues is probably not incidental.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This brings to mind the recent research that has been done into why male birds have such striking features. They tried to explain it as survival for years, but experiments have found that the female birds just like them better with bigger plumes or colors or whatever. There is a good chance we just evolved this way because we find it more attractive.</p>
<p>Edited: I meant not just females looking for traits that help with survival, but rather purely aesthetic preference. I can't find the article I read, but I'm not claiming anything is definitive, it's a theory with some studies that suggest sometimes this is the case</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I genuinely love about this part of the thread is that even if some of the speculation is wrong, it still highlights one of my favorite insights into human evolution. We didn’t evolve to survive as cavemen. We literally evolved to be civilized. </p>
<p>As someone said above, we might’ve evolved to need nice haircuts. And to eat a nice cooked meal. And to run a marathon. (ITT “muh teleology,” it’s just an expression.) So if you go on a morning jog, then stop by the stylist before taking your girlfriend to dinner at a nice restaurant, you’re doing exactly what your ancestors evolved to do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm also pretty sure not everyone can grow really long hair and that it needs certain care beyond a length our ancestors didn't know about. I'm a male with long hair since 20 years, didn't had a single cut since then but yet it only goes until my shoulder blade and never became longer. Took maybe 3 years to reach that length</p>
<p>edit: Just made me curious if there's a reason for my assumption and googled it, pretty interesting to read: <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/why-dont-chimpanzees-have-long-luscious-locks-1-180951387/" target="_blank">https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/why-dont-chimpanzees-have-long-luscious-locks-1-180951387/</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>Both me and my brother have long hair. His is well past his shoulders.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, but that'd be enough tbh. As for care, we used to decorate our hair with mud and such in our ancestry. That may have had some minerals to take care of it in it, and failing that it'd mean you are unlikely to keep it beyond long hair then</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, because we never didn't have a way to cut it.</p>

<p>or not</p>
<p>dreadlocks and twisting it up and tying it are other options too.</p></div>		</li>
