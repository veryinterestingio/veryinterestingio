			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree, shingles is absolutely terrible. I'd take it over a kidney stone any day, but unfortunately I don't really get the option of one or the other. I'm going to have more kidney stones, and in all likelihood, I'll get shingles again because of how young I was when I got it the first time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Get the new vaccine, shingrix is 97% effective against shingles. I work in Healthcare, you may need a prescription is you're under 50.</p>
<p>It's approved in adults 50 or over and recommendations that everyone who had zostavax should get the new vaccine as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This may sound like a weird question, but how much did dislocating your ankle hurt? (I've got a connective tissue disorder that caused my joints to dislocate easily and frequently and <em>I think</em> less painfully, so I've always wondered what it feels like for a normal person.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My ankle injury was a bit more complicated than dislocation - dislocation, ligament tear, compound fracture.</p>
<p>It hurt a lot, but mixed into the pain was the scare of seeing the gruesome injury, foot backwards, blood, bone, etc.</p>
<p>Shingles hurt a lot, too. Maybe less intensely than the ankle, but since it just went on and on for days it really wore me down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shingles is the dormant varicella zoster virus that becomes active again after it have given you chickenpox. If you have not had the virus or vaccine you cannot get shingles. </p>
<p>However, you can get chickenpox as an adult (Which sucks a lot more ass as an adult, greater risk of pneumonia, hepatitis, and encephalitis) and then get shingles. Later just like everyone else. </p>
<p>Note: While the vaccine stile uses live virus, it is a lot more rare to get shingles from the weaken virus used in the vaccine.</p>
<p>The only reason I can think of to expose children to an outbreak of chicken pox, is to ensure that the vaccine in your vaccinated child was effective (it is around 95% of the time). Getting surprised by chicken pox after you got the vaccine sucks, but getting surprised by chicken pox as a vaccinated adult sucks more.  </p>
<p>Edit: This is of cause only a valid option if testing for vaccine effectiveness and getting another set of isn't an option. No point in getting the normal virus in your system instead of the weak one if the cost isn't going to result in hardship. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The live virus is <em>exactly</em> why I can’t be vaccinated against the chicken pox. I don’t have enough IgA to withstand vaccines with live viruses. </p>
<p>The anti-vax movement fucking terrifies me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know very little weakened immune system. </p>
<p>I assumed that due to the rather long contagion period before symptoms the risk of getting exposed is so high that it is inevitable in the long run. So getting weakened version in an controlled environment would be the saver option. </p>
<p>is it because what makes chicken pox worse for an adult is the strong immune system which is nullified by a weakened immune system so it is better to wait as long as possible than getting the weakened version? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Before the chickenpox vaccine was common, parents would expose children to outbreaks of chickenpox to ensure they caught it before they grew old enough that they would have a worse case. As others have said, the odds then favored catching it sooner or later, and better sooner than later.</p></div>		</li>
