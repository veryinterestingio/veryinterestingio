<p>Cotton will not be compressed to the ground and therefore the drag will be better than the nails, maybe...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I suspect it's about volume but OP said the cotton and nails were 'contained' though that might be a miscommunication. </p>
<p>My feeling is that it's a drag thing and it's carried rather than contained. Drag increases with <del>cube</del> square of speed which explains the nail truck catching up but not why the cotton truck is first to begin with...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had teachers like this before.  The guy is probably going to pull out some quirk in how he said what he said.  One thing that is coming to mind is that the question (as OP writes it) could be taken to mean that they run one after the other (same starting and end point).  In which case, it is whichever truck goes first.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, if this were a riddle, the answer would be ‘whichever truck does the run first’, given that there is only one driver. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing is, the teacher is not making his point at all. He called the students slow for not being able to provide an argument, but I don't see him offering an explanation either. So I don't think he knows what he's talking about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm thinking the idea here is a somewhat shielded attempt to convey critical thinking skills. If you're given a scenario told no it's wrong, but why do you think that? The correct answer should be, I dont know. Sometimes in science that's the best answer giveable.</p>
<p>Definite miss on the teachers part for not driving that home after the lesson as otherwise it just gets lost and does no critical thinking training. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Was thinking the same thing, poissibly also get students to engage in infomation discovery. However, if he didnt tie it into the lesson then the point would be lost (as seen by op).</p></div>		</li>
