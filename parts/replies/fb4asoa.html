			<div class="markdown"><p>Meh this is misleading. When a movie really hits it big, profit payouts are legit and normal, but itâ€™s usually really in only a massive success that this happens, so everyone is happy, even the studio.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think there's any way that you can actually prove that. If it was fraud, the IRS would have jumped on that studio like a hungry cat.
