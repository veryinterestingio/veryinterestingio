			<div class="markdown"><p>What is &quot;tangible wealth&quot;? Is owning the rights to a barrel of oil or a brick of cocaine inherently worth more than owning a portion of a company's factories? Is the US dollar tangible wealth, or are we only counting precious metals because the US government can print more of those?</p></div>		</li>

Money is like the blood. Buildings are your heart etc. They nourish different kinds of power. Money is obviously the most powerful because it can be converted to be used into anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It gets a little murkier when you consider the drug kingpin has tons (literally, paper is heavy) of cash that is hard to spend legally, while a billionaire who has funds 'tied up' can walk into any bank in america and walk out with enough cash to last a normal person a month.  It doesn't matter if they can't touch their own funds, any lending institution would recognize the wealth and have no problem giving out huge cash loans.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Or 100,000 months for that matter.</p>
<p>One of the fun things about this level of wealth is how it just works differently. If you're that top 0.05% or whatever, you can take $0 in salary and just live on loans. If you're a billionaire, you can choose which bank you want to borrow money from at interest rates well below what any normal person could ever attain. Why would you spend actual money from your bank account to buy a $5 million dollar house when you can take out a mortgage with an interest rate lower than inflation? Use your own money on investments that pay good returns, not on buying stuff like a house or car or utilities. That's what poor people do. Let the bank pay for that shit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And that's not all. There's a big time gap between when you spend money, and when you make money. It's usually on the order of one to several months, but highly dependent on the industry.</p>
<p>See, you gotta pay your supplier. Then you gotta pay rent for the factory, pay your workers, pay the utilities, pay for shipping. So that's money you've spent, but you haven't made any money yet.</p>
<p>Sometimes you sell your stuff to retail stores or distributors on credit, so they pay you in a month, or you give them a discount to pay early / upfront.</p>
<p>Because those retailers themselves are in the same boat! They need money to run their company, and part of that money goes towards paying you for what you're making.</p>
<p>Finally, when they pay you, you get money back. That money goes towards paying loans, paying your suppliers, paying for your property, plant, and equipment, paying staff... the cycle starts anew.</p>
<p>The accounting concepts are &quot;accounts payable&quot; and &quot;accounts receivable&quot; if you're interested in further reading.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was talking to a friend who manages a medium sized company on behalf of a VC corporation a couple days ago. Last week their payroll was a little over $1 million. Gross revenue was $8,000. And that's just payroll, not mortgage, insurance, taxes, utilities, etc.  If you suddenly stop making money, your billion dollar company becomes worthless overnight.</p>
<p>That's why we saw over 3 million UE claims last week.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They actually don't need to make much money at all.</p>
<p>Let's say you go to college and study biochemistry. You come up with some amazing general purpose antiviral that looks super promising.</p>
<p>Your professor is very well connected and suggests the two of you found a company together, splitting the ownership. But you need a lot of money to get moving.</p>
<p>So you raise $50m (he is well connected) at pre-money of $100m. You buy all sorts of equipment and hire a team to get moving. You are being paid $200k/year off this and you are exctatic. </p>
<p>Of course, you moved in from Ohio and the wealthiest you in your town was worth $20m. Quite interestingly, you are already worth twice as much as they were... Theoretically. I mean, it is unlikely as all hell that he would give you $20m for your shares in your company (after all, it's a horrible sign about the antiviral that you want out to put it mildly).</p>
<p>Now let's say it has been two years and a big pharma really likes your results and there is competition for the next round. Eventually you get a $300m investment at pre-money of $3bn. Congratulations, you are officially a billionaire!</p>
<p>Do you think you could buy a private jet worth $50m at this point? Or fuck, do you think you could buy a home worth $2m without taking a loan?</p></div>		</li>
