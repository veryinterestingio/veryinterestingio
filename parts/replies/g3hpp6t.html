			<div class="markdown"><p>Not every protein precipitates out of solution at extreme low or high pH...  but that doesn’t mean they wouldn’t change their shape.  Extreme heat (I mean, center of sun is one thing... but merely boiling water) is not going to denature 100% of proteins, especially smaller peptides.  </p>
<p>There’s only a single type of protein each prion disease we know of denatures to become a replicate of that prion.  Most proteins do not have a “prion form”.  That’s the main reason that every single protein in the world can’t become a prion... because very few have a conformation which both renders them inactive from their primary function AND converts other proteins of the same original prior orientation and sequence to that same prion type conformation.</p>

<p>Are there proteins which meet the second part of that condition, but not the first?  Where the prion-form can still do its original job?  Eg, harmless prions?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A prion by definition is not able to do its function, so there are no harmless prions. Proteins are so specific that it is highly doubtful a protein could cause another to change shape through whatever form of transmission prions use without degrading the function of the original protein, and since prions are such a rare phenomenon and only spotted from symtpoms, it's unlikely anybody would be looking for a protein that infectiously changes the structure of other proteins whilst keeping their function.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a hot area of research now. Lots of proteins have &quot;prion like domains&quot;. These are parts of the protein that are intrinsically disordered and want to glom together. Why are these domains present in so many proteins?! One theory is that these domains facilitate phase transitions within the cell, allowing for liquid-liquid phase separation.</p>
<p>So, let's say you want to translate a specific part of a chromosome in the nucleus. The proteins you need are spread across the entire nucleoplasm and waiting around for them to diffuse over to that one spot is going to take forever. Instead, you get a local increase in some protein that has a disordered region. This creates a kind of hydrogel that can freely exchange with the rest of the nucleus, but can have a local increase in the concentration of certain important proteins without losing then to diffusion. Unlike a membrane-bound organelle, which has a physical barrier, this liquid droplet can form and dissolve quickly with minimal energy expenditure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The structure of a protein is (partially) what makes it function the way it does, so changing that shape, as a prion does, would change the functionality.  There may, however, be a prion that changes the protein and makes it perform a different function (other than making more prion), but i'm not aware of one.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Thank you, this answer makes me feel 72% better about how badly prion diseases could come in and turn all of me into goo, not just my brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The freaky thing is the prion protein is highly preserved across mamilian species, but IIRC we still don't know exactly what it does.  This means either it is essential to our functioning or the entire mammalian branch had an extremely unlucky ancestor.  Not all prion diseases can jump species, but chronic wasting disease (deer) has shown at least some structural drift, which means it is not inconceivable that it could jump at some point.   Scary stuff with how long the incubation period is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory could there be designer &quot;anti-prion&quot; prions, that only take misfolded proteins  and upset their ability to &quot;replicate&quot;? </p>
<p>I mean &quot;in theory&quot; as in &quot;could we actually do this eventually with enough resources&quot; not &quot;I suppose FTL travel could be possible&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hahaha... in theory communism works!  In theory.  </p>
<p>It would be basically impossible with our current ability to predict protein protein interaction and the speed with which we can confirm conformational changes.  </p>
<p>For example, I’ve spent 4 years trying to get a misfolded snake venom peptide to refold into a natural bioactive conformation without having to worry about doing it inside a living organism and I still haven’t been successful, and may never be successful... it may be almost impossible to do depending on a bunch of variables.  Other proteins refold into their native state from a denatured one as soon as you drop them into water of a physiological pH.  Luckily it’s only one part of my dissertation research.  But trying to refold it into a non native form that somehow turns other misfolded proteins into the native form...  let’s just say if someone does it and figures out a replicable methodology to do it again and again they’d be publishing in Nature and Science and possibly win a Nobel prize  even if it didn’t work inside an actual organism.</p></div>		</li>
