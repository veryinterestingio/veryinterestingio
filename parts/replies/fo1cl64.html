			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! So this would only apply if the page is monetized? I just hear of them being flagged but I’m not a major user so I don’t know the lingo well. I just know people get their videos taken down for a song that you can find a perfect full version of on the same platform.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve had a video struck for having a song in the background. Since I’m trying to get monetized I took down my video and reuploaded it with the song out. I did so even though the video was still up and I was given a message saying that the owner of the song will let me keep it, but they’ll take all the monetization from it. For big time youtubers that could mean losing 100% of the revenue for a 4sdcond song clip in the background which is totally unfair because the video could be 10-15minutes of random footage getting monetized by someone else</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does depend on the copyright holder. For most of them, if you post their song, but they get paid for it, they're OK with that (particularly since it's mostly the record companies that are controlling this, and money is mostly what they care about). But they do have the option to block infringing videos entirely.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not sure if this is what OP is referring to, but I've kept up with a couple of &quot;first reaction to ...&quot; YouTube channels. They use a picture-in-picture format where the video they're reacting to is playing usually in the lower right corner, lower left corner or lower center while the larger video shows them as they're listening.</p>
<p>They often comment that if the video gets blocked, they'll have to post a version with the lyric video instead.</p></div>		</li>
