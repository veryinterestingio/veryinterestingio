			<div class="markdown"><p>To get a little more philosophically spicy: Why does it need to stop at our bodies? Mentally, what makes our body feel like it's &quot;part of us&quot; is control and feedback. In other words, we exert some amount of control over it and it, in turn, sends back sensations to our brain to give us an idea of the world outside ourselves. But you could say the same about the tools we use. A chef's knife, a musician's instrument, or, more broadly, all of our smartphones and wearable devices. These things might not be biologically connected to us, but given how plastic our brains and mental states are, it's not a stretch to define them as extensions of the self.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Personally, I think that's an abuse of fuzzy definitions and shows a complete disregard for the heap of sand paradox, but that's philosophy for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And I'm certainly not going to make such an expansive a claim; I feel no control over the vast majority of the universe, nor do I get much sensory feedback from it. I'm simply saying that my own definition of the self extends a little further out than just the biological body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just think of how hazy that line gets when humans begin to augment themselves with technology. I mean, we already do to some extent, but I'm talking matrix-style augmentation where you literally plug your brain into a network and upload/download instead of learning or experiencing things via conventional sensory inputs.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There is an individual self, as much as there are meters and kilograms. They are concepts which are useful in operating in the world, but they are not reality itself. They are not real in the sense the feel of your keyboard is or the weigh on your sitting ass are real.</p>
<p>And likewise, in nature there isn't a &quot;heap of sand&quot;. &quot;Heap of sand&quot; is a concept, an individual thought. Reality does not know such a difference any more than nature knows a difference between a centimeter and a meter.</p>
<p>What there is, is a continuously changing impermanent stream of events and changes in a certain point of space, and some bundles of those events include thoughts and feelings that &quot;self&quot; is a separate permanent entity. But they are just thoughts that occur at some point of of the universe. What you are is the universe experiencing itself.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really interesting point! The line between self and other is pretty tenuous. It's easy to consider my heart a part of me since I'm so obviously dependent on it to continue my existence. I'm similarly dependent on the trees outside to keep the oxygen content in the air sufficient for my functioning; I'm dependent on the entire mass of the Earth to give the atmosphere the appropriate range of pressures my body needs to function; I'm dependent on the Sun to ultimately fuel the energy for virtually my every action.</p>
<p>What's stopping me from extending my sense of self throughout the planet and beyond? From seeing forests, the Earth, and even the Sun as my organs?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Mainly the fact that you'd have to mangle the definition of an organ to an unrecognizable form (&quot;that which I'm dependent on&quot;) , which also is then so broad that it's entirely useless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's any comfort, it's given many philosophers over the centuries existential crises as well! And it's not like any one philosopher has ever come along and just &quot;solved&quot; these problems. Most philosophers just moved on to related topics they find more interesting or think are more important.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You shouldn't let it upset you to much. These questions don't actually affect you unless you think about them. Hume presented all these kinds of horrid problems like Bundle Theory and the Problem of Induction but even he conceded that although the world as we perceive it makes no logical sense it still seems to work.</p>
<p>I like to think &quot;Be a philospher , but amid all your philosophy , be still a man.&quot; was the first trigger warning lol</p></div>		</li>
