			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll start with b first. Yes, different casinos shuffle the shoe at certain points. Some will deal 75% or so of the shoe before shuffling, while others will shuffle after only 50% of the cards have been dealt. Shuffling sooner means there is less time for the shoe to gain an imbalance of high cards and become &quot;hot,&quot; so it reduces the effectiveness of card counting. There's a major downside to the casino to shuffling sooner though. Shuffling takes time and thus the table will not play as many hands in an hour. That gives the casino fewer hands to win money off of the vast majority of the remaining players who aren't counting cards.</p>
<p>Now for using more decks. This is an entirely separate issue. The more decks a blackjack table uses the worse it is for the player. This is because fewer decks = more blackjacks. To see why, imagine you draw a 10 as your first card. Now you need an ace to complete a blackjack. If there were infinite decks, you would have a 4/52 chance of drawing that ace. But in a single deck game, you have a 4/51 chance because you already have one non-ace in your hand. Players understand that fewer decks give an advantage to the player and so casinos offer single or double deck games to appeal to them, usually tweaking some other rules to cancel out this advantage. This effect really overwhelms any card counting considerations in terms of deck size.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Can't they just use two shoes and a shuffling machine, dealing from one while the other one is shuffling?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you explain to me why does house have an edge? You are playing with the same deck and with the same chances of drawing good or bad cards. What exactly gives them an advantage however small it is? (In a scenario where you dont count cards but just play normally)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean most casinos use a multi deck shoe. So 4-8 decks and all the cards don't get used before a reshuffle makes counting to predict outcome damn near impossible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even worse is when a casino uses something like 5.5 decks. Then they have a hot swap deck ready to swap out after 8 hands. You’ll never have an advantage</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The amount of decks does not add to the difficulty of counting. It just means it typically takes deeper penetration of the shoe to get to a meaningful count.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work as a supervisor, the guy in the suit behind the dealer. I'm the one watching out for this kind of stuff. Using more cards in the shoe doesn't really effect someone whos really good at counting. They can adjust their numbers based on whether its 1 decks 6 decks or 8+. These days, a lot of casinos are transitioning to using continuous shufflers. Instead of using a regular shoe and manually shuffling, you will deal a couple hands and once you get about a decks worth of cards in the discard rack you give them a quick riffle and toss em back into the machine to be randomly placed back all throughout the shoe. These machines don't change the odds of the game. Let me say that again because I'm about to have a million people try to tell me I'm wrong but SHUFFLE MASTERS AND AUTOMATIC SHUFFLERS DO NOT CHANGE YOUR ODDS OF WINNING. their only purpose is to make counting cards impossible and also to cut down the time it takes to manually shuffle 8 decks. More hands per hour means more money for us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually continuous shufflers do change the odds of the game in the player’s favor. Look up the cut card effect if you’re curious as to why. But this advantage is more than offset by the greater number of hands per hour.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I read through this it sounds like you as a player using a strategy to give you the highest chances of winning... does the casino want you to play the game blindly and just rely on luck rather than trying to win ? </p>
<p>I have never gambled or been to a casino before so sorry if this is a noob question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In blackjack there is something called “basic strategy.” Basically it’s a chart detailing what the best play in every situation is, but only considering the cards you currently have and the upcard the dealer is showing.</p>
<p>A player who plays basic strategy will do significantly better than a typical player, but he will still lose in the long run. A competent card counter will win in the long run. So a casino will tolerate good strategy up to the point where the odds actually tip in the player’s favor. Then they have no reason to keep the player there anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but I believe the question is: why is the casino allowed to do this?</p>
<p>Edit: to be clear, I understand why and how, but I believe OP was asking “why is this allowed”, not why do the casinos do it. And, yes, clearly it would be entirely not in their interest to allow it. But that’s the point: if i figure out a way to beat your game, one might think that you can’t just say, “well, you can’t play it anymore.” But of course, the alternative would just be that they eliminate that game entirely. So...</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why do they do it? Because it’s in their interest. </p>
<p>Why are they allowed to do it? Because the government or gaming commission or whoever has not explicitly forbade it. Why not?  Because.</p></div>		</li>
