			<div class="markdown"><p>Last part, Eli...12 mebbe.
Is there a frequency that 'corresponds' to blue independent of our eyes/brain?</p>
<p>If our cones and brain were wired differently so we picked up other frequencies, seeing colurs zymf, gronk and jonxø, wouldnt we then say that blue is just what we see when gronk and zymf light up at the same time?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pure yellow light has a wavelength of around 580 nm. Our red and green cones overlap a bit at that point, so both get excited when they're exposed to that light, and we see it as yellow. But all our brain knows is that the red and green cones are excited a certain amount. If you shine the right mix of pure red and green light at your eyes, you'll see yellow all the same, even though no yellow light is present at all. That's why an RGB screen can generate nearly every color with only three different wavelengths. It's not because light or color are special in that way, but because our eyes only really distinguish three types of light to begin with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the two other colours to make blue, gronk and zymf would have to be green and ultraviolet, and we'd need receptors for both, and no receptor for blue. If a child was born with their blue receptors shifted so far along the spectrum that they had red, green, and UV receptors, they would still be just as able to see what we see as blue and all the colours surrounding it, but their brain would be registering it as a mixture of green and UV, where both those receptors are being activated by the blue light. They would also be able to see the crazy hidden patterns on flower petals, as well as the cum on your bedsheets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The question is confusing, but fundamentally &quot;blue&quot; is made up inside your brain. There's nothing fundamentally special about 430 nm light.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I find it interesting that you picked, as an example, a color that doesn't have a wavelength.  It only exists as a color to us because our brain constructs it from red and blue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find that example really drives home that “color” isn’t frequency. But yes, perhaps an example with a frequency  in between red and green or in between green and blue would be better.  This is ELI5, though, and I was trying not to to say things like “basis function” or “540 nm”.</p>
<p>Edit: I did leave out a bit, I guess.  A mixture of incoming frequencies will “add up”, their contributions to each of the cones. </p>
<p>As another interesting aside, this explanation can be used to understand color blindness.  Folks with color blindness are either missing one or two of the types of cones, or they have one of their cones ‘tuned’ to a different frequency than most folks.</p></div>		</li>
