<p>Mass used to have a call-in number you could dial to find out the traffic on interstates and state highways.  It was pretty useful before map apps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right. I work in the domain of managing variable message sign messages. Corporations like Google/HERE/TomTom get most of their data from cellular towers usage and combined with historical trends it can get pretty precise. We use them to determine travel times and it's pretty much always right. On the other hand, it's not very reactive. If there's a stopped traffic event due to an accident or any other car queue pile up reason, those sources can takes from 5 to 15 minutes before they adapt their times. That's why in construction zones we deploy speed sensors all along the roads to be informed instantaneously to any change of traffic state and change the messages accordingly as soon as it happens, because for this situation Google is not good enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Also running GPS constantly is a massive battery drain, even when augmenting with cellular triangulation and stray WiFi signals (both of which can be more precise and faster than straight GPS).</p>
<p>Both Apple and Google play the same trick: low precision, infrequent GPS traces triggered by cell tower handoff at all times, and high precision GPS active only when you need it. When using turn by turn directions, you get the high precision constantly (at the expense of all your battery). When just using your phone normally or keeping it in your pocket, you get the infrequent low precision updates. Those infrequent updates are used to drive location-aware services like reminders and home automation.</p></div>		</li>
