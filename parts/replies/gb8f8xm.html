			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty sure they don't do this for intestinal obstruction. That's what x-ray, CT, MRI is for. Why would you do this? So invasive.</p>
<p>So much is wrong with this, not least the very high risk of complications.</p>
<p>I mean maybe decades ago before x-ray. But they still had hands feeling the abdomen. Where on earth did you hear this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They run the bowel if there is a known obstruction they are fixing or other injury like a hole they either already know about from imaging or the patient is so sick itâ€™s emergent. Astute observation! It would be silly to do this to anybody who came in throwing up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I said in the post that I discussed this with a doctor. Whether the procedure is antiquated or not, it does exist, and this was his description of it. You don't get to say he doesn't do it or that it doesn't exist or that I made it up. You weren't there. You can say it is no longer common or is largely supplanted with digital imaging. Those are valid additions to the facts that I gave.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I literally work with gastro doctors in the UK (maybe different by country). It is not common practice as you described. And some people on here sensationalise.</p>
<p>Check the reply above yours which gave a reasonable explanation. And things should always be questioned. Don't take it personally.</p></div>		</li>
