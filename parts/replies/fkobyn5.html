			<div class="markdown"><p>To elaborate on your correct answer: cellular machinery is universally VERY similar, but ecen between 2 individuals within a species you see enough small variation in proteins and their structures to cause differences in outcomes when it comes to infection and other diseases. Between 2 different species: the variations stack up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I am resistant to norovirus because of a genetic mutation. It showed up on a genetic screen years ago and practically speaking I have never had the severe symptoms, despite it sweeping through offices I've worked in and my ex who I lived with having it. I have had very mild loss of appetite and mild nausea once or twice during an outbreak but never vomiting or diarrhoea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>you can understand it pretty well when you understand the history of viruses. scientists think that viruses evolved from dna and rna in cells and thats whyy</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't have any existing immune response to them. </p>
<p>By the time my kids were 2, they'd each had 15-20 colds. Not a big problem as they didn't have anything else to do at that age.</p>
<p>Once they had been exposed to all the common variations it slowed right down and they get sick roughly as often as adults.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just about the fact that we don't have a preexisting immune response. (Also note that a species jumping disease is different from a human disease transmitted by another species, like malaria) It's also about those differences in cellular machinery: the way they interact with, say, a civet, is to make it a little sick. When they try to operate the cellular machinery in a human the same way they do in a civet, they end up interacting in a very different, and often more lethal, way. </p>
<p>You can apply a little evolutionary logic to it: a disease that's extremely infectious will rapidly burn its way through an entire population, and everyone will either be immune to it, or dead (this is also why diseases like H1N1 become less deadly over time; dead people can't transmit it). A disease that's been with us for a long time, like a rhinovirus, is just a little infectious, and extremely rarely deadly: a person with a cold will, on average, infect one other person before recovering. The only way someone will die from a rhinovirus is if they're extremely immunocompromised, like they're on full body radiation therapy; they're already extremely vulnerable to it (i.e. someone who's already on death's door, and a stiff breeze would kill them); or they're just extraordinarily unlucky.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the virus co-evolved with those species and became less deadly (otherwise the virus would have died off).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And to add a little to this, there are some species which are very similar to us and can transmit viruses to us. If memory serves there are some viruses which we've tracked that have gone through several species/ iterations before they have the necessary components to infect humans</p></div>		</li>
