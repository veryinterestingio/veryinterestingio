			<div class="markdown"><p>He didn't do himself any favors by being so cock-sure of himself. He discovered some functional therapeutic methods and concepts but to hear him talk about it it's clear he was sure he discovered THE TRUTH of the psyche. His dream analysis and psycho sexual stages of development have their functions but he was not willing to put it through the rigors of the scientific method or give space for other behavior theories. </p>
<p>I think the only time he ever changed his mind was about the health effects of cocaine and cigars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well to be fair his nephew pretty much sucessfully marketed cigarettes for women based on this theory. </p>
<p>There was a huge stigma around women and smoking, it was seen as inappropriate and vulgar for women to smoke, Edward Bernays was asked by some tabacco companies how they could get around this stigma and expand their market to women.</p>
<p>Edward Bernays the motherfucker, linked cigarettes to a symbol of male power (phalic object yada, yada) and renamed them torches of freedom, had a bunch of women smoking in a women's rights march and took advantage of the movement for the tobacco company.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Bullshit.</p>
<p>Freud never stopped expanding and modifying and tweaking his ideas. In fact, it's been a struggle for scholars on Freud to compile his ideas in a way that would reflect his theories accurately because his writings are scattered over the course of 40 years and changed with time. He discarded theories from his older work and reworked many of the rest.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, it's infuriating how people think he was a &quot;megalomaniac&quot; and &quot;never changed his mind&quot; when he clearly abandoned his theories and expressed  dissatisfaction with the ones he was left with. You'd have to have read basically no Freud and know nothing about his work to think that he never changed his mind on things.</p></div>		</li>

That being said, he was pretty conclusive on his views about sexuality.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And physics (especially as applied to astronomy).</p>
<p>I mean really, it's the whole of science in general. Sure, the early pioneers may not have been up to our standards of scientific rigor (the alchemists literally wrote their notes in codes so nobody else could repeat their experiments, at least not deliberately), and were <em>very</em> wrong at times, but they were right enough to iterate on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Physics and Chemistry in particular have plenty of ideas dating to somewhere between 1600 and 1900 that are completely wrong but a close enough approximation of &quot;right&quot; to still be useful in the right contexts.</p>
<p>Take Galileo and Newton's idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_invariance" target="_blank">relativity,</a> for example. In this theory, the laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames, time flows the same in all of them, and all of them are related to each other by uniform, relative motion. If frame 2 is moving at speed v12 relative to frame 1 and frame 3 is moving at speed v23 relative to frame 2, frame 3's speed relative to frame 1 is just the sum of v12 and v23.</p>
<p>All very simple and intuitive! And also wrong, aside from the &quot;laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames&quot; part. As we now know, there aren't absolute frames of space or time, time doesn't flow the same for everyone, the rules for relative velocity addition are more complicated than that, and there's a maximum speed limit for any frame relative to any other frame. But Galileo and Newton's rules for motion are a lot less complicated than Special or General Relativity, and if you used them you'd be close enough to correct for most purposes as long as you're dealing with things traveling much slower than light.</p></div>		</li>
