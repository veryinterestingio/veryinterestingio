			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a really amateur view. Anyone who thinks gold is better money needs to explain exactly why. &quot;To prevent mismanagement and printing too much money.&quot;</p>
<p>Building trust is harder than mining gold. It hurts everyone, American, Chinese, Korean, European, when too much money is printed, but <em>especially the most wealthy elites</em>. Guess who gets hurt when you fuck with money? Yeah, the people with money.</p>
<p>Look into what happened to the silver standard to understand why a gold standard isn't a solution for anything. Having metal in vaults doesn't change much.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve is just a boogeyman for conspiracy theorists with no understanding of the basics of monetary policy. Responsible patronage of currency is what strong economies are founded on. Even the most insane dictators know they can end up the way of Zimbabwe if they try to do something like what you're suggesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Money becomes worthless very quicky. People just stop using it. Imagine your employee wants a carton of eggs instead of any money. Poor people actually get by ok. Labor and goods actually hold their value better. You can still work for food. Billionaires and companies see all their wealth disappear.</p>
<p>Banks lend you a $1m to buy a house trusting that $1.2m will mean something in 10 years. If the country starts printing money it's equivalent as making all loans worthless, among other things.</p>
<p>It's not subtle, it cannot be hidden, and it doesn't benefit anyone. It's the equivalent of turning money into monopoly money. There is no conspiracy around it.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but the fed actually has a target amount of inflation that they’re actually going for. The belief there is that deflation is much worse and some inflation helps to encourage borrowing money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it's because positive inflation means that money becomes worth less over time, which encourages you to keep it moving in the system, because it loses value if you keep it still (like putting it under your mattress as opposed to in investments accounts). If inflation goes negative you will instead GAIN &quot;value&quot; by putting your money under your mattress, so everyone will suddenly store their money instead of investing it, and the economy will come to a grinding halt because people won't be willing to lend money, so you can't get loans, which are what drives new development.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, the intended solution by the founding fathers was for only enough money to be in circulation to facilitate the trade of goods. This money would be created by the government, instead of adding currency as a debt created to the federal reserve. Lincoln’s greenbacks were the closest we came to real government issued and controlled currency.</p></div>		</li>
