			<div class="markdown"><p>Swimming is fun, doesnt create impact on joints, and you dont get hot and sweaty. Id recommend swimming to lose fat. In fact, by having cool water around you, your fat burns faster because your body has to burn more stuff to maintain body temperature. Not sure how to get that to work in winter tho. Maybe just eat less? Idk</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When a plant consumes that energy, does it consume oxygen and produce CO2? I feel like this applies to deciduous trees in the spring before they get their leaves up.</p>
<p>It's crazy, thinking about how much energy plants gather that isn't meant to be consumed. They make so much structural sugar(cellulose) and bait sugar (fructose)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, I don't think I should have to say this, but this is why the whole &quot;breatharian&quot; thing is a huge scam.</p>
<p>You are an engine, like all organisms are. You take in oxygen, you burn the food you have eaten, which became part of your body, and release CO2. The only difference is that plants release oxygen to make the food they eat, and they therefore release a net positive amount of oxygen when they are gaining mass, i.e. growing.</p>
<p>You take in oxygen (O2), you breathe out CO2. There is an extra carbon there. That carbon was part of your body before you exhaled. With a sufficiently precise scale (like a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/TC100KA-Platform-Precision-Digital-Operated/dp/B0039UN848" target="_blank">100kg +/- 5g scale</a> they use at factories), you can measure your weight loss every 10 minutes. You lose about 30g of body weight per hour, or about half a gram every minute, even without going to the bathroom.</p>
<p>You often hear that a human's recommended daily intake is around 2000 kcal. From this you can calculate that your body is effectively a 100W space heater. That energy comes your body breaking down itself. That is 8.36 MJ, or about the energy density of 2 kg of TNT, or half a kilogram of sugar.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also it should be in the fore front of anyone's minds that the ONLY way to lose weight is to eat less carbon or breath out more carbon... Pee and poop are basically zero sum games.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The food you eat contains C, H and O, which are stored in fat.  When the fat is used, it create a lot of CO2 and a bit of H2O, so you breathe most of your fat away, but you pee some out too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your pee is mostly just what your drink (I think), I take your point that it's not truly zero sum, but on bias weight loss is through respiration I think. Your breath contains some amount is h20 also.</p>
<p>Your pee does carry out nitrogen compounds as a function of protein breakdown... It's all a bit messy down there ðŸ˜‰</p></div>		</li>
