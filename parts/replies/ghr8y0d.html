It definitely not always a good idea (it rarely is, if ever) to have <em>more</em> illness in your body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tropism is an important consideration. Hepatitis B, C, and D are all viruses that target the liver so they compete for the same resources. Every virus has a &quot;tropism&quot; or a preference for certain types of cells based on their entry receptor and other factors. Just like a bird prefers a certain tree and fish live in specific types of water. In HIV, which mostly lives in CD4+ T cells, many other viruses with different predilections can reactivate and go wild at the same time, while still maintaining a high HIV viral load (e.g. HHV-8 in vascular cells leading to Kaposi's sarcoma, EBV in B cells, TB reactivation in the lungs or literally anywhere, other bacterial/fungal infections...)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hepatitis A rarely, if ever, becomes chronic. So in the long-run, the viruses that can remain chronic (B-E) would win out simply by forfeit of the said loser viruses.</p></div>		</li>
