<p>Could you talk more about this? With humans being so present in a natural ecosystem, is it even &quot;natural&quot; anymore? I would assume that animals would be affected just by the presence of humans watching.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats a tough one. What is “natural”? Every ecosystem has been altered in some way by some things and the species living in it respond and adapt. I tend to believe that humans are just another species that alters environments to their needs and even human dominated environments can be considered natural. When cliff swallows nest on bridges instead of cliffs, falcons hunt from atop sky scrapers and coyotes and foxes den in culverts I still consider that part of their natural environment. That being said, obviously there are non human dominated landscapes and environments that I believe we should try to preserve as they are.</p>
<p>There is definitely an emotional difference for me, as someone who is passionate about this stuff, watching wildlife with other observers and cars gathered around compared to when I am alone in a wilderness environment, and I certainly appreciate those environments a bit more. But as long as the number of tourists is limited to a degree, which it typically is, and the animals are not using humans as a source of food, the behavior is still going to remain essentially what it would be what it would be without humans present. The safari vehicles end up being just like any other piece of the environment like a tree or rock and are more or less ignored. Obviously some parks are more human altered than others. Kruger National Park in South Africa is probably the most popular and most filmed park in Africa, nearly the size of New Jersey, but it is high fenced, the populations heavily managed and in the high season the road systems can feel like highways (similar to Yellowstone in US). Kruger is amazing for wildlife viewing but I would definitely consider it less “natural” than a place like Chobe National Park in Botswana, which is also a popular tourist destination with similar wildlife but no fence, far less amenities and less intensive management.</p>
<p>I will add that some other researchers at the location I mentioned in my original comment with the habituated primate troop found that the monkeys were essentially using human followers for predator avoidance. When the humans were around the monkeys were more likely to forage close to the ground, as they could assume that predators like leopards and snakes were less likely to be present. Clever monkeys.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the response. Wildlife and ecology is something I'm passionate about too. However, the more I learn about ecosystems the more i get disappointed. Habitat fragmentation is rampant, invasive species are omnipresent, and Humans have affected wildlife to such a significant degree. I used to want to work in the wildlife field. I get disillusioned by the fact that major wildlife groups like ducks unlimited exist primarily  to make sure ducks are preserved, so that people can hunt them...</p>
<p>I was talking to a employee of the state wildlife and fisheries. He was saying how he can't wait for the Louisiana black bear to be delisted, because then they can shoot to kill black bears that interfere with humans instead of tranquilizing them.</p>
<p>It just feels so messed up. It's definitely interesting how some species have flourished by adapting to urban ecosystems, like squirrels and pigeons. I just hate how much disdain people have for &quot;nuisance&quot; species. We are the Invaders, not the wildlife.</p>
<p>This turned into a bit of a rant, but yeah I've been moving away from wildlife. I prefer plant research, it's a lot less sad.</p></div>		</li>
