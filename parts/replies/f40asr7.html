			<div class="markdown"><p>I would hesitate to say easily.  It can be done with some degree of success, but it is a pretty sloppy endeavor and not always reliable.  You can also get out a stripped philips head with a slotted screwdriver sometimes.
Edit: Left hand drill bits work wonders with Philips</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not true for one big reason that I oversimplified for the sake of explanation.</p>
<p>Often, the original shape isn't gone, so much as it's unusable. Rust or paint might fill in the head, or corrosion may have etched out the detail necessary for something like a hex or torx head. It's easier to just either dig the crap out or cut through it taking advantage of the pre-existing shape if that shape is just a slot. There's no way you'd be able to carve back out a phillips, square, hex, or torx head.</p>
<p>Sure you could cut a slot into any sufficiently degraded head, but you'll also have weaker surrounding material from where the head was cut (imagine digging a slot into a hex bolt. Sure it'll work, but now there's a big hole in the center of the head that serves only to weaken the head, making removal more difficult.)</p></div>		</li>
