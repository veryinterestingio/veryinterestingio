<p>Lmao.</p>
<p>But, great ELI5. I think your is the first mention of the hydrothermal vents, and that’s fascinating, thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always recommend “Deep Hot Biosphere” for these types of questions.  Thomas Gold is the author. He gets into a lot of areas in the book and tackles the OPs question. </p>
<p>His take is all life started in the center part of the earth. You have to be able to metabolize a metered and continuous energy source. He believes simple organisms started there.   The earth’s core/crust provided that metered heat/energy source. </p>
<p>If life evolved in a puddle or pond, the life sources would have automatically had to have photosynthesis capability or else the energy source would have been depleted and the life would die out. </p>
<p>He believes these organisms moved up and out of the deep hot biosphere eventually, coincidentally these organisms in the deep hot biosphere oxidized hydro carbons and other molecules of iron oxide and sulfates that were already there in the earth’s crust. They moved up and out through the thermal vents and eventually developed photosynthesis which enable them to get closer to the area that had the most oxygen, land, from which to metabolize energy sources. </p>
<p>Good read...origins of life, debunks fossil fuel theory, pulsars, neutron stars....earthquakes are just the earth belching methane. Guy was a genius. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At a very basic level, life is largely a collection of circular chain reactions that use energy to end up back where they started, like standing whirlpools in a moving stream.  Most of these chain reactions likely existed before cells, before RNA and DNA got involved, suspended in some stable and continuous energy gradient.  Hydrothermal vents continuously bubbling hot water up through a chemical soup into cooler water above are a prime candidate for this.</p></div>		</li>
