			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, there is no need to expand exhaust gas past ambiant pressure (at the rocket's altitude) because the flow will detach from the nozzle wall and there won't be any further gain in exhaust gas velocity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a vacuum, yes.</p>
<p>With any ambient pressure you want the exhaust to match the ambient pressure when it leaves the end of the nozzle.</p>
<p>Too low exhaust pressure and the exhaust plume can detach from the nozzle, causing lots of instability (can cause vehicle loss). Too high and the exhaust overexpands, losing efficiency as the momentum is directed laterally.</p>
<p>The perfect nozzle would be one which starts small at ground level and continuously expands to keep the exhaust pressure the same as ambient at all altitudes. Unfortunately that isn't practical when your nozzle needs to survive thousands of degrees Celsius, with aerospikes being a crude approximation to the ideal.</p></div>		</li>
