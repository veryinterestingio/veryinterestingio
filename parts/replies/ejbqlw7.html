			<div class="markdown"><p>CO2 is really hard to measure, because it will differ from body part to body part.</p>
<p>Even O2 is hard to measure; most O2-meters are placed on the fingertip. During a dive, outer extremities are vaso-constricted, meaning that blood flow is much  lower in fingers, hand, arms. So O2 level needs to be measured close to the inner organs or brain, since that is where the body tries to keep all the oxygenated  blood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't significantly increase your blood oxygen content by doing this. Haemoglobin in your blood can't go beyond 100% saturated which is only a very small change from 97%-99% breathing air. The way that breathing oxygen for a while works is that you replace the air (78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen) which normally fills your lungs with pure oxygen. As your body uses the oxygen from your blood you continue to absorb the reserve in your lungs. </p></div>		</li>

<p>-Which is why i specifically wrote <strong>blood plasma</strong>, not haemoglobin or red blood cells. I am fully aware of the conundrum you're refering to, which is why i always explain to my athletes (i'm a freediving coach) that they won't get any more O2 out of hyperventilating (and don't get me started on the Bohr effect).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The blood plasma don't normally hold any O2, but after breathing almost pure O2 for 20 minutes, plasma gets over-saturated with O2</p>
<p>I'm not a medic or physician, but this is how it's been explained to me by physicians.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I assumed you meant blood, sorry. I was always taught that at atmospheric pressure the oxygen dissolved in plasma was negligible even at a high FiO2. I've recently revised the oxygen delivery equation for an exam and the solubility coefficient is very low - 0.02 millilitres per 100 ml of plasma per kilopascal PaO2, compared with 1.34 x Hb x saturation for the oxygen bound to haemoglobin.
I don't understand what you mean by oversaturated, how can more gas dissolve than at equilibrium, and how can this change be more significant than replacing the FRC of the lungs with 100% oxygen? </p></div>		</li>
