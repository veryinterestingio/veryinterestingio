			<div class="markdown"><p>No.  The stored memories do not take the form of extra material being added to your brain cells, they take the form of preexisting brain cells growing together in different ways.  If you learn something tomorrow, all of the neurons involved in storing the memory are already in your head right now - they'll just get connected to each other in new ways tomorrow as the memory forms.</p>
<p>Incidentally, a iPod also does not weigh any more when you add music to it, for the same reason.  The songs are stored by flipping parts of the magnetic or solid state hard drive to either &quot;0&quot; or &quot;1&quot; values, but there is nothing permanently added to the device when you add music - the configuration of the storage media is just changed according to the file.</p>
<p>Edit: Spelling, and also iPod physics: I don't want us to get off-topic on electronic media storage physics, and some of the citations that are being thrown at me are making assumptions about the starting alignment of the magnetic dipoles which would impact whether adding a file to an iPod's hard drive would make it weigh more or less afterwards,  but in the interest of avoiding further discussion of this tangent: IF adding a file to a hard drive changed its weight, the change would be so small that it would be effectively unmeasurable.  Similarly, the weight of a creating a memory, though it may involve a few more or fewer receptor proteins and dendritic processes, is effectively zero.  In both cases the mass change is incidental to the storage of the data.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is fucking with me. Thinking about how, right now, my brain is being arranged in a certain way that is directly related to what's on my computer screen. It's weird..</p></div>		</li>

<p><strong>Except, it absolutely does.</strong> The change in state from a 0 to 1 <em>does</em> have an inherent change in mass.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Using Einstein's E=mcÂ² formula, which states that energy and mass are directly related, Prof Kubiatowicz calculated that filling a 4GB Kindle to its storage limit would increase its weight by a billionth of a billionth of a gram, or 0.000000000000000001g.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In all fairness, even in the human mind, this would still be irrelevant for practical purposes, a person with total recall would in fact have an ever-so-slightly heavier brain. Realistically it could get to be a <em>noticeable</em> number, even if functionally insignificant. However, acknowledging that it's irrelevant doesn't change that it happens to be the case, and the commenter said &quot;technically&quot;, so you're quite simply wrongly informed here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically, there would be a, albeit tiny, change in weight. The connections and such dissolve and grow an name new connections. There's matter involved in that. The difference would be miniscule, but measurable, I'd imagine</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily, the ipod would, yes, but a brain does not necessarily weigh more. Neurons are trimmed and reformed relatively often, but memory is not just stored in &quot;more&quot; neuron dendrites, it's stored in the patterns of their firing. So forming a new memory will not necessarily make you weigh more, it could have no effect, or even make you weigh less.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Computers store data differently and only memory capacity occupies physical space. Saving information doesn't add or take away from this space. If you started with 4 billion cells set to 0, the only change you make is switching some to 1. In brains a 0 is a lack of a respective structure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know the analogy falls to bits (lol) when you look deeper.</p>
<p>But a hard drive gets no heavier because no extra matter is added. Similar to a brain only it's not storing bits and bites in electron filled microswitches.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electrons are still an aspect of matter though. </p>
<p>They aren't etherial despite their demonstrated lack of volume. When electrons pas through matter they effect it.</p>
<p>It's why physicists are the ones who study electrons. (Chemists too to a certain degree).</p>
<p>Also neurons are already in the brain with the capability to form connections.</p></div>		</li>
