			<div class="markdown"><p>If a kid has a white parent and a black parent is that kid white or black? Does that kid get treated like a white kid or a black kid? Do people who see that kid in passing think they are a white kid or a black kid?  How many generations of white/black biracial people marrying white people before folks start seeing a white person?</p>
<p>Are Hispanic people white? Some of those people have 100% European DNA, they should count as white.  Do we treat them like they are white?</p>
<p>Racial categories aren't defined by genetics, they are defined by perception.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct: Chinese, Korean, Italian and British are ALSO social constructs.  China's borders today are not the same as they were 10, 50 or 100 years ago.  Today, a Taiwanese person might claim not to be a Chinese national.  They would not have claimed that 100 years ago.  The British claim that Scotland is part of Britain.  More and more Scots disagree.</p>
<p>So yes, nationalism is also a social construct.  It's a simpler social construct than race, because there are organizations (called &quot;states&quot;) that help nationalism seem &quot;real&quot; by producing flags, maps, passports, that &quot;reify&quot; nationalism.  </p>
<p>&quot;Race&quot; is even more socially constructed.  There is nobody in charge of what &quot;white&quot; means (though many claim to tell you what they think it should mean).  There's nobody officially in charge of producing &quot;black&quot; passports, flags, etc.  Each and every one of us can decide what these things mean.  That's not true for &quot;British&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yes, definitely! This is worded so much better then I could have ever come close to achieving. And agree, 100%. It’s all social constructs, but it’s just easier to wrap our heads around some aspects over others.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not any more.  For now. Even so, when that happened in the past, or if it happens again in the future, it would yet again be a social construct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of like how someone who is Chinese originates from China, someone who is Korean originates from Korea, and someone  Zimbabwean originates from Zimbabwe. However, there is no country of “black” or “white”. </p>
<p>Those are the social constructs. Grouping a collection of people together based solely on their physical appearance/their skin colour is a social construct.</p>
<p>However, different races do have different genetic markers. So you can see what ancestry makes up your DNA. This is not visible to the naked eye. So someone can appear “white” but actually have DNA associated with many races. However, people will look at them and think “white person”. That thought process is the social construct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This also neatly shows why the discussions about it always keep going.</p>
<p>View 1: &quot;it's not a view, it's a fact, because it's measurable, see, dna&quot;</p>
<p>View 2: &quot;it's a view, a construct, there is no such thing as white, black, orange with spots&quot;</p>
<p>Both don't technicly exclude each other, but oftentimes it -sounds-like they do. Which is why it always keeps going...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Fear of discrimination by medical professionals is one reason. Another is that many ethnic and racial minorities do not have access to the specialty care centers that recruit subjects for trials. Some may also fear possible exploitation, thanks to a history of unethical medical testing in the U.S.&quot; is this only in relation to the US. I know if you look at world wide white people are not the majority so it seems really messed up that these tests would be predominantly white. Now if it is only in the US I 100% get why they would be hesitant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It will probably change a lot in the future, but looking out the history of who was doing a lot of scientific testing, it's generally done in countries where the majority are white(Europe and United States). As more countries become developed, I'm positive that will change and much more data will come in from other races as places tend to do research on the people that are simply around them.</p></div>		</li>
