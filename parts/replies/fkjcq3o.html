			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, smaller transistor also switch faster, which means that computers can update faster and do more computations per second. The more calculations you can do in 1/30 the of a second, (or whatever the frame rate of your TV or other screen is) than the more information you can have per frame which directly translates to higher resolution and better quality images.</p>
<p>The cell network is also with mentioning because it means that you can have acess to information almost anywhere which made it worthwhile to develop tiny and  efficient processers to put in phones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And the smallerr the transistor, the easier it is to switch. This allows us to both reduce energy consumption and heat production. </p>
<p>Once you reach low enough power consumption, you can package it with a battery and get a useful life out of it, too. </p>
<p>When you have to worry less about heat, it suddenly becomes viable to package an entire processor in a mostly-sealed case, like a cell phone; or you can put a pretty powerful processor with even a small, light and slim heat sink, like a laptop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately we are quickly approaching the limit on how small transistors can get. Because of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle a transistor that is too small(5nm) won't be able to consistently contain electrons to a single transistor.</p></div>		</li>
