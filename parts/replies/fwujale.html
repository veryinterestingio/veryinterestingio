			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep I heard the same thing from my band directors in high school and college.</p>
<p>Not sure how accurate this is but what I heard was that professional musicians who record things like soundtracks will usually play together for the first time when they're recording.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This category is called session musicians. It's 100% true.  Session musicians are some of the if not the most respected people in the recording industry. Right up there with expert sound engineers. If you ever meet a professional session musician, their ability to just sit with their instrument - which is sometimes a whole litany of instruments not just a single one - and do whatever the hell you or they want is unbelievable.</p>
<p>Look up the comedian - and former sessioner - Bill Bailey and some of his acts, and the way he casually can just pick up a little keyboard and wow people with made-up nonsense on the spot. I don't claim that he's one of the most unbelievable musicians out there, that should give you a good idea of what this kind of person can do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hello! I’m a composer who studied film scoring and can confirm this is true. It costs a ton of money to record session musicians, especially in LA; you’re looking at like $100k for a day with a full orchestra. The LA musicians are a pretty elite group that’s stupid skilled, so their price tag is warranted. Their whole career is sight reading music and that’s mostly what ends up in the film.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently got a chance to play in a band that was fairly successful in the 1970s... they had classical training but were a rock/prog band. We had one rehearsal before touring for a 2 hour set and if they wanted to change it up and play something different we listened to it on the bus that day and  rehearsed it in sound check. Most challenging thing I've done in my career to date.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A friend of mine plays in a big heavy metal band. I asked him how rehearsals work, considering members live hundreds if not thousands of kilometers apart. He told me that just a few days before we met he got an offer from yet another bigger band, which he took. They told him which songs they'll play and the first time they played together was at the show. I don't consider soundcheck as rehearsal :)</p>
<p>So yeah, agreed, hats off to musicians man.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To tack on to this, yes, we can memorize our stuff, but it takes time.</p>
<p>Even then, it's still a good idea to have your sheets. There's two levels of using sheet music:</p>
<ol>
<li>I'm using it to tell me what to play</li>
<li>I'm using it as a reference sheet to remind me of little things (like special adjustments)</li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>When I conducted, I was a nightmare to my musicians because I would change all kinds of things up. I treated the whole piece of music like clay, I'd fine tune it here and there and it would be a different creature than what the paper <em>says</em>. This doesn't mean I'm sitting there and telling the musicians to play &quot;Stars and Stripes Forever&quot; like it was a funeral dirge. It means that I'm fiddling with the harmonic balance and articulation.</p>
<p>By adjusting the volume of certain notes inside a chord, I can emphasize certain motions or ideas in the piece. It allows me to create a stronger emotional impact or build more tension. By changing the articulation I can alter the mood and how the audience perceives the music.</p>
<p>If I am good enough at it, I can use sound to paint entire pictures inside the minds of the audience.</p>
<p>This is what I mean by the articulation and balance changing how the audience percieves the music:</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/5W-o5Y_GunU?t=175" target="_blank">Here is Movement 4 (Jupiter) of Gustav Holst's The Planets</a> by the Chicago Symphony</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/Tog120uXKW0?t=179" target="_blank">and here is the same piece performed by the Los Angeles Philharmonic</a></p>
<p>Both videos are fast forwarded to the chorale section but I definitely encourage you to listen to the whole thing. Minor adjustments to tempo, harmonic balance, and articulation can make the pieces feel different. I don't remember who did it, but there's even a version where the conductor make it fast and staccato (short notes) which made it feel almost like a march...dunno why...</p>
<p>Personally, I think the LA Phil version is the best one ever done. The full performance of this piece by the LA Phil is what turned me into an audiophile because it is by an extreme margin the best recorded and best interpreted version I've ever heard. In high school I was one of those asshole kids who had subwoofers in the car at full volume, but instead of rock or rap or pop, it was this CD. </p>
<p>The conductor's job isn't what it looks like. 90% of the conductor's work is done in study and interpretation and note taking, 9% is in rehearsal, and 1% is the performance. My <em>opinion</em> is that the conductor is part of the show and should accentuate the performance, but others would disagree and say the audience is there to listen to the musicians, not see you wave your arms like you're an over-exited extra in a harry potter movie.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll be honest, I'm not really hearing much of a difference between the two examples... even when I truly concentrate and repeatedly listen to them back to back. I guess the second one is a little bit softer, maybe? Makes me sad, because clearly my ears are simply too shitty to appreciate the work put into this. But this was a very interesting read nonetheless, thank you!</p>
<p>Fwiw, I did hear what sounded like a part of the Elder Scrolls Theme around 3:26 and that made me smile.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your ears aren't shitty. It's not like a sharp contrast, rather something almost subconscious. If you heard each one independently you might have a slightly stronger or different emotional reaction, but listening and trying to hear a difference is difficult if you're not used to listening to music critically, especially orchestral music.</p>
<p>I had a professor use taste in food is an analogy for listening to music and I think it works very well. </p>
<p>If someone who had never tasted Coke or Pepsi tried them both for the first time, it would likely be hard to tell a difference. Even if the difference was noticable, it might be hard to pinpoint what the difference is. However, someone who is used to drinking Pepsi would probably be able to notice the switch to Coke much more. Same goes for music listening. If you're not used to hearing something, it all kind of sounds the same. The more you digest, the more pronounced the subtle changes become. </p>
<p>Either way, music is meant to be enjoyed and the fact that you even took the time to listen to both versions and try to appreciate them already shows a greater appreciation for the artistry than the average person IMO.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't feel bad - that was a tricky example for anyone who hasn't already learned how to listen for this stuff. Here is a much more obvious example (fans of Disney's Fantasia 2000, buckle up!):</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/0-OBzD5Es4c?t=58" target="_blank">The finale</a> to Stravinsky's Firebird Suite, conducted by Valery Gergiev. Watch the video as you listen to it, and see just how much the conductor has drunk the Kool Aid on this journey and is 100% invested in the adventure.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/IrMGqAmjbug?t=594" target="_blank">The exact same finale</a> this time conducted by Igor Stravinsky himself (the actual composer!). The comparison might sound quite similar at first, but as the piece evolves you will begin hearing stark differences in the performance; this version feels a lot more strict / mechanical, whilst the first once sounds a lot more free flowing.</p>
<p>This example is less about the instruments themselves and more about the 'overall beat' of the piece, because that type of difference is a lot easier to detect.</p>
<p>I won't dive into the backstory of why these differences exist (it's more complex than just 'good' vs 'bad' conducting), but it shows how different conductors can inject a completely different energy into the musicians.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The biggest difference for me is the timing of the notes, or the space between each note.</p>
<p>In the Chicago's version everything is much more even, giving it a kind of smooth sound. Personally I feel it gives the piece a kind of perfunctory sound as if the group was just kind of going through the motions, plodding along.</p>
<p>In the LA Phil's version, there's a subtle difference in the timing that gives the piece a stronger sense of movement the same way squash and stretch will help emphasize flow in animation. They pass quickly through transitions and linger a bit on the peaks and valleys, emphasizing those chords.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, this is so interesting.  I had no idea conducting was so nuanced. The LA Philharmonic version definitely sounds a lot better to me as well. Hard to describe, but I feel a sense of wonder listening to the chorus that's not present in the other Chicago Symp version.</p></div>		</li>
