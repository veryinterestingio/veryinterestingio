<p>You are in good company. We understand from the principles of relativity that an object cannot form an event horizon just because of its inertial motion. Because the object still has to exist in its inertial frame of reference. However, showing this mathematically is in my view a technically challenging problem. The <a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/28436" target="_blank">most compact argument</a> I've seen has been that Einstein's field equations which determine the curvature depends on the stress energy tensor, and not mass or energy directly,</p>
<ul>
<li>G_ab = T_ab</li>
</ul>
<p>The stress-energy tensor is an invariant whose properties does not change regardless of the coordinate systems used--though the individual components of the tensor might. In the rest frame a massive object's stress energy is given by,</p>
<ul>
<li>T_00 = rho (all other elements zero)</li>
</ul>
<p>where rho is the rest frame density. In any inertial frame moving relative to the object, the density does increase as a symptom of Lorentz length contraction. This is the part of the argument that would imply that the object could collapse into a black hole. But that is not the whole story--in the moving frame the other components which were previously zero become nonzero--these are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress%E2%80%93energy_tensor#Stress%E2%80%93energy_in_special_situations" target="_blank">momentum, pressure, and shear components of the stress energy.</a> Specifically the Lorentz boosted T_ab tensor has the form,</p>
<ul>
<li>T_ab = (rho)(u_a)(u_b)</li>
</ul>
<p>where u_a is the four-velocity of the object. In the calculation of the curvature, the increased density is compensated for by these other terms thus no black hole appears in any reference frame if the black hole didn't already exist in the object's rest frame. In other words the curvature (evaluating the Einstein tensor G_ab) is unchanged regardless of which frame we calculate it in.</p>
<p>Another cartoonish way to think about it: For the Earth, the Schwarzschild radius represents the radius required to cram all the Earth's mass into before the Earth collapses into a black hole. If you are moving relative to the Earth, along the direction of motion, the Schwarzschild radius (which tells you the required density for collapse) is reduced in length and always below the length contracted physical radius of the Earth. In a sense, as the density increases due to length contraction so too does the required density for black hole formation increases.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> It is of interest to attack the problem from a different angle, namely considering the boosted Schwarzschild metric which represents a black hole with linear momentum. If the kinetic energy could induce black hole formation then we'd expect the boosted metric to somehow have an event horizon at a radius R_S' which is greater than the Schwazschild radius R_S</p>
<ul>
<li>R_S' &gt; R_S = 2GM/c^(2) <strong>(?)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The moving event horizon radius R_S' takes on the approximate form,</p>
<ul>
<li>R_S'/R_S = ((x-vt)^(2)/(1-v^(2)/c^(2))+y^(2)+z^(2))^(-1/2)</li>
</ul>
<p>which draws out... you guessed it! <a href="https://www5b.wolframalpha.com/Calculate/MSP/MSP14741ei9g66i768c6c1f0000412d75898dda72d5?MSPStoreType=image/gif&amp;s=46" target="_blank">A squished sphere.</a> In other words the moving black hole's event horizon radius does not exceed the event horizon radius in the at rest frame. This matches wonderfully with our description above. For more details see,</p>

</ul>
<p>However it is worth noting that this is not what you, the observer, actually sees. It is an odd quirk of relativistic optics that spheres always visually look like circular disks regardless of their relative motion.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stress energy is not an invariant. It's covariant. Invariant quantities do not change in component values with change in frame of reference. I think the main argument here is that, from the point of view of a Schwarzschild solution, since it is for a spherically symmetric source, and black hole is formed when the source is restricted to a spherical volume smaller than the Schwarzschild radius, for a source in motion, Schwarzschild solution has to be appropriately changed to adjust for that which would essentially involve modifying the solution for a moving source or consider the rest frame of the spaceship(which hopefully is spherically symmetric).  Hence, if a spaceship can't form a black hole while at rest, it can never otherwise.(All this I say from the point of view of the Schwarzschild solution, others I don't know enough about.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't find the other answer particularly good, so I'll take an another shot at it.</p>
<p>While it is true that kinetic energy contributes to stress-energy tensor of a point particle, we run into some other problems because we lose symmetries when are considering it. Namely, we lose benefit of having a black hole so loosely (or imprecisely) defined. In case of a moving particle, we have to solve Einstein equations to get spacetime it generates and I suspect* in that spacetime there will geodesics which go arbitrary close to particle and then arbitrary far from it. That would precisely mean that particle didn't form a black hole.</p>
<p>I know this doesn't answers your question exactly, but I hope it gives you some idea about it.</p>
<p>* I say suspect because I have never even tried to calculate this myself.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Can you expound on this thought? Just because something causes more problems than it solves doesn’t mean it isn’t valid or correct because it is inconvenient. </p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>

<p>I'll address this statement first. In scientific models, when we talk about one concept being used to replace another concept, we usually do so because the new concept can do everything the old concept does in a simpler manner. </p>
<p>In this case, in order to achieve the same explanatory power relativistic momentum and energy has, you would need the basic idea of relativistic mass + some corrections. So, when we say we prefer one concept over another, it's not that one concept is plain <em>wrong</em> (if not we wouldn't just dislike the concept, we would say it's plain wrong). We usually mean the concept we prefer can explain everything the old concept does in a simpler way.</p>
<p>Why would we use the idea of relativistic mass in the first place? This concept got widely promoted in order to make SR look like standard Newtonian mechanics. With relativistic mass, you get p = mv. You can also describe the total energy of an object with E = mc^(2). Looks really neat right?</p>
<p>Wrong. Other than those two cases (the version we use now is barely more complicated anyway, it's basically identical except we factor out <strong>one</strong> variable γ), everything else sucks.</p>
<p>Unlike in Newtonian mechanics, acceleration in special relativity depends on the direction the force is being applied in. A force applied perpendicular to motion will cause a different acceleration from a force applied parallel to it. Now your relativistic mass needs two separate values, one transverse and one parallel (the idea that one object has two different masses is already ridiculous enough without even considering how this gets complicated).</p>
<p>You also get confusing ideas like what this thread is literally about. People hear that having enough mass causes black holes, so increasing relativistic mass must lead to black holes forming. Except it doesn't, because the concept of relativistic mass that people tried so desperately to associate with rest mass simply isn't the same as rest mass.</p>
<p>If you use relativistic energy and momentum, you get to define a nice quantity called the 4-velocity. With this quantity, you get all the other associated &quot;Newtonian&quot; quantities like 4-momentum. This one quantity behaves nicely because we can just plug it into our general equations without worrying about all the details.</p>
<p>So in your opinion, would you rather write p = γmv and E = γmc^(2) while not dealing with all the confusing technicalities of how relativistic mass behaves differently from normal mass, or would you rather write one letter less in the equations for p and E WHILE dealing with all the inconsistencies?</p>
<p>There's a reason why a lot of physicists are frustrated that new generations of students keep getting force-fed this idea of relativistic mass just so that the very basics of special relativity becomes very slightly easier at the cost of all the trouble afterwards.</p></div>		</li>
