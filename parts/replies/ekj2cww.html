			<div class="markdown"><p>The ADH part is mostly correct, except where they say &quot;no urine is produced&quot;. In reality some urine is constantly being produced by the kidneys at all times, the amount produced is related to blood flow through the kidney. During sleep, blood flow to the kidney is reduced markedly, along with your blood pressure, and this, along with the increase in ADH, results in a slower filling of your bladder during sleep. It is also why most people wake up needing to pee.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I drive for a living.  I can happily get in the cab and drive for 7 hours straight... And not feel even the slightest need to pee.  The split second I stand up however?  Yeah.   This is why I've developed the habit of parking up within sprinting distance of the gents....</p>
<p>You can train your bladder not to bother you..  but if you can't stop having to go every few hours, you either need to stop drinking a can of 'dew every 10 minutes, or go see a doctor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have scarring on my bladder and kidneys from chronic kidney infections since I was 4. I've trained my bladder so I can hold it, but if I need to pee, I need to go.
Also I pretty much only drink water and tea and keep it to a minimum in the evening.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As a result, absolutely no urine is produced.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The kidneys will still produce minimal urine. At least 30 mL/hr or 0.5 mL/kg/hr. No urine production in someone is either due to chronic renal impairment, e.g. someone who gets dialysis, or someone who is very sick.</p></div>		</li>
