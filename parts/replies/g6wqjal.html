<p>I hate it, but I always suspect I'm cooking it wrong because some people like it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've more or less taught myself to like brown rice, whole grain, oat, rye, etc.</p>
<p>I didn't use to like those things but after eating them a lot and reminding myself that eating healthy is a good thing both short and long term, I've started to genuinely enjoy them.</p>
<p>Nowadays I find too much white flour to be icky. I've also gotten a lot more sensitive in noticing how eating affects my mood and well-being. Like I notice how eating at McDonalds now makes me feel weak and mildly nauseous later in the evening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like brown rice when I am in the mood for something more substantial or have been eating too much crap recently. Same with brown bread. But to be honest most of the time I eat white rice because it goes with a far greater range of dishes.</p></div>		</li>
