			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it deadly because disturbing a molt is deadly, or is it only deadly if the creature believes it's under threat? If the latter, a lobster raised by people would know its people and perhaps not go into shock. You could also start by first domesticating lobster, so that you create one that does survive help during molt, and then begin growing a monster lobster from that stock.</p></div>		</li>
