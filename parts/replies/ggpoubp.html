<p>I just ... had a moment of hilarity thinking about your comment as a response to that. I hope your day is bright.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Urine is a major tool for controlling the plasma concentration of various electrolytes. It also is a tool for controlling your plasma osm. Sometimes you need to remove free water to prevent dilution of your blood/prevent alterations in electrolyte gradients. And since water follows solutes if you need to remove large quantities of salt then you gotta send it out with at least some water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why then arent we like birds just pooping instead of poop + urine? That would allow us to hold the water longer and excrete harder substances, right?</p>
<p>Theoretically of course, im not saying evolution is logic all the time and as you stated, enviroment played a &quot;no need&quot; factor there</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to us, but I mean, it works for birds</p>
<p>That said, not necesarely diarrhea, I meant mixing the two things. As the body absorbs more water from all that its not as liquid, the same way food comes as poop and (usually) not diarrhea. But is Fecal matter AND whatever is called what you get rid from on urine</p></div>		</li>
