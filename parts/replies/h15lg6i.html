			<div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_calendar" target="_blank">Babylonian calendar</a> is based on the Sumerian Umma calendar from 21st century BC. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_calendar#Civil_calendar" target="_blank">Egyptian solar calendar</a> was probably in use as early as 4 centuries before that, during &quot;the golden age&quot; of the Old Kingdom of neighbouring Egypt. It consisted of 360 calendar days + 5 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercalary_month_\(Egypt\)" target="_blank">epagomenal days</a> at the end.</p>
<p>I'm not a historian, but I'd say it's plausible that the number 360 could be related to the Egyptian calendar's division of the year.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Remember this is well before Pythagoras so the idea of having a three unit stick, a four unit stick and a five unit stick hadnâ€™t been thought of yet.</p></div>		</li>
