			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard one time that DNA starts to degrade in 100 years, or less, so trying to resurrect something a million years old is almost impossible.  Even several hundred years old would be a challenge.<br />
Plus, if you did, wouldn't you only have one set of DNA?   How could you make a population of anything with only one set?  Doesn't it take several hundred sets to make a viable population?  I guess that would depend if your single set was perfect, but doesn't every set of DNA have some defects?  I think that lots of the defects don't affect anything but if you tried to breed only using that one set, with every successive generation you'd be amplifying any defects which do exist, wouldn't you?   Seems like it would be an exercise in futility at best.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Preservation conditions make a huge difference to the amount of degradation. There are many ancient DNA samples over a thousand years old at this point. They actually sequenced DNA from a 1.7 million year old rhino recently! <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/1-7-million-year-old-rhino-dna-a-game-changer-for-evolutionary-study/" target="_blank">https://www.courthousenews.com/1-7-million-year-old-rhino-dna-a-game-changer-for-evolutionary-study/</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on conditions; IIRC in physiological conditions you're looking at a half-life on the order of a few hundred years.</p>
<p>This is actually quite long; human proteins have half-lives on the order of 2 days, and mRNA has a half-life on the order of 12h.  <a href="http://book.bionumbers.org/how-fast-do-rnas-and-proteins-degrade/" target="_blank">E: Source on degradation to read more</a>.  It varies by species.</p>
<p>This makes sense though -- the better things are bonded together, the longer they last, but the more energy is required to break them apart for recycling.</p>
<p>Also, given that you have give-or-take 10^13.5 cells in you, a 200kday halflife still works out to losing 3ppm per day, which is ~10M of your sets.</p></div>		</li>
