			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of the definition of an explosion includes the rapid increase of volume of a <em>gas</em>. If you think about it, the gas inside a balloon is at a higher pressure than the air outside the balloon; this is what causes the membrane of the balloon to stretch. At the instant when the balloon is punctured, the membrane snaps back, and whats left is a balloon shaped mass of pressurized gas, which naturally wants to expand. So a balloon popping is indeed an 'explosion'. It really depends on what you want 'rapid' to mean in the definiton.</p></div>		</li>
