<p>This is perhaps the worst good explanation of parallax I've ever seen. It makes perfect sense if you already know what parallax is, but if you don't... I can't imaging making heads or tails of this. </p>

<p>Thanks for the super informative response, though!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah well, I couldn't think of a different way to explain it without a lot of typing or drawing a diagram so I got lazy and wrote that instead. If someone wants to write a correction then I'll tip my hat to them. Also I'm a bit tired-it's 3 in the morning here due to parallax.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always liked this one: hold up one finger between you and something far away.  Look at your finger while closing first one eye and then the other.  It should look like your finger is moving relative to the background each time you switch eyes.  The perceived motion of your finger can be measured as an angle that really only depends on the space between your eyes and the distance to your finger.  Once you measure the distance between your eyes, you can calculate the distance to any object for which you can measure that motion angle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The eyeball and thumb trick is the simplest parallax demonstration I know.</p>
<p>Close your left eye and put your thumb over an object in the distance. Keep your thumb in ther same place and switch eyes.</p>
<p>If you measured how far your thumb appeared to move, and measured how far your eyes are apart, you could use trigonometry to sew how far away the object you were looking at was.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha yeah, best way to explain it is close one eye and hold you hand out in front of you (or just your thumb)</p>
<p>Close the other eye and your hand/thumb seem to move. </p>
<p>THAT is parallax, perspective being changed based on your positioning/angle of observation</p>
<p>Parallax is used to measure great distances as well, we can measure up to .001 arc seconds of parallax (which is quite precise considering how small we are in relativity to our overwhelmingly large and complex universe)</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="https://www.universetoday.com/91120/do-it-yourself-guide-to-measuring-the-moons-distance/" target="_blank">Aristarchus</a> did this in 270 BC. He watched a lunar eclipse, timed how long it took, did some mathematics and determined that the distance had to be about 60 Earth radii.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that article is inaccurate. Aristarchus grossly overestimated the lunar parallax, and calculated a distance of only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Sizes_and_Distances_(Aristarchus\)#Results" target="_blank">20 Earth-radii to the Moon</a>. It was Hipparchus over a century later that improved on the method and produced a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Sizes_and_Distances_(Hipparchus\)" target="_blank">much more accurate</a> calculation</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I understand your first citation, it says that Archimedes credited Aristarchus with determining the diameter of the moon was a half-degree, which yields the correct value, and a &quot;long-standing (but dubious) reconstruction&quot; misinterpreted Aristarchus' estimate by a factor of 4, yielding an incorrect value.</p>
<p>I don't see how this supports your conclusion that Aristarchus &quot;grossly overestimated the lunar parallax&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem was Aristarchus' estimation of the Sun-Earth-Moon angle during half-moon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That, when the moon appears to us halved, its distance from the sun is less than a quadrant by a thirtieth of a quadrant</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(From the Heath, 1913 translation.) In other words, he estimated that angle as 90 - 90/30 = 87 deg. </p>
<p>That immediately yields the ratio of lunar distance-to-solar distance by taking the cosine:</p>
<ul>
<li>cos (87 deg) = 1/20</li>
</ul>
<p>The actual ratio is 1/400, which means the proper angle should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>arccos (1/400) = 88.86 deg</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the Sun and Moon are the same size in the sky, that means the Moon-Sun size ratio should be the same by similar triangles, and thus he assumed the Sun is only 20x larger than the Moon. This error gets propagated to produce a lunar distance 3x too small.</p></div>		</li>
