			<div class="markdown"><p>In fairness, nimbyism in the USA is only half the story. Then there's making sure that people in the other country can't have their own &quot;nimby&quot; regulations. Then there's regulating the mine and its region enough to keep it all stable and profitable.</p>
<p>The top producers are Indonesia and Philippines, and both have been shutting mines in recent years. This is to protect the environment, but also to put a lid on the local corruption and violence.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Don’t forget Phosphate,  we mine twice as much as the 2nd country (Russia).</p>

<p>huh, I was pretty sure that Morocco was the largest phosphate producer. But after googling Morocco is the second largest after China. Though Morocco is the world's biggest exporter of phosphate. They produce twice as much as the US every year. and 75% of the phosphate that's currently extractable on earth is in Morocco.</p>
<p>It's to the point where in a decade or two Morocco is expected to control much of the worlds phosphate production, which is why there are lot's of startups trying to figure out ways to harvest phosphate from sewage treatment plants or swine farm runoff.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Mining happens where the resources are. Plenty of mining occurs in first world nations. </p>
<p>Where Earth resources occur in developing nations, mining operations certainly do take advantage of the lack of regulations or unionised workforce - working at mine sites can be some of the most dangerous work in the world. However, it’s not really true to say that first world nations just don’t let mining happen. If it’s profitable, it will happen. Poor disposal/management of tailings, mine collapse, acid mine runoff, these are all things which can and do occur in the mining projects of developed nations.</p></div>		</li>
