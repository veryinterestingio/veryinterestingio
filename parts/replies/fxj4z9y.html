			<div class="markdown"><p>But if every flip is independent and coins don't have memories then what exactly is being watered down? what I am trying to ask is why the next 900 flips balance that extra 10% in first 100 flips.</p>
<p>and I came across this chaos game umm  Sierpiński triangle (<a href="https://youtu.be/kbKtFN71Lfs" target="_blank"><a href="https://youtu.be/kbKtFN71Lfs" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/kbKtFN71Lfs</a></a>)   </p>
<p>it somehow seems connected to this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>900 flips is a much larger number of trials than 100 flips. So when you add them all together, the mean for the 900 flips is going to be weighted much more heavily than the mean for the 100 flips.</p>
<p>Since our prediction is that the mean will be 50% for future coin flips, having a large number of future coin flips makes it likely that the aberration in our small number of past coin flips will not influence the total nearly as much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't need memory. The key is that the smaller the trial size, the more variation from the mean you might expect to occur. The group of 900 flips &quot;waters down&quot; the group of 100 simply because there are more of them. If the group of 900 flips were to have the result of 60% heads/40% tails, it wouldn't water down the group of 100 that had 60%/40% at all because the percentages would be the same. However, the point is that because there are 900 as opposed to 100, that probability of getting 60/40 in that group is much much lower. </p>
<p>Another way to think about it: rare events (i.e. outliers) are what skew the probability from 50/50 to 60/40 (in this example). But rare events are, by definition, <em>rare</em>. So the more trials you do, the less of them you will have. And because you have more trials, the less of an effect these rare events have on the larger group of trials.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I flip a quarter 5 times and they are all heads, 100% of my flips are heads.  If the 50/50 odds match for the next 94 flips, I’ll have 47 tails and 52 (47+5) heads total out of 99 total flips.</p>
<p>47/99 is 47% and 52/99 is 53%.  </p>
<p>It’s not the coin is more likely to hit “tails” after five “heads”. It’s that more flips drives you closer to 50/50.  If I make a billion flips, you’ll be somewhere like 49.999999% to 50.0000001%.</p>
<p>Side Note: In Vegas, they know the odds for every game so they know that eventually, they’ll make their money back for every random Joe/Jane who “wins big”.</p></div>		</li>
