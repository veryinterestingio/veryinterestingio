			<div class="markdown"><p>The biggest flaw in the theory is that humans almost certainly didn't need to with all the other ways large bodies of water can be populated. A body of water doesn't need many happy accidents before fish breed there. Almost guaranteed fish were breeding there within the first months, well before it was big enough to be &quot;Great&quot;. When the lake is big enough, it's almost certain the eggs for tasty fish will also get there without human intervention.</p>
<p>Humans have practiced aquaculture for thousands of years all over the world, for which we do have documentary and archeological evidence. And the concept of stocking smaller lakes and ponds (or just holes) is so basic it's hard to believe it wasn't done by some human ancestors even before the last ice age. </p></div>		</li>
