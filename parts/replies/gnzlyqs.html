			<div class="markdown"><p>I started intermittent fasting just over a month ago. I'm 6'1&quot; and was about 235lbs. I WAS a huge foodie and lived in a city with crazy food options. I ate till my food was gone, and often did all you can eat places, though, much healthier than American restaurants for sure. But, these also often included all you can drink (alcohol) as well... </p>
<p>When I started IF, I struggled hard. I'd eat a little, and needed to eat again soon, or I'd feel like I was crazy starving. This only lasted a week though. After that I was able to keep to two meals within a 7-hour window. I only drink water, and if I have cereal, it's with almond milk. </p>
<p>Today though, I'm now completely fine eating one normal size meal around noon. And that's it. I've even increased my output, but I wouldn't call it a full on exercise routine, but I'm definitely burning something, as I can see it on my body and face. But, the hunger isn't ever really there! </p>
<p>This explanation really hit home for me, as I never thought I'd hit this point when I started. I have only ever &quot;cheated&quot; once a few days ago by eating 30 minutes before my normal window.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same! Also I let myself eat whatever I want most of the time and don’t restrict myself to anything whatsoever. It’s made me actually choose healthier options knowing that after the healthy option (getting full) I can still treat myself and I end up either not eating the whole treat or maybe just half. Restricting myself was only making me more needy and the pounds have shed off during quarantine as I’m not eating as much! Sometimes it’s a hassle having to chose what to eat because you’re not even hungry!!!</p></div>		</li>
