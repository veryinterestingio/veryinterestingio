			<div class="markdown"><p>The Colorization sub used to be one of my favourites and almost every submission used to amaze me. The quality was amazing and I could scroll through it for hours. But it’s 90% low grade ‘first attempts’ now which look like a kid with a colouring book has done it. I’m all for people trying their best and learning and don’t want to criticise but it’s a lot less fun to look at for me now. Do others feel the same?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve seen a a few vids about it on YouTube, it’s a really fascinating art, on a professional level. They spend MONTHS researching and obtaining fabric swatches and samples of the time/place so they can do so accurately, going over written accounts of the events or period. They’re historians as much as they are artists and editors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My grandmother had one done of a photograph of her mother, and was flabbergasted that they got the colour of her dress spot-on, because she remembered that dress. This was also before the internet so it's not like they could have done some kind of online research - I can't imagine the level of research they must have done to nail that so accurately. People who do that stuff never cease to amaze me.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Colorize: US</p>
<p>Colourize: Canada</p>
<p>Colourise: UK (or Australia/NZ)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Highly recommend watching they shall not grow old and then watch the little documentary afterward about how they did it. It'll blow your mind, and is one of the few old time footage movies out there that looks like it was shot yesterday in some scenes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was one of the most amazing documentaries I've ever seen, especially how they fixed the frame rates and made so much effort in correctly dubbing the audio. Even just the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrabKK9Bhds" target="_blank">trailer</a> is fascinating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the process is called rotoscopy ... also can refer to special effects.  So for example if the older star wars films during the light sabre scenes an effects editor/artist would literally paint the colours onto each film frame. Each second of film is 24 frames btw - and if u do the math it can add up to quite the under taking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not every frame any longer, at 24 frames a second the colours don't change much between frames so computers can make a good estimate based on the previous frame what colours are needed. Still some manual work involved though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One might add that some of the artists go to absurd lengths to form their reasonable assuptions. This might include researching what kind of color pigments were used at the time by, what colors the clothing brands used (sometimes seeking preserved original pieces), how these colors interact with light, what kind of color film they want to emulate etc. You can science the fluff out of some projects.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For more recent stuff like World War II, it always helps if there are color photos of that exact scene - it takes the guesswork out of the job. The tedious hassle of manually doing photo restoration and color retouching is something i don't look back tenderly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>World War II in Color (on Netflix) and Cold in Blue (HBO) are mind-blowing to me! </p>
<p>Especially Cold in Blue since it was recorded by a cinematographer who was aboard a bomber plane and would document what it was like. He knew there was a chance he could die but he did it anyways.</p></div>		</li>
