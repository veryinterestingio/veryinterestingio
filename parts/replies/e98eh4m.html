			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the higher the voltage, the more resistance it can overcome to produce current. When a battery is low (at a 20% state of charge) it's voltage is lower than average, so the smallest amount of resistance that is in the system can temporarily start cutting the current. </p>
<p>Filament bulbs will just get dimmer and dimmer, but an LED requires a minimum voltage to operate, so when the batteries hit low voltage due to higher resistance in the system (usually from corrosion), they just shut off. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Piggy backing on this, in naval aviation we used to do “corrosion prevention” on our tools, salt water wreaks havoc on tools, flashlights included. Take some extremely fine grit sand paper and clean the battery contacts every so often. As u/series_hybrid has said, filament bulbs (old school incandescent lamps) get dim, but it’s much more apparent on LED bulbs due to the low operating voltage LEDs use. So if you see your LED flashlight flickering, check the contacts and check the body where the ground point is, pretty sure it’s either loose or there is corrosion on it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>LEDs have a minimum voltage though, below that they simply will not emit light, filament lights don't have a hard lower limit on voltage, so even a tiny bit of voltage can still technically make a filament bulb shine a little bit. Granted probably not noticeably.</p>
<p>I think? Anyone feel free to correct me</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but many flashlights will have lots of components between the battery and the led that makes it less obvious to predict.</p>
<p>Plus, even if it's just batteries and LEDs and maybe a resistor, it's gonna go from perfectly fine to below the forward voltage drop threshold very suddenly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They can, but they need <em>something</em> to start operating. Traditional bulbs will light up even with say 1% power, very dimly, but still lit, LEDs will be completely off until 20% power and then they'll be dimmable up to 100. </p>
<p>I made up numbers, but hopefully you understand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question then: will hitting a battery slightly more often before this threshold is reached extend battery life? Basically, does it take more battery energy to get through this corrosion than not?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't really extend the battery, it just removes any film of corrosion that is causing a slight voltage drop. If you clean the contacts occasionally, it will have the same life as banging the flashlight near the end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just adding to your comment: </p>
<p>Corrosion and/or oxidation of contacts can be often corrected by vibration.  Corrosion is generally caused by leaving old batteries in a flashlight too long, oxidation is caused by degradation and lost of conductivity of metal in contact with normal atmosphere. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just adding to your comment:</p>
<p>A wire brush around the inside and outside threads of the battery cap and any threaded bulb holders can bring back a flashlight that has a good bulb and batteries, but does not work. </p>
<p>A little bit of vinegar on a cotton swab (they have long reach versions) will help clean corroded contacts.</p>
<p>In extreme cases, disassemble the device and soak the corroded parts in vinegar, changing the vinegar after the first two hours and cleaning it with a cheap toothbrush (that you won't be using for your dental needs) or a wire brush. Soak it again for a few hours to overnight and clean it up again with a brush or rag. </p>
<p>If it's something you only use once a month, take out the batteries. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just adding to the comment, since /u/Philip_De_Bowl went on a perfectly legitimate tangent:</p>
<p>The 'corrosion' we're talking about here is imperceptible to the human eye.  You may take the batteries out and expect to see a green mass of corrosion, but the contacts all look perfectly shiny.</p>
<p>We're talking about a molecules-deep layer of corrosion/oxidation which is just enough on the threshold of voltage drop to dim the lamp.  Jiggling it around wipes off a few molecules and gives you a few more seconds of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it works on a single battery, i'd expect it has some tiny DC-DC voltage converter inside. Voltage of a single AA/AAA battery by itself is AFAIK not enough to drive a LED, so it must be converted to a higher voltage - and that's also why it's also &quot;vampiric&quot;, if the DC-DC is good it can convert quite low voltage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because like most chemical reactions the chemical reaction that produces the electricity in the battery takes place faster at higher temperatures. If you put a battery in a cold environment it will lose current capacity and voltage compared to the same battery at room temperature. Warming them up with your hands is only likely to help if the batteries are cold to start with, like being outside in the winter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with this statement, All of these answers about Led flashlights lol. I think the query was meant for simpler explanations. All it is, is a conversion of potential to kinetic energy. Batteries die faster in the cold, we all know this. Just a chemical reaction in there for most flashlights—which are typically battery operated. Also I can agree with shaking it allowing for more direct voltage induction. If the batteries are being pressed into the sockets. </p></div>		</li>
