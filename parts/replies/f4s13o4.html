			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on, the reason a lot of movies are 2.39:1 is because of anamorphic lenses. This was created in the mid 20th century to bring people back to the movies after televisions became more commonplace. They called it “CinemaScope.” </p>
<p>Won’t go into too much detail, but basically these lenses would be filmed squeezed, then projected into 2.39:1. This causes distortions on the sides of the image and creates lens flares (which is what people criticize JJ Abrams for over using).</p>
<p>EDIT: anamorphic lenses are VERY expensive, so a lot of people use standard cinema lenses shot at 16x9 and just add black bars on the top and bottom. You’ll notice these fake anamorphic movies if the lens flares are circular instead of streaking)</p></div>		</li>
