			<div class="markdown"><p>Regarding the enormity of words in the English language - this could potentially be an issue. As you add more words to the device's vocabulary, it would become easier for a decoder to confuse them. For example, decoding 'cow' and 'cows' as two separate words would make it hard to discriminate between the neural activity associated with the two words since they are very similar save for the final 's'. However, language modeling is extremely helpful, so even if you have uncertainty over what words a user is trying to say, you can use a language model to use the rules of English and the context of each word to improve the predictions, as we did in our paper. For the 'cow' vs 'cows' example, a language model would change 'I saw two cow' to 'I saw two cows'.</p>
<p>What is promising is that you don't need too many more words to make the device useful in practical applications -- according to this article (<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-44569277" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-44569277" target="_blank">https://www.bbc.com/news/world-44569277</a></a>), you only need 800 words to understand 75% of the language used in normal life. There are also alternative approaches to increasing the vocabulary that have been demonstrated in people that can speak normally, like decoding subword units such as phonemes (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10994-4" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10994-4" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10994-4</a></a>). That approach can be generalized to any size vocabulary, and it's what most artificial speech recognition systems use today.</p>
<p>Regarding a transcranial apparatus, that would be extremely nice, but the signals acquired from this kind of technology are typically noisier than what you can get with implanted devices. One of our goals for the future is to have a fully implanted neural interface that can wirelessly transmit data outside of the skull, which should cosmetically look better than our current approach and wouldn't need to be wired to a computer. This should also reduce the required amount of medical care associated with the device because part of the device would no longer be embedded in the skull. -SM</p></div>		</li>
