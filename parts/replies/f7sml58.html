			<div class="markdown"><p>If you take a still picture of something moving, it's blurry, right? It's blurry because in the short time the shutter was open, the person was moving and so was in multiple places. So the blur is a timeframe of everywhere the person was while the shutter was open.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice explanation! Follow-up question: could you introduce a motion blur to video game stills so as to achieve a similar smoothness with a lower frame rate?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The shutter of a camera is open for a period of time, letting light hit the sensor. We'll say it's open for 3ms for argument's sake. </p>
<p>The image you see is an average of all the light that hits each pixel on the sensor. </p>
<p>The people in the Kingsmen scene are moving, and in every 3ms window with the shutter open, their position on the image will change. They feature in all pixels corresponding to where they were at the start of that 3ms, to where they were at the end of that 3ms. </p>
<p>If you move too much while taking a picture, or you take a picture of a fast-moving object, it's usually blurred, I'm sure you know that. That's the same thing. The person/camera are moving relative to each other. Inage gets blurry.
You can reduce blur by opening the shutter for less time, but there is also less total light, so the image gets darker.</p>
<p>Video games don't do this averaging. Instead each frame draws everything in a crystal clear image showing exactly where objects are supposed to be. It's like capturing an infinitely short period of time, a single instant. This looks very unnatural to the eye because things aren't this discrete in real life. You need more frames to show smaller jumps in the positions of objects, which help make things look more life-like.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The timing in-between each frame is really important too. </p>
<p>Usually when a game is running at lower frame-rates it’s because the GPU can’t keep up, but it’s pushing out frames as fast as it can. Some frames take longer to render than others meaning not only is each frame sharp, but they’re also not spaced evenly apart which really hurts how smooth it looks. </p>
<p>Minecraft is a really obvious example of this. It can be running at 60 fps and still look choppy. </p>
<p>That’s why technology like freesync is a thing. It’ll even out those frame times making 40 fps look smoother than 60 fps without it. </p>
<p>Obviously movies are pre-rendered so they always run at a constant time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if it would be more correct that it’s a summation of the light over that period, as opposed to an averaging. Either way, great explanation!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In camera terms, consider length of exposure. Think of those long exposure shots of, say, traffic. If a single car with headlights on passes by the camera while the shutter is open, the image will look like two long snakes of light, instead of the two orbs of the headlights.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really bugs me when games on PC offer a 30fps option but absolutely no image options for that mode. For example interpolation, interlacing or blur etc. It just looks awful and really janky without the techniques consoles use to make it seem more fluid. Does anyone know if those techniques are generally written into the code of the game or is the image from the game altered by the console as it renders the video? That is, does the console receive the same jerky version as the PC game would then apply techniques to it, or is it the code of the game that compensates for 30fps?</p>
<p>Just curious. If it's the latter I can't see why they wouldn't include the techniques in a PC version, some games aren't too bad at 30fps and while I tend to choose frame rate others prefer higher resolution or graphics. And there are oddballs who genuinely prefer 30fps, don't see why they shouldn't have the option.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think gameplay influence it a bit too. Recently when i played outer world i needed to reduce graphic options a a bit. The gameplay feels really delayed and lagged at 25 fps. When i lowered the graphics i fell much more confortable interacting and much easier to play and aim.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not exactly sure what you mean by 30fps option for PC games, but I do know that PC games are given basically the full range of graphics customization because every PC is different and console games usually have locked graphics settings because when they are designed for console games, the graphics are optimized the  specific console, some thing that is usually locked into console games is motion blur which gives the illusion of being as fast as the PC version while actually running at 30fps.</p></div>		</li>
