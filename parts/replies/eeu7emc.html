			<div class="markdown"><p>It is not impossible. And the could be the reasoning, however I would say the main driver is money. It costs a lot of money to house research animals properly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the most likely reason. At most institutions mice cost upwards of $1/day/cage of mice in vivarium fees. Rats cost even more. So for 1 decent sized experiment, say 100 mice, we are talking 20 cages. Say they monitor them for 4 months, now we're looking at 120 days x 20cages x $1 = $2400 in just housing costs alone. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes. Lots of instances. But lab animals get destroyed as a general practice, anyway. If they are no longer needed for research purposes, they are euthanized according to guidelines and usually incinerated. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was kind of pissed about this.  Did some research on fish (nothing with drugs, it was all behavioral) and wanted to try and find some place to rehome them after the experiment was over.  </p>
<p>Nope, IACUC made me euthanize them all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So this was what actually led me to this question; it seems like an interesting further study to look at how an <em>almost</em> lethal dose of a substance can affect the body's responsiveness to other substances in the future.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I totally agree with you, there are a few problems here.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I have no idea what your scientific background is, so don't shoot me if I oversimplify, but look at the tests like this:</p>
<p>Pretend we are back in high school math. You have an equation with several unknown variables, let's say x and y. If you change x, you can see how y changes and vice versa.</p>
<p>Now pretend you have an equation with 500 unknown variables (weight, genetic diversity, predispositions to disease, hormones, nutritional uptake, water intake, gender, age, possible side interactions we don't know about, etc.) If you change x, can you, for certain, say how that affects y? No, not really. </p>
<p>Drug trials are extremely difficult to do, even under the best of circumstances. There is no feasible way to test every possible combination of variables for any given drug, so tests are designed to minimize variables and potential damage (that's why they start in cell cultures, then to mice or rats, then to humans and why human trials exclude people with preexisting conditions, pregnant women or women in general, and people using other substances). </p>
<p>There's ethical issues here as well. If the combo of an almost lethal dose of X makes Y more effective that's great, but what if the combo leads to extreme pain or internal hemorrhaging or birth defects? How can we justify taking that risk? There are some crazy strict guidelines on how to handle <em>in vivo</em> trials. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So I totally agree it would be interesting to look at, and potentially even helpful to look at these interactions. But the process would probably be terribly terribly unethical.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Taking a near lethal dose of something might not always leave the animal healthy. Damage to internal organs, brain/nerves, cardiovascular. </p>
<p>It might be more humane to euthanize them, then leave the lab rat in some state of discomfort for whatever it's remaining natural life is. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not an &quot;almost lethal&quot; does though, it's one that'll probably kill the subject. Having a 50% chance of dying at step 1 of a treatment regime doesn't seem like a very interesting treatment to investigate. &quot;Drink 120 coffees, then take 2 aspirin and come see me in the morning if you're still feeling alive&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never seen a case where the animals were not immediately sacrificed after the test.  Animal care guidelines include limiting suffering where at all possible.</p>
<p>Also of interest, sacrifice is always a manual process in order to not contaminate autopsy.  Some techs will just break necks by hand, others use a little guillotine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back in the late 70s I had a job as an animal tech for a large medical supply company. </p>
<p>I don't recall how we did the rats and guinea pigs. I know we had a guillotine but I never used it.</p>
<p>For the mice it was cervical dislocate and for the rabbits it was sodium barbital. I sacrificed more critters than I care to recall. Me and my fellow techs treated them well, but after a while it starts to get to you, especially when you can sense that the animal knows whats happening.</p>
<p>Living in Texas I am asked why I don't hunt...</p></div>		</li>
