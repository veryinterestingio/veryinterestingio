			<div class="markdown"><p>So proof is actually a really inaccurate measurement.</p>
<p>Edit: Whoa. I guess &quot;innacurate&quot; was the wrong word. It just seems like proof is more of an approximation as apposed to ABV which will tell you exactly how much alcohol you're consuming. As some one else pointed out, the concept of &quot;proof&quot; has been more finely tuned so that it's more accurate now.</p>
<p>And yes, I agree that we Americans are stupid when it comes to measurements. Sorry to the metric master race.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;The exception proves the rule&quot; isn't an example of &quot;prove&quot; meaning &quot;to test&quot;. It means that a stated exception to a rule is the same as stating the rule itself. So a sign stating &quot;free parking on Sundays&quot; is the exception that proves the rule that parking isn't free on other days. It isn't necessary to have a sign stating that parking is not free on those other days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to this, it was a common practice on ships as a proof of the abv of rum. Since a portion of a sailors paycheck was in rum, it was super important to make sure you were getting a full pay. So they'd perform this 'ritual' on the deck prior to passing around 'paychecks' to show everyone that the rum hadn't been watered down. Of course only the officers got the good stuff and the enlisted usually had theirs watered down afterwards anyway.
The original reason for the rum? Helped prevent scurvy for pirates and Royal Navy sailors alike. The ration tradition continued up until 1970. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Scurvy is caused by a lack of vitamin c.</p>

<p>Yeah that's bullshit too, they gave them alcohol because it was the only way to keep them in line as a result of how shitty they were treated.</p>
<p>brb going down the bakery for a loaf of bread at age 13 and waking up &quot;recruited&quot; by the navy. They would literally just go out, beat the fuck out of people and when they woke up they were at sea. Nobody is &quot;preserving water&quot; as alcohol, rum supplies werent saving you if all your water went bad.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not exactly. Grog (one part rum to eight parts water with a twist of lime to keep the scurvy away) was useful for preventing scurvy, but the rum itself has no role in that.</p>
<p>That being said, a potable liquid with a high alcohol content is useful for a number of things (in addition to the obvious inebriation), most notably that it's going to be the one guaranteed source of clean/sterile liquid. In a world where germ theory was still centuries off from adoption, this is immensely important.</p>
<p>Another historic/famous sailor/pirate drink comes down to us as the  &quot;Dark and Stormy&quot;--where ginger beer (itself historically an alcoholic beverage) is mixed with rum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It wasn't mixed 8:1 depending on the Navy and period it was usually somewhere from a 4:1 to 1:1 only people being punished for drunkenness or other shit would get their grog served that diluted. Lime was very rarely mixed with it and when it was done it was a personal thing not a part of their standard grog ration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a friend who was a Marine who served in the Vietnam War. He once told me how by then they had stopped paying in rum but hadn't yet fully taken it off the books. Anyway, his story was that he found whatever loophole and petitioned for the &quot;back pay&quot; of his rum ration for his tour and ended up with several cases of rum as a result.</p></div>		</li>
