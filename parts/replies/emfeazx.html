			<div class="markdown"><p>Alpha Geminorum (Castor) is a triple hierarchical, sextuple star system. </p>
<p>So there's Aa and Ab which orbit a common centre of mass, like a binary system. Then Ba and Bb, which also orbit like a binary. These two binary systems (A and B) orbit each a common centre of mass.</p>
<p>Then this whole thing (A and B together) and a third binary system C (Ca and Cb, which form a red dwarf binary) also orbit a common centre of mass to form one massive system, which appears as one star in the sky, the brightest &quot;star&quot; in the Gemini constellation.</p>
<p>iirc this is the largest observed hierarchical multiple star system.</p>
<p>EDIT: There are actually two 7-star systems: Nu Scorpii and AR Cassiopeiae that look like <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Construction_of_Nu_Scorpii.png/220px-Construction_of_Nu_Scorpii.png" target="_blank">this</a> (not to scale ofc)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stars itselves are not that rare, but they are often very far away from each other and don‘t interact with another. Systems with more stars are often very unstable, but as said before there are ways they can be stable, but that doesn‘t occur very  often.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Earth actually holds the unique trait to have a moon that can create a total eclipse with the sun.</p>
<p>As far as we know this is extraordinarily rare and haven't recorded any instance of it happening anywhere else</p>
<p>Edit: As clarification, I was referring too perfect total eclipses, where the sun and Moon both appear the same exact size is the sky. Both the sun and Moon take up on average half a degree of the space in the sky. Thus when they overlap perfectly, the moon is barely covering the sun, creating a perfect eclipse</p></div>		</li>
