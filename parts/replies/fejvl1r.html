			<div class="markdown"><p>At first when I read &quot;supernova&quot; I kind of shut down because whatever you said after that seemed like it was going to be even more difficult to understand than my initial question.  However, with the encouragement from the other comment I re-read it a few times and wow!  That really makes so much sense.   Thank you!</p></div>		</li>

<p>I always find it interesting how so many fields of science start to cross into other fields. We can verify the accuracy of a concept in geology by peeking into something we know from astronomy. We can then verify an assumption in astronomy by peeking back into geology or biology. It's become a complicated web. But the fact that the web exists is one of the reasons that we have so much confidence about our general scientific understanding.</p>
<p>This is something that so many anti-science people fail to comprehend. If the young-earth creationists were correct, then just about every field of science is completely wrong. The creationists attempt to say something about biology, but geology refutes it. They then say something about geology, and astronomy refutes it. Either the whole web is (largely) correct, or the whole web is completely wrong. But we can demonstrate that the whole web can't be totally wrong with something as simple as the cellphone in your pocket. The camera in the phone is a working example that our understanding of quantum mechanics is largely correct, and the GPS is a working example that our understanding of relativity is largely correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OP, this is the only correct answer so far. All this stuff about &quot;we know because statistics&quot; is a total non sequitur and the &quot;it's an assumption&quot; crowd are just encouraging Young Earthers and other psuedoscience/anti-science people.</p></div>		</li>
