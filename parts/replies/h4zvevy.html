			<div class="markdown"><p>I try using mouse with my non-dominant hand occasionally, the interesting thing is it's not too hard to do the movements, but I want to &quot;mirror&quot; the buttons, apparently my muscle memory is not &quot;left click / right click,&quot; it's &quot;index finger click / middle finger click.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>Oddly enough, I can write in cursive, mirrored really well left handed.  If you hold it to a mirror, it looks way better than my normal handwriting. If I write forward it looks like my cat tried to learn to write.</p>
