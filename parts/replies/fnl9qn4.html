<p>Digital death is a big research area and there's lots of interesting qualitative research being done around the world. Currently Kate and I are writing up research from our interviews with bereaved people in the UK who decided to cremate their family member without a funeral ('direct cremation'). For those who chose direct cremation (i.e. to not have a funeral ceremony), they were happy  with their decision as it made sense to them and their circumstances. We conducted this research as we were also interested to see if the funeral had an impact on the grief trajectory following a cremation.</p>
<p>There is quite a lot written about 'mass deaths' and public mourning - where people come together to grieve usually after a natural disaster or sporting disaster, or a terror related event. There is a field of study called Terror Management Theory, which I've only just started to read, and which has fascinating insights into behaviours of populations after people have died as a result of a terrorist related incident. Historically, here in the UK, there has been a lot of analysis of commemoration for the two world wars of one hundred years ago, and I do wonder whether we will see similar mass/public commemorative events for those who died in the Coronavirus Pandemic of 2020.</p></div>		</li>
