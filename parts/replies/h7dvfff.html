			<div class="markdown"><p>Similar experience. I had both of my Achilles tendons surgically detached, heel bone ground down and reshaped, then Achilles reattached. Two months apart. First time I took hydrocodone for two days plus ibuprofen and didn't notice a difference in pain relief when I stopped the hydrocodone. 2nd surgery I only took ibuprofen and acetaminophen and the pain relief was the same if not better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Norco and Vicodin are a blend of hydrocodone and acetaminophen.  Percocet is a blend of oxycodone and acetaminophen.  So if you were actually given Norco, Vicodin, or the generic equivalent, you were taking acetaminophen, but a lower dosage of 325mg for Norco and 500mg for Vicodin.  Those levels are lower than recommended for a single pill as an effective dose for acetaminophen alone, but  have a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20670044/" target="_blank">synergistic effect with opioids</a> that make them more effective and allowing less of the opioid to be more effective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In short, I had massive bone spurs from a lifetime of competitive sports. It reached the point where I couldn't run or jump more than 10 minutes without paying for it with 2 weeks of swelling and ludicrous amounts of pain. I found a good sports surgeon and went for the surgeries with an extremely aggressive rehab plan. I was squatting in the gym again within 2 weeks. Running in 4 weeks. Ran a 5k race in 24:00 something in 3 months. Kickboxing 4x week after 4 months. Ultimate Frisbee after 5 months and competed at national championships after 10 months. Crossfit after six months (I still don't rebound off of box jumps for safety though). </p>
<p>There was pain, for sure. But only during the activity and nothing after. Probably took 2.5 years to be completely pain free. I'm 100% in both feet now and no lingering issues and full mobility (tons of dorsiflexion). Very happy with the results. </p>
<p>Fwiw I only had a soft cast for 1 week after each surgery, never used a boot nor crutches.</p></div>		</li>
