			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been enjoying <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/KitbogaShow" target="_blank">Kitboga</a> on YouTube lately - he does livestreams of himself leading scammers on and wasting hours of their time in increasingly elaborate ways. My favourite one had to be where the scammer got him to &quot;buy&quot; $2000 of Google Play Store cards, which he then &quot;credited&quot; to his own Google Play account while the scammer watched helplessly (the codes were all fake, of course - he runs a script that makes it look like the store is accepting any random string of letters and numbers as valid).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once spent 25 minutes trying to get a foreign scammer to explain to me where the ctrl key was under the pretense that my greasy chip fingers had worn off all the letters on the keys. The string of broken english expletives that came out when i got bored and told him i was just fucking with him was worth the effort.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For example, law enforcement has traced Darkside to Russia. To further the investigation, they need help from Russian police... Which will never happen.</p>
<p>Russia govt basically protects (employs?) hackers in their country. In exchange, the freelance hackers/criminal gangs promise to not hack Russian or Russian allies or businesses.</p>
<p>North Korea also does this to some extent, though NK hackers are almost all government sponsored.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a sense itâ€™s modern day privateering. All developed nations employ hackers, but each country has their own rules of engagement when it comes to who to hack and what to do to them. If you want to be a successful hacker make sure you hack someone your country really really hates.</p></div>		</li>
