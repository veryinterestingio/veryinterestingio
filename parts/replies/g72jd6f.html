			<div class="markdown"><p>I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was a kid but I never knew this could be a part of it. I always wondered if everyone else always gets &quot;stuck&quot; on repeating words / phrases in their heads. It's so annoying. I basically have to either say it out loud or type it out before my brain will move forward</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth looking into what autistic people experience! Echolalia and stimming are both considered &quot;autistic&quot; things, but ADHD and autistic brains are similar enough to be considered &quot;cousin disorders&quot; so I find there's a lot of overlap and similarity.  Source I guess, I'm ADHD and have done research into autism as well.</p>
<p>And yeah, I get the same way.  If I'm alone, it always ends up happening out loud anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not the first time I‚Äôve read symptoms of ASD or ADHD and thought ‚Äúhuh that sounds like me‚Äù. I think I‚Äôve learned to deal with this by this point in my life but it makes me wonder if I‚Äôd have been diagnosed if I was a child today. Not sure how I‚Äôd feel about being ‚Äútreated‚Äù for this though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OCD is an outward manifestation of massive anxiety, which is very commonly concomitant with ADHD. I think the recursive thoughts are all interconnected. It drives me fucking crazy, and my meds only temper it slightly üôÑ</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same. I have OCD and always thought thats what caused me do to this.
However, I have mentioned this behaviour to my therapist in the past, and she never said anything about ADHD or Autism--now I am not sure if I should ask about it again.</p></div>		</li>

Edit: should clarify it‚Äôs an invisible pad in front of my face, I just do it to thin air</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have ADHD and experience this, and none of my friends understand when I explain it to them. There's a handful of words that are repeat offenders, too. For example, the word &quot;aardvark&quot; pops into my head a lot and I have no fucking idea why.</p></div>		</li>
