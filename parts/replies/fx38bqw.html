			<div class="markdown"><p>I can attest to keeping a porch spider to cure your arachnophobia. I had a fairly large zipper spider build a huge web under the awning on my back porch one summer, and I decided to let it stay there since it wasn’t in my way and it gave me something cool to look at when my dog needed out to poop or if I decided to smoke or whatever. It was actually really awesome to watch her catch things and wrap them up, and she did end up eating a few wasps for me, too. I got to see her grow and rebuild her web a few times, I kept track of the number of egg sacs she laid (5!) and eventually had my Facebook following along with her too.</p>
<p>In the late autumn, she died to the first freeze and I honestly almost cried. I haven’t had the same fear of spiders since.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In areas with pitcher plants, many spiders will lurk in the hood if the pitcher and <em>steal</em> prey that comes in, attracted to the pitchers nectar. They drop the dry corpse in, though, so the plant still gets some nutrients.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a stupid spider between my door and my bug screen. It keeps building a web, I keep removing it. I do wonder how it didn't starve yet though, there is never anything in the web, how could it.</p></div>		</li>
