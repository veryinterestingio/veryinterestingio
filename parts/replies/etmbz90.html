			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably depends how they got rubbed off and if the follicles were damaged in the process. I don’t think they’ll grow back if the follicles were damaged.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't actually know how my arm lost some of its hairs. I think they were rubbed off because the skin wasn't damaged, and there is only a certain area where some of the hairs are shorter.</p>
<p>I could do an experiment on my other arm were I shave off my arm hairs on my other arm a see if the hair grows back or not, which could be relatively interesting.</p>
<p>Thanks for the advice though, I'll come to terms with living with some short and long hairs on one of me arms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it in a patch/several patches? It's possible you have alopecia areata. It's very common on body hair and in beards but a lot of people don't notice.</p></div>		</li>
