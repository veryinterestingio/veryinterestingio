			<div class="markdown"><p>At what level? As I can tell from the question, you know that the pressure of a gas or liquid increases with depth. The pressure at the center of Jupiter's core is massively bigger than the one found on the surface of the planet. According to calculations by NASA the pressure at the center of Jupiter is more than 650 million psi. <a href="https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/jupiter/en/" target="_blank">Link to the NASA Article about the inside of Jupiter</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah of course, I guess I meant on the &quot;surface&quot;, so where it changes from gaseous to liquid I think? That's a good point though I'd be intrigued to see the psi at multiple depths. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey just a heads up I was reading that article, it's actually 16000 at the bottom of Earth's pacific ocean. It's 650 million psi inside Jupiter's core, according to that article.</p></div>		</li>
