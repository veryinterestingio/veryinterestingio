			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in California.  I grew up in San Diego and lived there in 2003 and 2007 when the firestorms hit and a third of the county burned.  I'm currently about 90 minutes away from where the Camp fire is currently burning, and where the fires burned in Napa over the summer.  I've got a friend who lives in Alberta.</p>
<p>He was checking the other day to make sure I wasn't anywhere near the fires, and we got to talking about other things, and he mentioned a fire that they'd had in Fort McMurry a while back.  &quot;Yeah, it started burning in May of 2016, they finally put it out in August of 2017.&quot;  It burned 1.5 million acres, and it was on fire for over a year.</p>
<p>I was astounded.  He said once it stopped threatening homes and winter set in, they just let it smolder.  Hard to fight fire in the insanely cold weather, and it was just burning vegetation for the most part.  You can't let a fire burn for over a year in California.  There's not one and a half million acres in California where there's not people.  The Camp fire, for all it's destruction, is only at 125k acres as of this morning, which is massive, but a tenth of the size of the Fort McMurry fire.  San Diego's Cedar fire was just under 300k acres, still massive, but still a fifth of the size of the Fort McMurry fire..  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fort McMurray is my home town! It’s an oil town in the far north of the province and so there’s virtually nothing nearby for hundreds of kilometers. So fires elsewhere are gonna get more attention unless it directly impacts the city.</p>
<p>When I was growing up, there was a fire south of the city which blocked the only route in and out (maybe in the late 80’s?). I remember the grocery store shelving stocks slowly dwindle. The fire crept closer and closer but never made it to the city itself. I had a high priority medical appointment in Edmonton so we had to fly over the fire (my first plane flight ever!) and I remember thinking how massive the fire was as I excitedly drank my complimentary apple juice.  From north to south it ended up stretching about 100 km. </p>
<p>It’s crazy to think of how populated California is compared to here.  You guys have more people than the entirety of Canada. So a fire of this size would be insane down there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Forest fires are a necessary part of the ecology in many of the areas they occur.  There are some trees that produce seeds that won't germinate unless they've been burned.  If you can let it burn its better for the environment. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, I definitely understand, and have even mentioned those trees to friends of mine when I point out that for all their destruction I have a certain appreciation of and fascination with forest fires.  </p>
<p>Just the sheer size of the fire, and how long it burned for, surprised me.  </p></div>		</li>
