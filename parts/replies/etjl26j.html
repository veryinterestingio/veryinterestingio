			<div class="markdown"><p>Ackchually, that is not true. Hox genes determine the vertical order of organs, not the left right difference. Hox genes determine that first you have a head, then a torso with two limbs, then the belly, then two more limbs, simply put. The left right difference is caused by notochord having certain transport proteins on the left, and not on the right side(or the other way around). These transport proteins transfer a certain substance of which i forgot the name which prohibits certain organs to develop on the one side, and stimulates them on the other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this again, there are a number of studies on something called ciliary beating which drive left-right asymmetry at the node. </p>
<p>ELI5
Node cells have tiny cellular tails that all wag in the same direction, causing the environment around the node to become asymmetric in terms of flow. This drives signalling one one side of the node which is not present on the other, leading to left and right being asymmetric in the developing embryo.</p>

<p>But for OP, yea they do have a certain orientation. Your body also somewhat knows what front and back is. If you look up axolotl experiments, they graft cells in different places and can make arma/legs regrow based on where they make the wound ie make the wound on the back of thr arm and an arm would grow out facing the other way.</p></div>		</li>
