			<div class="markdown"><p>This wouldnâ€™t be your personal footprint though. The calculation is for the worlds emissions and the visualization is 1 diamond per American. Also a vast majority of the emissions will be from factories and ships, etc. I would be interested in seeing a calculation for the size of the average persons diamond though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the math I did is for only America's emissions, divided up among only Americans.  The emissions required to make and deliver your stuff (within the US at least) is included, and I think that's fair.  It doesn't include emissions in other countries to make stuff that gets imported for you to buy, but that turns out to be <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-13187156" target="_blank">relatively small.</a></p>
<p>The average American's carbon footprint in diamond form really is 4.5 tonnes per year.  The average European's diamond is about 2 tonnes, the average Indonesian's is 0.5 tonnes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Those factories  and ships make and transport the stuff people buy. Make no mistake, big businesses pollute on our behalf.</p></div>		</li>
