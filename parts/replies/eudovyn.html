<p>Many insects such as dragonflies have sufficient eyesight and visual processing to direct their flight visually.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Understatement of the decade.. They have excellent eyesight for an insect and processing that automatically homes in on the target. Possibly the best hunter on earth. one of the things why i feel so unease with dragonflies is that they actually do see you, not your heat signature or following a scent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dragonflies also use direct muscle flight where both sets of muscles connect to the wing and power flight. Functionally, they can control their wings independently of each other. It’s why they’re crazy maneuverable and can seem to change direction on a dime to catch a prey item.</p>
<p>Most other insects fly by contracting and expanding their thorax, which pivots the wings up and down.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yup. Would not try to swat that. Would run and scream.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes this is another part of the complicated answer. Mechanically they have swoops and tumbles dictated by their physiology, however their flight control is still dictated by sensory inputs their antennae receive. There is some interesting research out there about controlling the flight path of bombyx mori with pheromones and how they orient themselves in a pheromone plume with wind. They move towards a concentration gradient of pheromones, but need to essentially sweep the air to find where the concentration of molecules in the air is greatest. This to us appears erratic. In all it’s a complicated system dictated by more than one thing.</p></div>		</li>
