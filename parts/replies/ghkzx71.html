			<div class="markdown"><p>So the real me is technically what I see in the camera but because the camera issue it makes me look less attractive? So what I see in the camera is still technically not what others see? Because camera me has the problem that girl you showed me. My nose looks bigger. My face in general looks unflattering. </p>
<p>So my simple question is, neither is what other people see?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The mirror is what other people see. The colours are essentially correct, the &quot;resolution&quot; is high, the image has depth, and the focal length is that of a human. The flip is pretty much irrelevant. It feels more natural to you, because you see it more. The non-mirrored is more natural to others. They both look basically the exact same though. You look like what you see in the mirror. Though keep in mind, bathroom lighting is very different than other lighting, like sunlight. People rarely see you in the same lightning as a bathroom mirror has. </p>
<p>A good high resolution (or high quality film) camera shot with the right lens and correct white balance and all that fun stuff, and then put on a high quality HDR screen or very good printing ink quality can look pretty close. It can even make you look better, given good photography and possibly editing. You using a cellphone camera is not even close to this, the photos usually look worse than you because they are low quality, colour and shape distorted, and generally poorly framed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The non-mirrored you is what you see in the camera, which is in a sense the &quot;real&quot; you. And the focal length issue depends on the camera used, if you're just using your cell-phone, then likely yes, you would have the same perspective issue. </p>
<p>A lot of attraction and appearance are not based in hard science though, and are highly based on expectation. You find photos of yourself particularly unattractive because it doesn't fit your brain's self-image of you. Just like how you probably hate the way you sound when you play a recording of yourself, it's just a little off, cause you aren't getting the vibrations going through your skull too.</p>
<p>Vision is also more complicated than cameras, but the longer focal lengths are **better** approximation of what other humans see than your phone camera.</p></div>		</li>
