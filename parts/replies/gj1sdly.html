			<div class="markdown"><p>infinity is weird. despite the fact that the speed of light is finite, it requires infinite energy to accelerate any non-zero mass object up to the speed of light. which would -- on paper but perhaps not in practice -- mean that a 5 nanogram object requires the same force as a 5 kilogram object (infinite) to reach c.</p>
<p>am i oversimplifying or misunderstanding something?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well infinity isn't actually a finite number. The heavier mass would need more force quicker than the lighter mass but both require infinite force to reach the speed of light. </p>
<p>But infinity isn't a finite number so you can't actually sum the total force needed to compare the two as it never reaches the speed of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, The amount of energy required to accelerate larger masses would approach infinity faster than that of a smaller mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ah, right. i was trying to plug infinity into a finite equation. really, of course the smaller object would be able to go faster with the same energy as the larger one. brainfart on my part.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just 5 kilograms; âˆž kilograms.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the moving object, the speed of light relative to it is always the same; so from the perspective of an static external observer, any gains in the speed of the moving object gets compressed further and further the faster it goes, and from the perspective of the object, the speed of light always remains the same &quot;distance&quot; away from its own speed; in no perspective the object ever actually reaches the speed of light, no matter how much it accelerates.</p>
<p>It's sorta like a real version of Zeno's paradox; except instead of position it's speed. You can never accelerate all the way to the speed of light; first you gotta reach half of speed of light, then half the difference between that and the speed of light, then half the difference between that and the speed of light, and so on; you will never actually touch the speed of light, you will always be &quot;twice the distance of your next step&quot; away from it. (&quot;half&quot; being picked just as a illustrative example, it can be any value less than 1)</p></div>		</li>
