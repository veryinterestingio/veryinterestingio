			<div class="markdown"><p>What they actually do is give doctors multiple preferals. So for example they get 100 dentists and give them a list of toothpastes and they pick all of those they like. So yes 4/5 reccomend colgate but they also reccomend most other toothpastes</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with this is that a proper understanding of statistics requires the fairly advanced algebra of pre-calc. Indeed, you don't have to scratch the surface of statistics too deeply before you find full-blown calculus!</p>
<p>Not that I disagree with you. It would be wonderful if everyone understood that an 100% increase on almost nothing is still almost nothing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Calc for statistics? Not at a basic level. Anything advanced then yeah but I'd hardly imagine op needs precalc for figuring this out.</p>
<p>Couldn't argue against algebra though at any level. In our school system trig, algebra etc are split and not called precalculus (UK). At least not at KS3/GCSE level.</p></div>		</li>
