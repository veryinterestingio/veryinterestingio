			<div class="markdown"><p>I was wondering about that as well. I mean, a dog doesn't care why it has a stomach ache and seeks to alleviate the symptoms so it makes sense that level of awareness would also come into play.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Along with this, it might be over biased towards these diseases because of how they’re discussed in human society.</p>
<p>For example, salmonella has about a 1/20,000 chance of being present in any given egg. However, people are generally taught to never eat raw egg products. Those kind of odds are never noticed in the animals eating the eggs, but the human perception may be much stronger.</p>
<p>Just a thought.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, since you mentioned it, it's strange that animals don't seem to have a similar level of food aversion that humans do even when they're shown to be susceptible to classical conditioning like with dogs. It only takes one bad experience with specific food item to turn a human off that food completely for life, even when they're too young to know what germs or viruses are so I wonder why you don't see similar behavior in dogs? </p>
<p>Obviously a question for a different thread, just an afterthought.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My thought is it has to do with historically where we got our food from.  Dogs are at their core hunters who eat meat.  They have an instinct to hunt and kill meat sources for food that likely overrides a bad experience.  Humans from my understanding where scavengers and would start to eat anything and depended on our taste buds and past experiences to avoid foods that might kill us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly enough, humans and wolves evolved as opportunistic carnivores. Basically, while we both will hunt prey neither were above scavenging. This is the hypothesis put forward for the domestication of wolves: the wolves most likely to be comfortable scavenging around human encampments ended up being kept as “pets”.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes perfect sense when you put it that way. Animals that kill and eat their prey right away don't really have to worry about rot and decay playing a factor but humans store food and we probably NEEDED a stronger &quot;sick&quot; reaction because our food is more likely to go bad. Even in the original sub I think the biases part of my brain considers &quot;sick&quot; to be inherently negative reaction without considering that it also serves a purpose like any other pain reaction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You do actually see the behaviour in pets sometimes, lots of pet owners will tell you their animals have different preferences for foods. For most animals, though, it's because they simply have no choice. They don't have the breathing room to be picky, and I guarantee you if you took someone and starved them for a week or so, they would happily scarf down the first raw cut of meat you threw in front of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like 0ndem says, they probably have a strong instinct to eat meat that overrides the bad experience. With what I know now, I actually think now that humans were not meant to eat loads and loads of meat. Because meat is very very hard on the kidneys. Protein in nature has nitrogen, which gets converted to urea, and the kidneys have to work overtime to produce ammonia to balance that out.</p></div>		</li>
