			<div class="markdown"><p>I just noticed that Copper-Silver-Gold stack one on the other on the periodic table.  CU, AG, AU.  </p>
<p>Does this mean that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roentgenium" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roentgenium</a> would have corrosion resistance superior to gold?  I read it's electron affinity is less than Gold, making it a cheaper and lower cost alternative to Unobtainium: forming the most reliable computer contacts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say the even more major problem is that we can’t make it easily at all. Would be pretty hard to make contacts out of something we’ve only ever made a few atoms of. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I should use it for power contacts only, not data?  Cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The wikipedia article itself says in the intro paragraph that it is extremely radioactive, does not occur naturally, and only one synthetic isotope has a half-life longer than a minute. </p>
<p>And it’s only 1 minute 40 seconds. There are theoretically two isotopes that could last longer but only 5 and 10 minutes, but they haven’t been created... Not feasible at all. </p></div>		</li>
