<p>Edit: I got excited guys, jeez</p>
<p>Edit^2: Thanks for telling me about your birthmarks guys. I really enjoyed it. I have a friend who believes they're scars from how you died in previous lives. I don't believe that, but its fun to come up with stories :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a medium colored person and I have a dark birthmark on the inside of one knee and a light birthmark on the inside of the other knee (like where the would touch in the fetal position) . I've always wondered if some melanin came off of one knee and stuck on the other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Strawberry birthmarks are vascular and usually get bigger when she's around 2 years old and then shrink again. Maybe when she's in puberty and starts to grow rapidly, it'll come back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ayy, same. It covers a whole quarter of my back, some of my shoulder, and a lot of my chest too. I'm always entertained how deep purple it can get if I'm cold and wet.</p>
<p>Its also fun how my birth marks are completely concealed by a t-shirt, because I can go years knowing somebody before they finally see me shirtless and they're so surprised.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same! Mine is not nearly so large but it does change colors depending on my body temperature. I never knew it could disappear though, so I’ve just spent the last ten minutes pressing on it playing hide and go seek with my birth mark.</p></div>		</li>
