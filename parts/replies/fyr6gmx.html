			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what the question is asking is how to determine a time interval, but more the absolute time relative to our current timekeeping system. If all of our time systems shut off you could use your method to create a very precise egg timer for 10 minutes, but it wouldn't be able to tell you when is it exactly 3 O'clock.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought hydrogen would be the most stable atom, and cesium would be one of the least stable ones since it's bigger? Can you explain to me why cesium is being considered stable?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure! We call the noble gases stable because they are chemically inert. We call an iron nucleus stable because it has a high binding energy per nucleon and (related) it thus turns out to be an end product of supernovae.</p>
<p>When we colloquially said cesium is &quot;stable&quot; here, we also mean something very different. We mean it's a good ingredient in an atomic reference. We are actually talking about a specific atomic transition in cesium (the hyperfine &quot;clock transition&quot;). It has a pretty high frequency (9 GHz) which gives a lot of &quot;ticks&quot; to count which gives a lot of subdivisions to time. And it is nice to work with: when an atom is in either state of this atomic transition, it stays there for a few seconds. If we tried to use the &quot;D2 transition&quot; in cesium, the frequency would be even better (350 THz) but the atom decays from the excited state within 30ns (not long enough for a good measurement). But there are atoms that have high transition frequencies <em>and</em> long lifetimes.</p>
<p>Final note: I didn't want to use the word &quot;stable&quot; to celebrate cesium to begin with. A final criterion in an atomic reference atom would be how stable the transition frequency is against environmental changes. For example, how much does its transition frequency change vs. changes in gravity, light fields, or especially: magnetic field. The cesium clock transition is first-order insensitive to magnetic field, but other cesium hyperfine transitions are not.</p>
<p>Hope that helps; please feel free to ask for more clarification!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is easy enough to get a pure sample of cesium, and only a very small sample is needed, so plentiful isn't really a problem. (If you are an atomic physicist studying, like, dysprosium that might be a different story). But all of these experiments start by buying a pure sample of the element. The real answers to your question:</p>
<p>Cesium is under hydrogen in the periodic table, which means it has 1 valence electron orbiting the stable nucleus and causing all of the physics. Rubidium is the same way. That's as simple a system as we can get; plus, hydrogen was too light to cool and trap effectively and cesium is nice and heavy. It requires about 3 lasers plus some microwaves to trap and probe the atoms and run an atomic clock. Eventually, it turned out that there are many clever ways to cool these atoms and <em>really</em> start studying their properties, and move on to more complex atoms (like those with <em>two</em> valence electrons!). But cesium is simple, cheap to buy equipment, and a convenient energy scale for humans (computers) to work with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not the stability of the atom, it's about the fundamental uncertainty in the energy associated with the transition used for the clock. There are now clocks based on optical transitions instead of microwave ones, which already are about 100 times better than traditional atomic clocks. We will probably switch to those for the official time standard at some point in the future.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That also mean.. to answer /u/hairycoo questions.. if all time-keeping devices shut down.. there is now way to set the time back to the &quot;real&quot; time.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If we consider devices that count the frequency of caesium-133 atoms as &quot;time-keeping devices&quot;</p>
<p>So while there is a definition of a second.. time as we use it in everyday life is kind of made up. That's why we have time zones, sometimes over big areas where the time is &quot;wrong&quot; on many places. Because people decided to have this time at a specific place.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You could set a clock based on the sun but I'm not sure if this could be set as exact as our current time is keeped track of.</p></div>		</li>
