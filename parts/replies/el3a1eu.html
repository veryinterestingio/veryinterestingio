			<div class="markdown"><p>A musician is a perfect example for this: Nearly no one actually '<del>knowd</del>' 'knows' the individual notes or chords they are playing. They just play the first noted and the muscle memory takes over.</p>
<p>Obviously you can still get the notes back simply by looking what your fingers want to do or listening.</p>
<p>Our brain simply has an easier time memorising movement patterns than it does memorising loads of abstract information.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An easier example of this is song lyrics. Most people that have heard a song enough times can sing along with it. Those same people, if asked to recite a specific line, typically struggle. For an even easier example, look at the ABC song. Almost everyone knows it by heart, but few can remember what letter comes after what without reciting some or all of the song itself.</p>
<p>Your brain uses lots of tricks to memorize large volumes of information. Patterns is one. Another is to commit things to subconscious memory (this is more for physical skills).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. I was talking to a singer just after the concert (it's a metal band that normally has a few beers with the people if the venue is small enough) and and one point recited an iconic line from one of his songs, he had no idea which song it came from and had to try and think. He knows the song by memory but taking one line out of Context and he had to remind himself where it was</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some people quote shows or movies they saw 10 years ago.</p>
<p>I can sing along to the two or three thousand songs on my computer but fuck no could i simply write any of them out or even quote most of them beyond a sentence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Marching band can't be a truer example of this. We barely even think when it comes to the playing. All of our focus is on marching in time and keeping sets nice. Up in pit, our entire focus ends up listening to the band, I can't remember the last time I thought about what I was playing during comps or late season practice, or even about rhythms. I can still play through an entire show from 4 years ago, just by hearing the beginning chords.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea I was in the villages marching band when I was in elementary school, with a a sideways flute, and even though we did have the sheets, I wouldn't have been able to read the notes fast enough to play, so I'd just figure out the first couple of notes, and then just go by what my fingers did. Plus keep in step obviously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea exactly. I used to play the guitar as a teenager, and if you hand me one, I'll have to just start one of the songs I still 'know' and try my way through it for a few times, and then it'll just flow.</p>
<p>Same on a piano with some simple melodies like Greensleeves. I don't know any of the notes, but if I start playing, it'll just work somehow.</p>
<p>Really amazing how the memory works.</p>
<p>Even for stuff like the phone numbers of my childhood best friend. I have to have a number block and just type it, but I don't actually know the numbers by heart. Just the pattern on the numberblock.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but thats why you are meant to learn reading the music (literally playing from the music), not watching the hands and learning patterns, and play what you read. Learning the piano by muscle memory is a good way to pick up bad habits fast. What people should be looking to learn to memory are all the techniques, scales etc. that form the building blocks of everything else.</p>
<p>Teachers who tell people to learn stuff slow just know that when you speed up you stop playing what you read, and start introducing bad habits that are much harder to lose than to learn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your answer implies that this is a conditioning thing, but it's not. The muscle memory (or procedural memory) is simply stored in a different part of your brain, one that can only express it through a series of finger movements, instead of through a representation of symbols. If you want to recall what symbols the password contains, then you have to rely on the descriptive memory to tell you what the string of letters, numbers etc. <em>looks like</em>, which is far more difficult as you're not using that memory whenever you enter your password. Your muscle memory is recalled more easily and reliably because it's used so often.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I forgot my bank account number for internet banking one time. Just clean forgot it. It was bizarre. My password was perfectly fine, but the <em>number</em> I use to log in, that I've used to log in, for years now, just completely disappeared from my head. Even my muscle memory forgot it.</p>
<p>I had to ring up and get them to read it back to me and re-learn to remember it. It was fucking weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve had a debit card with the same PIN since I went to college, and didn’t get a credit card until after I’d graduated, so for years it was just me and my debit card and frequently an ATM because certain transactions require cash.</p>
<p>Before I left to study abroad, some family members gave me the leftover currency they had in their possession so I’d have some cash while I was getting settled in. Once I had spent it all and needed more cash, I went to the nearest ATM, and as soon as I stuck my card in, I realized that for the first time in my life, I could not remember my PIN. It was a huge mindfuck having a piece of information I used <em>all the time</em> over the course of <em>years</em> just vanish instantaneously. </p>
<p>Your description is exactly what I experienced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably just a mini stroke - nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>Joking - apparently the brain occasionally repurposes neurons which are no longer triggered for another skill. The unused skill or memory is wiped.</p></div>		</li>
