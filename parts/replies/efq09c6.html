			<div class="markdown"><p>Kellogg was desperate to prevent men and boys from masturbating, and pushing for universal circumcision was just the method he eventually settled on as most workable. He also seriously considered locking male children in chastity cages on a permanent basis until they reached the age of majority, and experimented with this horrifying surgical intervention to make sustaining an erection entirely impossible:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a method of treatment [to prevent masturbation] ... and we have employed it with entire satisfaction. It consists in the application of one or more silver sutures in such a way as to prevent erection. The prepuce, or foreskin, is drawn forward over the glans, and the needle to which the wire is attached is passed through from one side to the other. After drawing the wire through, the ends are twisted together, and cut off close. It is now impossible for an erection to occur, and the slight irritation thus produced acts as a most powerful means of overcoming the disposition to resort to the practice</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But don't worry - he was an equal opportunity chastity maniac! He was also an advocate for female genital mutilation being adopted as an American practise:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In females, the author has found the application of pure carbolic acid (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenol" target="_blank">phenol</a>) to the clitoris an excellent means of allaying the abnormal excitement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>In his <em>Ladies' Guide in Health and Disease</em>, for nymphomania, he recommended</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cool sitz baths; the cool enema; a spare diet; the application of blisters and other irritants to the sensitive parts of the sexual organs, the removal of the clitoris and nymphae...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dude had serious issues. Nevertheless, America found him credible enough that his bizarre &quot;surgical intervention to prevent masturbation&quot; initiative took hold. Thankfully, it was just circumcision and not the nightmarish silver sutures thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It gets better.  Not only was Kellogg the cereal guy, but he was also greatly influenced in his philosophies on life by Sylvester Graham.  </p>
<p>Literally deadass the fucking Graham cracker man.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvester_Graham#Career" target="_blank">Both literally made boring as fuck food without any &quot;stimulants&quot; so they wouldn't have the desire to beat off.</a></p></div>		</li>
