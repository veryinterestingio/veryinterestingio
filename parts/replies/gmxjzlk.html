			<div class="markdown"><p>This may be the most talked about issue in vaccine science and policy circles lately. With different approaches taken in different countries, as you note.</p>
<p>Here in the U.S., the message from government health officials has been very clear that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines should be administered in the manner that they were tested and evaluated--2 doses, 21 or 28 days apart (depending on the vaccine)--with a bit of wiggle-room to accommodate the challenges of scheduling. But no systematic delays of the second dose in order to give more first doses.</p>
<p>We still don't have reliable data for the strength and duration of protection after only one dose. There's protection, for sure, but details are sketchy.</p>
<p>I agree with using the vaccines the way that they were studied and evaluated unless and until we've got good evidence supporting alternative strategies. There's a lot we don't know about the virus and the disease, but we _do_ know that two doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine are extraordinarily effective at preventing severe outcomes. I don't want to lose that right now, especially with new vaccines and far more supply on the horizon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you think the decision makers should be resoundingly condemned for promoting delaying the 2nd dose? Or is it the type of calculated risk that effective decision makers should be willing to consider and sometimes adopt?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I definitely don't think decision-makers or other scientists advocating for delaying the second dose should be condemned for that view. It's a very reasonable proposal given the circumstances, and that's why there are many leading voices in the medical and public health communities advocating for it.</p>
<p>These are difficult judgments to make given the limited data available, the fact that we do know one dose definitely provides _some_  protection, and we've got a raging pandemic and many many people waiting to get vaccinated. Those are all important considerations, too, and science alone can't point us to the right answer right now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, if the vaccine is substantially less effective with only one dose, could we be giving people a false sense of security? They might then socially distance less, and cause more harm than good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you know if there has been any study done on the effectiveness of using the first dose of one vaccine (eg. Pfizer) and the second dose of the other (eg. Moderna)?</p>
<p>If there was very little difference in effectiveness, I have to imagine this would make the logistical challenge of the vaccine rollout at least a small bit more manageable!</p></div>		</li>
