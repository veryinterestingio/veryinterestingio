			<div class="markdown"><p>When you get the big block fancy ice cube for a scotch or cocktail - how do they keep that ice clear?  Iâ€™m guessing there has to be a way to keep air particles from creating space between the frozen molecules? You may not know but your answer made me even more curious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing that makes ice cloudy is the formation of tiny bubbles that get locked in when the ice freezes. These bubbles form due to trapped dissolved gasses coming out of solution just as the liquid freezes.</p>
<p>I don't know exactly what kind of product you are describing so I cannot say how they are made. What I do know that ice sculpture manufacturers can create super clear ice by freezing it in a large chest that has a pump continuously stirring the water. This prevents the ice from forming a solid cap on top first and jostles all the air out of solution. Like shaking a soda bottle. My guess, the product you described is made the same way in large blocks, then cut down to size.</p></div>		</li>
