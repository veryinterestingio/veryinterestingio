			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for this answer -- re: all the other top answers in this thread, I appreciate that the reason callousing stuck around was because it was beneficial, but that's not really <em>why</em> they happen or <em>what</em> a callous is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah, just what sticks around sticks around.  It doesn't have to be useful, beneficial, or anything of the kind.</p>
<p>As long as something living can pass on the genetics before it dies, then whatever it had can be passed on too.</p>
<p>We need to retire the thinking that &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; is a thing for evolution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both are answers as to why, but one is proximate/mechanistic (properties of the body-environment interaction) and the other is ultimate/functional (it exists because it’s beneficial for these reasons). The proximate <em>why</em> is more like <em>how</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Moisturise it. A LOT! I had one on my knuckle which keps tearing open every now and then. It took months of constant treatment with dekspantenol based moisturiser to get rid of it. The actual healing started really fast, but it got smaller very slowly. It'll start to normalise from the edges.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks loads. It crossed my mind it's autoimmune, something like keratosis. I've got Type 1 diabetes so it's on my radar. I'll give that treatment a shot though, It's pretty uncomfortable.</p></div>		</li>
