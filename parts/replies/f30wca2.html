			<div class="markdown"><p>While I'm only an armchair civil engineer, I can't imagine that there's very little you couldn't do with string, a sextant, theodolite (the surveyor telescope thingy), bubble level, some metal rods, maybe a known length of light chain etc. </p>
<p>Maybe not for everyone, but maybe for you - when I was a kid there was a series of books by an architect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Macaulay" target="_blank">David Macauley</a> where he explained how they used to build things like cathedrals, mills, the pyramids, skyscrapers. They can probably be found in your local library, totally recommend you check them out. They're written for young adults so mileage may vary but they're very much Engineering like you're 5.</p></div>		</li>

But for those interested, there's a pretty decent documentary series about an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydoRAbpWfCU" target="_blank">archaeological re-enactment of medieval castle construction on Youtube</a>.</p>
<p>It's a bit &quot;fluffy&quot; with the costumes, but it does explain many of the engineering principles and techniques, as well as the logistics of medieval masonry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look up pictures of the Sydney Harbour Bridge under construction. Built in the 1930s, using surveyors connected by phone on multiple points in the harbour to guide the build out from each shore and meet in the middle...the span of the arch is 500 metres (543 yards) over water
The accuracy was so close that when they constructed  the final length in the daytime, they could wait for the steel to cool overnight night and shrink the final bolt holes into line to meet up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In machining, theres a tool called a sin bar.  It's nothing truly special - just a flat chunk of flat steel with two dowels on the bottom.  The trick is that those dowels are exactly 5.00000 inches (or 10, or 20, or similar lengths). And the bar is perfectly parallel top to bottom.  </p>
<p>Using some simple trig, you can cut whatever angle you dammed well please with it.  With insane precision in some cases.  Need an angle of exactly 10.457°?  Put 0.9075 inches of stuff under one of the dowels and, if it's on a flat surface, the top of the sin bar would be only be out by +0.0001° (so 10.4571° instead of the intended 10.457°). </p>
<p>Trigonometry and algebra are probably the most powerful tools grade and high school math teaches, and yet the ones most teens ignore.</p></div>		</li>
