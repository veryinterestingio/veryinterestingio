			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow! That calculator is spot on! Just to help show how quickly the power needed to overcome drag starts to add up, at 67 mph (my guess at an average speed for my commute) the calculator said about 234 Wh/mile. Not too far off of what I actually see. To increase the speed just 12 mph we need around 50% more power (I think that's how you say that: .5(234) +234 = approx. 350). And that's how owning this car has actually slowed me down. Having that real time feedback on my efficiency has been very effective!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Crazy... I hadn't really thought about it being 50% more, just to go my preferred &quot;slightly faster&quot; highway speed. You are right!</p></div>		</li>
