			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a point on the shore of Kaho'olawe (the &quot;boring&quot;/&quot;desert&quot; island of Hawai'i that's really dry and doesn't have much vegetation) that's called Kealaikahiki (&quot;Road to Tahiti&quot;). That always blew me away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kahoolawe was used by the US military as a bombing site. I believe it is the way you described it because of how it was used for target practice. (Back in middle and Highschool, we learned the island's nickname as &quot;The Target Isle.&quot; Hawaiian studies was a mandatory course in 7th or 8th grade, and 10th...iirc).  If I'm not mistaken, it was somewhere around the early 90s when the bombing stopped and it was listed as a &quot;protected&quot; area. (there are other parts of the Hawaiian Islands that are still being used for live fire training). Last I heard, because of what had happened, theres pretty much no longer any chance of freshwater because the aquifers had been destroyed.  It will forever be uninhabitable.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>not that far, a plume can reach 9 km, assuming you have a boat that reaches 5m height with perfect weather you could see it from 338 km away if my napkin math checks out (and it may not)</p>
<p>Hawaii was colonized from french Polynesia which are 4000 km away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you were such expert sailors and knew the waters very well (clouds, fish, bird, wave behaviors), I wonder if intuition would just tell you something big is in that direction if a volcanic eruption had occurred.</p>
<p>Maybe ignored at first, but if one of the leaders sees it as well... that could lead to eventual exploration. I don't know. Just speculating and daydreaming about it for sure, but society doubted the Polynesians for a long time. I wouldn't doubt their capacity to sense this sort of thing again.</p>
<p>edit: Added birds. Also, could you hear a large volcanic eruption if you happened to be within range?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Went back home and said &quot;we saw massive smoke plume we need more supplies&quot; or just  kept going once they saw that smoke plume.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thor Heyerdahl, did mention, that the people maybe could have seen the disturbance, an island would make in an otherwise uniform thin cloud cover. This would be even more noticeable, if there was an eruption, causing a bigger updraft wind.</p>
<p>They could have followed the &quot;track&quot; marked in the cloud cover, moving towards them, from the volcano.</p>
<p>Idk enough about metrology, and how fast turbulence dissipate, but it's an interesting hypothesis, and your thought of adding a volcano, enhance it.</p>
<p>But the gene pool disprove his theory i think, and wind direction, not sure, where he was right or wrong tbh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the theory is that a local “Polynesian King” would have fled out of necessity (war, forced exile) with as many of his wives, slaves, tribe members, animals and vegetation as possible with no intention of returning and every intention of finding a new, permanent home (As opposed to a more European “exploration” model) Meaning the first group to arrive in Hawaii would have a somewhat diverse group (at least comparable to other small island communities).  Multiple children with multiple wives over a couple of generations creates a pretty diverse gene pool pretty quickly.  Not to mention, you don’t really have to spread out past the cousin relationship to avoid the really severe impacts of inbreeding. (Not to say they are avoided but no worse than other small indigenous tribes or the Royal Family) </p>
<p>TLDR: The Hawaiian Islands were first populated by descendants of the original discoverers, not a continuous flow of settlers from other places.  (This is the theory at least)</p></div>		</li>

<p>We can even speculate how that specific body habitus was the one</p></div>		</li>
