			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the paradigm. Of the studies I cited, I would say that the lab-based effects range from medium to large, but I wouldn't actually trust those studies as much as more real-world effects. For example, the last study in my first cited paper looks at actual hiring in law offices, which shows a small but significant effect size. They don't really account for other factors well (e.g., correspondence between outgroup names and perceived difficulty of pronunciation) in that bit though. With racial names in study 2, racial minorities were 50-60% as likely to get a response compared with stereotypically White names, which is a pretty large effect. </p>
<p>I think OP's scenario would realistically be a small effect, but it's reasonable to think that it's present.</p></div>		</li>
