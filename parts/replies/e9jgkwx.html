			<div class="markdown"><p>FWIW, a better way to describe the breeding-based definition is 'generally won't breed' rather than an inability.  This can be either behavioral (the mate doesn't look quite right,) or it can be because of a lack of opportunity (the populations are geographically separated and don't come into contact with eachother.)  Wolves and dogs and coyotes and dogs can interbreed and be fertile, but generally won't.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>That said, as far as determining whether it's a new species, the biologist will generally <em>acquire</em> specimens (they kill 'em.)  If they aren't a particular expert in that type of critter, they'll generally consult with one like you mention, who has gone deep down the rabbit hole regarding some particular, small group of critters (like South American hummingbirds.)  The scientist will then go through the literature,perhaps using a dichotomous key, comparing various landmark features to existing species.  If there's any doubt, they'll compare the specimen to <em>type specimens</em> (preserved specimens housed in museums) of similar species.  Genetic information may or may not be used.  Finally, they'll publish their findings and give the greater community of [insert critter type] geeks a chance to go 'nah, dude, that's one of <em>these</em>.'</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Another requirement for extant species is generally observing populations of the critter to ensure that it's not some sort of sport, mutant, or hybrid.</p>

<p>Species is a relatively 'squishy' topic, <em>particularly</em> with vertebrates. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Wolves and dogs are the same species. Domestic dogs are a subspecies of <em>Canis lupus</em> called <em>Canis lupus familiaris</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alright, this may seem like a weird question but it’s coming from someone who has gone to natural history, science, and living museums like aquariums or zoos her entire life.</p>
<p>A lot of the species research I’ve seen in person is done through capturing and bringing back corpses of new species so there’s a concrete record. I’ve probably seen more extinct animals in jars, dried or preserved, or as dioramas than the average person. (I know, I’m that morbid person who wants to look at the Irish Elk skull or what have you)</p>
<p>Can you discuss the history of that and what progress has been made in leaving animals in situ while still identifying them as a distinct species? </p>
<p>(I’ll give you a real world example if you like- the Scottish Wildcat- it’s been hybridizing with local domestic cats and knowing what is a wildcat and what is not is getting increasingly difficult from simple observation. If that species was totally unknown and someone thought today that the Scottish wildcat was an unrealized distinct species, how would that be confirmed?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is that even modern taxonomy is still based on morphology, ie. the shape of the animal. Species identification, especially for us non-taxonomists, is done using keys, which are basically decision trees, eg, if animal has 4 sharp canines go to #102, if it has 2 canines go to #103, and keep going, splitting until you get to the species. It’s often not big things that help you decide, though.  For instance I work on fish. To differentiate between two species of leather jackets you need to look at the dorsal spine and count the whirls of tiny spines the travel up it.  Whether it’s 3 or 4 whirls decides which species it is at the final step. The juvenile fish are about 10mm/half inch long, the dorsal spine is about 3mm long, the smaller spines are tiny. You can’t really do the ID in situ, or even anaesthetise them for long enough. End result is a lot of dead fish, which once ID’d go to a museum. </p>
<p>Morphology within a species is still variable, which is one of the reasons that museums will keep multiple samples of the same species, so scientists can see the variation, or even just what the taxonomists mean when they talk about “semi-rounded 3rd rostrum barb”. </p>
<p>Genetic identification is coming along, but it’s relatively expensive, so we only use it on really hard to ID things like fish larvae, or confirmation of new species.  You still need to get a tissue sample though, which is tough to do non-lethally unless the animal is large. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any measurement that a researcher would want to take off a museum specimen could of course be taken in the field on a live animal. They can even get DNA samples. And the measurements and DNA can help identify it as a member of some existing species or as a new species. So why take samples? For one, declaring new species generally includes having a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holotype" target="_blank">cataloged reference specimen</a> in a museum. But also, without a specimen, others can't build off (or dispute) the work to understand and place that species in the tree of life. When specimens are added to collections, they also tend to have tissue samples collected so that people can sequence the specimen and look at what its DNA says about where it goes on the tree of life (or about any particularly remarkable features). So the answer to your question is that bringing samples back is about much more than identifying new species.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Microbiologist here who is currently working on writing a paper on a new species. What we do for bacteria is right after isolating, send them out for 16S sequencing. 16S is a &quot;quick and dirty&quot; way to identify what we are working with because it's a super conserved region in the genome. When we get this sequence back, we BLAST it to see what else has been sequenced it there. If it had a low match (some even go up to 97% identical), then we start looking further into it. </p>
<p>With the one that I have, we sequenced the whole genome and ran a panel of biochemical tests. We also purchased some of the bacteria that were returned as being close matches, and ran the biochemical tests on them to. This allows us to compare how close the functionalities are.</p>
<p>With the genome, what I had done is BLAST the sequence that had the 16S in it (genome sequencing doesn't just give 1 long sequence, but a handful of smaller sequences). This sequence returned other genomes that were similar but not identical, so I aligned all of my sequences to this similar but not identical sequence and found several large (upwards or 30kb) deletions which could explain the difference in function.</p>
<p>Basically we kept finding small differences and propose that all of these small differences so we have something new. </p></div>		</li>
