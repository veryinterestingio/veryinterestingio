			<div class="markdown"><p>In the early '90s I remember teachers telling us how lefties should be so grateful they didn't force them to use their right hand like schools did when they were kids. In a class full of right handed kids it sucked to be the last one to get scissors and you had to use the lefty pair. They didn't look any different other than, &quot;lefty&quot; written on the side, but you sure felt the difference when you tried using them.</p></div>		</li>
