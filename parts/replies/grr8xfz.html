			<div class="markdown"><p>Good answer. To elaborate, there are insects which tolerate freezing, and these are more rare. Most temperate insects are not freeze tolerant, but have a super cooling point as low as -40 C, and there are comparisons of different climatic conditions and the supercooling points of the dozens of species that have been studied. Insects in Temperate Continental (think Midwest America) in 3 habitats, sheltered, partially exposed, and exposed have supercooling points of -19, -27, and -34 C; note that climate change is predicted to push a warmer but drier climate, and in that zone insects have lower average supercooling points, which indicates a harsher winter. Much of that is because a drier climate has less subnivian, the area between snow and ground, which insulates and maintains temperatures around -10 C or above, even when the air temp is very cold.</p>
<p>As an insect reaches lower and lower temps, they suffer from dehydration as the intercellular water freezes This leads to higher concentrations of the chemicals, including calcium and potassium as well as proteins, and as you may know higher concentrations of these chemicals usually lowers the freezing point. Glycerol and other chemicals are produced to further reduce the freezing point. The insects I study have a supercooling point of -28 C, however they start to experience mortality at -10 C, so even though they are adapted to harsh winters, they rely on shelter like leaf litter and snow.</p>
<p>Insects which tolerate freezing are known to have proteins that are ice nucleators, and to reduce the stress of freezing these insects often freeze at relatively high temperatures, some as high as -2 C.</p>
<p>Most insects overwinter protected, either as a pupa or an egg. The flies which wake from winter slumber are the lucky few who found refuge either in the subnivian, or possibly around human disturbance. Note there is a common butterfly in North America, the mourning cloak which often overwinters as an adult. I think they probably also overwinter as eggs, but they are often the first butterfly seen in spring. They are quite large and beautiful, and it is amazing that they overwinter as adults.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Has human settlement dramatically increased the amount of insects surviving the winter then? I can't think of many places that would remain warm over the winter in, say, the US without any humans around keeping buildings heated and so on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One related factoid is that the German Cockroaches found in northern latitudes in the US started to change their taste in food compared to their southern counterparts despite being the same species, precisely because the ones in the north can only survive indoors unlike the ones in the south.  A common form of roach control product is a sweet-tasting glucose bait laced with a slow-acting poison.  In the south when this product is used and kills off lots of indoor roach hives, the next generation of roaches come mostly from outdoor hives that never bothered humans and thus were never were subject to pest control.  But in the north where the winters are too cold for there to be any outdoor roaches to replenish the population, the next generation of roaches come mostly from indoor hives lucky enough to avoid being exterminated.  And one way to be a cockroach lucky enough not to be exterminated is to happen be one of the weirdo roaches who, unlike all your brethren, happens not to like the taste of sweet things so you happened to avoid the poison bait.  After several decades of using this type of bait on roaches, we've accidentally bred the sweet tooth out of them.  But again, only in the north where there isn't an outdoor roach population to dominate the next generation when the indoor ones get killed off.  In the south, the replenishment from the outdoor population overpowers this evolutionary effect making it mostly lost in the noise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we did it might be hard to determine how that would affect their population. These flies still need to find food and a place to lay eggs or else they're just a dead end; it is possible the entire lifecycle is given a boost, say from 2 generations a year to 3, though often that is something that is variable at intermediate climates.</p>
<p>There is a recent invasive &quot;Brown Marmorated stink bug&quot; in the US Midwest that is often reported in dwellings in autumn. It is suspected this is promoting their invasion, I am uncertain if that's been shown.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aren't there also insects that lay eggs in lakes and ponds? And I would think that most of the insect population dies off, with just a few remaining each spring to start reproducing again. It's amazing high the flies in Northern Canada are worse than in the south. You'd think there would be less.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every challenge, even cold weather, is also an opportunity to avoid competition and predation. What we call &quot;trout brooks&quot; are groundwater-fed streams that run all winter, about 10 C in summer and winter. There are winter-emerging midges, Diamesa, a type of fly that lives as larvae in water, in this case they emerge as adults in the winter to mate. While the muscle metabolism in most organisms cannot work chemically below about 4 C, these insects are able to be active below those temps.
The Canadian winters certainly are a challenge but there's plenty of life that can adapt, especially as summers can be quite warm. Alpine streams are even more challenging and there are midges at high altitudes in almost eternal cold! As a limit, I believe the quickest lifecycle egg-hatch to adult is a midge that can do this in about 7 days, of course that's at higher temps. Given a year to grow in wet areas (Canada has plenty of wet areas) then a few days as adults swarming and mating, and we have a successful population. Some midges might even go 2 or more years before maturing to adult stage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer, thanks for generosity in setting this out. I had wondered this when visited the Northern Hemisphere some years ago, and staying in nice houses there were flies, I felt shocked dismayed thereâ€™d survive there, but now know why!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is raising the levels of glycerol similar to what a wood frog does for its' hibernation/suspension? I believe they utilize a sugar to replace much of their water so it doesn't freeze.</p></div>		</li>
