			<div class="markdown"><p>The top post talks about the social aspect, which would explain a lot of it too. It's a very clear, visible way of saying &quot;I'm sad, help me.&quot; When you cant communicate (like before you develop languages as a species) it becomes really important to convey your more complex emotions. Because being upset is usually caused by something pretty bad (and I imagine pre historic peoples would have had some tough skin), it's important that humans can show that something is wrong non-verbaly to warn others and to get their help.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The evolution of species-typical behavior, including crying, is messy and way more random than many believe it to be. Evolution does not select for anything in particular, nor are species marching towards an ever more advanced form with every passing generation. If that were true, we probably wouldn't need to breathe oxygen (which is highly toxic) or walk upright with our knees bending the way they do; if our knees bent in the opposite direction like a dog's hind legs, it would be way more efficient and humans would not have such horrible knee issues as we age. </p>
<p>If you haven't, check out Dawin's book on emotion; it's an even better read than his &quot;On the Origin of Species...&quot; IMHO. Lots of good nuggets in there that still ring true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is my problem. I really want to cry. Like as a man. Just have a good weep for once. But I can’t. Every time I think of something sad I end up laughing and talking to myself how silly I am. I really jus wanna have a moment of down. I don’t mean like I laugh like the joker. I just chuckle when I think of something sad. How do I do it?</p></div>		</li>
