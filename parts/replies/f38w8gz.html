			<div class="markdown"><p>Actual ELI5 translation of parent post:</p>
<p>There's a process to sneezing. Stuff that messes with your nose makes your body release chemicals. If enough of those chemicals gather, you sneeze. It's sort of like how if you pull on a rubber band hard enough, it will snap.</p>
<p>But sometimes, whatever it is that's bothering your nose goes away before enough chemicals gather to make you sneeze. That's like you let go of the rubber band before it snapped.</p>
<p>Also sometimes if you're doing something the brain thinks is very important, the chemicals won't gather. We don't really understand how to explain what the brain thinks is &quot;important&quot; yet, and we're still learning about how sneezing works. So ask again in a few years!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The “what the brain thinks is important” thing is quite interesting. Similar to how you often wouldn’t need an alarm clock before an important morning. </p>
<p>The answer to this would likely related to, and answer a lot of questions regarding conscious and unconsciousness. Would love to learn more!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well most people tend to wake up before their alarm actually goes off, and if they have any kind of meaningful activity to do that day will make a decision to just lounge around in bed vs actively trying to go back to sleep, unless it is a random ass time in the middle of the night obviously.  Others who don't really care all that much will set their alarms for the latest possible time and refuse to move until they hear it, regardless of whether they are awake or not. In this sense then it is what you personally deem to be more important.</p></div>		</li>

<p>it can be definitely seen where you tend not to sneeze when doing important things or your in the middle of something</p>

<p>Too bad our brains didn't evolve to think driving is important.  Sneezing during that shit is scary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Give it time. In 1,000,000 years, humans will have evolved the ability to <em>instinctually</em> move forward when seeing the color green, and to stay to the right when moving slowly. That is, of course, except British people who will have evolved into Homo Leftus by then.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Only if we ignore that its unlikely any human will be manually driving anything outside of a video game within the next 50 years.</p></div>		</li>
