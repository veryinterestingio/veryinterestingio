<p>Like... if you had a very very large stone/crystal, maybe you could carve it into a tetrahedral shape and it would stay.  But if you tried to just smoosh piles of sand/gravel out in space into that shape, at some size the gravity pulling from the other side should be strong enough to make it collapse into a sphere.</p></div>		</li>
