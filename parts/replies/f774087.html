			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. When I took Paleobiology in college we discussed this. The guess is between 5-10% of species have been fossilized.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I took paleogeology I asked the professor, his GF was going to the class each time to hang out with him, she was a invertebrate paleontologist and he asked her. She said, for land species, they think 3-5% have specimens that survived until now, for aquatic, 1%</p>
<p>Farther back, the worse it is</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on what group you are talking about.  This might be in the ballpark for large reptiles, mammals, or dominant vegetation but the percentage would be much less overall.  Think how many fungi and insects there are today compared to the number of fossils.  Or rare species endemic to small islands.  And all the innumerable species of bacteria and viruses that have disappeared without a trace.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also remember a figure of 0.001% but I might be missing/adding a zero...this is why I said way less than 1% for all life ever (I couldn’t remember how ridiculously small  the percentage actually is)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So this 5-10% number is for whole <em>species</em>, meaning that many entire species have never had <em>even a single individual</em> become a fossil.  </p>
<p>So the odds for an individual animal, an individual of a species, like you or me, must be <em>really</em> low, like 1 in 100 million, or perhaps lower than that...</p></div>		</li>
