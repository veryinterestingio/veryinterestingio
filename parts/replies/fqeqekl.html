			<div class="markdown"><p>I did leak testing on oil rigs, we used helium mixed with nitrogen (99% nitrogen, 1% helium). You'd then use a machine to detect how much helium was escaping from valves, flanges etc. Helium has one of the smallest molecules therefore can escape from pretty much anything. The higher your standards, the less helium you want to see escaping.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe what he meant is how they maintain the pressure? Or even if he didn't I want to know lol. Sealed at sea level is easy, but this little thing goes from sea level to outer atmosphere in like a matter of an hour.. How does it keep such delicate pressure with such violent forces going on outside the craft? How to they maintain the temp and not have it be an oven? So many questions! :)</p></div>		</li>
