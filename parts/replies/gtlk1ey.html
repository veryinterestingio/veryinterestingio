			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a process.  Tying off, raising a vein, getting the air out of the syringe, etc. Everyone is different but similar, the ritual of it though is almost religious. But as to the heat, it is a small amount of liquid, it dissipates pretty quickly in the syringe. From memory, the syringe is like luke warm almost instantly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've shot heroin that was still super hot. My arm bubbled up like someone dumped boiling water on it and it hurt like fucking hell. Generally I'd wait til the bottom of the spoon cooled down, and it usually was only a problem with thicker spoons because they retain the heat longer.</p></div>		</li>
