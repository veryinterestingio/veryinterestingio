			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on how much sugar you have. Basically, a process called <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmosis" target="_blank">osmosis </a> 'sucks' (for want of a better word) the water out of bacteria when you have a much higher solute density outside the cell than you do inside the cells. (That's why pouring salt on a slug will kill it, and also why isotonic sports drinks can help you exercise; in that case, they're designed to have the same solute content as your cells, so they don't give or take water from them.)</p>
<p>If the cells dry out, the bacteria can't reproduce and they die off without spoiling the food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with available water and osmosis.  Bacteria and molds require a surprising amount of it to live in a &quot;suitable environment&quot;.  Think of a glass of water being 1.0... bacteria needs like 0.9, mold 0.8 or so. a bowl of sugar would be 0.0something.  An apple would be 0.9 or higher... makes sense, an apple is mostly water.</p>
<p>Anyway, in a sugar rich environment where there isn't enough available water, like in a jam or honey, the sugar will attract the water OUT of the bacteria or mold cell, killing it. Same way salt kills a slug, the salt draws the water out of the slug's cells and it literally dries to death. Salt acts as a preservative in the same way - salt draws the liquid out of the bacterial cell, keeping the food fresh... downside being it dries out the preserved food as well and now its really salty so you have to boil the shit out of it before you eat it.</p>
<p>When you're fermenting stuff, you're doing so in a water rich environment, usually a tank full of liquid. So there's plenty of water to keep the sugars from desiccating the yeast or bacteria or whatever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it comes to how bacteria and most organisms takes in water. Cells take in water through the cell membrane by osmosis. Osmosis basically states that water will flow through a membrane towards the side with higher particulate concentration (particulates being salts, sugars or anything that can be dissolved by water). This however is not just one way, if somehow there is higher particulate concentration outside than inside the cell, water will be pulled out of the cell, dehydrating it in the process. Normally the cell will have ways to combat this (allowing more salts, and sugars to enter the cell to counteract) but in things like honey/frosting, it would literally have to be more concentrated in sugar than either of those things to avoid dehydrating, and that is just not possible for bacteria.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Considering how much more pourable maple syrup is, I'm guessing it's because of the water content. Maple syrup has about double the amount of water in it than honey. Both are supposed to last an extremely long time in theory, but I bet that much of a difference is enough to be the difference between &quot;mold will grow, but very very slowly&quot; and &quot;virtually nothing will grow&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah what can happen is you get some water on the surface through the air via condensation.  That thin layer of water won't have enough sugar in it to protect it and and viola... Life.  Life finds a way.</p>
<p>I've seen it with concentrated apple juice the same way.  Thats one reason why in commercial production the tanks for these things will have nitrogen atmosphere (no oxygen) because that prevents growth.</p></div>		</li>
