			<div class="markdown"><p>Do these mutations affect severity and how contagious a strain can be. Since there are so many different strains what would happen if you were exposed equally to 2 different strains. Let's say one from Asia and one from Italy. Would that maybe even create another strain. Is it possible to get sicker from being exposed to 2 different strains or sick again from different strains.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to know more about this too, but sorry for piggybacking. I know people who didn't even feel any different but were tested positive and then there are the ones who almost died because of it.</p>
<p>Is it possible that this is because of different strains or is it just the matter of immune system and other factors (differences in us, humans)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One possible reason for this is actually that Covid19 has a key to the protein CD147. I’m not sure if you have a bio background, but viruses enter your cells because they have “keys” that match “doors” that are present in your cells. Research has found that Covid19 can access your cells through the protein CD147 which is present not only in your respiratory pathway, but also in your red blood cells and the walls of your blood vessels. People with diabetes (or just higher blood sugar in general) and people with asthma produce a higher number of this protein than normal. This is likely why asthma and diabetes have been such a significant risk factor for Covid19 related death or severe symptoms. It might also explain why some patients exhibit blood clotting symptoms that have led to strokes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It comes down to how the interaction between the virus and the human body (and thus immune system). The Virus depends on specific proteins and receptors in order to enter human cells and replicate (these are the spikes on the virus). It's akin to a lock and key type arrangement. Mutations that affect that mechanism also likely make it non-infectious. By the same token, the immune system detects those proteins, and uses them to identify the viruses. </p>
<p>So yeah, you can have mutations of the virus, but if they affect the mechanism that's used to both detect and infect, those mutations are negatively selected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does it? I thought that coronaviri were unusually large (they have one of the largest genomes of any RNA virus) because they had a dedicated error-checking capacity. This proofreading code removes most of the random mutations that we expect to see in &quot;simpler&quot; viri like influenza.</p>

<p>Both of those are true, but I'm not sure they're causally connected that way.</p>
<p>It seems more plausible that they have a proofreading exonuclease because their genome is large, rather than their genome being large because they have a proofreading exonuclease.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the section dedicated to proofreading is quite large but I agree, it's likely necessary <em>because</em> it's a large genome. </p>
<p>It is however unusual in RNA viri, this is why  antivirals like nucleotide analogues fail to do anything to SARS-COV2  when they work against other viri that lack this mechanism</p></div>		</li>
