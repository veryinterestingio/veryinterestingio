			<div class="markdown"><p>It is up to the conutry postal service how they organize postal codes. The senders country or any intermediary countries does not need to know the post code schemes in the destination country. The postal code may not even have to be written in arabic numerals. It is true that most have a lot of redundancy in the address. But you may still get collisions such as two people with the same name living within the same postal code. But this is why you send the mail to the destination country first as they have a full record of all addresses and names within their country and have a much better understanding of the laungage.</p>
<p>Romanizing a name or address is also not without issues. Most languages have multiple standards for how to romanize the language. If you use a different way then what the postal service does then they might not be able to match it to anything in their database. So it is best to write the address in the language and alphabet that the destination country use and then use the standard Latin English spelling only for the country name.</p></div>		</li>
