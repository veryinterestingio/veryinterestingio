			<div class="markdown"><p>Close, we used it, and still do, to recognize and distinguish friends from everybody else. Those bacteria op mentioned are kinda like fingerprints. Each person has a unique combination of them which in turn makes a unique smell. </p>
<p>We don't really mind the smell of those we consider &quot;family&quot; for instance. We are even instinctively intruged to investigate and &quot;smell&quot; it throughly to become familiar with it. Exactly like a dog. Most social mamals share that trait. If you are interested in testing this hypothesis, next time you are about to sleep, cuddle with your mom's pillow (or even gym clothes) and note the effect it'll have on the quality of your sleep (it smells like mom is close so I'm safe)</p>
<p>So the repulsion you experience is mostly aimed at strangers. I.e Joe from accounting (which behaviorally speaking, has probably quite the opposite personality to what you are used to in your family)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, it's weirder than that.</p>
<p>Most non-primate mammals have aporcine glands covering nearly their entire bodies, which they use for everything from creating oils to keep thier coats clean, to marking territory, to thermoregulation and more.  Most non-primate mammals also have very few errcine glands- the &quot;not stinky&quot; ones humans have over nearly all our bodies.  Dogs only have them on their feet, so only thier toes sweat the way we do.</p>
<p>Why primates have their ratios of sweat glands types reversed is a bit of a mystery, but we don't just have them  in our armpits- we have them  on our nipples, in our ears, on our genitals and many other places!  As for why the armpits- again, kind of a mystery, but one theory I've heard is that they're a leftover from the earliest primates who had venom glands in thier armpits.  The slow loris still has them!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hair under your arms and between your legs acts as a dry lubricant. But sometimes that isn’t enough,  and oil would help lubricate, therefore your armpits release oil to help your arms move without friction damaging the skin, it so happens that when you move more you sweat more oil for more lubrication and more water for more cooling. Unfortunately for us in the modern world, the hairs act like little smell antennae.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if this is actually true. Many people shave their armpits and I've never heard of this causing problems like people getting an armpit burn or something, and surely if that's why the hair is there, it would make a difference.</p>
<p>And we would expect there to be hair on the upper thigh between the legs, too, where there is also friction when walking (for a lot of people anyway).</p>
<p>I just don't think that the hair does that. It may be for more effective sweating, or for pheromones/health signaling type reasons, but I don't think it protects us from friction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have this gene!   </p>
<p>I used to wear antiperspirant daily, but just kinda stopped because it doesn't really do anything.  I am the only one in my family that got this gene.  </p>
<p>It also gives you dry, flakey ear wax. Which is cool I guess?? </p>
<p>My arm pits don't smell any different than any other skin creases.  Inner thighs, under boobs... In fact, this last summer I started putting antiperspirant under my boobs to combat sweat.  But my arm pits just don't get that BO smell.  </p>
<p>I have no clue where I got the gene from, but it is kinda cool I guess.  It lets me not have to worry about getting super strength deodorant.  I just use a lemon grass infused coconut oil on my underarms.  But even if I didn't, I don't know if anyone would tell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some people clean themselves off pretty well of bacteria. Im Japanese, and I never had underarm BO after sweating until I had to borrow my samoan friend’s sweaty-soaked shirt due to being in a sort of military bootcamp and needing a shirt at that moment. </p>
<p>Of course, his bacteria transferred to me and it’s much harder to clean off etc., so I stink with his smell at times. Still trying to get that bacteria off after these many years lol. Sucks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did discover that, if you can't take a shower and have pit stank, hand sanitizer and a paper towel does a remarkable job of freshening that right up.  Because once the stank kicks in, a sponge bath doesn't do much about that soaked-in smell but hand sanitizer does.</p>
<p>Not a great deal of use for that info, though.  Camping, actually a good tip.</p></div>		</li>

<p>this comes ultra handy if you are in an emergency sitiuation like a job interview, important  meeting at work after 10 hours in and dont have the means or the time to proper wash.
just go to anypublic toilet and grab hand sanitizer rub your hands and your armpits presto.. insta smell kill and alcohol evaporates quickly so no  evidence remains</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I apply Gillette clear gel antiperspirant after every shower to my pits and crotch (the apocrine areas).  I have never had to smell the odor pf bacteria poop again for many, many years.  Even if I skip showering for one or even two days, by the third day STILL no rank stank, and although I certainly can smell sour sweat on my body it’s stank free pits. (I don’t skip showering very often, though.)</p>
<p>Anyway, I swear by this stuff.  It’s also* great for the soles of your feet every once in a while. Apply liberally, then put on socks. If your shoes are stinky, apply liberally again to the bottom of your socks, then wear the shoes.  Magic. Stankless shoes. </p>
<p>Chemistry kills stinky bacteria. Amazing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I use antibacterial soap on my pits every time I shower and it very effectively cuts down on the instances of offensive pit odor. Definitely don’t take oral antibiotics for this though as that will just weaken your immune system and not do anything about the bacteria on your skin. </p>
<p>A dermatologist would also not recommend using antibacterial soap regularly on your skin as in general your skin microbiome is a healthy part of the organ. Antibacterial soap is a scorched earth approach that just nukes all the bacteria. Anecdotally, I have been using it just on my armpits for at least three years now and haven’t had any issues (rashes, skin breakdown, infections).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is also absolutely terrible for your body and the environment. I hate to tell you this, but your improvement is most likely very short lived. By using antibacterial soap you are killing good bacteria that compete with bad bacteria getting a foothold. You are also exposing yourself MASSIVELY to athletes foot or other fungus, in your armpits. Your bacteria compete for resources and best out fungus. With you doing that for so long, your skin can no longer be protected from fungus because antibacterial soap does jackshit against fungus. Your self treatment is honestly an insult to your bodies natural systems and you should just try to be an adult about odor that I guarantee is not that bad.</p></div>		</li>
