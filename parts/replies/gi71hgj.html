			<div class="markdown"><p>A common one is the heat capacity. </p>
<p>You start by slowly heating (or cooling) the substance while measuring the amount of energy used to heat it and the temperature. </p>
<p>Graphing this, a sudden spike in energy used to heat with a very small temperature change indicates a phase change. </p>
<p>This is used extensively with polymers and liquid crystals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>State is more of a descriptive term, used to define different regimes of behaviour of a material, then one with a hard, absolute definition. Yes, any physical property can be used to distinguish states, I'm not sure what you are asking with the scale of a state of matter. Do you mean the scale of the material or the scale of the measurements?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Any scale at which you can measure it, and convince Reviewer 2 that it's legit.</p>
<p>Physicists in general love phase diagrams.  <a href="http://ganesha.phys.h.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~sakagami/dir/ToOkamoto/Theraulaz/phase%20diagram%20of%20data-driven%20fish%20model.pdf" target="_blank">For example, consider <strong>Figure 4(b)</strong>, in which a phase diagram is assembled for simulated fish behavior</a>.  In this case, it's based on the &quot;alignment&quot; and &quot;positional&quot; parameters, also defined by the paper in question.</p>
<p>Whether or not it counts as a &quot;state of matter&quot; is more of a philosophy question than a scientific one.  The point is to characterize something interesting happening, by quantitatively different behavior occurring in different situations.  The word &quot;state&quot;, however, is used extremely widely, to express the.. well, state... of a system.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For instance in water, if you subject it to very high pressures and the heat it, you won't see the phase change from liquid to gas, it will be a continuous change between the two.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Curious what this means in terms of what we observe. If we were watching this process of putting water under extreme pressure and then heating it, what would we actually see happening inside the container?</p></div>		</li>

<p>As an example of a property we don't usually equate with state change, superconductors have a specific superconducting state.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can this be any physical property? Like when a ferromagnetic material is taken beyond its Curie temperature, can you call that a state change?</p></div>		</li>
