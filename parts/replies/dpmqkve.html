			<div class="markdown"><p>DC can absolutely trigger muscle spasms. TENS machines do this without the use of alternating current. Instead all it takes to trigger a muscle is a pulse of high voltage. Using an inductor with a 1.5volt flashlight battery, there is enough DC voltage possible to make the muscles of a half dozen people holding hands, all jump when the battery is tapped on the other side. For instance using a step down transformer as an inductor. They usually operate on AC, but if you use a battery, connecting the battery charges one half of the coil like an inductor, and then stops, but when the battery is released, there is a spike of voltage sent to the other side of the coil, at higher voltage if the step down transformer is used backwards. </p>
<p>The damage DC does depends on several factors, but it's just as dangerous as AC. A switch tech took it upon themselves to replace defective batteries in a DC UPS. This was no small APC box though, and was instead one of the pallate sized battery arrays used to power an entire switch room in the event of mains failure. While removing one of the batteries, he dropped the wrench he had used to break away the battery cables, and the wrench shorted. The metal wrench went incandescent and then molten in the blink of an eye. If it was your hand on that wrench, reflexes or push back would not have helped you. </p></div>		</li>
