			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on:</p>
<p>You read that graph starting with your starting elements and moving towards your products. In fusion, you're moving right; in fission, you're moving left. Hopefully that's not counterintuitive.</p>
<p>The binding energy comes from mass. This means that 1) the sum of the masses of the protons and neutrons isn't the same as the mass of the nucleus (the nucleus is lighter than it should be), which means 2) that the change in the mass defect) is what gets turned into energy at the end, using a very obscure formula: E=mc^2.</p>
<p>Finally, the fact that iron is at the top of the peak means you can get no net energy from fusion nor fusion. This is why stars have iron cores.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And an iron core kills the star pretty quickly. Once it can no longer fuse nuclei it loses the energy need to resist gravity and collapses. Very big Ka-boom-boom</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, does this mean that planets, which usually have a core made of an alloy containing metals with a mass number around iron's or something similar, could have possibly arisen from stars? And that the fusion of the star resulted in a somewhat stable iron core which is then bombarded with space dust, asteroids, etc. until it eventually forms a planet? Then depending on what materials reach it? For example, other stars that explode, releasing atoms which are partway in the fusion process, like lithium, carbon, etc?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So does the star actually lose energy when it starts converting Helium?  Or does it skip Li, Be, and B and start creating Carbon directly?  It seems like there's so much less energy at those levels that it's not even worth it for the star.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I should start and say that I'm a chemist and former Navy nuke, not an astronomer nor astrophysicist.</p>
<p>That said, beryllium is why the universe still has stars. It's very hard to fuse and stay fused, so there's that. If helium just went to beryllium-8, then that would be the end of the star. Be-8 has a stupidly short half-life, so it would decay. Luckily, the energy of Be-8 is nearly the same as C-12, so it's energetically favorable to have three He-4 atoms fuse to make C-12. I believe some of the lighter elements like lithium are made when the star goes nova. </p>
<p>Also, though I haven't seen anybody mention it here, I figured I'd mention the Farnsworth Fusor. It looks really cool, and any hillbilly who says they built a fusion reactor has almost certainly built this. It was made by the same guy who invented television (and is one of Ohio's Representatives to the US Capitol building statuary collection), but it takes more energy to keep going than it makes.
Still looks cool as hell at any rate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Deuterium-to-Helium fusion produces energy.</p>
<p>The Helium then fuses into Beryllium but Be-8 doesn't last long.  If left to it's own devices it almost immediately decays right back into a pair of Heliums.  The only thing that stabilizes it is fusion with another Helium nucleus into Carbon-12, which is stable.</p>
<p>That's why it's called the <em>Triple-Alpha Process</em>.  Three Helium nuclei (alphas) add up into a Carbon.</p>
<p>Every subsequent fusion reaction -- at least the dominant ones -- are similar, in that they consist mainly of an alpha capture.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This graph will also explain to you why people like nuclear fusion so much</p>

<p>Well, one reason. Other reasons include the fact that hydrogen is much easier to obtain than uranium, and at least in theory it can produce less radioactive waste.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was reading about the new ITER fusion reactor which is estimated to produce 60 tons of nuclear waste because essentially everything that's in the actual reactor site (inside the concrete shielding walls) will be highly radioactive. That's roughly two years of nuclear waste from a 1 gigawatt fission reactor uses and ITER isn't even supposed to generate electricity and at most it produces 0.5 gigawatts of thermal heat for 20 minutes. </p>
<p>The more I read about fusion the more I realize that it still has it's drawbacks. If we can make a fusion reactor that's theoretically never going to wear out then that would be fantastic, but if they have a short life span (even decades) then we're going to generate huge amounts of nuclear waste.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that I said &quot;in theory&quot;, not with current fusion technology. proton-proton fusion does not create a neutron stream, but it requires much higher temperature and pressure than deuterium-tritium or deuterium-deuterium reactions, so isn't really being pursued right now. More promising is research into better materials for absorbing the neutrons that are less radioactive and/or produce radioactive material with a shorter half-life, but again, we aren't there with existing technology.</p></div>		</li>
