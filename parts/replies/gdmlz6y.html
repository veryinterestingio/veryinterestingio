</blockquote>
<p>Yep and <em>remarkably</em> quickly as well. If we're totally confident in the safety profile of a mRNA vaccine we could theoretically go from sequencing a specific Coronavirus (like SARS) to a vaccine in under a month. It took us 25 days to get the first medical batch of vaccine produced for the current Coronavirus (and then of course like 9 months of testing).</p>
<p>Over time we should get pretty confident with the approach and then this will look a lot like the flu vaccine, which is produced yearly in anticipation of major influenza strains.. except even faster. Probably much faster. Possibly in just a few days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suspect they will still have phase 1/2 trials to ensure safety and appropriate dosing, just expedited if we have known vector safety. The problem is that any change in the mRNA (and produced protein) could have a risk of autoimmunity that is not entirely predictable, though as our modeling of human proteins evolves, that risk should diminish.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So why wouldn't we be confident in the safety profile? Are there some possible long term unintended consequences that we may be overlooking?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>No.  The flu is an extremely special case.  It's almost the only known virus with recombinance.</p>
<p>We aren't altering the vaccines.  We're recombining two vaccines, one for each flu half.</p>
<p>Besides, in general, you're not going to want an altered existing vaccine, you're going to want a new one.  It's more work to modify an existing one, where you have to meaningfully alter a random chemical to do a different thing, than it is to make a new one, where you either summon a new chemical from an immune system or build one from scratch that isn't full of weirdness.</p>
<p>Yes, you could alter new vaccines.  You just wouldn't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The common cold isn't a virus, the common cold is the symptoms associated with your immune system fighting an upper respiratory virus. Because your upper respiratory tract is the easiest way to for a virus to get into your system and spread back out again, they're super common. There are over 200 viruses that cause the common cold. Of these 200 viruses, 4 of them are coronaviruses.</p>
<p>If you're confused about &quot;isn't a virus&quot; vs &quot;the symptoms,&quot; it's sorta like how AIDS isn't a virus, AIDS is the symptoms associated with having no T cells, which is typically caused by an HIV infection. Or how falling doesn't hurt you, it's the sudden deceleration at the end that hurts.</p>
<p>We'll likely never have a vaccine for the common cold. Developing a vaccine for any of the 200 or so viruses that cause it wouldn't be particularly hard, and maybe there will be vaccines for the 2-3 most common ones someday. But developing 200 mostly unrelated vaccines - I doubt it.</p></div>		</li>
