			<div class="markdown"><p>When I go home to my parents house (in the country, with more trees, grasses, pollen attacking me) my allergies flare up.  But there are plenty of people that live there year round, that aren't bothered by them.</p>
<p>Humans don't all react the same to the same chemicals.</p>
<p>My allergies are &quot;safe enough&quot; for me . . . I'm just a bit more miserable than the average person who goes there.  I would think it the same for the pool.  She might be affected more, but it's still within the range of 'safe for humans'.</p></div>		</li>
