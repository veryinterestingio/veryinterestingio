			<div class="markdown"><p>That is an interesting and important question. Cardiologists, specifically exercise cardiologists, have spent decades debating this question. The take home message is that different countries have made different choices. In Italy, all competitive athletes are screened regularly by imaging (echocardiogram) and EKG. In the U.S., screening is usually limited to family history and physical exam, although certain organizations, like NBA, screen more. The trade off is that in a large, diverse country like ours, if you screen everyone you lead to overdiagnosis and eliminated athletes from sports unnecessarily. And it's expensive. In reality this is something that's debated at almost all cardiology meetings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To detect something like ARVC, the typical hospital EKG/ECG uses 12 electrodes to map electrical currents across the chest. You're likely familiar with an EKG trace; a real diagnosis is a set of these traces overlaid, and superimposing them can tell you a lot about which areas of the heart are working at what times.</p>
<p>Apple's implementation uses a single electrode, and rather than shielded cables adhered with conductive gel, you're using the person's arms and whatever conductivity your bare skin has. You won't get traces anything like the hospital EKGs.</p>
<p>Sometimes, though, quantity makes up for quality. Perhaps ARVC has qualities that make it possible to find likely candidates with frequent 1-wire low-resolution EKGs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is your response only for screenings to detect ARVC? Many organizations in the US are advocating screenings, as done in Italy, for all youth in order to detect HCM and other possible cardiac issues. Overdiagnosis vs. the risk of undiagnosed HCM, for example, that often manifests initially with death does not seem like a fair trade-off. Personally, I would very much like to see the US require screenings for all youth.</p></div>		</li>
