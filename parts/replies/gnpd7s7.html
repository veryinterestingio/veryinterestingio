			<div class="markdown"><p>Assembly was my favorite class in CS, but the majority of people in there (including my husband who was an excellent coder in 3rd and 4th generation languages) hated it because they never could grasp it. To me, it was pure elegance. Done right, it wastes zero computation cycles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's debuggers and other tools. Debuggers are great but sometimes they couldn't be used in the OS or some exits. There's tools like sliptraps that can be used for specific purposes( when a program attempts to modify this address take a partion dump) but sometimes they generate too much overhead.</p></div>		</li>
