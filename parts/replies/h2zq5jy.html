			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the fundamental reason that waves seem to be coming into shore from the perspective of a person on the shore.  The waves are bent toward the land as water becomes shallow and the waves slow down from friction with the bottom.  </p>
<p>The waves out there in the open ocean are just moving in whatever direction the wind and current cause them to move.  All of those waves will, eventually if not stopped, find shore somewhere, so as a general thing, only waves heading toward a particular shore end up at that particular shore.  The other waves are moving in a different direction so will end up at a different shore.</p>
<p>A bit silly to think that waves moving in another direction will end up coming in where you (the viewer) happen to be.  That isn't the direction they are moving, so they won't arrive.  Only ones already heading there will.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your first paragraph is mainly correct but one minor point -- waves do not slow mainly from friction from the bottom, they slow because in shallower water the water pressure under the wave crest is smaller, reducing the driving force that moves the wave forward (for this reason, in shallow water the wave speed is proportional to the square root of the depth).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is interesting.  I always thought it was drag that caused the retardation.  Good to learn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So you’re saying it’s actually a sorting effect. Every wave goes in one direction and so if you stand at one edge, all that you observe will be waves travelling in your direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>sort of, yes.  Waves are going everywhere, although there are preferred directions because of winds and currents.  We can only see those waves which come in this direction.  They will grab a wedge of the circle via refraction toward shore and give the impression that those waves were all moving in one concerted direction when they were not, but instead were in a larger spread (coming form different &quot;starting&quot; locations but ending at the same general spot). Most waves though are going somewhere else.  We only see a small portion of all waves.</p>
<p>Just to add, imagine being a small island.  Waves on the north shore seem to come from the north.  Waves on the south shore seem to come from the south.  Well, clearly, the ocean isn't flowing directly at that island from all directions, so there must be a &quot;sorting&quot; (using your word) of waves so we only see those which are headed directly at the island and only hitting the island if they come from somewhere that hits the island if they move that way and that way only, and not all waves are heading at the island.  They come from everywhere out there, but only some hit here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks I really like this explanation. I wonder if it is the dominant effect over what others are saying about the wind usually blowing from sea to land.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Storms do pick up energy over water, think hurricanes, and they follow pressure systems giving them direction. Waves are formed by windspeed + duration and then they get directed towards shore based on the bathymetry of the ocean floor. </p>
<p>This refraction is also why some waves even along the same shoreline can be considerably bigger/smaller and vary from one another. It’s all based on the variances in the bathymetry of the ocean floor, especially closer to shore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you’re familiar with refracting light at all, you can use these principles to figure the direction of the wave. As the water depth gets shallower towards shore, the wave still has its same energy, but less depth to transfer it through. This is similar to a more dense medium for light (index of refraction). </p>
<p>When something is refracted, it’s speed is slowed down and it bends towards the “normal”, which in most cases would be directly towards shore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The wind coming from the sea to land is often what is called a sea breeze which is caused by air rising over the hotter land and sucking in air from over the colder ocean water.  Sea breeze usually dies at night and is also fairly localized to the shore, waves are built by 3 factors; wind strength, time and fetch (distance over which wind blows), a sea breeze only gives you one of the 3 things needed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This, I think, is the real answer to OP's question ... why do waves seem to come towards inshore ... it's because these moving bodies of water hit shallower land which increase pressure and slow thst body from the bottom up, if that same body of water is moving into deeper water, the energy dissipates and does not get forced up into a wave. </p>
<p>Tldr: deep to shallow makes wave, shallow to deep does not</p></div>		</li>
