			<div class="markdown"><p>You're the person to ask this: I've heard that the effacacy of vaccination, the tri-valent ones, with 3 strains, is only about 14 percent. That the strains that are picked are only similar to what presents in a given year, enough to offer antibody production protection, about 1/6th of the time. </p>
<p>Does that number mean anything to you? Do you have more current numbers?</p>
<p>Please, and thank you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Efficacy varies by year. Last year quadrivalent was 40%. That would mean trivalent was lower (almost by definition since it simply doesnt include one strain) but there's no way it was only 14%. I belive the actual number is only about a 6% relative difference using last year as an example. It can be worse depending on if the wrong B strain is included. That's why you always get the Quad. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do you make sure that you get the quad? From a consumers perspective, there seems to be no choice in the matter. You go into the pharmacy, you ask for the flu shot, they administer it without much discussion and you leave.</p></div>		</li>
