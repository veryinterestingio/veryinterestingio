			<div class="markdown"><p>I had an organ transplant about a year ago and I was told that I can't have raw honey for the same reasons that small children can't. I was told that pasteurized honey is ok as long as it hasn't been open for more than a few days. (Hooray for single serve packages!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to be quite brutal with the pasteurization to eliminate the spores of Clostridium botulinum. For a certain elimination, you probably need a pressure cooker and well over 100C for a significant period of time. I imagine that won't be good for the honey. </p></div>		</li>
