<p>Now if you use digits on your other hand to keep track of how many times you count to 12 on your first hand you can have 5 groups of 12 before you run out, letting you count to 60 using both hands.</p>
<p>Which brings us to how the ancient Babylonians used Base60.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Many in India still count on their fingers using their thumb and the digits of their fingers, instead of a finger at a time like we do</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a programmer so I understand the concept of different bases. Intuitively though, I think it would take some practice for me to learn to count in Base 60 on my hands. I guess it all comes down to what you are used to doing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There is no limit if you count motions and store data in your head because then you can do successive operations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sexagesimal, or base 60 is usually counted as follows: 1 tip of pinkie, 2 middle of pinkie, 3 base of pinkie, 4 tip of ring, 5 middle of ring, 6 base of ring, 7 tip of middle, 8 middle of middle, 9 base of middle, 10 tip of index, 11 middle of index, and 12 base segment of index finger. Combined with the other hand, multiplication can go up to 60 (5x12).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I started with the left hand, using base pinky as 1. Counting with the fingers on the right to expand the base. It's pretty intuitive and now makes counting on my fingers feel like caveman stuff. Weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read a theory that nine and new are similar in many Indo-European languages because for a while they didn't count past 8. The number nine would start a new series of four so nine would be the &quot;new&quot; number. Then there's the remnants of base-20 counting, mostly in French, but eg English has a <em>score</em> meaning 20.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I couldn't tell you. I only know that from a teacher I had several years ago, though I have no idea why I remember that.</p>
<p>EDIT: I would assume one would count with the palm up, just because it's easier, but again, I'm not sure.</p></div>		</li>
