<p>Basic thermodynamics. Go to openstax.org (a site created by rice university to offer free textbooks for 1st and 2nd year classes) and look at their thermo book. You can get steam to crazy hot levels, called superheat (though technically any steam above the boiling point of that water at a <em>given</em> pressure can be called superheated). When steam is superheated at atmospheric pressure, it's hot as shit (at least above 100C) and can definitely be heated to a point where it can set all sorts of shit on fire. It is invisible, and any steam you see is condensing steam or wet steam, not legitimate superheated steam. And like I said before, this is at a given pressure. You could lower the pressure and boil water at room temperature, 25C for example, and then have superheated steam at 30C that doesn't set fire to anything, but is just lukewarm to the touch. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If a pipe was leaking superheated steam, how would you detect it? I'm assuming you'd see a loss of pressure but then would you need to go in with something like infrared cameras to actually find the leak? Or would it be easier to just shut off that area until it cools down enough for it to be visible steam coming out?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The advice I read once for finding a pinhole leak in a steam system:</p>
<p>Walk very, very slowly through the area, waving a broom in front of you. When the bristles are sheared off, you've found the leak.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If superheated steam is leaking into air, it will cool and eventually condense into the air. So you would see the cloud a short distance from the pipe if enough is leaking.</p>
<p>In a large steam plant, you probably wouldn't see much of a change in pressure in the piping (unless it was a sudden failure). Control loops at the boiler/superheater are working to maintain the header at the desired temperature and pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In places like power plants where they have very high pressure steam, I've heard of using a stick with a ribbon to find leaks. High pressure steam escaping through a small hole can slice right through you. You hold the stick out in front of you and pass it around the pipe where you suspect the leak. If the end of the stick or the ribbon falls off, there's your leak! If it falls off while you're walking, you stop walking immediately.</p></div>		</li>
