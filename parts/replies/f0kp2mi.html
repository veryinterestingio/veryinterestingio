			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure you know this, but one should really <em>not</em> use Beowulf as an example of Old English. It is not only pretty early Old English (as opposed to more common late Old English), but it is also poetry and is written unusually to begin with. Prose such as Canute's Address is much better and is even ever so <em>somewhat</em> understandable.</p>
<p>Aside from that, one of the difficulties of both Old English and Early Middle English is that their orthographic systems differ from Modern English, often significantly. If you rewrite them to match how <em>we</em> would write the same sounds (or as closely as we can), they are <em>far</em> more understandable.</p>
<p>But, yes, from a spoken perspective, you will probably not understand anything easily from before the Great Vowel Shift, though you would probably already have difficulties understanding spoken English 200-300 years ago, though you'd be able to catch on or figure it out.</p>
<p>One major difficulty is the loss of the original English second person pronoun <em>thou</em> and its declensions. That is still common in Early Modern English, but it is gone now, replaced by <em>you</em>. While one would figure that out simply because they are likely familiar with it, the pronoun set overall is a bit different and it would make parsing the spoken language far more difficult...</p>
<p>And that assumes that you can make <em>yourself</em> understood in order to converse.</p></div>		</li>
