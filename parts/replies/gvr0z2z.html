			<div class="markdown"><p>The CO part is good information too for anyone wondering why we don't just set a bunch up all over earth and remove the excess carbon dioxide. It can definitely be done, but then we're just stuck with an even worse gas. For Mars it's important though for future exploration and even bases. A constant source of oxygen there would allow fuel to be made and obviously air to breathe. Of course it does send the CO out, but since we can't breathe there anyway it doesn't make much difference. By the time we were doing it enough there to be a problem it would mean we've thoroughly mastered local space travel and hopefully would be advanced enough to have a better solution. One problem I could see would be if life were found on Mars. There would be a serious ethical dilemma with even adding a small amount of our own pollution</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we are able to supply hydrogen, then it is relatively easy to convert it into methanol - a useful rocket fuel. </p>
<p>This process is one of the building blocks of many Mars colonisation plans for this reason, <a href="https://sbir.nasa.gov/SBIR/abstracts/98/sbir/phase1/SBIR-98-1-04.03-0890B.html" target="_blank">eg</a></p></div>		</li>
