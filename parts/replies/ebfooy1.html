			<div class="markdown"><p>If I'm not mistaken, a declaration of war has to come from congress. Last time that happened was for the war in Afghanistan in response to 9/11. (Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong on that.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Afghanistan did get approval from Congress, but technically that was still just authorizing the use of force as a police action.</p>
<p>The last actual declaration of war by the U.S. was WW2 in 1942.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on this, the President is authorized to mobilize the military without Congressional authorization for up to 60 days, after which Congress must approve the action or the troops be withdrawn; however, the intentions to mobilize troops must be communicated to Congress within 48 hours of them having been mobilized. This was established by the War Powers Resolution of 1973.</p>
<p>The current military actions being conducted in the Middle East were initially authorized under the Authorization for Use of Military Force against Terrorists, originally intended to give the President the authority to direct movement of troops against Al Qaeda and the Taliban regardless of their location in international borders, but has since been extended to include ISIS and other terrorist groups, since the wording of &quot;against terrorists&quot; was vague enough to allow it, despite the original authorization having nothing to do with them. Congress has been trying to fix this loophole but also allowing actions started under its vague scope to be completed, but doesnt seem to be getting anywhere.</p>
<p>Fun fact, the US has only officially declared war 5 times (1812, Mexican-American, Spanish-American, WWI and WWII). The Civil War was never declared, because doing so would legitimize the CSA as a sovereign nation. Korea and the 1st Gulf War were UN Coalition police actions (still needed congressional approval for extended use of force). Vietnam and the current &quot;War on Terror&quot; are congressionally authorized use of force.</p></div>		</li>
