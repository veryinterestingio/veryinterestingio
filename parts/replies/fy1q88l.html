			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that's correct. I should have said any <em>pitched</em> sound. Unpitched sounds like (some) percussion, machinery, or noise will not have harmonics.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Good explanation.  I would relate this to having a few of the same instruments being played at the same time; the effort is found with playing in tune with each other.  It may be apparent that tuning an instrument is hardly perfect, still yet.  However it is within harmony where we find a balanced vibration which resonates in a positive manner within the listener(s).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that not ALL of the tonal content of a human voice is harmonic in nature. If you look at a spectrogram of voiced sounds, you'll see some spectral peaks that don't shift with a rising or falling fundamental. These, I believe, would be due to resonances in the oral/nasal cavity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those resonances are still harmonic tones, they're just louder ones.  The only non-harmonic content is consonants, saliva noise, vocal fry, etc.</p></div>		</li>
