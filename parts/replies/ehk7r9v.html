			<div class="markdown"><p>Planes flying at cruising altitude can be tough to locate though because the sound takes so long to reach the ground. You hear where the plane was 30 seconds ago, which at cruising speed means you start looking for the plane about 5 miles behind where it is currently located.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep it's the echoes that cause the problem. Plus it's usually a lower frequency sound which makes it even harder to determine direction.</p>
<p>Though fighter jets are absolutely impossible to find just by sound if they are flying reasonably fast.</p>
<p>You can hear the sound in the east, while the plane is already somewhere in the west.</p></div>		</li>
