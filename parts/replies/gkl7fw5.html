			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh, so it's about as hot as an oven. That's really crazy, as that doesn't SEEM that hot, but I've heard that the heat is what prevents them from continuing further?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn’t seem that hot, but considering it’s at a temperature where water is probably evaporating to quick, and they’re drilling through possibly really dense and hard material that needs the drill to have a form of cooling, and that the drill itself is only heating up exponentially due to the pressure and low oven type heat, all adds up to a really difficult situation to overcome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you're drilling a hole that deep, the hydrostatic pressure is so high that the water in the drilling mud can't exist as vapor. The major issues are just over heating of the diamond or tungsten carbide cutters and grease failure if you're using a roller bit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problems don't stop at how the machinery doesn't like heat. The rocks get a little softer with the heat and the pressure on the sides of the hole is <em>ginormous</em> so keeping the sides of the hole from squishing in on the drill bit and shaft is a major problem, too...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More than that, the people who were doing the drilling also said they had to stop because the stone was getting (for lack of a better word) gooey, and was binding up the bits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also only 12km of a thing more than 6000km thick. </p>
<p>If you were to measure the depth of a mosquito bite it would be deeper in your body than how deep we have dug down</p>
<p>I'm explaining that poorly but yeah. It's a tiny tiny fraction</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know this is bit off-topic, but what stopped them to dig deeper than 12km? Layer of hard rock? Heat? Or even something else?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heat and soft rock... Like...so hot and under pressure the rock is more like brownie batter but also very hot, so you can't really get anywhere anymore because the rock just flows in around the tool until it's gummed up and overheated</p></div>		</li>
