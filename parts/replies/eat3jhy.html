<p>Haha, that would have been ridiculous. It was 6 AAs. I wish you could fit 6 C batteries in there, then maybe it would have been playable further than 6 feet from a wall outlet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I swear there was something from that era that took 6 C batteries. You're right that there's no way they'd fit in a game gear. I looked up ROB and he only took 4 AA. </p>
<p>I found it, I was thinking of those portable CD Players and boomboxes that had a giant battery compartment that could hide a secret stash of chocolate or something.

<p>Since space and weight weren't a big constraint with boomboxes, they typically took the largest widely available battery size, D.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Here's a clip of Homer making a replacement for AAA batteries by whittling down some Ds<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>The economics answer works for far more cases as well. Why waste time manufacturing multiple cell designs when you can use one repeatedly and perfect that one. If a manufacturing defect occurs in one small cell it will cost less than one in a massive cell and will not waste as much material.</p></div>		</li>
