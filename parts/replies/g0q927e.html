			<div class="markdown"><p>Those little spots are basically like bruises. When you hit your nail, a little pocket of air can get trapped between the nail and the nail bed. At least that is how they explained it to us in esthetic school.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An interesting one that's never been a concern for me is that I have a nail that periodically has a dent in it.</p>
<p>My middle finger on my right hand will just now and then produce a flat point on the nail which proceeds down my finger as the nail grows and then is removed when I trim them. It doesn't hurt and it's not particularly noticeable (it's not discolored or anything) so I've never really thought much of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing people should be aware of is if you have a black vertical line in your nail, and it wasn't the result of an obvious injury, get that checked out. Could be cancer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like the root to a plant, without it nothing would grow. When that gets damaged, as pointed out by another commenter that had it happen to them, it will ‚Äúcopy‚Äù that damage out as the nail grows. Imagine its a 3D printer installed in our finger, if something clogs the printer on one side, the whole print is going to look wonky on that side.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My nail once got half ripped off, but it came off (out actually) at the cuticle instead of the end you clip or file down. I had to wait for the rest of it to grow off while the new nail came in once the cuticle healed. Point of the story is the damaged lunula caused the new nail to grow back with a ridge in it, kind of interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got the end of my finger smashed open by a rock when I was kid. The skin on my fingertip was hanging by a thread. The doctor actually stitched my fingernail back on to stimulate growth. It grew back mostly normal. There's a little indent on my cuticle where the stitch was and an indent on my nail where the scar is, but other than that it's fine. Great doctor, 10/10 would recommend.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can't really see it on the lunula. It's like a bunch of fractures that go all the way down the nail. The nail usually splits at the top from wear and tear, so I just have to keep it short. Otherwise, it doesn't bother me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had to remove 90% of my big toenail after dropping something heavy on it.  It tried to heal on its on, but the nail was growing between the dead nail and the dried blood.  So I was able to remove everything down to the lunula, because that hurt too much.  So now I have a permanent indention across there.  My nail grew back normal tho üôÉ</p></div>		</li>
