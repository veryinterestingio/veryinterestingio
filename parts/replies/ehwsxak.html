			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, or even a friend. I usually just end up recommending books I've enjoyed and think they might like because the question of choosing (even apart from all of the pressure to impress) is hard in itself</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if you're asked the question but don't care about what they think? I always find it harder because if I know what the other person likes I can pick something I like of a similar genre. If I don't know/care about their opinion then I have all the books I've ever read to pick from and how the hell am I supposed to just pick one?</p>
<p>I don't care what you as a random faceless internet commenter thinks of me and my taste in books but I couldn't tell you my favourite book right now, only what I'm currently reading.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I would have a hard time picking my absolute favorite book too, but without a lot of pressure I can easily name off dozens of books that I like.</p>
<p>We are talking about the situation in which people completely lose the ability to name books that they even like, and that is caused by stress.</p></div>		</li>
