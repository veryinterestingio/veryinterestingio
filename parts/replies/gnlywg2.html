			<div class="markdown"><p>Here is a pretty good article. So there was some wind generation taken down but overall wind/solar are generating slightly more than expected usually for this time of year.</p>

<p>Basically every generator type got hit bad, wind and solar just stood up better, longer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's part of it too, yes.  Also, coal and nuclear plants are having problems, because both use water systems to boil water to move through turbines and then condense it again.  Texas plants don't have as good of systems to control the temperature of the condensed water heading into the boilers to make sure it's able to boil at the correct rate, so some of those plants are hampered despite having a ready supply of fuel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That isnt really correct for nuclear. Least the one i am familar with the water enters the &quot;boiler&quot; at over 450 degrees. It is more sub systems are having problems with freezing. You have tiny instrument lines and they get frozen. Some of those lines can control trip instruments and trip equipement off because it senses a low or high due to the line being solid. Still there is only 1 of 4 nuke plants in texas offline right now. </p>
<p>The gas plants are having similar problems and also are more exsposed. Last one i was at had some pipes burst due to the cold and it wasnt near this cold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ll also add that a lot of folks here have the 2-in-1 heater/AC units which require electricity. But the heating part here is significantly less efficient than the AC part, to the tune of the same unit using 2-4x as much power to heat than it would use to cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.fplblog.com/does-running-the-heat-really-cost-three-times-as-much-as-ac/" target="_blank">The simple answer to your first question is yes, because heating uses more energy, it does cost more to run the heat in your home than it does to cool your home with A/C. ... In fact, it can take up to three times more electricity to heat a home than to cool it, which equates to a higher bill.</a></p>
<p>I’ll also note most people don’t have furnaces or heat pumps. They’ve for the AC with a heating element in it. Article also clearly states that. </p>
<p>Edit: most people in places with mild winters like southern Texas. I’m on of the folks with an AC that relies on the heating element.</p></div>		</li>
