			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm the same sometimes, for different reasons. On my way to a DnD group, it's 2hrs there and 2 hrs back. GOing there it's still light, but going back it's always dark since we finish just before midnight. Audiobooks make it just bearable. I don't know how americans survive.</p></div>		</li>
