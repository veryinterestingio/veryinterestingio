			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference is we know when this filthy reposter is going to strike next - 10 years from now.  So we have plenty of time to come up with a solution.  We could try to outlaw reposting, failing that we could just fall back on the old &quot;find and murder&quot; strategy, an oldie but a goodie</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I sent in my spit sample to 23andMe. Once analyzed, I learned that I have 309 neanderthal variants in my genes which is more than 92% of other 23andMe users. The highest count is 397. However, for all that ive got, the neanderthal genes only make up 4% of my overall dna.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can also tell you if you have any traits associated with Neanderthal DNA. For example, it tells me I have a Neanderthal trait associated with having reduced back hair, and indeed I don't have any except a couple of stray hairs.</p></div>		</li>
