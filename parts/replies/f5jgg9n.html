			<div class="markdown"><p>There are many kinds. SSRIs and SNRIs and tricyclic antidepressants are mood lifters, anti-epileptics and neuropathic inhibitors slow nerve impulses and have a variety of medical uses including depression treatment, alpha and beta blockers can be used to keep your brain calm while you sleep, and newer treatments like TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) attempt to alter and improve how your brain communicates with itself. </p>
<p>Depression is an extremely vague term. There's manic depression, major depressive disorder, depression linked to anxiety and/or PTSD, borderline personality disorder, paranoia, etc, that may all read as depression from your perspective. You have to go a doctor and get diagnosed, and then you basically start trying things, letting them settle, and deciding if you feel better. If one doesn't work, you wean off of that and start again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are so many types and no way to tell which ones will work. If you are able, try and mention your issues with a doctor. I had vivid dreams that would bleed into reality for years before a doctor told me it was due to a mental health disorder and not something everyone done went through. Thankfully we found some that worked through trial and error.</p></div>		</li>
