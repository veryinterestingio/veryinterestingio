			<div class="markdown"><p>Would you happen to know how long these vaccinations will last?  And whether or not going through 1 process of the 2 shots could still pay off years later?  I think I saw something about how skipping something like a flu shot might not be so bad if you had one in the past, it’s just not as effective as being up to date on your flu shots, but also not as ineffective as never getting a flu shot ever...</p>
<p>I could be totally wrong on all of this, I’m just trying to learn more about this stuff and more times than not, I’m trying to take some of the comments of anti vaxxers and find counter arguments/sources to their misinformation whenever possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Influenza is a challenge to compare, since the virus changes dramatically on a regular basis around the world. Compound that with the concept of &quot;original antigenic sin&quot; and the whole flu vaccine comparison goes right out the window.</p>
<p>Suffice to say that elderly people and those with risk factors should get the flu vaccine every year - especially since it's more or less free. It may not be completely protective, but it's (probably) no harm, either.</p>
<p>As far as the Covid vaccine goes, I expect there to be some level of protective antibodies for 3yrs+ <strong>if you get the booster</strong>, at least that's the case for other vaccines using similar technology in model species.  Probably more like 3mos if you don't get the booster. The inverse question is how long they'll be protective against a slowly changing virus. I expect we'll probably need a modified booster in the winter, and then some sort of modified booster yearly for a few years. Will everyone need to get them? No, but probably the same people who should get an annual flu shot will be better off getting a Covid booster. I'd guess they will probably work on formulations to include covid in the annual flu shot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So to some extent, the 2 shot process with the Covid vaccine could sort of be enough, until you factor in those that are at higher risk which at that point, you might want to get boosters after the initial vaccine, the higher risk you are?</p></div>		</li>
