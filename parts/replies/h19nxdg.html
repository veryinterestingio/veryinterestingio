<p>I'm now imagining the new Top Gun movie having Tom Cruise just flying in a straight line, pushing a button, and jets around him are just blowing up lmao Not even dogfighting just firing rockets. I realize even with these kind of rockets dogfighting is still a lot more complicated than that, it was just a funny image that popped into my head.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder about that, if two similar stealth fighters , both flying along undetected at range eventually come close enough to be seen on radar, irst, or visually would that result in a dog fight? I suspect at some point, stealth will be normal amongst NATO, Russian and Chinese fighters, and so will sensors that minimize the abilities of stealth will be good enough that dogfighting will return.</p>
<p>Shooting beyond visual range means the target gets more time to detect and evade. Plus you burn off the missiles fuel which could mean the target could possibly fly out of range. And rules of engagement often require visual confirmation of target.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to rain on the parade, but that was air combat in the late 80s. F-14 Tomcats (the fighter in Top Gun) were developed to deploy the AIM-54 Phoenix missile system. It's published range was something like 100 nautical miles but if I remember correctly it was more like 180nm. It had on board radar target tracking and guidence. The AWG-9 radar system on the F-14 passed target information to the missile until sometime after launch and then on board systems took over. The AWG-9 system had a range of about 400 miles and could lock a target nearly that far out. One of the main ways we kept the Iraqi air force out of the first Gulf War was by flying heavy F-14 patrols and locking on anything un identified in Iraqi air space before they even knew we were out there.</p>

<p>A modern AIM-9X for example can be given targeting data from the planes radar or helmet mounted sight prior to launch and can track a target up to 90° to the sides (of boresight), allowing pilots to shoot at targets without having to point their own planes nose even close to it.</p>

<p>and thats just what unclassified, official data says. Actual capability is most probably higher than that still.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Classified information is normally very specific. Entire capabilities normally wouldn't be classified. Instead, individual numbers like the total engine burn time, fuse detonation time, or turning radius might be classified. You'd be surprised just how much is public knowledge, especially with older weapon systems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Classified information is very limited and specific. It's done this way so engineers can work on things without security clearance. In a case like this, it might be classified at what range this is effective.</p>
<p>For a good example, I worked on simulating nuclear weapons and their results on the battlefield. They gave us the models and enough information to simulate a nuclear weapon, but there was a set of co-efficents that were used in the model. The co-efficents were from real test data, but told they were really old declassified data (pre-1960, but didn't tell us the test or date). The real numbers would give very different results (like yeilds 1000x what we were seeing, but that's just a guess based on what's publicly available).</p>
<p>The other issue is if you use classified information to create anything, that thing is now classified too. Which means classifying too much can lead to mountains of classified paperwork that gives an enemy no useful information, but creates a lot of work around handling/tracking that data.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Patriot missile in the first gulf war is a prime example. Bullshit claims from the manufacturer. US military insists they're accurate even when everyone can see them failing to intercept scuds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way the old ones worked was really amazing. Today we think just take an input and program the computer to move surfaces to follow it. But back then they had complex systems where a heat source moving from the center of a photoreceptor would cause a voltage change, and the voltage change would cause control surfaces to move.</p></div>		</li>

I mean these days a 15 year old can program a heatseeking algorithm with a raspberry pi and a thermal sensor, which has zero development cost. Back then you had to make protypes, fire them, build new ones an nauseam till you had something that works reliably.</p></div>		</li>

slits or rotating discs in front of a single sensor to control the voltage based on the orientation of the source.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the next part that makes it interesting, &quot;the voltage change would cause control surfaces to move&quot;. Modern devices insert a microprocessor and software in between those two steps, which makes it easy to process the input and send any arbitrary output control signals you want. But the old systems had to find ingenious ways to directly relate the sensor inputs to the control outputs, using only analog circuitry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but digital electronics has programmed logic to guide it. Back then they had to design analog systems to do the same thing. </p>
<p>The old stuff just fascinates me. Like fire control computers today. Feed some sensors into a program and sort it out. But back then they perfectly machined cams and discs to represent the appropriate multiplication and logarithms. Input the data and the movement of all of those pieces would continuously provide a firing solution.</p></div>		</li>
