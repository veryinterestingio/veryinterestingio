			<div class="markdown"><p>After writing all that I should note: I am not sure how much of what I've detailed is legal if you don't own the computers or TVs involved, but I'm guessing there's some law it violates. I'm not advocating this or any other action explicitly, merely exploring possibilities that exist; if you do this and go to jail it's not my fault you listened to a random dude on the internet. :)</p>
<p>In the aggregate that's definitely difficult, but boomers inadvertently gave millennials the tools to do it: in the 90s they lobbied for Clinton to pass legislation to get TV shows rated and chips put into TVs to block certain ratings or channels.</p>
<p>It also lets you set parental control passwords so that they can't just undo it, in the event that your parent is a particularly technologically inclined boomer-trumper.</p>
<p>and as for computers, if they're on any sort of windows system you can go into c:/windows/system32/drivers/etc/ and open the hosts file in notepad, then follow the guide in that document to redirect sites like foxnews and breitbart or whatever else to some other IP address (127.0.0.1 if you just want it to go to nowhere, as that's the loopback IP, but you could find or make IPs that redirect to like MSNBC or something. Or if you're really clever about it, get CSS from Fox News but display articles from CNN or MSNBC or something.</p>
<p>I'm getting complex here, but the basic idea is that on an individual basis, you can save your friends and family with a basic intervention and some tough love.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a low effort response. </p>
<p>Fox has pushed a narrative that benefits a select few stakeholders at the expense of society as a whole. Their message uses divisive language to cultivate a hatred and fear against the other side. </p>
<p>The rest of the mainstream news channels do it now, but this behavior was mainly driven by ratings. Fox started fear mongering to push an agenda and the others followed suit to try and keep up. They all need to go if we are going to see a true fundamental change in our partisan divisions. </p>
<p>Getting rid of one side or the other would destroy the feedback loop, but getting rid of the conservative side could benefit the most people. If we got rid of the liberal side we would still be better off because we would break up the gridlock, but the country would be run by a bunch of xenophobic racists who reject science.</p></div>		</li>
