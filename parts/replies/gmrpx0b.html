			<div class="markdown"><p>We also don’t have a robot capable of mining space rocks or the required technology and infrastructure to both get it to said space rocks and to ship it and its cargo back with aforementioned space rocks. Even if we developed that tomorrow the amount of time it’d take to be commercially viable is staggering. Also I don’t think we actually have a use for space rocks specifically yet and we’ve got a ton of ore right here.</p>
<p>Not to mention the extremely low probability that I’ll ever be in a situation where my body specifically is dying independently of my brain <em>and</em> anyone with the competency and equipment is on hand to extract my brain and place it into this nonexistent robot; regardless of whether I can actually pilot the thing.</p>
<p>Fuck you’re right scrap the whole idea crew I was a fool to dream</p></div>		</li>
