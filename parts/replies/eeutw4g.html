			<div class="markdown"><p>I have dyslexia. My first language is Dutch, and I have a very hard time writing gramically correct Dutch sentences (I do know the grammer rules). Formulating gramatically correct English sentences on the other hand is much easier for me. Don't know why, but I feel so much more confident in writing in English compared to Dutch.
So I would say learning a second language when you have dyslexia is no problem. Of course it takes some effort but I don't experience the same difficulties. Correcting mistakes you have made your whole life in your primary language is much harder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im similar to you but english is my first language</p>
<p>And ive always found myself to have an extraordinary affinity for other languages. Like, german for example is just english for dyslexic people.   Cryillic languages as well are very smooth for me</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have to disagree. My native language is Portuguese - I have difficulties writing it correctly, but no problem expressing myself. Then I learned English -  no problem. Then I learned German and everything went to shit. Now I cannot communicate well in any language: I unlearned English, I have difficulties finding words in my native language and my German has not improved (even though I`ve been living in Germany for the past 10 years and use it daily). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s really interesting. Do you think your confidence in English grammar is because of the English language in particular, or is it because it’s a second language in general?</p>
<p>Just as an aside, I don’t think I would have guessed that English wasn’t your first language, so I’d say your confidence in your grammar is well-placed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes I think it is because it is English. Not because it is my second language. The english grammar is just way easier compared to the Dutch grammar.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't believe I'm dyslexic, but can do this very well.</p>
<p>If I can see it, hold it, or get a visual picture of it's shape/parts, I can sort out how it works and comes together. </p>
<p>I can't look at a rubrics cube and remember what color is in what spot to save my life.. </p>
<p>But I can mentally understand how the mechanism works and how the parts slide between eachother. </p>
<p>It makes be actually pretty good at fixing things because if something doesn't work I can figure out pretty quick what's causing a bind or jam or what's broke to cause an issue by visualizing how all the parts come together and work. </p>
<p>I also blame ADHD for some of this. </p></div>		</li>
