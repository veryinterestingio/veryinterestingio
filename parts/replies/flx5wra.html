			<div class="markdown"><p>Close to it. There is a small electronic circuit with a small set of components connected to the crystal that makes it vibrate when powered. The battery also powers the counting circuit, to keep track of time passing.</p>
<p>To develop a bit more, the way it usually works is that a quartz crystal deforms when electricity is applied to it (this is called piezoelectricity). When you cut the power, the crystal returns to its original shape and produces electricity while doing so. The circuitry around it is built to keep that back and forth motion going on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a more technical description: just applying electricity doesn't make the crystal vibrate, it just makes it constrict a bit. However, if you give the crystal electric impulses matching its mechanical resonant frequency (think the way a metal rod sings if you hit it - it vibrates on its mechanical resonant frequency), the crystal will start vibrating intensely, like how you can speed up yourself on a swing by periodically moving at the right moment. As the crystal returns to its normal size it gives off an electric impulse (like stretching out a rubber band and then using that energy to fire a ball of paper) which goes to an amplifier that makes it stronger. The amplifier's output gets branched off into the counting circuit and also back into the crystal to keep the swinging going at just the right rate (positive feedback loop).</p>
<p>To start off the entire shebang without the crystal's positive feedback already giving you the right pulse frequency, the amplifier first just outputs wide frequency band random noise if there is no proper input signal from the crystal (this is a usually undesirable design issue in most cases but this time it helps), some parts of which hit close enough to resonance to slowly start up the &quot;swing&quot;. The oscillator will reach stable operation in &lt;0.1 sec (usually much less but extra breathing room is usually given before the frequency is trusted as accurate), specifics depending on the given circuit.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, stupid question time:</p>
<p>If the quartz crystal has to be given electrical impulses which match its resonant frequency, then how does the oscillator do this job with the correct periodicity? </p>
<p>Who times the timers??</p></div>		</li>
