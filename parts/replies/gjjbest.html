			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the most epic roasts in history involves a Roman politician insulting another because he didn't dilute his wine like a person of culture and instead got shit faced like a filthy plebeian.</p>
<p>EDIT: I don't have the exact source at hand. But for those of you curious enough to ask, search for Cicero's works on invective. Dude elevated public insults to a form of art and wrote extensively on the subject.</p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks to /u/almalexias for reminding me of the correct source. See <a href="https://www.bartleby.com/268/2/15.html" target="_blank">here</a>, composed shortly after Cesar's murder, after Mark Antony accused Cicero of being the brains in the conspiracy against Cesar. The whole thing is a diss track against Mark Antony, but paragraph 26 is the epic description of Antonius drunkenness. Unfortunately Cicero never actually delivered the speech to the senate but instead distributed copies among his friends.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iirc, the ancient Greeks used to top up their enormous wine “jugs” with water as the wine was drunk, so the wine became more and more diluted as the evening went on, probably helping to prevent hangovers in the process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However, we will say nothing of these things, which are acts of a more hardy sort of villainy. Let us speak rather of his meaner descriptions of worthlessness. You, with those jaws of yours, and those sides of yours, and that strength of body suited to a gladiator, drank such quantities of wine at the marriage of Hippia, that you were forced to vomit the next day in the sight of the Roman people. O action disgraceful not merely to see, but even to hear of. If this had happened to you at supper amid those vast drinking cups of yours, who would not have thought it scandalous? But in an assembly of the Roman people, a man holding a public office, a master of the horse, to whom it would have been disgraceful even to belch, vomiting filled his own bosom and the whole tribunal with fragments of what he had been eating reeking with wine. But he himself confesses this among his other disgraceful acts. Let us proceed to his more splendid offenses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even today many people outside the US dilute their wine. I lived in France 30 years ago and saw a lot of that. Kids drank wine - but it was mostly water. And adults did the same when drinking wine at lunch.</p></div>		</li>
