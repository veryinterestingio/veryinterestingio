			<div class="markdown"><p>This is basically correct. The brain itself does not have pain receptors (nociceptors), so it is not direct injury or damage to cerebral structures that produces headaches. This is why we can perform awake neurosurgeries on many patients without them experiencing significant pain from the manipulation of brain matter itself.</p>
<p>To elaborate: headaches can be caused by various abnormalities that affect structures both within the skull (intracranial) and outside the skull (extracranial). Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Abnormal vasoconstriction (a spasm and constriction of the arteries) or inflammation around the brain's coverings (the meninges) can produce significant headaches. This may occur in conditions such as migraine, meningitis, and loss of cerebrospinal fluid (as may occur after a lumbar puncture/spinal tap). Irritation of the meninges by blood can also cause intense pain (e.g., after an aneurysmal rupture with subarachnoid hemorrhage).</li>
<li>Congestion of the veins (or venous sinuses) or disruption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow around the brain can cause dull headaches, again most likely because this leads to excess pressure on the meninges. For instance, this type of headache may occur if a venous sinus becomes blocked by an abnormal blood clot (venous sinus thrombosis). Obstruction of CSF flow can also occur when a tumor or mass compresses one of the CSF pathways in the brain, which may lead to a condition called hydrocephalus (though this is not always painful). Imbalances of CSF production and absorption may also produce headaches if the pressure inside the head builds.</li>
<li>Spasm of the muscles in the scalp or neck is the probable cause of most tension headaches, which are probably the most common kinds of headaches. These classically feel like a squeezing &quot;band&quot; of pressure around the scalp and may be provoked by stress or other stimuli.</li>
<li>There are other interesting types of headaches that are not quite as fully understood but may be related to disease of the cranial nerves (the nerves that supply sensation to the face and other structures in the head and neck). This is true of trigeminal neuralgia and, according to some sources, cluster headaches.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like that you mentioned veins.. but I don't like that you began by saying that the brain doesn't have nociceptors. In my understanding, blood vessels (including those in the brain) generally do have nociceptors. To me, that's the most direct explanation for many headaches, throbbing sensations, etc. That sensation can be life-saving, and so it also makes sense from an evolutionary standpoint that the nociceptors in those vessels are preserved.</p>
<p>I'll continue with what I wrote first before editing - basically just dealing with communication issues when discussing this (defining the terms and any relevant philosophical concerns):</p>
<p>For clarity, I think this is a case where it's helpful to be pedantic and define what we're referring to here when we say &quot;the brain&quot;. Looking at the responses so far, it seems that everyone has assumed that when we say &quot;the brain&quot;, we're talking about just the cells in the brain that are unique to the brain (aside: from a philosophical standpoint, looking at it this way almost ensures that we'd say it lacks capabilities that the rest of the body has -- such as sensing pain. I'm guessing there's at least one catalogued logical fallacy and/or rhetorical technique at play here). However, the brain has some other stuff which isn't unique to the brain (i.e. the unique cells are the neurons and glia). Namely, the brain contains blood vessels.. and blood vessels do have nerve endings (at least I thought so, and a quick Google search seems to confirm it -- I don't see why it'd be different in the brain). So in my mind (pun not intended), the brain does have nerve endings, because its blood vessels have nerve endings. It seems like no wonder that the nerve endings within the brain's blood vessels are able to transmit information about their conditions, including pain.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That statement is correct. However, for the sake of an ELI5-level explanation, my response was meant to convey that the central nervous system parenchyma (cerebral neurons, glia, etc.) does not receive nociceptive innervation. </p>
<p>Though perivascular innervation does exist and likely does contribute to headaches, this is thought to arise from the peripheral nervous system. See <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK53087/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK53087/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK53087/</a></a> for an overview of the innervation of the cerebrovascular circulation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does sound pretty horrifying, doesn't it? However, many patients actually do very well with this. And if the choice is between undergoing awake neurosurgery and potentially suffering severe neurologic deficits, plenty of folks choose the former.</p>
<p>As a side note: in many awake neurosurgeries, patients are only awake for brief key portions of the procedure, and they may still receive very light sedation to keep them relatively relaxed. And it's important to select patients for these procedures very carefullyâ€”you can't easily perform an awake craniotomy on a young child, on a neuropsychiatrically impaired individual, on a severely anxious or claustrophobic patient, or on someone who's critically ill.</p></div>		</li>
