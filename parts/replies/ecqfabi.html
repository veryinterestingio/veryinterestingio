			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely! I was just showing my husband how Google photo recognizes our 3 year old daughter from birth to present. It’s facial mapping at its creepiest and most fascinating. As adults , it just needs to map one face, but a child it’s tracking growth. </p></div>		</li>

<p>As an aside, my friends like to joke because I say &quot;let me look in my Google photos&quot; but the haters don't know what they're missing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Drive has a 15gb limit and is separate from Google photos unlimited storage. Photos gives completely unlimited storage for PHOTOS, but videos start to add in towards your 15gb drive limit. You will NEVER run out of Google Photos space.</p>

<p>Google can advertise &quot;Unlimited space&quot;, most people will only use a fraction of it.</p>

<p>A fraction of unlimited is still unlimited. Unless you are into fancy Group Theory stuff, I think...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They also use the photos to run through their AI software to improve their image recognition stuff. Just like those CAPTCHAs we constantly have to do &quot;click all the stop signs&quot;, etc... is us helping google's image recognition software get better by crowd sourcing object identification in photos by real humans.</p></div>		</li>
