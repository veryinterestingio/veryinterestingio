			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem you lay out is provable. If you divide even numbers by two or add one and divide by two for odd numbers, you will always get to one.</p>
<p>For any positive integer number greater than 3, adding 1 then dividing by 2 is less than the original number.</p>
<p>Now, in your process, you either divide by 2 or you add 1 and divide by 2. Either way you end up at a smaller positive integer number. You are repeating a process that produces smaller numbers over and over in a finite set, so it has to bottom out at the minimum, which is 1.</p>
<p>The conjecture above is interesting because multiplying by 3 first before adding 1 guarantees that the result will be larger, so one half of the process increases the numbers size while the other half of the process decreases its size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regarding your last paragraph, I think the explanation is that the larger increasing (x3) part can never happen more than once in a row (an odd number x3 +1 will always be an even number), but the smaller decreasing (/2) part can happen several times in a row (16&gt;8&gt;4&gt;2) making the decreasing side potentially much larger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a nitpick (and question), but wouldn't it be an inferiorly limited infinite set rather than a finite one?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When doing 3x +1, don't you have a 100% chance of getting an even number? And when dividing by 2, it's only a 50% chance of getting an odd number.
So you have 50% chance of  *3 and 100% of /2 for the next number. On average you would have 75% of your initial number.
Or am I missing something?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not sure entirely, but I think the purpose is a comparison of operations of similar magnitude. Multiplication and division by roughly similar numbers, applied in turn, don’t necessarily need to converge, whereas comparing addition and division, division would overwhelm the addition, converging to 1.</p>
<p>The terminal condition for both of these algorithms is n=2^x. Considering your algorithm, you add 1 whenever the number is odd, then divide by 2 to whatever new number. This obviously trends to smaller and smaller numbers, until eventually landing on some 2^x which may be 2 itself.</p>
<p>The action of multiplying by 3 offsets the (essentially) monotonic decrease in value, making the result more dubious. In addition, 3 is chosen because it is the next highest odd integer (1 is trivial, 2 would result in another odd number ad infinitum).</p>
<p>The only exception I could potentially see is that for some number n, applying this algorithm m times would result in n again, forming a cyclic path. If you can prove that this never happens, AND that the number will eventually be some 2^x that should suffice a proof.</p>
<p>Also sorry for the whole thesis; I just woke up and got inspired haha</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have extremely limited understanding of anything at all about this problem. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erdős" target="_blank">Paul Erdős</a> (one of the most brilliant and prolific mathematicians of the 20th century, perhaps of all time,) said about the Collatz conjecture: <strong>&quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture" target="_blank">Mathematics may not be ready for such problems</a>.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>It has virtually <a href="https://youtu.be/O2_h3z1YgEU?t=205" target="_blank">no application outside of recreational mathematics</a>.  </p></div>		</li>
