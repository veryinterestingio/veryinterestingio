			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Itâ€™s like having the TV on while watching a movie on your iPad and having a conversation in person while listening to the radio and texting with someone all at the same time. And trying to have any of it make sense. </p>
<p>Or like going to a sports bar and watching all opening day football games at the same time and trying to astatine track them all</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Am on the spectrum. Most of my family is not. I have noticed they are basically dead to the world. People move around the house and they do not track it. They do not keep track of people and situations around them in public. They don't know where shit is, even if they have reason to. If they're doing something, they don't notice you approach. Half the time you have to make multiple attempts to get their notice.</p>
<p>A few years ago, my brother watched me walk outside, plunge my hand down through a foot of snow, retrieve a piece of wood. He did not understand how I knew it was there, even though we'd had snow for at least a month. I did not understand how he could forget about it, just because he wasn't looking at it. It's like they don't mind their surroundings at all. What do they plan on doing in case of an emergency? They don't know where exits are, where supplies are, how to keep themselves safe. Seems dangerous, to me. No reason not to keep track.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's just funny because you're on the spectrum talking about neurotypicals, the way that neurotypicals talk about people with a disability. Really makes you think of the word disability, when oftentimes it really is just differently-abled. Some additional challenges, some additional perks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep being able to instantly recognise what is different in a room, a letter that has arrived or a bag or a pair of shoes which has moved it seems obvious that you would notice it, but not for most people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It worries me how many people are out there in the world driving around while completely tuned out, or walking near roads while again having zero situational awareness. The world is full of these unaware zombies, people who will see you coming from a mile off and still step out in front of you and shit like that. How the NTs survive I've no idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was passenger in a friends car, and he got distracted changing his radio whilst driving. Ended up driving up onto the curb and berating his passengers for not letting him know he was not driving strait.</p>
<p>There really are people like that out there.</p></div>		</li>
