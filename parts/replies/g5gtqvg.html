			<div class="markdown"><p>Both are possible. The likelihood will depend on the amount of material that was transferred between Earth and Venus and the probability that the organism both survives the trip and can thrive in the new environment. Because Venus is closer to the Sun, it will be easier to get material to Venus than from Venus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that really true though? It takes about the same amount of energy to go to Mars and Venus, slightly more to Venus from earth. I have heard that it actually takes more energy to get closer to the sun than to the outer planets, counter-intuitively.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your reply. I think my explanation is indeed mistaken.</p>
<p>Here is an abstract by Melosh &amp; Tonks (1993, <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1993Metic..28Q.398M" target="_blank">http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1993Metic..28Q.398M</a>) that claims the exchange between Earth and Venus is roughly equal. Mars receives very little, and its ejecta are sent to both Earth and Venus. I would need to read more about this topic before commenting any further.</p>
<p>I hope this answers your question.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's insane. Does that mean there's a slight chance that our ancestors were originally from Venus, technically speaking?</p></div>		</li>
