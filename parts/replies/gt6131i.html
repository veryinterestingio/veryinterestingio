			<div class="markdown"><p>Consider a cloud of gas (mostly hydrogen) in outer space.</p>
<p>There are a few forces acting on the gas. There is the self-gravity of the cloud (the gravity it exerts on itself) trying to bring it together, and there is thermal pressure trying to push the cloud apart. If the cloud expands it will cool down causing the thermal pressure to decrease. If the cloud contracts it will heat up increasing the thermal pressure. When the force of gravity and the thermal pressure are equal the cloud will just sit there neither growing nor shrinking.</p>
<p>But the gas can radiate away energy through thermal emission. This cools the gas, making it shrink. The denser the cloud gets, the stronger the force of gravity gets. Also denser gas can radiate away energy at a higher rate than less dense gas. This makes a run away process where at some point the thermal pressure of the cloud will never equal the force of gravity. The cloud of gas enters &quot;free fall&quot;, collapsing in on itself. If we know the original size, mass, composition, and initial temperature of the gas we can figure out how long it would take the gas to collapse down to a single dense object. This is the &quot;free fall time&quot;.</p>
<p>We can calculate this with simple assumptions like a spherical cloud, with a uniform temperature, and density, and a constant rate of energy loss. This simple model will not be entirely accurate, but it does give a good estimate of how long it will take the cloud to collapse and start forming stars. You can do this with a small cloud that will form a single star, a medium sized cloud that will form a globular cluster, or a large cloud that will form a single galaxy. For any sized cloud of gas in space you can calculate a free fall time.</p>
<p>A galactic free fall time is the time it takes a large cloud to collapse and form a galaxy.</p>
<p>We can make the calculation simple to get an approximate free fall time, or we can add more and more complexity, like the gas can both emit and absorb and then remit light. These calculations can get very complex and astronomers have massive computer codes to calculate the most complex configurations.</p></div>		</li>
