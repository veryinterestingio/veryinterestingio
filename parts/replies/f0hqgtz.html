			<div class="markdown"><p>In regards to the small script part of your answer, I would like to ask this follow-up: wouldn’t most AI’s have a fairly limited number of responses (for now) if we implemented it today? The only thing that may be weird is if it doesn’t know what you are searching for on the web or something. Like if you asked Google to show you pictures of Éowyn, it could have a hard time with that. But the canned response of “I can’t find that right now.” would be pretty easy, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not a viable approach. Words are pronounced differently depending on the sentence, and as you mentioned, there's an insane amount of combinations already. Sure, it would be less complex to implement. But complexity isn't everything. I know that I'd rather work on an interesting problem for a year and end up with an imperfect voice that can say anything, rather than spending a year recording myself saying canned responses and ending with a very specific set of sentences than a voice can say, in a more human way but less understandable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a segment in CBS' &quot;Scorpion&quot; where they had Cabe say out the phonetic alphabet so they could recreate a vocal pattern. <a href="https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x50usfd" target="_blank">The clip is here, if you would like to see what I'm referencing</a> (Skip to 20:52). I know this is TV, so it's going to over exaggerate what is possible and how, but still I ask anyway: Would something like this not work, eventually?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that's actually a thing that some assistants do sometimes</p>
<p>i know for a fact that cortana has some real human voicelines for things like &quot;who made you&quot; or &quot;sing me a song&quot;, google assistant has that too but i honestly can't tell if it's ai or a human</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wrong. Once you train it using a lot of speech, you can use it to say almost anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends, typically deep fakes are run tons of times against one specific clip. You can see a recent example from corridor digital where they deepfaked Keanu Reeves into a fight scene.</p>
<p>But yes, you could run it against tons of speech until you get a general solution</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't true, it's only the model generation that takes a ton of time and computing power. When I last checked a consumer GPU could render 1 minute of DeepFake video in about 15 minutes. This is a actually within the realm of realtime possibility for companies like Google, Amazon, etc. A server with an array of Tesla V100s, or even better, Google's TPU could output that in real-time. The voice is already rendered in the cloud with current versions (because phones are too slow and can't hold the massive data set/model size), so this could easily be implemented with today's tech.</p>
<p>But if the last few years of machine learning progress are anything to go by, then within a year algorithm improvements will have it running in real time locally on a cheap phone.</p></div>		</li>
