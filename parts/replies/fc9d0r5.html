<p>For molecules at Jupiter's cloud-tops (ammonia, methane, water, etc), this is true.</p>
<p>However, no one has ever taken a spectrum of diamonds on Jupiter. Some scientists suspect the deep interior contains diamonds based on ab initio calculations (simulations from first principles of carbon's behavior at extremely high pressure and temperature)...but we have exactly zero observational evidence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right...the problem here is we really don't know how carbon behaves at the temperatures and pressures of Jupiter's deep interior. </p>
<p>Note we're talking around 5 million atmospheres of pressure and temperatures around 10,000 C. Is carbon a solid at that point, like diamond? Is it a carbon liquid? Is it a supercriticial fluid? We simply don't know the answers to these questions, since we cannot get anywhere close to those pressures/temperatures in the lab, so scientists try to make intelligent guesses based on what we can observe and extrapolate from there. Maybe it's diamonds. Maybe it's not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's amazing that this can be done from so far away. How can we be sure that the diamonds are raining down, as opposed to sitting on the surface, or floating in the atmosphere? And how can we be so sure of this? Like, how does the diamond's light spectrum not get mixed in with that of other sources, like from the planet surface or from elsewhere in the cosmos?</p></div>		</li>

<p>We can't be sure. </p>
<p>The whole &quot;raining diamonds&quot; thing is only an unverified prediction, and not supported by any observation - spectroscopy can only tell you what's on the visible surface, in this case Jupiter's cloud-tops. </p>
<p>The prediction is entirely based on an assumed &quot;equation of state&quot; (EOS), an equation describing how matter behaves at the temperature and pressure of Jupiter's deep interior. Bear in mind that there are several competing EOSs for Jupiter's interior right now, and only one of them predicts diamonds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a misguided question but cannot explain why without explaining how spectroscopic lines work. Rest assured the theoretical diamonds would not interfere with the data in this way.  </p>
<p>In fact, if they were to interfere they would (might, since they are not a gas) have their own line, carbon crystals with a (cubic?) structure that, again, may or may not have its own spectral line(s). This interference would in fact prove the <strong>theoretical</strong> diamonds existence.</p></div>		</li>
