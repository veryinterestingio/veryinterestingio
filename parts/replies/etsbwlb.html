			<div class="markdown"><p>Mercury in pure form is just a fairly dense, inert metal. You can't digest it like you can't digest gold if you swallow it. You need to absorb it in some way. You will only absorb trace amounts if you eat it. </p>
<p>This is why Mercury fumes are much more dangerous than Mercury itself, because it's interfacing with the capillaries in your lungs and entering your bloodstream. </p>
<p>The real deadly stuff is Mercury in a form that can be absorbed like dimethylmercury. Read the story of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Wetterhahn" target="_blank">Karen Wetterhahn</a>, she died after a few drops got through her gloves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which movie? In any case, maybe the Chinese records aren't very trustworthy? Aren't there like 5 emperors who are considered legendary, so their historical accuracy is disputed? It's almost like the Greek Odyssey. It may have some traces of truth but it's probably a lot of grandiose fiction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh shit. I broke a thermometer as a kid with my cousins and we played with the “shiny silver globs” on my tile floor. Thankfully my parents told us to stop and clean it up shortly after, but even then they were nonchalant about it because they weren’t aware of mercury and it’s poisonous properties.</p></div>		</li>
