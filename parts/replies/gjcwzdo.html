			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is really important. Thinking of ATP as a molecule that is efficient for the storage of energy  isn't helpful. ATP is a molecule used to pay energy costs, a way to transfer the energy in the chemical bonds of sugar and fat molecules to the enzymes and proteins that need it to operate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation. I wanted to add that, when in different metabolic states, we actually use different “processes” for making energy at different times, not necessarily all of them at once as aforementioned. For example, when one wakes up after a night of sleep, they would likely be in a fasting state in which the body is mostly using glycogen stores at that point because blood glucose as an energy source would be used up/depleted by then (unless you eat throughout the night). Additionally, if one were to continue in the fasting/starvation state aka continue to not eat, they would then move to different processes as other stores are depleted, e.g. once glycogen stores are depleted, the body moves to mobilize fat to glucose (gluconeogenesis)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To further answer OP’s question, the caffeine “energy” you obtain is not from calories turning into energy but rather a chemical change that “increases energy” etc. However, as you can now see how energy is stored/made/used, you can see why caffeine only helps so long and why some crash afterward. I have heard of some dietitians recommend if you’re tired in the afternoon to reach for a snack before the caffeine to see if food (energy) helps first as it’s actually getting to the root of the lack of energy. However, there’s nothing wrong with consuming caffeine of course unless one has any contraindications.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Given how much food we eat as Americans, and how calorie rich they are, I doubt anyone is actually lacking energy due to lack of food, unless they have anorexia.   </p>
<p>If anything most people at my office workplace suffer from low energy after eating lunch, as the body slows down to digest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation! We do absolutely utilize fats for glucose, but only a small portion of the fat molecule is actually glucogenic (the glycerol). The rest of the fat molecule gets converted to acetyl-CoA, which is ketogenic. Most of the actual glucose we produce when fasting comes from protein degradation since many are glucogenic. Muscles, specifically, produce a lot of alanine which the liver can convert to glucose via pyruvate.</p>
<p>Related to this, there are actually two long term fasting states that can happen: Marasmus (which is complete energy intake reduction - everything is low) and Kwashiorkor (consumption of carbs but without protein which leads to severe muscle wasting and complications). If you find yourself in an extreme situation, it’s actually better to totally fast than eat things which are purely carbohydrates without any protein since it allows your body to convert to a ketogenic state. If you continue to consume carbs, your body has trouble changing it’s day-to-day use of protein since the insulin release in response to elevated blood glucose maintains an “anabolic” state of metabolism and prevents total conversion to a fasted state. Basically, your body treats its protein stores as if everything is business as usual and will degrade protein like normal, despite no nutritional protein. You end up with sever muscle wasting, bloated belly (like you see in those starved African children pictures), and other problems.</p>
<p>Note: this is for extreme situations (stranded on an island, trapped on a mountain, etc). Even then, if you have access to a protein source then by all means go ahead and eat something. Just be careful if all you can find are some sweet berries or fruits since those alone can lead to problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah you can think of your body shutting down or slowing down different pathways like a factory slowing down a production line. They usually don't shut down all the machines completely, it's just on standby unless it's not needed for a really long time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct, but since some other answers are not completely correct I want to reiterate that the body uses a mix of the energy sources, with the ratios depending on demands. Fat is not at all just emergency energy reserve. </p>
<p>For example, for physical activity in fasted state: At low intensity (25% VO2_max, e.g. walking), mostly fat from blood <del>triglycerides</del> fatty acids are used. At medium intensity, muscle glycogen is added, with some increase in muscle triglycerides and blood glucose. At higher activity (85% V02_max), the largest part comes from muscle glycogen, with further increase in blood glucose at less fat used. In the feed state, carbohydrate use is larger. Also, on prolonged exercise, carbohydrate use drops and fat use increases. Eventually, glycogen from both muscle and liver are depleted. </p>
