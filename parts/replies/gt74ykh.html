			<div class="markdown"><p>That &quot; health&quot; is also just an indication of how well the voltage follows the expected curve. Voltage is basically the only info that the device can use to make calculations/predictions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They can get instantaneous current too with a shunt resistor. That's how macbooks (and every other laptop) reports power draw (in Watts, being Amps*Voltage).
Total power drawn is generally how laptops measure battery health. If, in one charge a battery used to produce 90Wh before dying (reaching 3V a cell), and now it only produces 72Wh, it has 80% health.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And in how far does that not indicate the actual capacity? Keep in mind that this is not some software bullshit by Apple, the devices itself reports itself. And I assume the battery manufacturer knows how its battery work.</p></div>		</li>
