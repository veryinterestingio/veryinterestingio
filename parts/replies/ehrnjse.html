<p>Dark matter is mysterious but we understand that it feels and produces gravity but NOT the electromagnetic force; this means that dark matter cannot collide with anything. As a result, DM halos are a whirl of dark matter flying every which way.  </p>
<p>So why then are (some) galaxies disks? The answer is that you are focusing on the visible stuff. The milky way’s DM halo is mostly spherical.</p>

<p>Interesting stuff. We know that galaxies consist of about 5% ordinary matter and about 30% dark matter. Shouldn't the dark matter collapse under it's own gravity? Or does it not interact with itself? With that, what do we certainly know about dark matter? What are we still uncertain about?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The dark matter doesn't collapse under its own gravity because it has to conserve its angular momentum around the galaxy. Baryonic matter is able to collide to cancel this motion out but the dark matter can't radiate or collide away angular momentum perpendicular to the plane and so it stays in roughly a spherical distribution. </p>
<p>Dark matter does interact with itself but only gravitationally, as far as we know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this.  Gravity is a radially symmetric force, so DM has no mechanism by which to shed angular momentum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually a bit misleading to say <em>galaxies</em> are 5% baryonic matter, 25% dark matter, and 70% dark energy since those values are for the total mass energy of the universe. Dark energy doesn't contribute the the mass of a galaxy in any meaningful way</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>“In the standard Lambda-CDM model of cosmology, the total mass–energy of the universe contains 5% ordinary matter and energy, 27% dark matter and 68% of an unknown form of energy known as dark energy.”</p>
<p>Sounds like fiction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to correct the other guys response, dark matter halos are NOT considered to be spherical.  I would say all DM models expect the halo to be flattened.  Wikipedia even discusses how there is no reason to believe they would be spherical.  Dark matter is also more of a disk shape.  When we make rotation curves of the galaxy, this allows us to see how much mass is inside a certain radius.  If the mass was a sphere, it would produce gravitational affects in other directions.  While there is some motion in the vertical direction, it is just a fraction of the rotational speed.  The galaxy is like a cylinder, but most of everything is near the galactic plane, which seems to include dark matter.  </p>
<p>That being said, our simulations of dm are getting better, and people like yours truly are working on matching the data from our galaxy to our models of dark matter (or perhaps the other way around).  We are also matching our DM models to simulations of galaxies to see if these models are general and not just specific to our one galaxy.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, OP here. Sounds like you know more than I do here. Checking some sources, yes I agree. Halos aren’t generally spherical. They are often depicted that way in cartoons I’ve seen in lectures which threw me off. </p>
<p>I’d still argue they are mostly elliptical though, and not flat like a spiral galaxy. Certainly there is not process to drive them into such a flat shape besides the presence of baryonic matter there, which ought to elongate an otherwise spherical halo a bit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, tl;dr - galaxies are primarily disk-like for the same reason that solar systems and planetary moon systems are (cancelation of vertical velocities due to angular momentum) in much the same way that planets and larger moons are ellipsoid for the same reason that stars are (the competing forces of gravitational hydrostatic equilibrium and centrifugal force).</p></div>		</li>
