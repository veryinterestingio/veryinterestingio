			<div class="markdown"><p>But in the question 3 WAS just a placeholder, wasn't it? If you substitute 3 for C in the puzzle, then you should also do-so in the question. Would the C have any different probability of showing in the center square?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, because you can take any puzzle, say one on your A-I version that happens to have a B in the middle, swap all the B's to a placeholder like ?'s, the C's to B's, and then go back and swap ?'s to C's.  </p>
<p>You now have a valid Sudoku puzzle which has a C in the middle. You could do the same if it had been A, D, E, F, or G. And you can take any puzzle with a C and swap it for another letter by the opposite process. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think about it like this. In every sudoku puzzle, the 81 boxes can be split into 9 sets of 9 boxes, where each set has all its boxes containing a unique number (e.g. the set of all boxes containing the number 1). </p>
<p>One of these sets contains the box right at the centre of the puzzle so let's focus on this set. What number do we assign to the boxes in this set? 2? 7? It's completely arbitrary so if it was random then the probablilty that the boxes of this set are 3 (or any other number) would be 1/9. As some people have said already, there may be some human bias making 3 more or less likely to be chosen but this is just related to human psychology and completely unrelated to the rules of sudoku itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I understand that. I was never arguing or debating the actual probability but the use and validity of people saying that because  placeholder substitutions can be used that implies equal probability/equal distribution - which I argue is not the case at all. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point of the substitution is to make it apparent to someone who doesn't see that 3 doesn't have some special place to go that that is the case. You can sub it back in to the question if you want. You can use the numbers 0, -7, 24, Â½, 66, 4, 400, 2, and 8 if that makes it clearer. That 3 is a number or that it's the third number don't matter at all for how it's used in Sudoku.</p></div>		</li>
