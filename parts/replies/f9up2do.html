			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d like to add that some systems (like the 3DS or the Nintendo Switch) are exceptions to this rule. Games are still being read straight from the game card simply because it’s fast enough. That way, you save time by not installing them, and internal storage as well.</p>
<p>Some of them may need a day-one update, but in general, they are quite small in size and will anyway be installed faster than full game + update.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since reading from a disk is so slow, I wonder if other developers will go the Nintendo route and make their games on cartridges. Sony would still probably want their systems to play movies, but otherwise they could just make a small cartridge slot right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No they won't. Making games available to download online is way cheaper than basically giving everyone a USB stick with the game data. It worked back in the good old days where a typical NES game for example was half a Megabyte in size, compared to a modern console game that are more like 50 Gigabytes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. It would be expensive to put it on USB sticks in general. To put it on USB sticks with comparable performance to internal harddrives even more so. With the size of games these days you'd end up needing to charge an extra $30 for the drive the game came on.</p>
<p>The advantage of optical discs was really that you could make a stamp and very cheaply mass produce them, which is way harder with solid state storage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>CDs are cheaper than cartridges. That’s a reasons why some games are more expensive on Switch than PS4/Xbox. And back in the day they tried to make the games as small as possible cause Nintendo would cash in more for bigger capacity cartridges. Actually that’s even true today. Some games ship on a smaller cart and you have to download the rest cause they don’t want to pay up for a bigger one, I remember LA Noir for example.</p></div>		</li>
