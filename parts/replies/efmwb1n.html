			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting factoid -- early computer chips were made with a similar process.  Except instead of enlarging the negative, you'd (effectively) run the enlarger backwards and shrink the negative (a.k.a. mask) down to get a tiny computer chip.  A lot of the original advances in Moores law came down to figuring out ways of focusing light accurately at smaller and smaller sizes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, they use what are called Photomasks. They’re essentially pieces of square glass with the geometry of a single layer of the completed chip etched onto a layer of chrome. The process to create these masks is actually pretty interesting; very similar to the process of printing chips onto silicone wafers. </p>
<p>Source: worked in a photomask manufacturing job. </p>
<p>Edit: Silicon, not silicone, but squishy computer chips would be cool too</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite - they do a ton of photolithography, but more generally to-scale, not focused down. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>interesting FACT, a factoid is an unreliable piece of information that is repeated so often that it is often mistaken for the truth. The usage of the word factoid is now a factoid. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The quality you get from film negatives is still amazing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>except unlike a shadow, enlargers can focus at different distances so you can have a sharp image.</p>
<p>also making the image larger changed the exposure time needed on the paper. </p></div>		</li>
