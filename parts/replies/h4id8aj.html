			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting fact about the blood-brain barrier:</p>
<p>Morphine acts on the nerves outside of the brain, as only a very small portion is able to cross the barrier. Heroin on the other hand has no problem crossing the barrier. It cannot act on the neurons there, however there's an enzyme that converts heroin into morphine. Again, remember that morphine cannot cross the barrier. Thus, whatever heroin got converted will remain trapped in the brain, activating neurons until it disintegrates.</p>
<p>As heroin gets converted into morphine in the body, you'd expect those two to behave the same way. The blood-brain barrier is what makes difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Parkinson's disease's hallmark feature (but not all the pathology) is a problem producing dopamine within the brain, and partially remedied with dopamine supplementation.  But it can't be taken orally, transdermally, or injected, because dopamine cannot cross the blood-brain barrier.</p>
<p>Instead there's levodopa, which can cross the blood brain barrier, and readily metabolizes into dopamine in the brain.</p>
<p>However, levodopa will readily convert to dopamine anywhere in the body, but that dopamine anywhere else will just cause bad side effects.</p>
<p>Consequently, levodopa is always given as a combo drug with carbidopa, which is a powerful inhibitor of the conversion of levodopa into dopamine all around.</p>
<p>Well, doesn't that defeat the point of levodopa?  It would, except for one small detail- carbidopa <em>cannot</em> cross the blood-brain barrier, so it does not inhibit conversion of levodopa to carbidopa there in the brain.  Just everywhere else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's an ingenious delivery mechanism, but still a very, very blunt tool.  Perhaps in our lifetime we will see some big improvements in the treatment of neurologic and psychiatric illness... but then again neurologists and psychiatrists have been saying that for a century and most of our treatments are still very suboptimal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Awakenings by Oliver Sacks was such a cool book on the subject of L-DOPA. Not Parkinson’s exactly, but it seems to suggest that there’s much more going on than a simple lack of dopamine. Probably the standout part of that book to me was lucid patients that were able to predict their downfall and death. It’s truly amazing what it was able to do and tragic how temporary the treatment was. </p>
<p>Like other Oliver Sacks works, it’s absolutely fascinating and very well written. </p>
<p>I had no idea of this method of administering L-DOPA, and you’ve explained it in a similarly clear way. The brain and the mind are just so ridiculously complicated and there’s so much to learn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did my bachelor's in biomedical sciences. It was in one of my pharmacology classes and I found this fact striking enough to remember it. </p>
<p>I am sure that there are articles out there on the biochemistry of heroin if you would like to read more on it. It's a very interesting topic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s also the problem of sampling. You can biopsy most things in the human body and perform testing on it. You might even get normal human samples for comparison if you’re lucky. </p>
<p>The brain however, good luck getting that tissue. So essentially you’re guessing that things  will work by developing a drug around animal models, which don’t always translate to working in the clinic</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great answer! Tagging on to this, another reasons is simply funding and infrastructure. If an equal sum of money was spent on mental health vs. physical health, even with the treatment plans that we currently have, results would likely exceed those of the medical system considerably since many mental health issues respond well to early intervention.</p></div>		</li>
