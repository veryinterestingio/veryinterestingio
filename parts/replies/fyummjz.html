			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not contingent, the hormone is basically needed to tell your kidneys to absorb water.</p>
<p>Source: My brain doesn’t produce it, so I need to take a synthetic hormone to make my kidneys work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ikr, i used to pee in bed way up to 19 years of age (not every night but maybe 2 or 3 times a year during the end). Can't believe i never learned to control it before that age.</p>
<p>Much shame :'(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can also be to a certain degree a learned behaviour. Children don’t feel the natural need to wake up and go pee in a toilet whereas when adults feel that they they need the toilet they will naturally want to go to a bathroom. </p>
<p>In children who wet the bed late into childhood, interventional behavioural training via an alarm linked to a moisture detector can train this learned behaviour. E.g. Alarm sounds when moisture detected, child learns to wake up when they need the toilet.</p></div>		</li>
