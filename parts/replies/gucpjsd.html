			<div class="markdown"><p>Anyone care for some etymology? Meteor comes from the greek work &quot;μετέωρος&quot;, which is a composite word consisting of &quot;μετά&quot; (=after) and &quot;αορ&quot; (modern greek word equivalent would be αίρω, and it translates to lift/raise/set free).</p>
<p>So μετέωρος in modern greek translates to something that hangs in the air, &quot;hover&quot; might be a good word to describe it. It can be used figuratively for something that is uncertain and it hovers between some positions/decisions.</p>
<p>In ancient greek it was also used for things that were very tall (e.g. the famous Meteora Monasteries), and also could generally refer to celestial bodies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if this question was supposed to be somewhat humorous: To create the name of a certain mineral one does not have to use the full name of its derivative (for example the existance of calcite does not imply it is made of something called &quot;calc&quot;). The term graphite is derived from the greek word <em>graphein</em> which means to write in reference to its use in pencils. Incidentally the word graph similarly derives from that same greek root.</p></div>		</li>

<p>While true in many cases, calcite does indeed come from the latin word for limestone,  calx with the -ite added to indicate mineral form. Limestone being one of the primary sources of calcium carbonate way back.</p>
<p>Graphite is also somewhat tongue in cheek named for it's most famous usage long after it's discovery and first uses. It was initially called plumbago for it's confusing similarity to lead (in Latin; Plumbum) and later also known as black lead until a few hundred years later when it was renamed graphite.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pluto Eris and Ceres are our solar system's 3 officially recognized &quot;Dwarf Plannets&quot;. These are objects large enough to force themselves into spheroids, but not so large as to clear their orbits of other stuff.</p>
<p>Planetoid isn't really something with a strict definition, but yes, generally speaking, you wouldn't be wrong to use it while talking about a dwarf planet.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> There are certain to be many undiscovered dwarf planets, along with several likely dwarf planets that are still being classified (Haumea, Makemake, Quaoar, Sedna, Orcus and Gonggong)</p>
<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> also worth noting, Pluto's largest &quot;moon&quot; Charon is actually so large that it's more accurate to say the two bodies orbit eachother, than that the moon orbits Pluto. Technically this should make them binary dwarf planets rather than simply a dwarf planet and its moon.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That was part of the reason for it's demotion to dwarf planet. The center of the pair's orbit is outside of Pluto, a trait none of the planets share with any of their moons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, because Pluto is part of a belt of similar objects and hasn't cleared its area. Some call  those objects plutinos</p></div>		</li>
