			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine if you were drawing a picture of a unicorn and you started with a pencil.</p>
<p>Now your grandma says I bet that unicorn would be really pretty if you colored it pink. You could easily grab a crayon and go over your picture with a pink crayon. That's like the games you don't have to reload </p>
<p>Now imagine you were drawing the same unicorn except this time you were drawing it with colored pens and markers and your unicorn was already black and white and brown......and grandma says- it would look better if it was pink.</p>
<p>You cannot use a pink crayon over top of all those colors - you would have to start over from scratch. That's like the games that make you reload the game to see better graphics.</p>
<p>Don't be afraid to use this explanation for your first grade teacher. ðŸ˜Š</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you built a model out of the big Lego blocks then took a photo. </p>
<p>It would look chunky, right?</p>
<p>If you wanted a photo where it looks less chunky, then you would have to go build the model again with lots more smaller Lego blocks then take a new photo. That's what the games that reload are like.</p>
<p>The games that don't reload like that don't use blocks like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine your favorite pants have become too small for you.</p>
<p>In the first case you go to the tailor and he can adjust the trousers within a few minutes while you can keep the pants on. </p>
<p>However, if the pants have a other shape/material, you have to to pull them off briefly so that the tailor can adjust the pants. .</p></div>		</li>
