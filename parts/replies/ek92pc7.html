			<div class="markdown"><p>But it wasn't molten rock. It was a pyroclastic fall/flow. Ash, as /u/jedi_nomad said. I'm not sure how deep the ash fell at pompei, but imagine 20 foot deep piles of (high density) hot ash, burying an entire city, and you're on the right track. Look in this <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=pyroclastic+fall&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjYp9Olj7zhAhUrm-AKHXrmCxwQ_AUIDigB&amp;biw=1524&amp;bih=1030#imgrc=YqaXgbPCLX9qmM:" target="_blank">image</a>. It's all that, when it comes down. It's very heavy.</p>
<p>In this image <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=pyroclastic+fall&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjYp9Olj7zhAhUrm-AKHXrmCxwQ_AUIDigB&amp;biw=1524&amp;bih=1030#imgrc=SsO61bX-Eq5WRM:" target="_blank">here</a>, you can see that it's so heavy it's flowing more like water, and sticking to the ground.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It wasn't just pyroclastic flows that covered pompeii, it was also up to 20 feet of pumice raining down in less than a day.  You can see the layers alternating between ash and pieces of pumice.  I think the poses of the the people who left voids in the debris that depict agony more likely died of asphyxiation than being incinerated by a pyroclastic flow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lava, or molten rock doesn't have properties like water, in terms of a person could submerge in it. It crushes things in its path. Being molten means it will flow around objects to a degree to take the path of least resistance, but if the full face of a lava front encounters a building, or car, then it is pushing over it like a bulldozer.</p>
<p>If you jumped into molten lava, you would land on the rock surface and burn. Not sink.</p>
<p>Pyroclastic flows come in 2 main types and are like an avalanche.</p>
<p>They can come directly from an eruption and can contain super heated gas, ash, pumice, rocks of all shapes and sizes up to very large boulders. From explosive venting out the side of a volcano, or from a volcanic eruption ash &amp; rock plume collapsing back on itself for example like a shaken bottle of soda.</p>
<p>Or after rain/ snow destabilises built up ash/ rock etc deposits around a volcano and sends it down the mountain side more as a type of mud flow.</p>
<p>Both will typically follow features such as stream/ river valleys.</p>
<p>From a geological record perspective it is difficult to distinguish the 2 apart unless you have buried and &quot;cooked&quot; indicators such as at Pompeii. There are some other geological indicators, but they would probably bore you.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don’t think these are actually classed as pyroclastic flows though are they? Sounds more like snow avalanches or lahars. Both have in common with pyroclastic flows that they are debris flows driven by gravity and density differences, but the <em>pyro</em> qualifier in pyroclastic indicates they are made up of heated ash and fragments ie. from a fresh eruption. Lahars and avalanches can be triggered when a volcano is not erupting, I don’t think lahars do that thing where they entrain air into the leading edge of the flow and compress it either. </p>

<p>I don’t think this is true at all. Rock avalanches are dry and will consist of distinct pieces, usually with a fair amount of angular fragments. </p>
<p>Lahars are water saturated and will form a more cohesive deposit which is usually full of a lot of clay minerals. </p>
<p>Pyroclastic flows do not contain much moisture and will leave deposits rich in volcanic glass from fragments which have cooled to quickly to mineralise. Larger fragments and minerals will be welded together with the glass from the high heat, or a bunch of more uniform particles will form a consolidated ash deposit. </p></div>		</li>
