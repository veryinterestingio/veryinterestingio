			<div class="markdown"><p>Man, my friends still constantly share Harry Potter stuff even though they are in their thirties and forties now. They wear Harry Potter costumes to Harry Potter themed parties and they share all sorts of &quot;what house do you belong to&quot; quizzes on Facebook. Star Wars is another one that gets me, it's everywhere and inescapable. I grew up a bookworm and computer nerd, but nerd culture moved in a completely different direction than I did when I grew up and I'm to the point where I almost feel like I need to seek out a completely different friend group because my friends talk in all these pop culture references from movies and shows that I have no interest in. I feel like an outcast among outcasts at this point. I don't fit in with the social butterflies, but now I'm even awkward around my fellow awkward introverted people because their identities revolve so strongly around movies/books/comics that are so cheesy they bore me to tears. I'm not a hater and don't criticise them for having different tastes than me, but it's hard to relate when they talk in so many pop culture references that go right over my head.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first book wasn't that great so I hear you. It was only this year that for some reason I got interested and read the entire series and saw all the movies. No one is claiming that this is great literature, but some day you may want to try it again. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Almost everything I click on on Reddit, there's someone in the comments trying to turn it into a Harry Potter reference, then someone else always follows it up with &quot;r/unexpectedHogwarts,&quot; but it's hard to even call it unexpected when it happens every damn time!</p>
<p>I just wish there was some end point where I wouldn't have to hear about Harry Potter on a daily basis anymore, but I get the depressing feeling that 50 years from now I'll be sitting in a nursing home with Harry Potter posters up on the walls.</p></div>		</li>
