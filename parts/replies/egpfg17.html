			<div class="markdown"><p>I drive around doctors for in home visits when their clinics are closed, and its not rare to be sent out to an alcoholic who requested to be admitted to a hospital to get off heavy abuse. Doctor then evaluates their current state, and depending on how long they have been drinking how much, they will be admitted and helped with drugs or they will be prescribed something to be able to do it at home. Ive been told that it can literally be lethal to quit cold turkey without medicinal assistance if youve been drinking enough for enough time. </p></div>		</li>
