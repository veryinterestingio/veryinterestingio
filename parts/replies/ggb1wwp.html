<p>India along with countries like Bangladesh can receive special rights for producing patented medicines for very low cost.</p>

<p>Why is that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indian patent law works differently and favours public interest instead of drug company profits.</p>
<p>There have been legal cases where companies that produce life saving drugs attempt to sue others infringing on their patents, and the courts take into account damage to public health when deciding whether to grant an injunction on the production of said drug.</p>
<p>So if you try to pull a Martin Skhkreli in India it won't go well for you.</p>
<p>With this being the case it's more profitable for pharmaceutical companies to license their products for large scale low cost production, knowing that if they don't, someone will just copy their product for a lower price and that someone will use the public interest argument in court.</p></div>		</li>

They're making money from their deals with India.</p></div>		</li>
