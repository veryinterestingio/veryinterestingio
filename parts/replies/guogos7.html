			<div class="markdown"><p>The second dose usually has more side effects because you already have an immune system ready to attack what is being injected into your body. It’s a good thing. In fact, I’ve read that one of the reasons that people have reactions during the first dose is because they had COVID and didn’t know about it (asymptomatic).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anecdotally, I had severe covid in December, then got my first Moderna shot in March--and was down for the count for about 24 hours. The second shot, though? Not even a whisper of a symptom. It was interesting to see this all play out for myself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if they had covid and then get the shot, is that the same then as not having gotten covid and getting two shots?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The nurse who gave me my first shot told me the same thing. If you have a nasty reaction to the first shot, you most likely had asymptomatic Covid and had no idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, if I already got covid, shouldn’t the first dose itself be enough to build a lasting immunity?</p></div>		</li>
