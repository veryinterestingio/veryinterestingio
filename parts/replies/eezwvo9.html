			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, this is the answer in every case I've dealt with. Small towns, dense urban, metropolitan; everywhere you can connect too many devices to a tower sector. Asshole telcos (notably Spark here in New Zealand) oversell their subscriptions and don't bother to invest in network capacity to accommodate growth. Many cases where another 3g sector (or introducing 4g) would have solved the problem, but they aren't interested in adding towers in areas with 'good coverage', as if coverage = availability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's interesting is working for a condo developer I just talked to a company acting as a cell carrier but only for iot. Small bandwidth needs, has the 220 mHz spectrum while the competition for data is at 3000 mHZ range. Has better range of 80km vs 5km and no other demand. With small bandwidth need makes perfect sense for us</p></div>		</li>
