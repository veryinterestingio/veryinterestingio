<p>So, if I cut the package open, would I see a reaction? Or do you advise against it? üòÜ</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I doubt you would see much, but give it a try. </p>
<p>Note that there are multiple ways to create an oxygen absorber, so it may not be immediately clear what the actual contents of the package are. So as a precaution, don't touch it. But I doubt that anything remotely harmful would be used in something that is intended to be included with food.</p></div>		</li>

<p>i.o.w.  please use gloves, and open it outside. You're opening a package with contents unknown. Most likely nothing happens, however, if something does happen, having it not in your living room is a huge plus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For example, if you live in a colder climate where road de-icing is necessary and common, they typically spread salt on roads. They do this to lower water's freezing point to keep ice from forming on road surfaces. But this also has the side effect of salty water getting all over the metal underside of vehicles. That catalyzing salt can greatly accelerate rusting around scratched up bumpers and fenders.</p>
<p>Anything made of iron you put in the ocean is gonna quickly rust to hell for the same reason if it isn't treated with some kind of sealant.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I am not telling you to toss a cup of gasoline on a fire, but if you did it would be pretty exciting. Especially compared to opening up a hand warmer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Throw a cup of finely-powdered iron in a fire and it will be pretty exciting too. </p>
<p>I don't recommend throwing any powders into flame, they often react in a dangerous manner. Ever hear of a grain silo explosion? Those are finely-divided grain particles which can violently combust when sparked.</p></div>		</li>
