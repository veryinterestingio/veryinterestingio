			<div class="markdown"><p>Then, if you aren't careful you can get nitrogen narcosis from diving too deep for too long. You get all discombobulated and forget to check things like down-time, tank pressure, and best of all, which way is up. There really is a lot going on down at depth that you need to be aware of to stay safe. Thanks for the write up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So many years ago, I was hired as a guinea pig, sorry, subject, for a scientific project at my University where they were testing diver communications methods in the University’s hyperbaric chamber. To conduct the experiment, they took us down to 150’ seawater equivalent, on standard air, and had us do the experiment.</p>
<p>Anyhow, they pressurized the chamber ot that pressure, which caused all our voices to pitch up (thanks to the increased pressure). The dive tender on the outside of the chamber asked us if everyone was ok, and someone says “we’re fine, we’re just stuck in here with Minnie mouse” We started laughing. I thought it was only a couple of seconds, but when they showed us the video after it was closer to 10 minutes before we settled down.</p>
<p>That’s the heaviest I’ve ever been Narc’d and hope to never encounter that when I’m actually underwater.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reminds me of a documentary I saw on TV about the “MAM” (Mal aigu des montagnes), which is the thing that happens to climbers when they climb to high and too fast without taking the time to acclimate. We can see 4 guys in an hyperbaric chamber for 24 hours, every hours they would add the equivalent of ~800 meters to the count and adjust the pressure accordingly. At some point one of the scientist has troubles talking, tried to write “I need help” but ended up writing “the salt seems to drive inside the closet” and it felt completely clear to him that he wrote the correct message to his teammates. Creepy !</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The book Shadow Divers talks a bit about that, how divers would just all of a sudden get quiet and wander off their lines on the sea floor, never to return, and how there wouldn't be anything you could do to help. A lot of it was back before the much-safer modern air mixtures as well, so the narcosis was much more of an ever-present threat.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It is only relative to depth, not depth and length of dive.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm just a recreational diver, but that doesn't jive with the training I have had.  The longer you spend at higher pressure, the more nitrogen dissolves in your blood and the more likely you are to feel narcosis because of it. This is why saturation divers breathe gas mixes with no nitrogen, and even recreational divers often use nitrox mixes which lower the amount of nitrogen in the air to lower the chance of nitrogen narcosis and decompression sickness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Divers also use Nitrox (EAN, Enriched Air Nitrox) which are mixtures with higher oxygen concentration that normal air (typically up to 40%). They are therefore limited to shallower depth, but this breathing gas limits the nitrogen intake (dissolving into blood and other tissues) and reduce the risk of decompression sickness when returning to the surface.</p>
<p>However 1.6bar oxygen partial pressure is not <em>silly</em>, it is in fact a perfectly acceptable pressure for decompression stops using even higher oxygen concentrations (up to 100% from 6m). But indeed, oxygen pressure at the bottom should be limited at 1.4bar.</p>
<p>For technical divers doing very long decompression stops (several hours) on high oxygen mixtures, it is sometimes advised to perform <em>air breaks</em>, that is breathing a lower oxygen mixture for a few minutes (e.g. 5min) at regular interval (e.g. 20min).</p>
<p>I must also add that, for some specific treatment in hyperbaric chambers (NOT in diving, and under strong medical supervision), oxygen pressure can be well above 2bar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Tanks are filled with whatever mix is desired and then that mix is breathed at depth. </p>
<p>On a closed circuit rebreather, gas is breathed, captured by an exhalation hose and returned to a counterlung, and the co2 is “scrubbed” using a chemical medium. The metabolized oxygen is replaced (there are a few methods to meter the replacement), and then the gas is breathed again. Wash rinse repeat. </p>
<p>Much more efficient than open circuit scuba, but also much more complex.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Recreational divers all just breathe standard air or sometimes something called nitrox, which is a mix of nitrogen and oxygen at a higher oxygen percentage than standard air. Any diver that is bringing pure oxygen down with them is a technical diver, and they generally carry multiple bottles of different gas mixes to be used at the different stages of their dive. It is common for technical divers that go deep enough to need decompression stops to use close to pure oxygen as they near the surface, because that lets them exhale the nitrogen dissolved in their blood more quickly and shorten their decompression stop.</p></div>		</li>
