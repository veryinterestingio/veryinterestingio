			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best answer. It's a cultural categorisation. </p>
<p>At which countries are categorised as which can vary hugely depending on context and may change over time.</p>
<p>During the cold war the term &quot;the west&quot; would not have included countries in the Communist sphere in eastern Europe in mode contexts - places like Czechoslovakia and Poland for example. Today these would definitely usually be considered western nations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, reach country's atlases and world maps would have that country in the centre of the map. So Japan would be like Australia, where we see Europe  on the west side of the map, and the Americas on the east side.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We are not considered Western countries unless someone stands to gain from it. Plenty of us haven't been Western countries for the last 6 centuries... It takes more than a few decades to get there, both in our culture and in the minds of the &quot;real&quot; Westerners.</p></div>		</li>

<li>MAPMAKER: Welcome back to Europe! Which direction do you travel to obtain these delicious spices? </li>
<li>TRADER: If I were to draw a line, it would head southeast for a bit and then more-or-less due east. </li>
<li>MAPMAKER: That won't do. Kings need things simple. Let's just say you headed &quot;east&quot;. Are there kingdoms there? </li>
<li>TRADER: Of course! There's different Khanates, China, Persia....</li>
<li>MAPMAKER: Too complicated. We'll just say … ah, the entire region is now the East. You traveled to the mysterious East for spices. </li>
<li>TRADER: That's stupid. On my return trip, I headed in the opposite direction. Does that mean all of Europe is now the West? Ha!</li>
<li>MAPMAKER: Not a bad idea.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, as a lifelong Washingtonian this has always amused me. I live on the West Coast, but if I get on a boat and head out west I am now on the West Coast of the Pacific Ocean (somewhere in Asai, likely Japan).</p>
<p>So, I am from the West and I went west to visit the West Coast of the East. But from their perspective I came from the east to visit the East.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, Orient just means „East” in Latin. The Romans started all this by splitting their empire into an Eastern and Western part. So originally the East began in Greece and slowly got pushed out to refer to what is now called Asia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems obvious, but this is ELI5 so I feel the need to add:</p>
<p>When they said East or West in this sense, originally, it was understood that they meant “East of here” and “West of here” and that “here” typically means Europe (specifically England and France).</p>
<p>So much so, that the Prime Meridian - the imaginary line on the globe that separates the Eastern Hemisphere from the Western Hemisphere - passes right through Greenwich, England, a part of London.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I always knew the GMT centered map as the default. </p>
<p>Like you said that's partially culturally influenced due to the Eurocentric history of the Prime Meridian and previous maps, but it also ends up being kinda practical precisely because it shows all the time zones in order, and the international date line is the L/R border.</p></div>		</li>
