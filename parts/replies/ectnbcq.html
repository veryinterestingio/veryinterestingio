<p>This question is generally know as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olbers%27_paradox" target="_blank">Olbers' Paradox</a>, and is one of the questions that led us to expanding universe theories in the first place</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was actually a minor plot point in Diane Duane's modern fantasy novel Deep Wizardry, wherein after a particularly powerful spell, the night sky suddenly turned white, and because they were familiar with Olbers' Paradox, one of the characters realized it was because it was because the universe was no longer expanding</p>
<p>Not <em>that</em> relevant, I just love Deep Wizardry, lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sadly, that was taken out of the &quot;Millennium Edition&quot; rewrites, possibly because someone pointed out to Diane that just because Dairine stopped the universe expanding, that wouldn't make it as if it had never been expanding in the first place, and it would take a while for all the light to catch up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it wouldn't work. Even if the universe stopped expanding everywhere now, and even if you waited the 16 billion years it would take the repercussions from the furthest reaches to get to you, the sky would still be black with dotted starlight, because there just aren't enough stars to cover more than a tiny fraction of the sky, so most lines of sight would still be black.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's lots of evidence (cf Hubble's Law), but you don't even need an expanding universe to explain Olber's paradox. The reason the night sky is dark, even though we are surrounded by an infinite number of stars in any direction, is that the universe is of finite age (this itself is a consequence of expansion), which means those stars have only emitted a finite amount of light thus far. Moreover, most rays emitted by distant stars hit a more nearby star before they reach us, so we cannot just add up all the light from all the stars to come up with the total amount of light incident upon the earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It isn’t. Stars emit light in all directions like a lightbulb, not a flashlight. Put a lightbulb in that room and it lights the entire room because there’s material to reflect off of. The analogy to use is that of a street lamp at night. If you look up at it you only see the lamp because those are the only rays that reach your eye even though the lamp emits light in all directions. The same thing happens with stars from far away. Only the rays going directly toward you are seen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What a HORRIBLE analogy; a street lamp’s light diffracts in the air, but space is a vacuum.</p>
<p>A better analogy would be a star emitting light in the vacuum of space.</p>
<p>Remember kids: if you’re pedantic enough, all analogies are terrible.</p></div>		</li>
