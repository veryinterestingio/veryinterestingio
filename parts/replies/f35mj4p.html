<p>Turns out getting to the Moon is easier than I thought, while I was never a moon landing denier, I did struggle to wonder how you could get there on 60s technology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We managed to get there in the 60s by making the technology to do it. The first integrated circuits were used for guidance computers and the demand for such high grade circuitry jumpstarted the computer revolution, WD-40 was created to protect stainless steel atlas rockets from water, and the science of insulation was advanced to the point where a few inches of material can protect astronauts from high temperature plasma. Countless medical sensors were developed to monitor every vital sign they could think of and that's not even mentioning robotics. The human race figured out how to do so much in such a short time because it was unified in facing a difficult challenge and we're still riding the coattails of that innovation in many fields a half century later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but you are very limited in where you can go after doing so.</p>
<p>And you want to slow down at the landing site, say you wanna go to mars, going to Jupiter first to slow down doesn't really help you as you still need to get to Mars...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but part of how a gravity assist works is that you don't really change velocity relative to the planet you're using. So you can use Mars's gravity to change speed relative to, say, Earth, but not relative to itself.</p>
<p>Think of it like gently tossing a tennis ball in front of a truck going 60mph. You throw it such that it's barely moving, then the truck hits it and it ends up going 60+ mph. The truck slows down a tiny tiny bit, and passes that energy on to the ball.</p>
<p>From the truck's perspective the ball was moving 60mph before you even threw it, and so when it hit the truck it just bounced off a stationary surface the way any ball thrown at 60mph would.</p>
<p>There is a maneuver known as &quot;aerobraking&quot; that works on planets with atmosphere, where you let the spacecraft brush up against the edge of the atmosphere. This can shave off a lot of speed, but it does so mostly by converting it into heat from friction, and heat is hard to get rid of in space. That's all that fire you see in videos of re-entry from orbit.</p>
<p>Kerbal players have also coined the term &quot;lithobraking&quot; as a euphemism for high speed crashes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not just Kerbal players, engineers who deal with airplanes and spacecraft have used that term for a long time with the same connotation (though a few people do actually try and develop lithobraking techniques).</p>
<p>&quot;Rapid Unplanned Disassembly&quot; is another fun euphemism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What are you braking against? If a car's wheels stop, it skids against the road until it matches velocity and comes to a halt. If a ship brakes, it either engages its engines in reverse or waits to match velocity with the water. In space you have nothing to brake against. </p>
<p>Aerobraking is a thing if the body you're landing on has an atmosphere, but most moons do not have atmospheres of any practical significance. So the only thing you'd be braking on is the moon itself. So lithobraking, aka, crashing into the moon full speed.</p></div>		</li>
