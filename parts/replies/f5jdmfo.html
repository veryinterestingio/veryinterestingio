			<div class="markdown"><p>I have had similar experiences my whole life. nowadays when I'm sick with a fever I 100% know i will have a nightmare, and when i do it's okay because i immediately know it's a result of my fever. This makes them less of a nightmare more of an  uncomfortable dream</p></div>		</li>
