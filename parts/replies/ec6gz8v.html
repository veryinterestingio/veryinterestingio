<p>This is like your mom handing you $5 to buy school lunch, even though she knows school lunch costs $6. If you come home hungry she is going to yell at you for not buying school lunch as she told you to. If you spend $6 she is going to yell at you for spending too much money on school lunch. Any way it is a problem that she created that only she can solve but you can be blamed for it.</p>

<p>And also saying that regardless of the outcome you'll have to scrub the toilet as a direct consequence of needing lunch (in reference to the legislation riders)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to this, we're in debt 21 trillion, but we're not the only ones borrowing money.  We're also lending money.  Other countries owe us in the ballpark of 16 trillion.  We're still in a new loss when it comes to debt being owned by other countries, but it's not as severe as &quot;21 Trillion!&quot; sounds.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, national debt is complicated and doesn't work anything like your personal debt. </p>
<p>In a round about way, it can be seen as financial insurance for the debtor and debtee. The debtee invests their money in another nations GDP, at incredibly low interest rates, as something of a stockpile of liquid assets with an ally one trusts and/or a weaker nation the larger nation sees profit in. Eg: China is willing to give the US money because it knows the US is good for it, and the entanglement ensures mutual growth despite conflicting economic interests. </p>
<p>Alternatively, debtor can use the stability of their lender to safeguard against collapse. Should the US default on its debt with China, China can either forgive some of that debt (providing a cushion on the fall) or suffer the fall with the US. That is to say: if a nation defaults, another nation can't just reposes the other nation. That 6.06  trillion the US owes China (at a ridiculously low interest rate) is also 6.06 trillion in insurance tied to the yuan. If the US collapses, China has now invested so much that they have incentive to invest more, less their own economy suffer for the poor investment. </p>
<p>Shit's complicated yo. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is despite what certain politicians tell you when running for office.  If they ever tell you that we should run our economy like your household, they should be ignored.  It doesn't work that way and you are trying to trick your constituents to justify tax cuts for the rich.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It kinda does, just not the way you think. </p>
<p>The usual line of reasoning is that the government spends the money to make money - borrow a billion to improve education, wait 20 years and the people are better educated and pay more taxes. Build a road, trade becomes easier, more taxes. Etc. </p>
<p>For personal debt, the thought is that you buy a TV, TV breaks.... shit. </p>
<p>They're not wrong, it's just that either system can be used the other way. </p>
<p>Debt is worse than no debt. Interest needs to be paid, but as long as extra income covers the interest, it's fine. </p>
<p>So a person may borrow money to buy a car to drive to a more lucrative job. That's a good kind of debt. Or a mortgage, where they can build equity over time, instead of paying rent. Or better shoes that will prevent back pain later. Or spending 50% more on a TV because it will last five times longer. These are all household debt that aren't bad, as long as there's income to cover them. </p>
<p>A government, on the other hand, can also piss away money - building a &quot;bridge to nowhere&quot; that costs millions and benefits almost no one long term, or spending a billion to revamp education with no improvement. Now the interest payments have gone up, but there's no extra revenue. </p>
<p>In every case, there are unknowns - the more expensive TV may die before the extra cost pays off, and the investment into upgrading a highway may become obsolete when that side of the city loses its heavy industry. </p>
<p>The key difference is that governments don't die, so returns can be looked at on a much longer time scale, but the fundamentals are the same. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And, only about a third of US debt is external, meaning that only about 7 trillion of that is owed to other countries, the rest being borrowed from US citizens and institutions. We are owed much more money than we owe as far as other countries go. </p></div>		</li>
