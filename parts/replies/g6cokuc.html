			<div class="markdown"><p>OP, if you want to more, a lot of cooking (including baking) depends on something called the <em>Maillard reaction</em>.
The Maillard reaction is a chemical reaction that turns things brown and changes the flavour.
It is a chemical reaction (actually a group of a lot of different chemical reactions) between proteins and sugars, and so affects pretty well any cooking that involves meat, eggs, dairy, sugar, grains, etc. (even coffee beans and chocolate)</p>
<p>The Maillard reaction is extremely slow/effectively non-existent below about 150⁰C, at which point it starts to occur very quickly.
For that reason, almost all cooking has to happen above 150⁰C.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My undergraduate research was based on the levels of hmf produced in honey which is a result of the maillard reactions.
The Malliarrd reaction also contributes to the colour of dark runs and beers.</p>
<p>Edit: just for clarification I ment rum, not runs. But, I shall leave it for the humor.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You asked “why as such” and the response was “because such is such” </p>
<p>I’m personally curious as to a more of an inherent answer, like “at the molecular level, cells are more likely to create a heat-transfer relationship with one another whereas the higher the temperature the more likely the cells will mutate. Because of this relationship between temperature and organic matter, it is simply pure coincidence that 300-400 degrees just so happens to ‘cook’ most of what you’re looking to eat”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im not good with the intrinsics of science behind that reaction. But just want to point out, even if its obvious, you can have a pan or oven well over the 100°C but if there's too much water sweating out, the mailiard reaction will halt. For exemple, I have to take a break from frying minced meat if I want to brown it to discard the water of meat sweats. If I don't do that, I'll end up with boiled mince meat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup which is why a huge thing is to not crowd the pan. Even frying hot oil has a similar issue.  If you add too much at once, the temp drops too fast and you end up with soggy fried food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, you can also do smaller batches.   If you fill the pan’s surface with meat, it will fill with “meat sweats” more easily.   Smaller batches allows more surface area to cook that liquid off, and keeps the pan from dropping in temperature</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water, while liquid, can’t ever go above 100C. The browning reaction starts at 150C. </p>
<p>In order to brown something, you must first evaporate* all of the water at the surface. </p>
<p>At 100C you can still over cook food, you just can’t brown the food. Browning is what actually tastes good.</p>
<p>*Evaporating water takes a lot of energy and time. Think about how long it takes to bring a pot of water to the boil, and how long it would take to boil away all of the water. This is why it’s best to batch cooking, pour off liquid, dry food, ect. It gets rid of surface moisture and allows the food to get brown and delicious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s worth noting you can cook things significantly lower. Ribs in a slow cooker are typically around 200F. Chili is often cooked more like 300f. </p>
<p>The downside is these things take substantially longer to cook. But you keep the outside from burning will getting the inside cooked through (ribs) or for Chile you boil off the excess water from tomatoes and I believe bring out more sweetness. </p>
<p>The main reasons to get hotter is to speed things up or to crisp things. It’s not uncommon to cook something much higher than 400 for a short amount of time to crisp/brown it. A cooking torch for example is around 2,000 degrees but would only be used for a couple seconds.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>One of the basic mistakes many people make in their early years of cooking is using temperatures they are too hot. 200 degrees C is a good temperature for a crispy roast, bread, home-made pizza (often turning the temperature down after some cooking time). However, many (most) things are indeed better between 150–170.</p>
<p>Same goes for hobs. For many things you should be using lower rather than higher temperatures. Particularly when you want to simmer anything. Even pasta doesn't cook as well if blasted at full temperature.  Steak etc of course is nice cooked using a blasting hot temperature.</p></div>		</li>
