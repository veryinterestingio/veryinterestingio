			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, cant believe that this has come up, because this is a subject that I have studied and written papers on. Rituximab has been proven to reduce the symptoms of patients in a majority of patients. However, the effects mostly last as long as the depletion of the B cells remain out of the system. When the B-cells do repopulate back in the immune system, and the autoimmune B cells generate the inflammatory response against the desmoglein protein, the effects reoccur. Hence, patients must continue to receive cycles of RTX to maintain a non autoimmune milieu. My work has been involved in showing that a combination therapy of both RTX and traditional IVIG can lead to longer remission times between reappearance of symptoms and a possible long term “cure”, in which the immune system can be retrained to be non-inflammatory</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The squirmy bois have a chance I think. They fall in line with the hygiene hypothesis which much has no holes in my opinion. Humans used to live with parasites but no longer do in developed areas. People in 3rd world countries where where parasitic worms are still common have basically zero rate of autoimmune disease.</p></div>		</li>
