			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a great answer.  And just to address one of OPs points, some viruses <em>do</em> spread to nearly the whole of the human population.  Things like HPV, CMV, Chickenpox (before the vaccine) infect the majority of people by the time they're middle aged.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I joined Reddit originally so I could ask astrophysics/astronomy (and miscellaneous) questions with the chance of someone who actually knew the answer responding. I was hooked because I got answers like this; because someone sat down and took the time to type something like this out to me. I guess what I'm saying is, just know you're doing more good than you know by providing responses like this one!</p></div>		</li>
