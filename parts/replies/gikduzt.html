<p>The 52% protection figure includes all infections that occur in people within the first 10 days, before we would expect people to have any protection from the virus. If you exclude infections that occur during that time, the protection you get from a single shot of the vaccine is closer to 90+%. How long the immunity lasts after a single shot is a question of active debate.</p>

<p>Totally agree. There's a big difference between the vaccine &quot;efficacy&quot; in the several days immediately after it is administered and the true biological efficacy of a single dose. The stated efficacy of ~50% after one dose is by definition a significant underestimation of the true efficacy given how prevalent and transmissible this disease is coupled with the incubation period.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you or /u/pmont know of a blog post or something that elaborates on this point more? That it's likely there's a greater than 50% protection 10/11 days after the administration of the first shot?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not that it’s likely, it’s that it’s a statistical fact. By definition people will have been exposed to covid right before or immediately after the first dose and will develop the disease before the vaccine has a chance to actually do its thing. These people get counted against the efficacy of the single dose because they got diagnosed after it was given, but that isn’t the vaccines “fault.” It is a statistical certainty that the 50% number must then underestimate the efficacy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Moderna data linked in the top-level comment has numbers on page 28. If you take all cases after the first dose the effect is &quot;only&quot; 80%, but most of the remaining infections were in the first two weeks. Starting 14 days after the first dose the protection is 92%.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is the key. The people who got the second dose were conditioned on not getting infected in the time between injection and immunity from the first dose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So is the second dose meant to ensure that the immunity lasts longer? Or what is the point of a second dose if a single dose has that high of efficacy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very likely it was just an experiment constraint. No one expected the vaccines to be as effective as they have turned out to be, so they wanted to be able to check the efficacy of multiple doses.</p></div>		</li>
