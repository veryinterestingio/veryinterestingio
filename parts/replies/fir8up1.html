			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but that's why you have the ability to do things like double down and split, get paid 3:2 on blackjack, and also why you can vary your strategy based on the dealer's face up card. All of this brings the house edge down to about <a href="https://wizardofvegas.com/guides/blackjack-survey//" target="_blank">0.5%</a> depending on the specific rules, if you play according to basic strategy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You mean for the <em>house</em> to make a profit, correct?</p>
<p>I mean, even if the player somehow made 0.5%, that's only significant if you don't value your time. You could earn more by just leaving the money in your savings account.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but what percentage of players play like that?</p>
<p>Still a good point that you can get that %.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you sit down at a blackjack table and don't play that way you will first be told you're wrong by the other players. If you do it again you will be alone at the table with the dealer. Blackjack players don't fuck around with other people at their table playing like shit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to <a href="https://wizardofvegas.com/guides/blackjack-survey//" target="_blank">this list</a>, there are at least a dozen places in Vegas where you can play $5 3:2. Most are downtown or off-strip, but there are 3 places on the strip listed as well. Most casinos on the strip have 3:2 blackjack for $15 or less.</p>
<p>Don't play 6:5 ever!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no such thing as a double bust.  The house will not /can not bust if you bust.  Since you are talking about single player odds I presume we are both talking about a single player game.  If you mean that on a table with multiple players the dealer can bust and it doesn't change the status of previous losers, that is correct - but that is not a practical or even typical way of looking at or describing the game.  The instant you go over 21 your money is already in the rack.  The other players will act on their hands and either also bust or stay with something. The dealer is not going to fish your cheques out of the bank and give them back to you if they bust later on when playing their hand against remaining players.  It's odd to phrase it that way.</p></div>		</li>
