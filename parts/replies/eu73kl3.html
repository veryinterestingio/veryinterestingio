			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. You need a lookup table.</p>
<p>So once the brain gets the inputs it has to go fetch the memory.</p>
<p>Ignoring what is driving the need to get the memory, the brain part that is responsible for fetching the memory from.... er... Itself probably does what this guy talked about.</p>
<p>However that lookup table to know that such a memory exists must be there, another table or field to confirm that pages of this memory should be searched for here instead of randomly scanning the entire brain everytime.</p>
<p>All these lookup tables have to be itself stored somewhere. In cells or the brain? Again as what OP described as connections between cells?the synapses?</p>
<p>So puzzling.</p>
<p>I feel the brains understanding of the brain is limited by that very limitation of the brain</p>
<p>Meaning we will never understand a limitation of the brain due to thaf very limitation in the brain. The only way would be to evolve beyond today to overcome it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember a long time ago hearing of a study where rats were frozen to the point of no neural activity. Then they were thawed, resuscitated, and could remember things from before the freeze- thereby indicating that memory did have some sort of physical hard drive. I guess the theory was that if memory was just a collection of endless firing synapses, the memory would not survive the freezing. </p>
<p>Was this true? If so, I'd love to hear your take on this</p></div>		</li>
