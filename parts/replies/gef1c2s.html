			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay that was super clear but, I'm still struggling with the comparison with a piece of fabric, I now get how it gets stretched and everything but why is <em>gravity</em> comparable to that. I don't know if that too complicated of a question but I guess my new question is what is gravity hahaha and how can weight affect it ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't really know what gravity is; we know how it behaves but not why. Resolving that is one of the greatest unanswered questions in physics today.</p>
<p>Gravity is just the name we give to the phenomenon that &quot;our universe behaves as if mass distorts spacetime&quot;...that might be what actually happens, or it might be something totally different that's just observation-ally equivalent (quantum physics suggest that might be the case), but it freakishly accurately predicts what we can observe. &quot;Weight&quot; is what we call the force that gravity causes on masses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's never made sense to me why we compare everything to a piece of fabric like the universe is not one dimensional so placing a heavy ball inside a giant block of memory foam makes more sense to me but would that be a wrong analogy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that one's really good, another nice thing about this; you suddenly start feeling like every single planet and massive thing is almost a black hole, but for the fact that their holding themselves from falling into their centre of mass, which is basically correct.</p>
<p>It actually makes you feel gravity in action within the space, or at least it did me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Physicistüôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è So the ‚Äòfabric‚Äô in this analogy represents spacetime. That word confuses people a lot. Think about just space: in the world around you you can move up/down, forward/back, or left/right. In our limited perception, it would seem this is all that exists, but for various physical/mathematical reasons we know this to not be the case. Space and time are actually part of the <em>same thing</em> (with the up/down analogue being forward/reverse in time). So when space is distorted, time must also be distorted - and vice versa. </p>
<p>Energy creates distortions in spacetime, and matter is <em>very</em> concentrated energy. Matter also moves through curvature in spacetime (like the water drop moving down the stretched fabric). This is what causes orbits. So, matter tells spacetime how to curve and the curvature of spacetime tells matter how to move. What we call gravity is just the ‚Äòforce‚Äô driving the motion of matter through spacetime.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But why is there orbit? I mean unless gravity works in pulses of same frequency. It's impossible to maintain same orbit. It will just become slope going towards planet right?</p>
<p>slope like below.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait but why is the concept of time tied to light (and thus vision). If I close my eyes and don‚Äôt move time is still passing...right? Or is it that gravity can change the speed of light which is supposed to be consider a constant and so if the speed of light changes it must be because ‚Äútime‚Äù itself has changed?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Time isnt a physical thing it's a way to explain distance. Gravity affects distance by bending how far or short you travel.</p>
<p>If you remember that time is just a human concept and not a factual thing then it's easier to understand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>can you explain how gravity affects how far or short we travel? gravitational acceleration? </p>
<p>but if that's how it works then why are their orbits instead of just collapsing on planet in slope of spacetime?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The speed of light is constant. When you travel really fast both time and distance change to allow speed to be the constant.</p>
<p>A 5 Metre long car fits into a 3 metre long carport if it's travelling fast enough.</p>
<p>But in normal life, we consider time and distance to be constants.</p>
<p>If you can get your head around that, you might be able to learn something meaningful from the rest of the comments :)</p></div>		</li>
