I remember a Chinese guy once telling someone at work that software name is better written using the original name in english, like Photoshop or something.</p></div>		</li>

<p>spelling </p>

<p>iPhone is iPhone. But a lot of older people who don't know English at all will call it 苹果 (apple). So iPhone6 is Apple6. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The periodic table is one recent set of newly minted characters, but an even larger set are the terms used in organic chemistry. This is a huge set of new characters:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_nomenclature_in_Chinese" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_nomenclature_in_Chinese</a></p>
<p>It is important to point out that the characters were not just devised on the go by scientists. A committee convened to come up with the characters and their official use was established by decree. I think that's a big part of the OP's question.</p>
<p>As for the term &quot;computer&quot; in Chinese, it isn't &quot;computing machine&quot;; it is &quot;electric brain&quot;: 電腦.</p></div>		</li>
