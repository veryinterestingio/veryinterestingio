			<div class="markdown"><p>I own dogs. Dogs that steal food. I <em>know</em> beyond a shred of doubt that those fuckers plan to seize the food to be stolen, wait, and choose when to act. I can observe the intent.</p>
<p>I do <em>not</em> believe they ask why they exist. I do think that the shelter dog asks &quot;why does he not like me&quot; if I'm not 100% sunshine and rainbows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't be surprised at all if animals have consciousness. The fact that dogs/other pets can be trained to do anything shows that they at least are aware of what is going on around them and be aware of different possibilities in the future.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many should be considered to have consciousness for some reasonable definition of it, consciousness is an spectrum. We are not some magic creature, we are slightly more &quot;advanced&quot; primates. Go look at the other ones, they are strikingly similar to us. Their attitudes and choices make it very obvious they function with very similar mental processes to us, in the grand scheme of things.</p>
<p>Dogs dream, doesn't that necessitate a consciousness, to put oneself in imaginary scenarios. They also learn, plan ahead, have creative problem solving, have empathy, have moods, have preferences, they have memory...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would add that consciousness is probably not a product of just a certain level of intelligence or complexity in the brain. A computer can do very sophisticated calculations, but is probably not conscious (yet?). </p>
<p>Consciousness is probably tied to specific capabilities in our brains that were selected for evolutionarily. For example, in order to predict the future, you need to be able to visualize future events. In order to predict another person's behavior, you need to have a theory of mind. Perhaps having thoughts of your own is a necessary step towards visualizing the thoughts of others.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>But no computer that exists today is anywhere near as complex as the brain, so what does that prove?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. The human brain has just shy of 100 billion neurons. We've built CPUs with more than 1 <em>trillion</em> transistors. BUT, I brought up computers mostly because &quot;intelligence&quot; is a difficult term to define, and many people think computers are &quot;smart&quot; because they can do math quickly.</p>
<p>Complexity is more concrete and better for this discussion. But even if we call that 1 trillion transistor CPU more complex than a human brain (debatable), my larger point is that there is no reason to think a thing is just automatically conferred consciousness by virtue of its complexity. </p>
<p>Probably the sort of theory of mind and self-introspection that was key to our survival millions of years ago plays a large role. Though of course, we have no way of <em>measuring</em> consciousness. Maybe that CPU <em>is</em> conscious. But, I'm guessing it probably isn't, and you would have to do more than simply scale up its transistor count, or the connections between them, to make it conscious.</p></div>		</li>
