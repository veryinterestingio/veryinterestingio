			<div class="markdown"><p>Immune system has nothing to do with this. Neither does regulation of body temperature, nor development of specific immunties.</p>
<p>It's to do with pharmacokinetics - mainly distribution (how much water/fat/muscle we are, how much protein available to bind to drugs in our circulation), metabolism (both liver and other sites, e.g. lunga and kidney) and elimination of drugs (mainly liver and kidney).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, like I said. The metabolism begins to change over the years. Secondary and tertiary immune systems are part of the toxin removal system that helps neutralize drugs into a state easily removeable by the liver and kidney.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting.  My daughter started to go through puberty at age 4.  It’s called precocious puberty.
She has an implant in her arm to stop the progression of puberty, but I wonder if she would have been able to process adult meds earlier in life due to her precocious puberty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only partially. Some stuff is dependent on sex hormone presence to form, other stuff depends on different growth hormones.</p>
<p>Also for adults it's usually assumed you are 70 kg with quite wide margins up and down for most drugs.</p>
<p>Under 12 it's simply much more important to dose by body weight, even if metabolism works just the same.</p>
<p>Can't give a 20kg child the same amount of drugs as a 70 kg adult, even if the metabolism is fully matured.</p>
<p>It&quot;s not like there's different adult and child meds, the active ingredients are the same.</p>
<p>But instead of the standard 500 mg for Paracetamol / Acetaminophen you get much lower doses and a body weight table determining how many of the pills etc.</p>
<p>That's also one of the reason children's meds are usually always liquid based rather than tablets/capsules. Much easier to just have a bottle with a syringe rather than 10 different tablet sizes (plus swallowability for young children)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a drastic oversimplification of the process brought about by rudimentary understanding from a 100 level bacteriology class and information picked up as a pharmacy technician. It is by no means a comprehensive explanation but adequate enough for a layman's understanding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>None of this is correct.</p>
<p>99.5 F is not a bad fever, that’s only about a degree F higher than average body temp. Medically, you don’t even have a “fever” unless your temperature is 100.4 F. At 102-103 F, you want to start paying attention more. A prolonged temp of 103+ can cause brain damage.</p>
<p>Also, with kids the risk of fever is higher and a temp of 101-102 is more a cause for concern than it is in adults. A prolonged temperature above 100F is indication of infection in infants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I think they're talking about how they felt vs dispensing actual medical definitions.  Also, the definition of a fever not nearly as solid as you allege.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An adult probably has a fever when the temperature is above 99°F to 99.5°F (37.2°C to 37.5°C), depending on the time of day.</p>
