			<div class="markdown"><p>Do solar sails act like a sail with wind or not, I know a sail can usually act as an aerofoil but can such a thing happen with a solar sail? </p>
<p>That said even if it did I am not sure it would help moving towards the sun, as you lack another medium like water to angle the hull in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Going by that mass.. Old SciFi novels theorize that future spaceships would be powered by leaving a piece of a nuclear reactor exposed to space, and generally provide thrust by throwing radiation away from the direction of travel. How large a reactor (in MW or GW, I guess) would be required for, say, travelling to Saturn รก la &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><del>Deepness</del> Depends on how fast you want to get there. If you're using nothing but high energy photons (so straight game rays), then years.</p>
<p>However, if you use the heat of that nuclear reaction to drive mass (Hydrogen, helium, xenon, water, etc), then hypothetically you could do it in weeks. A 500 t open cycle Nuclear Thermal Gas Core rocket with a 1 MN engine could burn brachistochrone to Saturn in 3 weeks, using the Nuclear reaction to heat liquid Hydrogen as propellant. There are some minor issues of irradiating the crew, and you can't actually carry that much fuel (your mass fraction would be something like 50000). But a burn and coast could still do it if you add a couple of months to coast. </p>
<p>Or you could go straight to the end of sanity, and plug a Nuclear salt water rocket into it. Long story short, it's as close to a continuously donating Nuclear bomb as anyone's come up with yet. And it could take a 15 kt spacecraft to Saturn at a 0.1g continuous brachistochrone burn in 4 weeks, on a mass fraction of about 2.6 (meaning only 61.5% of your mass is propellant).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's several thousand times the sun's escape velocity by the time that burn stops, when you get to Saturn what would be the procedure for stopping?</p>
<p>Would you do it Expanse style, accelerate for half the journey then turn and decelerate for the other half?</p>
<p>As peaceful as it sounds to float off forever until your atoms eventually decay in a trillion trillion years, I'd want to know how to stop before starting the burn. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. I like it. Constant thrust (even low acceleration) is so much better than coasting.</p>
<p>Perhaps that's why so many sf authors posit impulse or ion drives in their stories. They are plausible and do not violate any of the known natural laws. Or at least not by much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is termed a &quot;Fission Fragment Engine&quot;. But they're not just throwing out electromagnetic radiation, they're also throwing out massive decay products (electrons, neutrons, atomic nuclei) so that gives them a bit more thrust. <a href="http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/enginelist2.php#fissionfragment0" target="_blank">More details here</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>This is actually way more than I thought!   </p>
<p>So, assuming your batteries lasted at full power for a year, your flashlight in space would actually start moving at a very human noticeable amount after a year of being on just from barfing out photons?!  </p>
<p>Totally insane!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except that the batteries won't even last a day, so if you wanted to have it shine for a full year, you'd need to pack a flashlight with a lot of batteries, greatly increasing the mass of the contraption and thereby reducing the acceleration it gains from the light being emitted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We could quantify this in another way. Quick googling suggests that the maximum theoretical capacity of lithium-ion batteries would be around 3 MJ/kg. Assuming neglible mass for the actual LED and all the mass of the flashlight being in the battery, a 0.5 kg flashlight could potentially have a 1.5 MJ capacity sometime in the future. This would power the 3W light for 500,000 seconds, or almost 6 days, and give a total change in velocity of 0.005 m/s.</p>
<p>You are not really going to substantially accelerate using light powered by a battery. </p>
<p>On the other hand, if you consider different energy sources... Considering nuclear fission, Uranium has an energy density of 80,620,000 MJ / kg.  If we got all of that energy out, 0.5 kg of uranium could power that LED for almost a million years. Assuming you somehow had a near-zero reactor mass (so just considering the fuel mass), this would accelerate your nuclear-flashlight up to 268733 m/s (about 0.1% of lightspeed). Still not a particularly effective way to accelerate. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why the earth is warming up. People using artificial light when it's dark out means we are beaming photons out into space, away from the sun, causing us to slowly crawl closer to the sun! That's why I shine a big flashlight at the sun to slow out descent. You're welcome, humanity.</p></div>		</li>
