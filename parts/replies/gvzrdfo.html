			<div class="markdown"><p>Certainly, some soils are naturally too nutrient dense for certain plant species. In nature though, every species is adapted to the soil it grows in, so this wouldn’t happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It actually does happen in nature especially to smaller plants.  This is essentially what happens when poop kills grass or other weeds</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is a little bit backwards. Plants are adapted to particular kinds of soil, yes, but a seed also can't control which kind of soil it ends up in. Either it's an environment it can handle, in which case it has a chance at growing, or it's an environment that it's maladapted to — for instance, a seed of a low-nutrient-adapted landing in an extremely nutrient-rich patch of soil. We don't see that species of plant growing there, because the seeds or seedlings died early in life.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So, I'd say it <em>does</em> happen in nature!</p></div>		</li>
