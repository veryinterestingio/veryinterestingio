			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're referring to JAXA's Hayabusa2! Yes, there is excellent synergy between OSIRIS-REx and Hayabusa2, in that both are sample return missions from primitive asteroids. The Hayabusa2 asteroid, named Ryugu, has some key differences from Bennu, so we will learn different things from the returned samples of both asteroids. Most recently, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2020/bennu-vesta-meteorites/" target="_blank">we discovered evidence</a> that the asteroids have experienced different collisional histories. - Dani DellaGiustina</p></div>		</li>
