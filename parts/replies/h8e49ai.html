			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically why sore throats though? Presumeably it is simply the landing zone for the virus, the first place it attains a foothold, and, as the body hasn't developed any resistance, the infection runs amok for a while in that location inducing the severe inflamation - in that particular zone over any other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, simply speaking it’s sore throat because that’s where the highest concentration of pathogen, the primary site of infection is. Another reason sore throat happens often is that the throat is full of lymphoid tissue, where immune cells are concentrated. These tissues, the tonsils, are especially sensitive to pathogens and foreign substance, and act as the first line of defense. Even if the infection is non-specific, the throat is likely to react with stronger inflammation than elsewhere along the digestive tract because it’s full of immune cells.</p></div>		</li>
