			<div class="markdown"><p>Your nerves don’t really stretch or compress to accommodate an over overabundance of body fat. They do however accommodate by increasing their “feeling” radius so fat people can still feel their skin/body. </p>
<p>This does become a problem though for mordibly obese people where their fat becomes so enormous that they lose sensation due to nerves, blood being cutoff, or due to developing diabetes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quick question. If said obese person who has these accommodated nerves decides to loose a lot of weight, what would happen to the nerves? Would they return back to normal, remain or something third?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adult skin does not shrink very well after extreme weight loss, so the surface area would stay pretty much the same and the nerves would not revert to a smaller radius of sensation.
Some people have the excess skin removed after extreme weight loss (considered cosmetic, not usually covered by insurance) and surgeons will cut the nerves in the process. The surgeon may attempt to reattach large nerves if possible but post-surgery the patient will have no feeling in some areas since some nerves are not reattached to anything at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel stupid for asking to dumb it down, but, does that mean that you don't get more nerve endings but they adapt to pick up feeling in a wider radius? </p>
<p>Unless you're at that point where you lose sensitivity, does that in effect mean that you do 'feel more' since you can feel touch on a larger surface? Or does the feeling, because the radius is wider, get evenly distributed over the nerves in the same way that it would with a thin person, so they feel the same amount of touch?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re right, obese people don’t get more nerve endings but they adapt to feel a wider radius, this will happen gradually as you put on more weight so it’s not like you would notice it.</p>
<p>And yes, larger people have a greater pain tolerance when compared to smaller people (width) in one study, feeling temperature was unaffected though. </p>
<p>Also, obesity can cause you to lose nerve endings but I’m not a professional in this field. </p>
<p>So essentially, nerves don’t really change that much, their sensory radius can but at a cost of less sensation.</p>
<p>Edit: You are not dumb for asking me to simplify, that’s how we learn better.</p>
<p>Only the smart people ask questions, feel good about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer is yes, your skin is an organ and it will develop more sensory receptors when it grows. The opposite is true as well, if an obese person loses a lot of weight, the excess nerves will atrophy as the skin remodels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This brings up a good discussion about nerve length vs density. I couldn’t find anything about nerves growing due to increase in weight. </p>
<p>Nerves can grow/shrink but I thought that was due to old age/neuropathy. </p>
<p>Nvm, just found that neuropathy from obesity is a thing but the loss of nerves isn’t caused directly by being overweight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ive read that the older you are and the longer you have been very overweight the less likely it is your skin will shrink back because its less elastic.
Im in a similar boat, lost over 50lbs and im 42. Im trying to build muscle to &quot;pick up slack&quot; so to speak while i wait see how well my skin shrinks :p</p>
<p>Sometimes a ton of extra skin can lead to rashes and open wound type skin problems so theres skin reduction surgery for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The hormones responsible for enabling that sort of 'remodeling' decline with age, but that rate of declination isn't uniform from person to person. Diet, exercise, lifestyle, genetics all play a role.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answers. 2 additions:</p>
<p><strong>Two-point discrimination</strong> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-point_discrimination" target="_blank">wiki</a>) is the jargon term for how we measure this tactile resolution. It is the ability to discern that two nearby objects touching the skin are truly two distinct points, not one. Adults and kids can do a fun experiment. Bend a paper clip into a U and lightly touch a blindfolded friend on the back of their hand with both points. If they report feeling one point, move the points a little further apart until they can discern two distinct points. Try different body parts. You can map this (see below). Some great lesson plans are at <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/chtouch.html" target="_blank">https://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/chtouch.html</a></p>
<p>Another way you can look at tactile sensory resolution as discussed in other comments is by looking at what the brain receives and how it reconstructs the sensory input. Your [cortical] <strong>homunculus</strong> ([wiki] (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortical_homunculus" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortical_homunculus</a>)) is a great way to visualise your neurological tactile &quot;map&quot;, and will stay the same size. It's also something you will never be able to unsee. Sorry about that. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Side-black.gif" target="_blank">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Side-black.gif</a></p>
<p>Your body might get obese in the real world, but you're wired with only so many sensors (nerve endings), each individually wired with nerves back running back to the brain that were installed when you were in the womb. You don't get more.</p>
<p>I did my MSc thesis partially on this topic. Feel free to ask further questions.</p></div>		</li>
