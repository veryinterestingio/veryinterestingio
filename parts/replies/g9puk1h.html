			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the total kinetic energy, which itself depends on the velocity and mass.</p>
<p>Cosmic rays travel very close to the speed of light, but are individual particles like protons, so the total kinetic energy they carry is a lot for a proton, but not enough to make any noticeable impact on the Sun. Cosmic rays strike Earth regularly, so you can expect them to strike the Sun even more.</p>
<p>Larger objects that might be able to cause a cataclysmic effect when moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light typically don't get to that speed in the first place. When they do get to high speeds, it usually involves black holes, and black holes come with tidal forces that tear large objects apart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The term 'near' means very little when talking about the speed of light, but others have pointed that out already. Given that you asked the question, I thought you might enjoy these two articles on XKCD What If!</p>
<p>There's one where he tries to figure out what happens to a diamond meteor that hits the Earth at ever increasing speeds: <a href="https://what-if.xkcd.com/20/" target="_blank">https://what-if.xkcd.com/20/</a></p>
<p>And the first one ever, the relativistic base ball, which is a lot of fun and gives you an idea of the energies involved with things traveling at significant percentages of C: <a href="https://what-if.xkcd.com/1/" target="_blank">https://what-if.xkcd.com/1/</a></p>
<p>As with all XKCD content, there is hovertext for most of the images.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if this question has a meaningful answer, but: for an arbitrary object in our solar system that gets a typical kick, what fraction of those put it ultimately into the sun / just into a different orbit / out of the system?</p>
<p>Like, is it really easy to fall into the sun? Is it really hard to leave the solar system?</p>
<p>EDIT: to anyone passing by, you should go down this rabbit hole. Thanks all for the responses. I always imagined the sun's gravity like running up the down-escalator, but it's more like a tenuous precipice: put one foot wrong and you're gone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s extremely hard to reach the sun. </p>
<p>From earth the sun is the hardest object to reach in our solar system. It’s not immediately obvious, but to reach the sun you need to shed all your orbital velocity - this takes more energy than reaching either mercury or Pluto. </p>
<p>If you have anything other than negligible orbital velocity left you’ll miss the sun and end up in an extremely elliptical orbit.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if it’s possible for objects within the solar system to naturally reach it. I don’t think slingshots (using a planets gravity to boost your velocity) would work to get enough change in velocity unless they’re supplemented with rocket power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Difficult to tell, but there is a related metric: Near-Earth objects (objects with an orbit somewhere close to Earth's orbit) typically stay around for a few million years before they either hit something or get ejected from the Solar System.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.boulder.swri.edu/~bottke/Reprints/Morbidelli-etal_2002_AstIII_NEOs.pdf" target="_blank">This paper</a> discusses the relative probabilities. The chance to end up in the Sun varies from 8% to 80% depending on the type of orbit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more likely they end up being on an extremely elliptical orbit, but that in itself is a problem for the object as that is more likely to put it on a course that gives meaningful interactions with other large bodies. </p>
<p>Enough little 'kicks' will eventually be enough to reduce the orbital velocity or even reverse it. In fact it's more likely that you end up with an object changing its orbit direction than de orbiting, but even though there is an ultra low chance there is simply so many objects that it's a certainty that this happens.
In 1998 a large comet was spotted impacting the sun by NASA SOHO and again in 2011. Comets are easier to spot as they approach the sun due to ice melts, asteroids not so much, but like most things, just because we don't see it happening doesn't mean it's not</p></div>		</li>

<p>If someone showed me how some sequence of planetary flybys could reduce an asteroid's orbital velocity enough that it started falling into the Sun, I would believe it... but they would have to show me.</p>

<p>It's trivial with an eccentric orbit. <a href="https://www.boulder.swri.edu/%7Ebottke/Reprints/Morbidelli-etal_2002_AstIII_NEOs.pdf" target="_blank">Here is some modeling</a>.</p></div>		</li>
