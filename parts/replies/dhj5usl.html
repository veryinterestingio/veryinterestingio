			<div class="markdown"><p>I've tried to find studies on the use of Soylent but there don't seem to be that many...(none) You would think they'd be all over Soylent, looking into the benefits and if there are negatives associated with a 100% Soyelent diet. Do you know of any studies? Cause I'd love to see some science on it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Soylent is basically just an enteral feeding formula that isn't marketed to people with feeding tubes. Nutritionally it's comparable to products like Osmolite Abbott, Nutren, and Nestle Compleat which are used as total meal replacements for people with FGDD and other Gastrointestinal disease (like IBD) that require EN feeding (NG, NJ, PEG, PEJ, etc)</p>
<p>There are already tons of studies detailing the effects of EN feeding, so Soylent isn't exactly that exciting from a medical study perspective. It's just a brand that's marketed towards the an already healthy and GI-functional audience. </p>
<p>My dietitian and Gastroenterologist actually recommend Soylent and similar drinks for people like me who only have temporary NJ tubes and swap between EN and oral feeding based on flare ups. When I don't have my NJ tube, I drink Schmilk (basically soy-free Soylent - i'm allergic to soy) and when I do have an NJ insitu, I run the schmilk through the pump, So no need for additional formulas. </p>
<p>(side note, Schmilk is cheaper than Soylent in my country, Soylent is $7.50 a day but Schmilk is $4.50 a day)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I lived off Soylent for 3 months. I supplemented it with protein powder to meet my caloric needs and for &quot;muh gains&quot;. </p>
<p>I was seeing a VA doctor during that period and while my BP, sugar, sodium, and cholesterol were always on the healthy side they got &quot;healthier&quot;.</p>
<p>One main benefit, (and the reason for me drinking the pancake mix flavored bevarage) was the fact that I could easily monitor my calories. I'm a thin guy with a high motabolism and I can never seem to tell if I'm hungry. While drinking the Soylent I managed to gain 20lbs of muscle and gain a lot of definition, especially in my stomach. </p>
<p>As a cool side effect, my acne cleared a good bit, I had more energy, and slept better. </p>
<p>My GF at the time tried it for a month and &quot;ate&quot; at a deficit (1000 Cal if I'm not mistake) and lost 15 pounds without feeling weak, sick, or tired. She gave up because she loves food. She also experienced some of those added benefits regarding acne and sleep. </p>
<p>All in all, I think it's amazing and as soon as my budget allows I'll be back on it because the benefits are so worth the semen like texture of the pancake mixed flavored substance.</p>
<p>It isn't for everyone though, if you can't afford $400 a month, enjoy socializing over meals and drinks, or if you just love the flavor of things... You really do need to have an attitude of &quot;food is fuel&quot; for this stuff to work.</p>
<p>Not a scientific study but that's my experience of it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The difference between someone with slow or fast metabolism is around 200 calories a day. Most people who say they have fast metabolism as a reason to why they can't gain weight over exaggerate  its affects.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Considering all you really need to build muscle is protein it is safe to say that soylent itself isn't really anymore responsible than getting protein in any other way and nor does it affect where you get definition in specific parts of the body. Generally skinny people have good definition in the stomach because they have low body fat to begin with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I was about 70% Soylent (version 1.5) for about 5-6 months simply because I didn't have time to cook and just found Soylent easier. It's stupid easy to mix, there's very little cleanup, and you save a ton of time not having to shop. I'd still keep staples and snacks​ at home, and eat out occasionally when I didn't want to cook, but I was largely on Soylent. I had more energy and found it was cheaper than eating out. I ended up stopping shortly after I met my girlfriend. She cooks and finds the mere idea of Soylent disgusting. I've actually thought about signing back up for Soylent because once again I'm finding myself short on time with work, freelancing, and school.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean if you consider the cost of regular food per day, I'd imagine 7.5$ is not bad at all. Comes out to around 200$/month, which is pretty reasonable. </p></div>		</li>

Bought 40 bags for 100 euros ish.</p>
<p>I tend to eat junk food for lunch or just white bread for breakfast but now i have replaced those meals with Jake Food.
I feel like i have more consistent energy, clearer head and downing the food takes less then 30 seconds so you have so much more time to do other stuff.</p>
<p>Eventually i will live entirely on jake food as a test.</p></div>		</li>

Well they´re all knock offs to Soylent in that case. </p>
