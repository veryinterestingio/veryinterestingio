			<div class="markdown"><p>Beautiful analogy... but tbh, I don’t think it is the best explanation for what is going on. IMHO the explanations below pointing to problems in long running processes is more in point... though not as eloquent as this was.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like the explanation.  Especially because sometimes computers &quot;guess&quot; what the right data is, much like you you might think you hear your friend say something in telephone and assume that it's right.  It's the same kind of cheating that we do practically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What do you mean by guessing?</p>
<p>Outside of machine learning, I’m not sure in what way programs ever guess what data is.  </p>
<p>Maybe a condition that checks for x &lt;= [some number], where [some number] is meant to only be a positive integer, but due to corruption has somehow become -2147483647, which might fuck up the rest of the program due to the expectation of a positive number yet was allowed through by an open-ended condition.</p>
<p>I’m just curious what you meant, not trying to be snarky or anything. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An example of this is error correction.  When you send data, you can send extra bits that are calculated in such a way that you can recover the original information if it's garbled.  This correction has limitations; for example, it might be able to correct from errors in two other bits but not three other bits.</p>
<p>Sometimes errors are created in such a way as to make the error correction think it has fixed the problem, when it has not (because the error was way worse than the correction can account for).</p>
<p>I had this problem when we lost a server and some files were restored from errored backup tape.  Only about 3% of the files were &quot;recovered&quot;, but they were still all garbage.  The errors on the backup were worse than the corrections could compensate for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Error detection and parity bits are fairly common to be fair. Not strictly guessing but gaps can be filled.</p>
