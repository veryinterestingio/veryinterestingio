			<div class="markdown"><p>Say I want to buy a volcano and I buy the area 5 miles by 5 miles that contains it. Then I divide it up, can I sell off 14,909 acres or more than that because the land contained rises up 5,000 feet?</p>
<p>Honestly I took surveying in 1978 and worked with surveys for my working life and still didn't know how we accounted for elevation change and it's effects &quot;on the land&quot; 2 dimensional measurements. (luckily I lived in Houston and it didn't matter)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a Surveyor by trade. All boundary survey's that eventually determine the dimensions called out in the deed are based on a calculated flat single plane distance. </p>
<p>When we shoot the distance it will be with elevations taken into account. The distance measured will be a slope distance. The slope distance is used to <a href="http://www.jerrymahun.com/index.php/home/open-access/electronic-distance-measurment/16-edm-chap-a?start=2" target="_blank">calculate the horizontal distance</a> which is what will be called out in your deed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you run through the math on that...I got 7%</p>
<p>Also, A perfect cone is the shape that makes the least difference in surface area.  If we use a mile high ridgeline through the middle of a 5 mile wide plot, we get a difference of roughly 14% in measurements, which is certainly significant enough to quibble about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>3% is actually quite significant. 3% of an acre is a plot of about 36ft X 36ft or ~1300sqft.</p>
<p>Edit: I am stating this as an abstraction, not as an argument to measure land with elevation changes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gotta love how they phrase it, too:</p>
<p>&quot;Mathematically, a value of 1.000 would indicate perfect, platonic flatness. The calculated flatness of the pancake transect from the digital image is approximately 0.957, which is pretty flat, but far from perfectly flat. The confocal laser scan showed the pancake surface to be slightly rougher, still.</p>
<p>Measuring the flatness of Kansas presented us with a greater challenge than measuring the flatness of the pancake. The state is so flat that the off-the-shelf software produced a flatness value for it of 1. This value was, as they say, too good to be true, so we did a more complex analysis, and after many hours of programming work, we were able to estimate that Kansasâ€™s flatness is approximately 0.9997. That degree of flatness might be described, mathematically, as 'damn flat.' &quot;</p></div>		</li>
