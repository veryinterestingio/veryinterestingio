			<div class="markdown"><p>Good catch. I’ve edited the post to say 0.1 which is common indoors. According to Osha, 0.5% is the limit of what people should be exposed to for 8 hours. I’ve had to run calculations for keeping an area below 1%, as nobody spent much time in that area. All kind of irrelevant, as getting oxygen in to a dying brain is generally more important than a slight headache.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a fun (albeit weird, and probably frowned upon) experiment that you can fully try on your own, using just the method you stated i.e. a balloon. (DISCLAIMER: MAKE SURE THE BALLOON IS IN NO WAY PERMANTLY SEALED TO YOUR MOUTH)</p>
<p>You'll start to feel the Hypercapnia (C02 poisoning) first before you feel the effects of hypoxia.  It has been a while since I've last tested it, but I think I would get around 3-4 &quot;good&quot; breaths, then several short rapid breaths before it became too uncomfortable and I would get light-headed and let the balloon fly from my mouth.</p></div>		</li>
