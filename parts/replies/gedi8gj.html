			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember working in Loss Prevention for a large [now mostly defunct] retail chain. We had a monthly budget that was essentially &quot;use it or lose it&quot;, which amounted to enough money typically to buy a few pinhole cameras, or new wiring or whatever.</p>
<p>Our store &quot;at its best&quot; had about 40 stationary cameras setup throughout the store and 6 PTZ [Pan, Tilt Zoom] cameras that were far more useful and covered way more ground. In the time I worked at that store half of those PTZ cameras were not working and so large amounts of the store did not have any type of useful camera coverage.</p>
<p>The problem? Our 'monthly budget' was not enough to buy a new PTZ camera, but 2-3 months of budget would have been, but no, can't save up or anything. . So my manager would just end up buying useless shit each month just to keep the amounts consistent.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Everywhere I've worked has had annual budgets and you could blow your wad this year on all the new camera upgrades and next year work on fiber optics or something.</p></div>		</li>

<p><del>True. But also It was a single Letter-&quot;Mart&quot; bought out by a company that didn't learn how to adapt to a changing market, and that likely had something to do with it.</del></p>
<p>Edit: clearly the opposite of what I said.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Trying to get out now. It's not a dept that will ever fit into the business strategy of a publicly traded company. Good LP numbers do not bump stock prices.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with LP is that it's kind of like the IT department in that if it's working correctly your numbers should suck, but also, it could just mean that your department sucks. Good LP should be super preventative, because realistically you're not going to actually &quot;stop&quot; the majority of shoplifters.</p>
<p>I remember once watching a group of people &quot;hiding&quot; in the makeup section of the store, with 2 spotters, while another two people sat in the corner stashing shoe boxes and putting on the shoes to walk out of the store - Like super super obvious theft. But of course, I couldn't stop them because I didn't witness them take the shoe boxes from the shoe department [other side of the store], and of course I couldn't get the rest of my team to look on our cameras, because that was one of the sections of the store with cameras that barely worked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No see you have to do it the opposite way. Pay for a big project you currently don't have the money for, by borrowing against your future budget. Making no allowances for shortfalls or continued maintenance! </p>
<p>Because apparently it makes much more fiduciary sense to borrow against the uncertainty of funding over time, than it does to actually acquire the funding and go from there...</p>
<p>I too worked for government.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. One thing that I would add is that a budget is not actual money, so just because you have a budget that doesn't mean you can or should spend it all and of you're fiscally responsible it doesn't mean that budget should be reduced.      </p>
<p>The fundamental problem with reducing budgets is that when you actually need the money then it's not available and the organization may not be able to cover your cost. This could lead to your department not being able to cover costs for one-time operational needs and ultimately organizational failure in worst cases. So you always try to pad your budget or spend it down to keep safe from running into those kind of problems. In responsible organizations all spending is meticulously recorded so you just can't go on a spending spree. In those cases the department will end up doing much needed repairs or replacements of aging equipment for example.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Exactly right.  A budget is a plan.  Plans can change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol...that's a funny joke.  My last two employers had double fuckery.  Every new budget is algorithmically allocated off the previous period expenses. Thus fostering &quot;use it or lose it&quot;.  Also, tying managements bonus to budget performance.  We would literally allow the company to fail most of the quarter such to absolutely make budget.  Lots of duct tape.</p>
<p>Edit: I'll add that my current co.pany is quite different.  They don't give a shit about budgets.  I've seen better fiscal responsibility watching YOLO plays on wallsteetbets.  We will literally spend money on anything, especially if it has questionabke/no payback.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IT people like to talk shit about management-types without an IT background who get put in charge of IT departments, and i'll agree that i've heard (and lived) my share of stories about incompetent managers fucking stuff up</p>
<p>but a good management-type who speaks management-ese would be handy to sort out problems like this</p>
<p>&quot;we'd like $500 to replace a redundant power supply in the server; we realize it's not in our budget, but we'd like to highlight the importance of this server, that the redundant power supply isn't strictly necessary for day-to-day operation but protects us from total server failure, and that with some figures from accounting, if the primary power supply fails without a backup, we could incur losses from $20-50k per day for anywhere from a week to a month while we wait on replacement parts&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>IT:  Management, can we haz $500 to swap out the failed redundant PSU?</p>
<p>Management:  Perhaps.  Can you explain why wasn't it covered under a maintenance contract?  What is the risk if we don't replace it?  Is there redundancy or resiliency built into the applications that the server supports?</p>
