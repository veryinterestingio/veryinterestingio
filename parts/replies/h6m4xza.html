			<div class="markdown"><p>This post hits me differently because caffeine only keeps me awake if I'm tired but doesn't make me feel energized beyond that. I've had 800mg of caffeine in a day one time because my job offered free Starbucks double shot energy drinks and I had 6 over the course of a day. I never felt wired at all, is there something different about the way I process caffeine?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. I have ADHD and caffeine has never made me wired. Just focused. Though it did become problematic last year when I drank 3 energy drinks almost back to back (maybe 45 mins between them; I was trying really hard to cram for a chemistry exam and it was all I could do to focus) and my heart started flipping out. Felt like a heart attack, but not sure it was. Had the pain in the left arm, the toothache, the lightheadedness, etc. Went to ER and they did an EKG and troponin test and all that jazz, and it was all clean. Just ultra high pulse. But still didn't feel wired.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have ADHD, no. Lots of drugs effect me much differently to other people. Alcohol relaxes me and makes me wanna just sit down and do nothing where as other people get super fucking obnoxious and awful to be around when they drink. Marijuana makes me super anxious, dizzy, and sick. I get whatever the opposte of &quot;mellowed out&quot; is. I've tried different doses, strains, and methods but they all have the same effect.</p>
<p>It's a shame because people tell me how good weed is and I fuckin' hate it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I personally wouldnt describe high doses of caffeine as feeling wired either, because not very much dopamine is released, no where near that of adderall or any amphetamines.</p>
<p>Everyone has different levels of metabolic enzymes so yes, everyone will process all drugs differently. There is also tolerance which again will vary the drug response from person to person, independently of genetic predisposition due to the levels of enzymes you have. And also for some drugs, body weight can effect the strength of effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, yeah I saw that part but there were a lot of conditions in that section that I wasn't sure on. Also just associate dopamine with feeling good or happy, not really with feeling energized.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Typically when you experience things that make you happy, they give you mental energy and drive because dopamine is automatically released from your brain. It functions as a motivator for &quot;good&quot; behavior. You feel good because you are doing some action (mainly food and sex) that is contributing to your survival or the reproduction of your genes.
We motivate our selves to get dopamine to feel good because our brains want to survive and reproduce our genes. </p>
<p>When we trigger the release of dopamine it is faking this mental energy for a sustained period while the drug is in your system, hence making you feel wired.</p>
<p>Tbh &quot;wired&quot; is not a term I'd use for caffeine, but I have a high tolerance naturally so maybe you respond more intensely to it than me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know &quot;wired&quot; isn't really a proper description, but it just didn't make sense that if all caffeine was doing was removing the chemical that promotes feelings of being tired, that excessive caffeine would result in feelings of anxiosness/restlessness, elevated heart rate, etc.</p></div>		</li>
