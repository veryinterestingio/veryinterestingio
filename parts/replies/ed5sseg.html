			<div class="markdown"><p>My comment wasn't a guess, it was short and simple explanation for why different eye colors have developed. It didn't address the melanin reason, as that was in the answer of several comments. I understand that I could have made it absolutely clear that there is no possible definitive answer, a common issue.</p>

<p>I do agree that my comment should be removed because of this. However I do have an issue with your response (your comment, not the removal of mine). </p>

<p>This may turn away Redditors who could add something to a post. The rest of your comment is fine and I agree with how it is write. It also makes the part I quoted unnecessary.</p>
<p>Thank for your time.</p></div>		</li>
