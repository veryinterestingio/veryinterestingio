<p>You have billions and billions of bacteria on and in you.  Look into the toilet sometime, and that shiny brown thing and you will see billions of Escherichia coli (E coli) bacteria.  They are symbiotic with us, they protect us.  Kill all the E coli in your gut and in short order your GI system would not work well and you’d likely get a pathogenic (bad) bacterial infection.</p>
<p>Clean and germ-free homes?  Chicken can carry Salmonella a serious pathogenic bacteria (that doesn’t make chickens ill) and washing hands after coughing (to protect others) makes sense.  But consider this: “Children from wealthy families are more likely to get polio than children from poor families. This is because children from poor families grew up in non-hygienic surroundings so they developed a partial immunity to polio.”</p>
<p>What happens when you weed your garden?  Your skin gets tough and you get protective callouses.  Well, the same thing can happen if you’re exposed to germs—your immune system kills them and remembers to knock ‘em dead if they re-appear.  That is why poor kids got less polio (polio was a devastating disease caused by poliovirus and almost all are immune to it because you got vaccinated as a kid.</p>
<p>Keep your kitchen counters and chopping blocks very clean, but let kids play and dig and get dirty and forget trying to kill every germ because you are covered—inside and out with good ones.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A poo? As I'd personally never describe a shit as shiny unless someone's been eating glitter or such</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bravo, you are correct: &quot;Each year, more than 3.5 million cases of chickenpox, 9,000 hospitalizations, and 100 deaths are prevented by chickenpox vaccination in the United States&quot;  It's now very uncommon in the US, but pretty common in many countries.  It can be especially dangerous when a pregnant woman gets chicken pox as it can affect the fetus.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The yearly flu (influenza) lasts only about a year, but not because the immune system weakens, it's because the virus changes and the body no longer recognizes it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Viruses use the host's cells to duplicate and during the duplication errors always happen creating viruses variations, right? If this is true, this is true for all viruses but you said in a way that apparently this is only true for some viruses. How can that be?</p></div>		</li>
