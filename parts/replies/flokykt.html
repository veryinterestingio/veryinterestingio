			<div class="markdown"><p>It's really hard to do, if not impossible. Single vaccines already need a very specific balance of preservatives, adjuvents and other chemicals tailored to the specific strain. It took a tremendous amount of research to develop processes for making the combination vaccines we already have.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really -- if COVID-19 has proven anything, it's that a virus only needs one host who can share it with others to stay around.</p>
<p>So the self-isolation will kill lots of instances of viruses, but if *any* instances of that virus is still around in SOMEONE, it will get a chance to get out again.</p>
<p>This virus is going to become part of our lives.  The hope with this quarantine is that we can slow it down enough so that the people who need acute care when they get the virus still can.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Transmission rate was only 2.5 or something.  With some ongoing containment measures this and other illnesses could be way less common.</p>
<p>It's thought that people are most infectious when they have symptoms. If we eliminate coming to work sick, of anything, we would get rid of a lot of it.</p>
<p>Also, a general social shift away from going to crowded restaurants on a regular basis would probably have a lot of indirect positive effects as well.</p>
<p>The important thing is that we do not ever accept this as just a normal thing that happens.  Going places when you are sick needs to no longer be expected, encouraged, or popular.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought it was only about three. Wondering, is being deadly an evolutionary flaw in viruses? You'd think it's in their interest that the host lives as healthly as possible and spreads them as far as possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Viruses do &quot;prefer&quot; to be less harmful to the host in the sense that evolutionary pressure encourages that sort of behavior. If a host is dead or immobilised, they cannot continue to replicate and transmit the virus. Anecdotally, this is why common cold viruses are so successful - they infect the host, but in such a way that the host is still mobile enough to spread it around their communities.</p>
<p>That's not the only viable strategy, for example HIV is eventually deadly (loosely speaking, nobody dies from HIV) but does not harm the host until it has had plenty of time to spread the virus. Norovirus somewhat immobilises the host, but is explosively contagious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most deadly viruses are a result of a process called zoonosis, where a not deadly virus of an animal gets transmitted to a human, where, if it can get a foothold, can become deadly.</p>
<p>It is in fact extremely evolutionary advantageous for a virus to coexist with their host, so most of the human ones don't cause extreme illness, and the symptoms they cause are mostly due to the bodies response.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a common perception (and was accepted as true until the 80s), but isn't the case.</p>
<p>There is a tendency for useless virulence (i.e. virulence which doesn't increase the fitness of either host or pathogen) to be eliminated. But useful virulence is not selected against.</p>
<p>Look at, say, cholera - untreated, it kills about half its victims. That's extremely deadly! So why is the fatality rate (when untreated) so high despite coevolving with humans for centuries? The severe diarrhea that makes it so fatal also helps it spread. It's useful virulence.</p>
<p>In essence, sometimes it's evolutionarily advantageous to be less deadly. In others, it's better to be deadlier. It really depends on the specifics of the system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a few ways to look at this.  First is that while killing the host is definitely a flaw, the important thing is how infectious the virus is.  If virus A can infect 2 people before the host gets better, and virus B can infect 4 people before killing the host, B has the advantage there.</p>
<p>The other thing is that this is still a new virus.  As it's thought that Covid19 is a virus crossed over to us from animals, this virus has not yet been optimized for humans, and it's possible that a less deadly version will emerge and then out-compete the more deadly version for the reasons you said.  This is one theory for what happened to swine flu 10 years ago.</p></div>		</li>
