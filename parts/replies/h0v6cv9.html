			<div class="markdown"><p>This topic was posted in personal finance the other week, according to that top answer, they ask you the zip you're in and the model and then they connect you with a legit dealership in your area and then the scammer listens in while you tell the legit person your details.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So shouldn't there be something done at the point that people begin talking to the dealership? I mean if you are talking to someone legit and you are asking about some extended warranty that doesn't exist, shouldn't that be a red flag they pick up on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was also posted a few weeks ago. Guy said to explain to the dealership that you’re being scammed to help them find a way to help defend against it. Not sure what they can possibly do though. </p>
<p>I have no doubt Pakistan and those other countries don’t give a rats ass and honestly probably support the “business”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't talk to these guys much anymore, because they almost never call you directly, but my favorite thing to do when they'd call is give them a realistic, but fake credit card number, and read it to them in a different confusing way each time. They get so mad after a few attempts.</p>
<p>Yes, my number is: 4266...147...6...99...1...7...222...4</p>
<p>Ok, I'll read it again:  42...6...6...one hundred and forty seven...699...seventeen...2...2...24</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I spent 45 minutes on the phone with the &quot;IRS&quot; having given them a fake name and a fake social security number. When it got to the point where I was supposed to stay on the phone and drive to a store to buy gift cards for them to settle my issue without having a warrant put out for myself I started giving the guy a hard time. And since they had given me a number to call halfway through the whole thing I had their number. I blew up their phones from 3 different lines just really digging at the guy for hurting people. I got him to tell me to go fuck myself. It was amazing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This just isn't true. Scammers for the most part send out THOUSANDS of emails, make hundreds of calls per day. The emails are in alot of cases purposely lacking in correct spelling, punctuation etc. this is to weed out &quot;smart&quot; people. They are specifically looking for people stupid enough to fall for it. There are scam centers that make as much as a medium sized business doing scam calls and emails, faking microsoft tech support, love scams etc. It's insanely profitable regardless of the amount of people wasting their time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Told them I had a 1988 Ferrari 308 and I really needed that extended warranty. </p>
<p>Not even sure the 308 was made in 1988. Seems about right though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. Its a scam, every minute they spend on the phone with you, putting garbage in their database, is a minute they are not scamming someone with dementia out of their life savings. </p>
<p>This may not be THAT scam, but, it could lead there. Scammers sell information to each other, especially about the people who fall for scams. </p>
<p>Keep them on the phone until they hang up on you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder how that actually works..<br />
First thing youd do is to ask them to tell you what kind of car you have. Its license plate or something tangible that they absolutely would know if they were legit.</p></div>		</li>
