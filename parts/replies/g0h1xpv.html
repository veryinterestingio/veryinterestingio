			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just regular. They cross two types of watermelons, a diploid and tetraploid so the resulting is a sterile triploid seed, which grows but cannot form seeds to reproduce.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You take two specific types of watermelon and crossbreed them, the resulting watermelon also produces seeds, but when planted those will grow seedless melons.</p>
<p>So yeah, they keep getting seeds from &quot;regular&quot; watermelons. Just ones that have been purposefully bred.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Man I saw a PBS , or something like that, special on that. It was crazy. Some area was bare after a forest fire so they were taking branches and shit from other trees and splitting them and wedging them into the others. It was wild</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a correction, seedless watermelons still have seeds. </p>
<p>They just do not mature into the large black seeds as would your more common watermelon.</p></div>		</li>
