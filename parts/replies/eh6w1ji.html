<p>they came up with a number like 10,000 years</p>

<p>From the actual <a href="https://www.cmog.org/article/does-glass-flow" target="_blank">Corning Museum of Glass</a> site:</p>
<p>&quot;The calculation showed that if a plate of glass a meter tall and a centimeter thick was placed in an upright position at room temperature, the time required for the glass to flow down so as to thicken 10 angstrom units at the bottom (a change the size of only a few atoms) would theoretically be about the same as the age of the universe: close to ten billion years.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>no ,no,thats another article about the myth of glass moving over time without exposure to a temperature change. the article i am talking about was a computer simulated model of the annealing curve of a piece of glass with a unique shape that they modeled cooling. the approximate amount of time it would take to organize and relieve all of the stress, and thereby the crystalline structure being grown to its fullest, was 10,000 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also so slow the time required to make an appreciable difference in dimensions through &quot;flow&quot; at room temp under tensile/compression force that won't break it is basically the age of the universe</p></div>		</li>
