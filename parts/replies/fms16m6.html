<p>That's expected to happen somewhere because there would be so many houses with multiple people.</p>

<p>Yeah, this really is the problem with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_truly_large_numbers" target="_blank">Law of Truly Large Numbers</a> as it applies to viruses.   Everything takes place on a bell curve.  While we can say for instance that &quot;Patients are virus free after 14 days.*&quot; There is always that asterisk &quot;Within 99.9% of cases&quot;.</p>
<p>When millions of little individual experiments in millions of patients and hundreds of millions of households are taking place, those improbable events are probable to occur.   The chances that out of say a million people every single one would be non-infectious after 14 days is very low.</p>
<p>What are the odds that someone will be asymptomatic for 14 days, sneeze on a book on day 14... it sit on the book for 3 weeks.. reinfect a roomate who is also asymptomatic... who then coughs on a closet door knob that doesn't get touched for another 3 weeks... 1 in a million?  Ok... with 1.5 million cases that's going to happen.</p>
<p>But, it is much easier to to contain an outbreak of a few hundred people than a few million.  So of course it's better to be dealing with the outliers than the fullblown pandemic.</p></div>		</li>
