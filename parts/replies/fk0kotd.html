			<div class="markdown"><p>You'll notice though that the back of a pickup truck sits slightly higher than the front of the truck.  This is to compensate for any load the truck may carry.  </p>
<p>The arch the OP is talking about is really noticeable in 18-wheeler flat bed trailers.  When they are empty you can really see the arch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>with the pickup truck the back is higher because the springs, shocks, etc. are built and installed to hold a load (say 2000 lbs). When there isn't the weight in the back the shocks are then much too stiff for no weight and the truck rides high. </p>
<p>This is part of the reason people complain about the ride in trucks and SUVs being so rough. They are designed for especially bouncy or heavy loads so when they are used on flat roads with no weight it makes for a rough ride.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As to why this is desirable, and arch has to push the sides outward to collapse, so you can beef up the sides to handle the weight fairly easily.</p>
<p>If it were flat, it would sag and pull the sides inwards, which is a harder thing to design around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not talking about wheel alignment.  To compensate for too much deflection, we will &quot;camber&quot; the structural member by an engineered amount.  Although, in buildings, we wouldn't do it for a temporary (Live) load...only permanent (Dead) loads.  Sounds like they do it for temporary loads on flat bed trailers to save weight.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Cambering a structural member does not reduce the amount it deflects, it just makes the loaded member flatter.  To reduce the amount of deflection, you'd have to stiffen the member.  For clearance purposes, deepening the member  to reduce deflections on a trailer is probably not an option, so the alternative is a heavier member but that isn't desirable for hauling.  So they camber it instead!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The guy you replied to is referring to the arch built into the bed, not the &quot;truck are high at the back&quot; thing.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Fwiw, &quot;camber&quot; is not only used to refer to an aspect of suspension geometry. For example, a roads surface will often have an amount of camber, to help with drainage.</p></div>		</li>
