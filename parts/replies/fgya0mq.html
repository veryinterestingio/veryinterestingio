			<div class="markdown"><p>A similar way to look at it is to consider the proportion of heads. Seeing 20 heads, that proportion is currently 1. After 20 more flips, we'd expect 10 H and 10 T, giving a proportion 30/40 = .75. After 100, we would expect (20+40)/100= .6. this is regression toward the mean of .5: going from 1 to .75 to .6 on average. meanwhile, the gambler that expected more trails than 50% has also erred -- future flips occur at rate 50%.</p>
<p>Both assume a fair coun (or known proportion). Real people would do well to question that hypothesis and wonder if sleight of hand had substituted an unfair coin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can also look at it in the following way. Suppose you assign the value 1 to heads and -1 to tails. The mean value of a throw over a very large sample will tend towards 0. But the <strong>total</strong> value of all throws will <strong>not</strong> tend to 0!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the reason the two concepts are not in contradiction to one another is that regression to the mean takes place by growing the sample, or 'increasing the denominator' so to speak</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You expect the proportion to go back to 50/50 as n goes to infinity, not right away.</p>
<p>The future flips will be 50/50, and the long term trend will head that way even including the original 10 because the 10 will be a smaller and smaller part of the whole set.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're not supposed to take into account past flips at all. You expect the distribution to <em>be</em> 50/50. The past 10 flips being all tails is an anomaly. The next 10 flips are still expected to be 50/50. If you flip 10 tails, and then an infinite amount of alternating heads and tails, it will work out to 50/50. In reality, you're not going to flip infinity coins, but probability will still trend to 50/50 over time. 10 tails and 0 heads is very skewed. 110 tails and 100 heads is only kinda skewed. 1,000,010 and 1,000,000, barely a blip at all. Sure, maybe you'll get another fluke, but that fluke is just as likely to cancel out your first flike by being all heads, so on average it works out.</p></div>		</li>
