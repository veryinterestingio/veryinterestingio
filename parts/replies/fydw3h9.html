			<div class="markdown"><p>yup I went on the ghost tour there about 10 years ago.  Numerous people have died on that ship, one thing I remember from the tour was they showed us a huge sliding steel door that allegedly cut someone in half.</p>
<p>The tour is actually awesome, you get to go well below the water line into the &quot;bowels&quot; of the ship.  Really cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My grandfather and grandmother came back from europe after WW2, on the Queen Mary grandmother was Lativan. My grandfather shipped over to the European theater on it. When it became an attraction, he refused to go on it. Apparently he didn't want to board it back from Europe either. My parents told me it was cause he had lost so many friends that he shipped to Europe with. He told me because it reminded him of the worse smell in his life. Thousands of men packed like sardines for a month, and all their BO and vomit from them all being seasick. Him and my grandmother are passed now God bless their souls.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol, anytime someone mentions that ship all I can think of is the Arrested Development episode where Tobias buys a gay bar and names it &quot;Tobias is Queen Mary.&quot;</p>
<p>And then I think in another episode Lucille hijacks the actual Queen Mary and tries to run from the Coast Guard with it.</p></div>		</li>
