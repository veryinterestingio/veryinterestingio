			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question. Apparently the twisting of the tusk helps it grow straight. If there are not development or mechanical mechanisms in place (like twisting), the tusk would likely be curved, which is probably not good for the narwhal's hydrodynamics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They reach adulthood \~10+ years of age. This is likely when the length of the tusk starts to skyrocket, because it is when it is most important to have a long tusk. The final length of the tusk is likely the result of a complex set of factors, like genes, environment, age, etc. So long story short, its complex and we are not really sure if there is a point where it will stop growing or taper off.</p></div>		</li>
