			<div class="markdown"><p>Ooh, so maybe you know the answer to this! My son has a space book that says the astronauts have to go into the airlock for 12-24 hours prior to going on a space walk. That seems like a crazy long time. How long do they have to wait in the airlock before walking?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question. Astronauts have to do something called &quot;pre-breathe&quot; before EVAs (spacewalks.) Basically they lower pressure in the airlock (joint airlock: crew lock+equipment lock) to 10.2 psi. The goal is to get nitrogen out of the blood to prevent the bends. There's a variety of ways to do it. The way described in your book is outdated. They used to sleep overnight in the airlock to achieve this. Now they do something called in suit light exercise. Basically they get in the spacesuit at 10.2 psi and start wiggling their arms and legs. This increases their metabolic rate I believe to expedite this process. It doesn't take nearly as long.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I apologize for this question if stupid. There are two questions that I have always wondered and you might just have the answer.</p>
<p>If we keep venting 2.0 psi:</p>
<ol>
<li>What happens to the vented air?</li>
<li>If we carry air to the ISS an exorbitant number of times, does the earth's atmosphere get smaller? I am asking on larger scale. Say we took GIGANTIC containers of air into outer space, beyond the gravitational pull, and then purged it out into outer space?</li>
<li>(Bonus question if you don't mind) Does the air that seeps out into space form air bubbles like it would in water? Someone told me this a very long time ago and I've been confused since then.</li>
</ol>
<p>EDIT: I ask this question in earnest, folks. I know my user name is an easy target for &quot;NiCE trY GuBbErmiNt SPy B0T.&quot; but I am actually trying to learn a few things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No stupid questions. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Vented air will disperse onto space and likely become a part of the atmosphere again</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Idk how qualified I am to answer this, but I'm sure someone could do the math. It would have to be on a scale that is incomprehensible and for all intents and purposes impossible. </p>
</li>
<li>There is a certain amount of what we call &quot;spec leakage.&quot; Basically creating perfectly air tight volumes is nearly impossible so there's a very very small amount that leaks out over time, but it's pretty minute.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! That has settled many lingering questions Ive had for a while.  </p>
<p>To go back to the bonus, I made a typo. Does the leaked out air make little air bubbles in outer space like it would in water? I apologize and sincerely thank you.</p></div>		</li>

<li>The air gets vented into space, decreasing the overall mass of air on the vessel that's venting 2.0 PSI. The only way to get that air back is to literally refill the air from deliveries.</li>
<li>The amount of atmosphere on Earth is ridiculously large, so much so that all of humanity's efforts to do such a thing would be insignificant against the blatant mass of air the Earth holds. But, technically, yes, that total atmosphere loss would be measurable, as if it gets purged into outer space, some of it will return to Earth due to the Earth's gravitational pull but a lot of it would be lost.</li>
<li>No. It spreads evenly across the vacuum and <del>gradually</del> rapidly disperses into effectively no air pressure. Without anything to contain it, it will reach equilibrium with the vacuum of space, and stay in equilibrium with itself the entire time it's doing so.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify for /u/government_spy_bot :</p>
<p>If you're talking about venting massive amounts of air from the ISS: it orbits at an altitude of about 410km. When venting from there, we probably won't lose atmosphere no matter how many times we do it. 410km is well within the ionosphere (i.e. the upper atmosphere) and air released at that altitude would still be gravitationally bound to the Earth.</p>
<p>However, you also ask about venting beyond the earth's gravitational pull. That would probably involve venting the gas at an altitude above 192,200km. In that case, yes, the Earth would likely lose some or most of the gas.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Hey, so my (eventual) job is to actually assist in this process via ground commanding.</p>

<p>So you gonna work in the support call-center for the ISS? lol
Probably the coolest call-center in the world ^^</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All communication between the ISS and ground is done by astronauts only. The team on the ISS would likely say when the airlock is clear to the astronaut on ground control and then that information relayed to OP. Unfortunately nobody will call him Houston.</p></div>		</li>
