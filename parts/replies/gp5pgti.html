<blockquote>

<p>You're overselling the point. Exceeding 1kw or even 2kw in a sprint and 100kmh on a twisty descent are fairly common in competiton. Those might be small numbers in comparison to a car, but they're still substantial. Grip is a very serious consideration.</p>
<p>Everything is a compromise and ultimately weight and aero win out with nothing larger than 28mm (often less) seeing much use on road bikes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rolling resistance has actually become the biggest consideration in cycling tire widths. </p>
<p>If you look at the pro peleton, tire widths have grown substantially in the past few years. The contact profile of these wider tires is counterintuitively smaller than their thinner counterparts, leading to gains in efficiency that far outweigh the aero cost of adding tire width.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've see tests on YouTube proving this, a narrower tyre (with the same tyre pressure) creates a longer contact patch which introduces more rolling resistance, I wider tyre has a more rounded contact patch which gives the same grip with less deformation. </p>
<p>Off course you can counteract this with more pressure in the thinner tyre but it starts getting dangerous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, he's not overselling in my opinion. The lateral force supported on a bicycle tire is almost zero if you are not banked. It's simple physics. you have very little downforce, and any lateral force at the tire-surface interface will induce a moment that tips over the bike. A vehicle with 4 tires and a low enough center of gravity basically cannot tip over. If you balance a bike without moving, think how easy it would be for someone to tip you over. And no, there is no gyroscopic effect keeping you vertical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually not quite true.</p>
<p>Weight is one issue, and is major draw in the bicycle game.</p>
<p>Rolling resistance is where the main gains is with narrower tyres on bikes, hence the trend to narrow in road race bikes.  However at some point the trend reverses, too narrow requires higher pressures, and what you then get is a slow down due to the excessive vibration (bouncing up is a way to visualise this effect).  The modern trend has now moved to little bit wider wheels and tyres, and lower pressures, and its been found that speeds have increased with an increase in comfort (lower vibrations).  Better aerodynamics have also been a benefit.  Where once road bikes ran on 23mm or even 19mm wide tyres, we now see 25mm and 28mm predominate (with frames often built to accept up to 32mm in some cases).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I had bought my first triathlon bike, it came with the 23mm tires on it. Fast forward 2 years later when I decided to replace the tires, couldn't find the 23s anywhere, so the bike shop told me to get the 25s. I was amazed at how much more comfortable it is on the 25s</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And wider tires have higher wind resistance. When road bikes are designed to be as aerodynamic as rules will allow, wider than necessary tires are less efficient. Mountain bikes have wider tires than road bikes because the lower grip levels of dirt require wider tires to compensate.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Which is partly why F1 cars are so interesting. You've got these big, hulking tyres and designers have to surround them with such interesting little 'flicky' bits of bodywork to divert airflow away from them to stop them being so draggy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The the aerodynamic deep section wheels used are optimised for wider tyres. The tyres combined with the rims create a fairing reducing drag. 2-5mm on the front won't make a lot of difference compared to the potential gains you can make by adjusting rider position.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The wind resistance of the tires themselves is not a major concern outside of the track bikes you see at the olympics. Spokes, handlebars, the frame, and especially the rider are going to be far more important drag factors. Itâ€™s why track bikes minimize all that they can.</p>
<p>I agree way more with the JayTheFordMans reply to the same comment, itâ€™s more about rolling resistance. Thinner tires means higher pressure, a smaller contact patch, and less rolling resistance. There is some drag from fat tires but itâ€™s not the main factor that slows you down when you make them wider since the rest of the bike usually gets wider too.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From the simplified F=uR equation that's taught in Physics lessons - yes, but in the real world it doesn't hold up.</p>
<p>There are a couple of factors at play for bicycles specifically:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>increasing the stiffness of the tyre (which you have do as your contact area decreases - by increasing the air pressure in the tyre) increases the rolling resistance because it prevents the tyre absorbing vibrations. If you imagine rolling the wheel over a small bump: as the wheel goes over, it does some combination of deforming the tyre, or lifting the bike and rider - which generates some resistance. Increased stiffness increases the effect of the latter because it prevents deformation of the tyre and so increases rolling resistance.</p>
</li>
<li>increasing the size of the tyre increases your frontal area which increases your aerodynamic drag.</li>
</ol>
<p>At some point, 1 + 2 is at a minimum and that's the size you want to use for your bicycle.</p>
<p>There are other common examples where the simplified friction model doesn't apply - cars being a common one. Wider tyres give better grip because they are more resistant to deformation and shear forces - which otherwise make it easier for the wheels to slip. </p>
<p>On ice the contact area matters a great deal as a small enough contact area (e.g. iceskates) will pressure-melt the ice beneath it and the 3 part Ice/Water/Metal has a lower coefficient of friction than just Ice/Metal</p></div>		</li>

<p>For viscoelastic materials like rubber, it indirectly is. The maximum traction coefficient is slightly inverse with respect to the normal contact pressure.</p>

<p>You'll notice that as vertical load (z) goes up, the slope becomes non-linear. You increase N but don't get a corresponding amount of mu.</p></div>		</li>
