			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the only correct response (so far). One additional note for OP: any (older) weapon with a hammer; rifles, pistols, and even shotguns could be set to half cock. In the days of the side lock firing mechanism and revolvers up until the firing pin disconnect, it was the usually the only iteration of what we would today call a manual safety. Newer firearms do not usually have the half cock feature because they have other types of internal safety mechanisms.</p>
<p>Edit: added words since some are incapable of understanding nuance or the nature of ELI5...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. All my modern leverguns (Marlin and BHA) can have the hammer set to half cock, which is the traditional safety for such a rifle. Until the hammer is fully pulled back,pulling the trigger does nothing.</p>
<p>Marlin still has a lawyer button as an additional safety</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another benefit of the half-cock notch was that if you were manually cocking the hammer, but it slips before you pull it all the way back, it would be caught by the half-cock notch instead of striking the firing pin, which could potentially cause an unintended discharge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A small side note, revolvers can also be carried with hammer resting on an empty chamber. Technically it's safer, but has an obvious disadvantage of 1 less round.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is explained by John Wayne as Rooster Cogburn in &quot;True Grit&quot;. Just before a gunfight, he load that chamber and Mattie asks him why it's not loaded and he says something like it's so he doesn't shoot himself in the foot or something.</p></div>		</li>
