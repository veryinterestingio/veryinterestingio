<p>A few years later I was randomly biopsied by a concerned doctor on a small flat mole I had no worries about. It was malignant melanoma on my upper arm exactly where the burns were most severe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cancer free for 2 years far as we know, and it was caught before it had spread so I didn't need chemo which is also awesome. I got a pretty hefty scar from them taking a chunk of my arm but it's a small price to pay for such random and life-saving good luck! </p>
<p>I sympathize for those that didn't get it found as quickly. I had no symptoms and no worries, even the biopsy I thought was overkill until the results came back.</p>
<p>TLDR: see a dermatologist and get checked. It could be an hour of your life spent but it could save you many years. I'm not even 30 so it saved me a LOT of years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here, only my shoulders were cracks and crevices that were so bad they started to puss. I was 18 &amp; my first motorcycle meant you couldn’t drag me away from being outside.</p>
<p>Now I have those dark, flat spots you speak of, as well as others that are popping up in various places. Haven’t hit a doctor yet....other things are pressing in my life, unfortunately.</p>
<p>Edit: thank you all for the concern in telling me to get off my ass....I’m currently going through an interview process and things are looking good. Once I’m set I will make the appointment. I promise. :D</p></div>		</li>
