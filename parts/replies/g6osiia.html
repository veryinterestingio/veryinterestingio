<p>Unless you have a separate generation mechanism. Both Ganymede and Europa (icy moons of Jupiter) have tenuous molecular oxygen atmospheres, but that oxygen is generated as high-energy particles accelerated by Jupiter's magnetic field slam into the surface ice on these moons.</p>
<p>The real bio-marker is if oxygen exists in the same atmosphere with something that it should quickly react with, such as methane.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We observed it spectroscopically 25 years ago (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/373677a0" target="_blank">Hall, et al, 1995</a>), so it's confirmed, not just suspected.</p>
<p>&quot;Tenuous&quot; here means very thin, with atmospheric surface pressure on Europa about 100 billion times lower than Earth's surface pressure, roughly equivalent to the atmospheric pressure in Low Earth Orbit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They absolutely do, just not for very long or in large quantities. Oxygen radicals for example are continuously produced and annihilated through the Chapman cycle.</p>
