			<div class="markdown"><p>One important takeaway from the find for me is that the discovering palaeontologist was looking specifically for the site based of his thesis research and he had the specific experience needed for pulling hyper-fragile specimens out of the earth. There were previous claimants digging on the site who had no idea of the context or how to work with finds that were disintegrating as they were dug up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was my first thought too. Everyone is talking about population levels during/before/after the extinction event but I think that is all moot compared to the local conditions necessary to create and preserve fossils.
Some places had perfect conditions and finding the Tanis site is a great example of finding KT event fossils because of the tsunami of silt that hit the area. Meanwhile if you pick any other random place on the earth to die, during the KT or shortly after, odds are the conditions aren't ideal to form a fossil.</p></div>		</li>
