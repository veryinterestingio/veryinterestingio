			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this, good friends with a local butcher and he showed me the new fridge they bought specifically for aging steaks.</p>
<p>Keeps them at approx 3c, and is more industrial than a regular fridge.</p>
<p>After 28 days he got a lump of sirloin out, had a thick dry outer skin that had an odd odour, which got cut off and portioned into two steaks, which were absolutely amazing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends but often 1.5-2x the cost. At least in the US. </p>
<p>Cut, age, heritage and method are also cost factors. There is dry and wet aging, for example.</p>
<p>I am a certified butcher, chef and worked at both Gibson's Steakhouse and Ralph Lauren' RL. I have handled a lot of steaks. If that matters to you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The comment below say 80% might be a little high, but not far off. The meat looses volume to water loss, then you have to cut off the pellicle, then account for the extra time and cost of the storage process. But a beautiful 45 day aged ribeye is a thing of beauty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the temperature, process and “rot trimming” need to be precise so as to not get sick then? Or is there wiggle room if you don’t nail it exactly? </p>
<p>Does it make corn fed meat taste more tender like grass fed? Does it make grass fed even more better?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work at a meat works that sells a lot of dry-aged meat. The trimming is not fit for human consumption due to the bacteria levels in it, we have to throw it in a fat&amp;bone bin that gets picked up by another company, From what I’m told, it gets turned into a range of things from dog food, margarine, shampoos and more. Honestly though, not 100% sure what happens to it when it leaves the factory.</p>
<p>EDIT: more info, we age our meat for a minimal of 3 weeks and max of 8 weeks, you can age longer, but we don’t have a license for that. The longer it’s aged, the more trimming you have. We send off testing every few weeks to ensure bacteria levels are within safe consumption levels.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Dry aged beef trimmings are called pellicle and are fit for consumption and are often used as flavor enhancers in other beef dishes.  </p>
<p>It's only bad for you if you did not properly dry age your beef.</p></div>		</li>
