			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct I’m currently sitting in the cab of a locomotive. I’m still quite new but from my understanding the power is generated by the alternator, sent into a rectifier to power all of the DC components, and then back through 6 inverter banks; one for each traction motors. This is for an AC locomotive of course</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the weight isn't the only thing that makes it impractical - typically. </p>
<p>I say typically, because there are in fact diesel locomotives. Most modern locomotives with a diesel prime mover are diesel-electric, but not all. A number of diesel engines exist with a mechanical transmission to the wheels - Voith made a few, for example. </p>
<p>You can make a transmission big enough, weight is not really the issue. Mining dump trucks have gearboxes this big, some ships do, many large power stations... In a train, a big problem is changing gears. Changing gears becomes impractical as there is an incredible amount of wear and tear in the clutch, with the kind of torque required. Electric transmissions just don't have that issue.</p></div>		</li>
