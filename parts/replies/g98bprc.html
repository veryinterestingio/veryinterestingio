			<div class="markdown"><p>Awesome, thank you very much! I'll check them out, I def appreciate it.</p>
<p>I've mostly been looking at cycle of abuse, hopefully cycle of violence pulls something different up. Could it be that I'm just not searching with the right terms? I've been trying to search it in different ways, but I've only had narrow success.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Cycle of violence&quot; is basically &quot;the&quot; term for it by now. You're using google scholar? I found hopping through the suggestions at the bottom to usually bring up more interesting material, often more to the point than the original search. With such large, interesting psych topics as abuse, sex offenders, domestic violence you can narrow the time frame down by quite a bit or it's just too much to sift through. </p>
<p>If you find an interesting study, you can always look up the author/s and see what else they did. Asking for copies of papers works very well. The authors don't see a penny of what the publishers make, to the contrary. Don't pay for papers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see, good to know. And no, I wasn't, I was just using google (ecosia), but I can check out google scholar.
Would the scholar(s)/author(s) be okay with that? It seems a bit forward to ask them, but I would definitely be down if that's acceptable.</p></div>		</li>
