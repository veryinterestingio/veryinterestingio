			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not like they have live-attenuated and inactive vaccines for everything.  Each disease process might come with a different version.  So chickenpox for example.  If you can't have the live-attenuated vaccine, you can't get the vaccine.  There are not multiple options for each.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am 52 years old. When I was a child, I received the measles vaccine and then came down with the measles a week later. Because of this, as a precaution, I was not given any more vaccinations including polio. </p>
<p>When I was older, I started to get vaccinations again for things such as the flu and haven't had any issues so who knows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I got my flu shot this flu season they told me that it wouldn’t be fully effective for about two weeks, while my body learned how to build the antibodies and become capable of producing enough fast enough to overcome exposure. </p>
<p>So, if I had been recently exposed but not yet symptomatic, I’d still get sick; if I were to be exposed within those two weeks, I’d likely still get sick but not as badly as I would have without the vaccine. It could be measles is the same, and you just were exposed before it fully kicked in, and probably had an easier recovery than you would have otherwise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure a flu shot is a great example since it's only some strains and you're still very likely to come down with the flu even if you get your shot each year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Measles vaccine (MMR) is given in a live weakened form whereas the flu vaccine has both the live weakened version or inactivated version where parts of the virus is picked to be is used to elicit immune response. You most likely were given the inactivated flu vaccine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is true that all of the injected flu vaccines licensed for use only contain surface antigens, rather than a live virus. But there are live flu vaccines, marketed as &quot;FluMist&quot; which contain live virus. Of course the efficacy is poor and the risks are higher, which is why doctors recommend the injection and why FluMist is not approved for use in countries like Australia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have autoimmune issues and there are a very few vaccines that I am advised not to get -- in fact, none that at currently common in North America.   I am advised to make sure to get the flu shot every; however I am to get the actual shot and not the nasal spray.</p></div>		</li>
