			<div class="markdown"><p>This is based on a slightly incorrect reading of the study (source; degree in neuropsychology); when the brain grows a larger volume in this case it isn't squashed against the inside of the cranium; it results in kids with slightly larger heads than average, and a condition known as <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megalencephaly" target="_blank">megalencepathy</a> which has, surprise surprise, a large degree of comorbidity with autism. </p>
<p>Secondly, it's not <em>apoptosis</em>, it's <em>synaptic pruning</em> that is faulty in autistic brains; from the age of 2 till about 10, almost half of the connections between different nerve cells will die away in a normal brain. Not the brain cells themselves, just the synapses that connect them to other nerve cells. In many autistic people, this pruning appears to be faulty and their cortices have many more local interconnections, and fewer connections with different areas of the brain. The sheer number of synapses still active in an autistic brain may explain why they get overstimulated by things, why they have a tendency to overthink and get distressed about events, why they can focus so intensely on a single interest with laser beam intensity. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>hey man, thanks for the info, im a bit behind on ASD, I was under the impression there are no structural differences in the scan of an autistic brain compared to a normal one, thats obviously not true? Could you elaborate a bit if you get the time?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Off the top of my head, as noted above there is the tendency to find megalencepathy in many cases of autism, there's the excess synapses, lower connectivity between areas of cortex but higher connectivity <em>within</em> an area of the cortex, smaller and more densely packed neurons within the cerebellum, fewer synapses within the limbic system, and I seem to recall some info about differences in the structure of the vermis (part of the cerebellum).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation, and I appreciate you linking a good, recently published paper that is openly accessible to read without having to be on campus WiFi/jump through my University library's hoops.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are apoptosis-related diseases related to each other and/or often comorbid?<br />
I have a diagnosis of atypical autism (too few/mild symptoms to get an Asperger diagnosis), and also two pairs of webbed toes.</p></div>		</li>
