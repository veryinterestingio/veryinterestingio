<p>Not necessarily true. Epi pens, Naloxone, Glucagon, are all drugs that need to work immediately and they are IM injections in an outpatient setting </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the subject of an Epi pen, isn't it more of an emergency injection usually given by untrained people? If so, wouldn't planning for it to be intramuscular be ideal; as opposed to expecting someone to find an vein during an emergency?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not a healthcare provider in any capacity, but this response actually addresses the question and makes more sense. Healthcare tends to have a “less is more” mentality as a general rule anyway (in absence of indications to suggest otherwise). So the idea of administering directly into a vein is more complicated/invasive and unnecessary for the desired/required effect. Way easier for someone to give a shot than finding an IV.</p>
<p>The second part nobody seems to be addressing, is in regards to how blood flows. All living tissue needs an oxygen supply to survive, and blood flow is typically the way that is accomplished (the cornea of your eye being the exception since it exchanges oxygen directly with the air). Basically, if it’s not dead tissue, it’s exposed to blood. If blood is getting there somehow, either it keeps moving to somewhere else, or that area is going to start getting bigger. Assuming your vascular plumbing is in order, the blood cells are traveling on a one-way street. The heart pumps and there’s pressure involved pushing/pulling it from artery to capillaries and back to vein. Just looking at this logically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought adrenaline specifically did not need to me injected into a vein i.e. epi-pens often being just jammed in the thigh or arm, epinephrine being just the pharmaceutical name for adrenaline. </p>
<p>Definitely correct me if I’m wrong though, I certainly am not a healthcare professional.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The epinephrine pen is for convenience's sake. Your average Joe isn't gonna be able to find a vein and inject IV epinephrine correctly into that vein, especially when you're talking about someone going into anaphylactic shock, which is a panicky situation where the patient could still be moving around.</p>
<p>Certainly if you <em>could</em> locate that vein and inject epinephrine there that'd be just as effective (if not more), but with the <strong>big caveat</strong> (in case anyone is getting any stupid ideas while reading this) that you'd need a much smaller dose (lower than how any epinephrine auto-injector comes, so you'd just have to have some epinephrine vials and a syringe around) <em>and</em> that it'd have to given very slowly (over at least a few minutes) or else you risk arrhythmias or other not fun side effects. So yeah, the quickness and ease of Epipens justifies their existence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't have to give it slow but a smaller dose and weaker concentration of adrenaline/epinephrine is used. For iv treatment of anaphylaxis we use 50 microgram iv 1in10000 strength compared to 0.5mg im 1in1000. It's best to do it with iv fluid running or an immediate saline flush because it constricts the vein as soon as it gets to it which might reduce the delivery to the central circulation. Continuous infusions should really be given through a central line.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, I was just trying to think of a well-known example of a drug that requires an IV. A better example is general anesthetics, which needs to be introduced into your body quickly so it's usually IV or inhalation.</p></div>		</li>
