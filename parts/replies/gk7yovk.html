Pretty neat application, though it obviously isn't portable to the general transportation use case.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Not too sure about that. It's unclear</p>
<p>Locomotives produce an insane amount of torque and use a lot more power than an EV</p>
<p>They require massive braking resistors to dissipate that energy</p></div>		</li>

Law of energy conservation would mean that they would need to have about the same mass and cooling ability as standard breaks to not overheat.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's much more maintenance to actually change drum brakes though. They are very difficult to get back into place and properly adjust. Self adjusting versions are more work still. Also the rotors then to rust and wear much worse. Just removing the drum can damage the brakes.</p>
<p>I'm so sick of being a mechanic in a constantly changing field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question from a guy that doesn't know much about brakes: Will the drum brakes last considerably longer than pads?</p>
<p>Like it makes sense for him to say it's less maintenance if, as the owner, he had to get them worked/replaced a lot less often. Definitely blows from your standpoint (the mechanics), but I could understand the logic if the owner only had to get them worked on a fraction of the time over the course of the car's life span. </p>
<p>If that's not the case though then yeah idk where this guy is coming from.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really depends on if it's a single it duo servo brake and your own driving style.</p>
<p>I find drums brakes do last a bit longer.  But are more prone to premature failure.</p>
<p>And they do not provide as much braking power as discs. Now while you have regenerative braking siding in this, I want to stop faster.</p></div>		</li>
