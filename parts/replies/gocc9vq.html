			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! Most endangered species kept in zoos have a Species Survival Plan (SSP) that includes a stud book with the genetics of all captive individuals for that species. Each breeding is planned very carefully by a board to ensure genetic diversity is maintained as best as possible. This is one of the big reasons why animals frequently transfer between zoos.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, zoos (specifically AZA accredited ones in the US) are absolutely vital to conservation efforts! Not only do they have basically a backup gene pool for endangered populations, they also are very important for reintroductions—the California condor, for instance. They also donate a ton of money to conservation efforts! And of course, they help educate the public and also expose people to animals and conservation that they might not otherwise have heard of. Zoos definitely had a big impact on my desire to study animals as a kid, and I know the same is true for lots of others :).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Came here to say this. </p>
<p>Accredited zoos have breeding programs where they will temporarily exchange certain animals for mating purposes. </p>
<p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Many also will have a huge repository of animal sperm and eggs in case natural breeding becomes an issue. Basically animal IVF. </p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CLFWP8dgoAz/?igshid=sz6kp603wq7c" target="_blank">Here's an example of the breeding program in action</a>:</strong> Recently the Toronto Zoo sent a Cheetah to Parc Safari in Quebec as part of the Species Survival Plan. The Cheetah gave birth to 4 cubs, 2 of which (males) were sent to a sanctuary in Zimbabwe for &quot;soft release&quot; and eventual release. The other 2 (females) remain in Canada for future breeding.</p>
<p>Edit: a word.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Great, now I'm imagining someone approaching a rhino with a turkey baster like in Don't Breathe</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think more along the lines of a hefty bag apparatus and um....a long plastic glove. I've seen it done with elephants and its hard to watch! But very important. ANd to the fun fact comment - they are referring to the Frozen Zoo held at San Diego Zoo Global. European Zoos also have a similar initiative which is good to have multiple sources of gamete storage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm very suprised the Safari Zoo is include in a SSP since they are not AZA certified (since I last look into it in 2017). They are, however CAZA certified, but they are less strict. Anyway way, I'm happy they could help, I'm just surprised because I thought the SSP where only for AZA certified zoo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, not necessarily! Non AZA zoos may still have individuals that have valuable genetics so it would be a waste not to consider them as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of zoos used to enlist the help of ISIS to keep track of genetic diversity and other animal information. Not a lot of people know this.</p>
<p>But in 2016 they changed the name from International Species Information System to Species360 for obvious reasons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also known as ZIMS (Zoological Information Management System). I use it daily and it has sooo many amazing features and information in it! You can look up genealogy, compare an animal’s weight to every other individual of that species and see where they fall in a graph, read past history and events, see what that animal is trained to do or likes to play with... and that’s just the tip of the iceberg. I have spent hours just looking up the info available there before. </p>
<p>Some zoos also use a system called Tracks that was developed by Denver Zoo. It’s similar and works as a record keeping tool!</p></div>		</li>
