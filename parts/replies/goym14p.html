			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean there are 2 problems with that. You can't patent shit quietly, because a patent inherently is public information. And secondly, &quot;sharing passwords&quot; or a service to share passwords would very likely not qualify as an invention, as inventions usually need to be a machine, tool or process that results in something, and it needs to be non obvious to skilled professionals (which it isn't, because this proposal is made in every reddit thread with this topic).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First let me cut and paste a reply for speed - </p>
<p><em>Short version - publishing agreements between labels and artists didn't cover online streaming rights, Spotify presented a platform where labels could even rewrite existing agreements so labels kept a higher percentage of streaming revenue.</em></p>
<p>I'm totally open to being corrected on details, this is just my understanding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah thats not really how it went down. First off, labels don't publish artists. Publishers do. In the US, songs have two copyrights, one that covers the written composition and one that covers the recording. Publishers exploit the compositions while labels exploit the recordings. Labels do pay through royalties on publishing but those rates are statutory (decided by the government.) In the early days there was some legal maneuvering going down trying to figure out what was and wasn't owed but that wasn't the difference maker. </p>
<p>Major labels control the large majority of popular music copyrights. Spotify needed to have them onboard to have a viable platform so when early (2008 or 2009 I think) licensing negotiations went down, the majors all got sizable equity stakes in Spotify. If there was any financial incentive that favored the labels over their artists with regard to streaming, it was that. In fairness though, the majors who have sold their Spotify equity have all paid it through to their artists in some form or another.</p></div>		</li>
