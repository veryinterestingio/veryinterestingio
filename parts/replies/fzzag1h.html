			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd have to think about it, and look around. I'm not very familiar with the Chinese vaccine, but it's a classic approach - kill virus, inject, get antibodies. The problem is that's not a very natural process. The mRNA in the various others in trials gets picked up by cells, which then make that protein, sorta tricking the immune system into thinking that cell is actually infected.</p>
<p>What we were doing for ASF was combining proteins that are produced very early in the infection with mRNA coding for proteins produced later in the infection, mimicking an active infection very closely. I can't recall if there are those sorta early/late proteins with coronavirus (probably, most viruses do have an organization to their infectious life cycle like that). That would be the best approach - spike protein combined with mRNA for the envelope protein or something.</p>
<p>FYI - the first vaccine that hits later this year/early next year won't be perfect, but everyone should get it. By the end of next year there'll be a better one, and maybe one even better in 2022.</p></div>		</li>
