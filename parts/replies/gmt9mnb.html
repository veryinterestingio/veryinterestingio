			<div class="markdown"><p>Quick question to people that are more knowledgable than me in this field: from reading the comments I've surmised that growing plants in lunar regolith is possible with the addition of organic compounds.  Am I right in assuming that these organic compounds are the solution for the lack the 'living soil' on the moon? Side question, if these compounds were introduced with some microorganisms that are commonly found in soil, could the lunar regolith be made into 'living lunar soil' (assuming that the site is not in vacuum)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That arbitrariness never made sense throughout all my organic chem classes. I hated all that &quot;Ignore those molecules that meet the definition, but we exclude for reasons we won't tell you.&quot; Eventually I came up with a modified definition that seems to fit better: Organic means containing carbon and hydrogen.</p>
<p>All your examples of inorganic carbon containing molecules do not contain hydrogen, while methane, which is considered organic, does contain both carbon and hydrogen, and nothing else.</p></div>		</li>

<p>depends on your definition, the act of carbon being in something doesn't mean it's organic. Carbon-Hydrogen bonds define something as organic, and many things contain carbon which have nothing to do with organic processes or aren't Carbon-Hydrogen bonds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In one sense carbon is organic. But bare solid carbon by itself does nothing for plants, it needs to be in compounds with other elements. Organic material is carbon-bearing stuff like wood chips, old grass, compost, tea leaves, etc. the more broken down--composted--the better.</p></div>		</li>
