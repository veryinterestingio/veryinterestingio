			<div class="markdown"><p>In the northern hemisphere (i'm at 38.5N, roughly), for example, moss and lichen will grow mostly (dominantly) on the north side of trees.  Depending on your latitude trees and plants will &quot;lilt&quot; to the track of the sun, which isn't directly overhead.   Where i live mushrooms tend to grow on the north side of the ground around trees, ferns avoid the afternoon sun, but will tolerate the morning.  In my forest the madrone prefer the edge of the fir and maple forests, but on the north side of clearings at about 2x the rate of the south side and so on.  Add to that that in rural environments buildings and gardens and greenhouses and yards often account for position relative to morning sun.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It will show the plants moving from the inside artificial light to the window as the sun comes up.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would also add that the input from all of our senses can be combined to change the way we are perceiving things. In other words, what we are hearing, or smelling, etc, can change what we perceive about the things we see. So the coolness of the air, how quiet it is in the morning, the lack of wind make us think that the light looks somehow softer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's call it &quot;the cup o' coffee vs. glass o' wine affect&quot; .  I think this is a substantial portion of the experience.  We feel <em>really</em> different about a sunrise vs. sunset in ways that are much more dramatic than any visual difference I described (and those I missed).</p></div>		</li>
