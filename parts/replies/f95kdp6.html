			<div class="markdown"><p>Netflix is very protective of their streaming numbers (likely to retain leverage in negotiations). I'd be very surprised if they allowed Nielson or any other third-party service access to that data.</p>
<p>EDIT: Not to mention, why would they? Nielson ratings are primarily used to sell advertising. Netflix don't do that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They might not literally have ads, but they still would need the data for who's watching which shows so they can market products written into the show to the correct target audience. </p>
<p>Plus, they might also use the data to know how to market themselves as well. For example, if Netflix has several kids shows, they need to know his to market to children and parents. So if they know that young and new parents like certain shows but older parents don't, they are likely to advertise those kids shows in places young mom's go to. </p>
<p>I can't remember if it's Netflix or Hulu but one (or maybe both) have a setting option where you can be a &quot;Nielson account&quot;. </p>
<p>But you are probably correct maybe they internally gather their data but Nielson likely has some data that might be considered &quot;common knowledge&quot; for the industry.</p></div>		</li>
