			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed, except for the lack of explanation surrounding how the US Central Bank had 1.5 Trillion to buy those bonds. It‚Äôs called inflation, ie they printed it, meaning the money you (hopefully) have in your wallet or bank is now worth less than before they printed this money.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not in this case. The money lent by the Fed isn't going to end up in the larger economy. This isn't money the bank will turn around and lend out, it's mostly meant to help banks with their overnight balancing and reconciliation process that happens within the entire banking system every night. Sometimes Wells Fargo owes Bank of America money after all billions of daily transactions balance so Wells Fargo has to send BofA money to cover that. Wells Fargo can either keep cash on hand to cover these types of situations and borrow from the Fed's discount window at an interest rate set by the Fed. A repo agreement is essentially just a longer term loan from the Fed's discount window to cover an unexpected uptick in uncertainty so the bank doesn't increase their cash on hand (which takes money out of the economy) or distort the short term interest rate (which is one of the Fed's main tools in executing monetary policy). So the Fed here is just saying, hey borrow money from this separate channel so it doesn't mess up what we're trying to do elsewhere in the economy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except to clarify #3, well-run (and not in regulatory trouble) banks typically don‚Äôt lend out more assets than they have on hand.  They may not have the physical cash, but between consumer deposits and treasuries they have more than they lend.  Treasuries are typically more ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù sources of funding for a bank (no interest checking accounts being the best) - so this really applies to banks with low consumer deposits (commercial banks which lend mainly to companies).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't 100% accurate for the current situation. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>the Federal Reserve bought $1.5 trillion worth of US Treasury Bonds from banks. Now the banks have cash, and the Federal Reserve now owns these bonds. The Federal Reserve can sell these bonds later and recoup a lot of the money.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Fed is loaning the banks the cash, and the banks are putting up the bonds as collateral. The banks are expected to pay back the loans plus interest, and get the bonds back.</p>

<p>he bank is using that money to give people loans. That‚Äôs how the bank makes money.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, it's quite accurate... </p>
<p>The borrowing banks enter into repurchase agreements (repos) with the Fed. Economically, this is extremely similar to a collateralised loan like you describe. But on a more literal level, the Fed did buy the bonds and they will sell them later.</p>
<p>The valuable point you add is that the Fed makes money off of these transactions (in a way analogous to earning interest).</p></div>		</li>

<p>You are correct, however I want to clarify a potential misunderstanding some people might have. </p>
<p>In this case, a ‚Äúcollateralized loan‚Äù is completely different than the ‚Äúcollateralized loan obligations‚Äù that caused the financial crisis. Their names are extremely similar but they are very different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Overall interest rates are actually lower than usual during a recession. The effect of banks running low on cash isn‚Äôt anywhere near the effect of businesses not wanting to take out a loan during a recession. Maybe I should have worked that in somewhere, but I didn‚Äôt want to make it too long. When the Fed buys bonds, it lowers the interest rate, which increases spending, which helps the economy.</p></div>		</li>
