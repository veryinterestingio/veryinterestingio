			<div class="markdown"><p>There are many ways to do this. Many experiments are actually done with light. Circularly or linearly polarized photons. Clockwise, counter-clockwise, horizontal, and vertical polarizations form the basis states similar to 'up down x y' I mention above. We can create a single photon at a time, pass it through a special kind of crystal that creates two lower energy photons when one photon enters, and those two lower energy photons have to obey conservation of momentum properties.</p>
<p>Another common design is nitrogen vacancies in diamond. If we very carefully control diamond growth with the right amount of nitrogen, every now and then an atom that should be a carbon in the diamond structure will actually be a nitrogen. This leaves an electron isolated in a physical location and we can manipulate that electron where it is. (I don't know this one as well, so pardon if I've made a mistake here).</p>
<p>There are other designs like superconducting rings with a little split in them that can hold quantized magnetic field amounts, and so on that I'm even less familiar with, but there's a lot of ways to build a qubit (the name of these things)</p></div>		</li>
