			<div class="markdown"><p>It's my understanding that the air pressure is actually used to disengage the brakes, normally held engaged by springs. This is a &quot;fail safe&quot; of sorts so that in the event you lose air pressure the brakes are fully engaged rather than non functional resulting in a very large vehicle with no means of stopping. The hiss you hear is the system blowing off any excess air that is not needed while stopped/parked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This same system is used in trains as well though I don't remember if they are used in all train systems.  I don't see how fail safe air brakes could be used in freight cars where the individual cars need to be moved around at yards to route to their destination.  This is going to be another rabbit hole of internet searches, I can feel it.</p>

<p>Normal procedure is to apply the parking brakes at every pickup</p>

<p>I think I remember hearing the sound at red lights and stop signs (where no one is exiting/entering the bus)... do they still apply the parking brake at these situations?</p>
<p>Edit: another comment addressed this</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the driver releases the pedal after stopping (<strong>even if they just release it partially while still holding it down a bit</strong>) the air gets released under the truck making a “tsshhh” sound.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends! For me, I use the parking brake at red lights if I know the light will stay red for a considerable amount of time, so I can rest my foot.</p>
<p>Also, at the end of the day we're supposed to release all the compressed air from the tanks so that they won't have water build up in them overnight, so we like to spam the brake pedal to release the air as opposed to manually pulling on the valves on the airtanks cause that takes soo freaking long..</p>
<p>For clarification, I don't drive busses, but I drove large trucks during my stint in the military.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spamming the brake pedal to empty them isn't as good as using the valve. The valve is usually at the bottom of the tank, so water collects there because gravity, and when you pull the cable to release air it blows any water out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With low-floor buses this could also be the tilt control thing. I'm not quite sure why they seemingly only do this while waiting at a red light. So they stand there you hear a little &quot;shhh&quot; every few seconds and the tilt slightly goes up and down (like a very minor amount, you can barely see it). Maybe it's just because the tilting system is actually leaking a tiny bit? idk</p>
<p>edit: It's actually called kneeling not tilting :D</p></div>		</li>
