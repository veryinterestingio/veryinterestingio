			<div class="markdown"><p>REST is generally used to describe a specific type of Web api. It is meant to represent state of a remote entity or resource.</p>
<p>REST Apis should generally only deal with updating and reporting the state of entities in a system. Think CRUD(Create read update delete). </p>
<p>A web api that starts a service, or runs kicks off a process would be a Remote procedure call(Rpc). Rpc calls can also do rest like stuff, and generally dont care about transport method or protocol.</p>
<p>Soap is in simplest terms a mix of both. It can make remote procedure calls and do crud stuff. I think most importantly it doesnt care about its transport method where as rest uses http.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially yes. A REST API is built around using HTTP, but REST is basically a set of principles for designing a nice HTTP API. I suppose you could technically make an HTTP API that doesn't follow REST principles, but most people won't like it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially, no.</p>
<p>And REST isn't just a set of principles for designing a nice HTTP API, it's principles for designing <em>one</em> kind of API. An API where everything is treated as a resource.</p>
<p>Most APIs don't actually follow REST. If your API has actions (uses verbs), almost certainly it isn't REST. (And yes, I know you <em>can</em> – for some interpretations of REST – have verbs, but this is something I'm yet to see in the wild.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>HTTP APIs have existed even before REST was created. SOAP is an example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A developer will also typically create internal APIs within the same project to divide the code into more manageable parts. That way, you don't need to think about all the code always, just the part you are working on and the internal APIs it's using.</p></div>		</li>
