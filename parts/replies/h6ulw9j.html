			<div class="markdown"><p>If this character comes from the bourbon’s movement in and out of the wood, could the process be sped up by increasing the surface area of the wood that’s in contact with the bourbon? For example, instead of using standard cylindrical barrels that are not too far off from being spheres (low surface area to volume ratio), maybe using a squashed version that has a huge diameter but very little height? It’s probably super impractical to do that, but I’m curious if it would work.</p>
<p>That, or just filling the barrel with loose pieces of the same wood, and having the bourbon fill in the cracks…</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, sort of, with caveats.  A large amount of the taste is compounds essentially leached from the wood, but there are other reactions going on that can affect the flavor in something like whiskey.  Heating and cooling cycles, seasonal humidity changes, some slow and gentle oxidation.  Storing in wood (particularly such a porous wood as oak) is much different than bottling.</p>
<p>In the business, the usual way to get a “quicker” aging is to just use smaller barrels.  That gives you the increased surface area to volume ratio without changing other elements too much.  But it’s usually not used for production runs or anything like that, more experiments or trying to get a feel for what direction a particular spirit will taste when aged.</p>
<p>And, I mean, it is possible to “age” whiskey very quickly with charred chips in an ultrasonic bath.  The results are usually far less than ideal.  You get the compounds of the wood extracted, but you don’t get the interesting flavor components that develop when the whiskey soaks into the wood and mostly draws back into the barrel leaving a little bit of the remaining solutes in the wood to do some interesting things chemically, and then get reabsorbed with another cycle of swelling and shrinking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've actually made a few different types of brown spirts over the years and I agree 100%. I tried different methods but by far my favourite was to used a 10L barrel (any bigger would've far outweighed my needs) for about 6-12 months minimum. </p>
<p>It sounds like you may also have some experience. I know about chips and sticks, you mentioned something I've never heard of, the ultrasonic bath. It makes sense, and I'm sure it makes sub-par spirts because of the speed. Have you ever tried or seen it combined with barrel ageing though? I mean theoretically you might be able to greatly reduce the ageing time, and get a very similar product by pretreatment before moving to the barrel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, and new distilleries will do this -- they'll &quot;microbarrel&quot; the whiskey in smaller barrels to raise the surface-area-to-volume ratio. It imparts the wood flavor much faster, so you have an &quot;aged&quot; bourbon ready to sell in a year.</p>
<p>However, the result is just generally not very good. It's faster but not exactly the same. I'm not saying it's impossible, but I've never tried a microbarreled whiskey that didn't have either too little or way too much oak flavor.</p>
<p>Here in Washington, Woodinville Whiskey Company was a good example. When starting out they had a microbarreled whiskey, and it was... not great. It gave them product to sell but didn't do a lot for their reputation. However, they had put whiskey in real barrels, too, and after 3-4 years they were able to start selling that product, and it was a lot better. They phased out the microbarreled whiskey entirely in a couple years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, Makers (bourbon) newer &quot;46&quot; recipe uses charcoal staves (sticks) in addition to the barrel walls to increase surface area.</p>
<p>Laphroaig (scotch) has a &quot;quarter cask&quot; variety that uses smaller casks to increase surface area for the same reason.</p>
<p>The sell &quot;quick aging&quot; home kits that are basically a glass mason jar with oak/charcoal chips that absolutely work, or you can buy tiny aging barrels that work the on the same principle as the quarter cask above.</p>
<p>Edit: Laphroaig Quater Cask (not Lagavulin)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Makers uses staves for every single non-basic bourbon. All of their bourbons are identical until they are re-aged with staves to change the flavor. Barrel strength is identical to that point as well and just isn't proofed down. They make over a thousand varieties the same way, most are only available at a specific restaurant/bar that contracted for a customized version.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and there is a difference between &quot;FINE&quot; vodka, and the stuff you get for 2.99 at the liquor store. Expensive vodka should have no taste and a little burn to know you're enjoying it. If your making bloody Mary's or screwdrivers. Don't waste your money unless your trying to flex. Same as tequila. If your making margaritas then don't put top shelf in it. If your into sipping tequila for the taste ((which it has) I'd recommend a nice anejo or reposato.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;expensive&quot; vodka, pro tip: you don't need to pay for something like grey goose, absolute etc, they're charging you for branding not the booze. Make sure it comes in a glass bottle and is at least triple filtered and you're allmost certainly fine, the vodka I keep around is $13 and it's indecernable from more expensive vodkas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd use a nicer tequila for margaritas unless you're doing the cheap &quot;slushy&quot; version. A nice margarita is mostly tequila (I do 2oz tequila, 1oz Curacao, .5oz lime) so a nicer tequila will shine. But yeah, Vodka I'll just buy something not super terrible by the gallon since it's easy to hide the taste. I make a lot of mixed drinks at home, it's fun</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I prefer blancos for sipping tbh. Aging is nice and all, but I think the aged taste works better with rums and whisky's. The agave flavor is what makes tequilas special and you can taste it most clearly in a blanco. And there is a huge difference between a good tequila and a bad one. A bad one might taste better aged. A good one doesn't need it.</p>
<p>I agree with not using top shelf tequila for margaritas. But I'd stay away from bottom shelf stuff too. You should at the very least pick one that's 100% agave and not autoclaved. You can get a decent tequila pretty cheap.</p></div>		</li>
