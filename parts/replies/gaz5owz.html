			<div class="markdown"><p>Well Tycho-2 only has about the 2.5 million brightest stars, out of about 200 billion stars in the milky way. Using Gaia data would be much more representative of  the galaxy, but it still only covers about 1% of the stars. I don't know if it has been done and how clear a picture of the overall galaxy structure it would cast.</p>
<p>Edit: so looking a this picture <a href="https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/iow_20110810" target="_blank">https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/iow_20110810</a> I would say Gaia gives a pretty good idea of the structure of our side of the milky way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, A while ago I wrote a 3D engine in Python and to test it I imported the whole Gaia catalog, and it didn't really look like any galaxy shape in particular. </p>
<p>Thing is, if I understand correctly, spiral arms don't have more stars, but brighter ones, so the catalog doesn't necessarily reflect the way we would see the galaxy if we were far away. (or my code is just wrong lol) :</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>thats interesting, Ive never thought the orion belt's stars were so close to us, this begs me to ask, are all stars we see with our eyes in the sky at night relatively close to us and within our galaxy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A notable problem: it's extremely difficult if not outright impossible to observe stars in &quot;the other half&quot; of the galaxy. </p>
<p>The Milky Way disk structure and galactic center are very bright and are like a barrier that prevents us from looking through it. <a href="https://asd.gsfc.nasa.gov/archive/mwmw/images/combined.jpg" target="_blank">This combined image</a> (<a href="https://asd.gsfc.nasa.gov/archive/mwmw/mmw_images.html" target="_blank">source</a>) shows on each band the Milky Way at a different wavelengths (radio waves at the top, visible light third-to-last, gamma rays last). Pretty difficult to pierce through, so  much so that we don't quite know what lies behind it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The stars in star catalogue's aren't chosen at random as we can only see the brightest stars even with our best telescopes. That means that the catalogues really only contain details of stars close by or very very bright distant stars. Any plot would be using very few stars from our galaxy and most would be for only the area immediately around us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually Gaia has a bit of the different problem: it can only map the faintest stars, brightest stars being too close and bright to be accurately mapped using their tech. Gaia mapped individual stars in the Magellan clouds.</p>
<p>Gaia is also limited by obstruction. Everything that's at the other side of the galaxy is obstructed by the very bright galactic core and interstellar dust.</p>
<p>This article details the process a bit more closely. <a href="https://sci.esa.int/web/gaia/-/61459-gaia-starts-mapping-our-galaxy-s-bar" target="_blank">https://sci.esa.int/web/gaia/-/61459-gaia-starts-mapping-our-galaxy-s-bar</a> It claims 150M stars have been mapped precisely with Gaia already.</p></div>		</li>
