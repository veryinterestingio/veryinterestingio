<p>In a few cases you can have bad bacteria in. Store your cheese correctly (depend on the cheese), don't contaminate it by having it touching meat, poop or anything, and look at it smell it. Some bad smell or bad look are edible, but like mushrooms if you don't know don't eat.</p>
<p>Companies have to play it super safe and deal with unknowing people. The limit date is for them.</p>
<p>Living in France, cheeses don't even have limit dates if bought at the market or farm.</p></div>		</li>
