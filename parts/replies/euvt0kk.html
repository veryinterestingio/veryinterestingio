			<div class="markdown"><p>In most PSH projects, the lower and upper reservoirs are open, above-ground reservoirs constructed either by damming a naturally flowing surface water body (open-loop PSH) or excavating an artificial reservoir and filling it with water from a surface water or groundwater source to which it is not continuously connected (closed-loop PSH). However, there are also PSH designs in which one or both reservoirs are located underground, sometimes in abandoned mine pits. In the United States, the potential impacts of proposed PSH projects on all environmental resources are assessed in either an environmental assessment (EA) or environmental impact statement (EIS) prepared under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 by the Federal agency developing (e.g., Corps of Engineers, TVA) or licensing (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) the project. Although project developers typically construct fences around the above-ground reservoirs, terrestrial wildlife, birds, and insects can make the reservoirs their home. Fish are typically present in the lower (natural) reservoir of open-loop PSH projects and can be present in above-ground closed-loop PSH reservoirs and the upper reservoir of open-loop projects if theyâ€™re released by humans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you give more information or examples of sites using old mine pits?  Is anyone using old room and pillar coal mines or would it be worth modifiying long wall mining methods to leave a lower reservoir behind instead of having the roof collapse?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can partially answer this- I worked at a large hydro plant with a reservoir last summer.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The reservoir at our plant was open, just like a regular pond. There were fish who lived in it, and they managed to survive because the water level never dropped below a certain threshold. They did, however, often end up in the intakes, ultimately getting shredded by the rotor (tough way out)  While I can't give a complete overview of the environmental impact, the one at our specific plant was more or less a regular pond - albeit a very large one.</p></div>		</li>
