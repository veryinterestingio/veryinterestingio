<p>Along with the dehydrating effect, you are also preventing most air from getting to the leaf, which some if not most bacteria need in order to grow and thrive. </p>

<p>But some other bacteria thrive WITHOUT oxygen, so that might not be as much help as you'd think.  But the fact that the leaf's crammed tightly between the pages of the book prevents insects from getting in to eat it, which is another vector for decomposition.</p></div>		</li>

<p>True but they're pretty rare in the normal aerobic environment so they'd have a hard time reaching the leaf during the window of opportunity, and anaerobic bacteria aren't super duper active and don't seem to be huge degrader e.g. pretty much all of our fossils (as well as our fossil fuels) come from organic matter being trapped in anaerobic environments and decaying slowly enough to imprint on the environment or even get converted.</p>
<p>The anaerobic environment can contribute further by being acidic/desiccant (bog bodies) or very cold, but AFAIK amber or mud burials and the like are pretty straight anaerobic with little further.</p></div>		</li>
