			<div class="markdown"><p>Regular ICU nurse or nurse anesthetist?
A few years ago I was in the ICU for almost a week (pneumonia, sepsis, not intubated but on a bipap as well as central line then PIC line, not a fun experience but the morphine was nice!! After thoracentesis a bunch of times and the physical stress from the infections it hurt to breathe and even move much. Took two weeks before I could even walk on my own. When your actual lungs hurt it is so painful. And I got so winded so easily because of the diminished oxygen, fluid around my lungs and in them as well I guess. Even after getting out of the hospital it took a month before I could walk fast or up hill). </p>
<p>The ICU nurses were amazing. Some of the most professional and caring nurses I’ve ever come across. I think about them to this day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ICU RN here. Never seen an anesthesia team. We work with an intensivist/ pulmonologist. Obviously hospitals are different and experiences vary; just offering my take.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it depends on how sick you are. If you are really sick and I'm your nurse, I'm not gonna let you out of my sight for a second unless someone else comes to relieve me. If you are not that sick, I will be checking up on you every hour to make sure you're still doing ok</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In patients who are uncontrollably seizing, even after administering heavy heavy doses of antiepileptics (anti seizure medications), we perform what is known as medically induced coma. These patients are typically extremely sick, requiring intubation (involves placing a breathing tube) and hooking it up to a ventilator (breathing machine). Medically induced coma includes placing the patient literally into a brain coma on purpose with high dose versed (midazolam) drip that goes into the patient continuously. If versed doesn't do the job, then we use phenobarbital drip. Both drugs have antiepileptic properties, with phenobarbital being the strongest for treating seizures. Medically induced coma is intended to be used as a last ditch effort to stop them from seizing by allowing the brain to &quot;shut down&quot; temporarily. Hopefully, I explained it ok.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I may pick your brains for a minute, I was reading a novel a while back where a coroner mentions that some sedatives meant for adults either do little to nothing for kids or even cause hyperactivity before kicking in after a good while longer than they'd take to kick in on an adult. Obviously the basic dosology for kids will be different than adults but other than that is there any merit to the book or was it just the medical equivalent to technobabble?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a known reaction with midazolam, a sedative in the same class of drugs as valium. Around 1-3% of pediatric patients develop paradoxical distress, where they can become agitated or violent. It's not a contraindication, but something that doctors need to recognize quickly. </p>
<p>Also, I'd add to /u/ushubi's response that while opioids differ in strength, it isn't a significant factor in choosing an opioid, since you can just increase the volume of you deliver. You can just as easily overdose someone on morphine as on fentanyl. Opioids are usually picked based on their duration of action and side-effect profile. For example, during a surgery, an anesthesiologist might pick remifentanil, which has a half-life of about 30 minutes, rather than morphine (half life of a couple hours). When the surgeons finish up, they can turn off the infusion and not have to wait too long for the drug to clear. No-one likes hanging around an OR waiting for a patient to wake up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the drugs used in adult ICU's are the same drugs we use in kids ICU's with the exception of propofol. We don't like to use propofol in kids. But we do use it in the bigger kids who are 18-19 year olds. Morphine is pretty weak as a sedative, requiring very high doses to have effect. So we use fentanyl instead often times in kids.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on rhe injury but most healing doesnt require the brain to be functioning beyond keeping the nervous sytem going... (respiration and circulatory systems still working) Healing is mostly autonomic, meaning that as long as oxygen is being pumped through your veins and your organs are fuctioning you will heal. A lot of these functions can be aided or temporarily replaced with machines. respirators and pace makers etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what others have stated, there are issues that slowing the brain helps with, when it comes to healing/preventing further damage.
One that I think I'm remembering correctly is glutamate toxicity. Glutamate, the energy source for the brain, is also toxic to the brain in too high quantities. When brain cells die, their glutamate gets released into the surrounding area, resulting in more brain cells dying and releasing more glutamate, and a snowball effect can happen.  Slowing down metabolism will slow this process down and hopefully mitigate the damage. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Glutamate toxicity sounds like an extremely risky thing. Are there any drugs being developed that could lower the risk in other ways than just slowing metabolism? Maybe something like a glutamate oxidase to destroy glutamate before it can build up?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe a better way of putting it is that we prevent over-excitement in the brain. We sedate them so that they don’t react to external stimuli, pain, fear, etc. But cerebral perfusion and oxygenation are maintained at normal, baseline levels so I think that healing rate would not be affected. Kind of how splinting and immobilising a broken limb would help heal it. Good question though!</p></div>		</li>

<p>(Ever since I learned about the glymphatic system, I've been wondering whether there was a relationship between damage to it during head trauma, and persistent vegetative states.)</p></div>		</li>
