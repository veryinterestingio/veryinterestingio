			<div class="markdown"><p>Heating and cooling isn't the only process involved, air getting in and alcohol and volatile compounds getting out would progress at the same speed, since it depends on the porous properties of wood. So you would have some processes going faster, but some going at the same speed: so you would get congeners faster into the spirit, but congeners need time to oxydize and react with the environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the other things that are happening during aging, it would be horrinly expensive to heat and cool the rickhouses.  One reason Kentucky is the center of the bourbon universe is the seasonal temps aloowing natural expansion amd contracttion.  In other words, cheap.</p></div>		</li>
