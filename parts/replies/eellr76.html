			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to this, and in my opinion more likely to be the limiting factor than this, circulation. As you increase your size the volume of muscle increases exponentially as you mentioned. This volume creates a need for much much more blood to be circulated, however, the only real way to transport more blood would be to increase the radius of our veins, and if you know fluid dynamics, that massively decreases the speed of blood flow (think about how when you put your thumb over a hose how much harder it sprays). This in addition to the added challenge of pumping blood that much further if our legs  got significantly longer makes it impossible to grow much bigger. Our hearts can’t keep up</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep! It has a massive strain on their heart and they often have strokes and other circulatory system failures due to this. Even being mildly above average (I’m 6’3) reduces the average expected lifespan by a significant amount! (a few years)</p></div>		</li>
