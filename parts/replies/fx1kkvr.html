<p>Judging by how many squid beaks we find in the stomachs of almost every whale that's ever been cut open, the whales clearly don't have a hard time finding the squids.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This really isn't that surprising when you think about it. The giant squid are highly unlikely to leave the depths to begin with, making them hard to find. They certainly aren't approaching boats, as boats likely look like whales to them. They don't wash up often on shores because of how deep they live and how soft their bodies are; when they die, they usually rot/get eaten fairly quickly and don't have skeletons to leave behind.</p>
<p>They just seem rare to us because we don't live in their world</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>u/TheSecretMe answered a similar question with &quot;There's a theory that suggests they can produce a sonic blast that kinda works like a flashbang and stuns prey. But it's unproven and the evidence isn't very strong.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do giant squids form schools sometimes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about giant squid, I know some large ones like Humbolt squid (they're usually \~5' long) travel in shoals that can get to over 1,000.  They stay fairly deep during the day (500m or so) and move up at night to hunt.</p></div>		</li>
