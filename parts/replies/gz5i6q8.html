			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. But you should measure the distance to your central nervous system (i.e. brain + spinal cord), not just distance to brain. So the ankle is further away than the upper arm, but the lower arm is further away than the upper leg.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if theoretically you got bit on the hand and just cut your arm off the next day, say like you're in the woods very far away from any help? Sure, cutting your own arm off would also pose it's own survival issues, but at least that's actually known to have been done in different circumstances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My microbiology professor told me about a case one of her colleagues had studied, in a which a man was bit on the neck by a rabid animal, far away from the necessary medical care. I want to say he was part of an archaeological dig or something like that. He died in like a day and half.</p>
<p>She said, &quot;moral of the story, if you're going to get bitten by a rabid animal, get bitten in an extremity.&quot; (She was joking, but also not.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I had been infected with rabies, I would try and quickly find a doctor who is willing to try the Milwaukee/Recife protocol, with whatever new twists the researchers would like to throw in:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At least two treatment schemes have been proposed to treat rabies after the onset of disease, namely the Milwaukee Protocol and the Recife Protocol. The Milwaukee Protocol initially came into use in 2003, when it was tested on Jeanna Giese. Subsequently, the teenager from Wisconsin became the first person known to have survived rabies without preventive treatments before symptom onset. The basic idea is to put a person into a chemically induced coma and to use antiviral medications to prevent fatal dysautonomia. However, the overall protocol is complex. The sixth version of the protocol last updated in 2018 consists of 17 pages with 22 steps of treatment, detailed monitoring and a timeline of expected complications.[81] The Recife Protocol follows the same principle but differs in details like termination of sedation and supplementary medication.[82] Some experts assessed the Milwaukee Protocol as an ineffective treatment with concerns related to the costs and ethics. Yet a study published in 2020 found 38 case reports for the Milwaukee Protocol and only one for the Recife Protocol with a total of 11 known survivors with varying sequelae.[82] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am really baffled by the people who are against the protocol and label it is unethical... If it's between certain death or the protocol, I don't see how certain death is better. And to top it off, I'd much rather slip off into a medical coma and never wake up again, rather than die strapped to a bed in agony.</p>
<p>The truth is that some people end up in a vegetative state, and many people would consider that worse than death. And then people shift the blame onto the protocol, rather than shifting the blame onto how we handle people in those states. If I had rabies ideally I would request the Milwaukee/Recife protocol, then to be euthanised if I end up in a vegetative state for longer than a few months.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If someone who has never been immunised against rabies is bitten on the hand, and go to the hospital too late to get the vaccine, depending on the type of wound (and I'm assuming you mean a deep wound with bleeding), we administer immunoglobulins (if within a week), and yes the vaccine itself.</p>
<p>Incubation period of rabies, i.e. the time between the exposure/the bite and the onset of symptoms vary, being typically around 2-3 months, but could be anywhere between a week to an year, and would depend on the site, depth, nature of wound and viral load.</p>
<p>Cutting off the arm ends up being a possibility only if there's significant bacterial contamination of the said wound, with gangrene of the limb.</p>
<p>Once clinical symptoms appear, the result, unfortunately is nearly always death, and dismemberment is of no use as many have pointed out.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this technically mean that amputation is also a viable treatment option for rabies? <em>(writing this all with an assumption that the place of  bite is arm)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I.e you get bitten by a rabid animal but stuck somewhere during an exploration and the vaccine 100% can't be delivered in time, would amputating the arm then be a viable option? Because you know, rabies kills you 100%, it's either where you got bit or death.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, if it's a viable method; what if you get bit on stomach or buttocks?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have no access to the vaccine, then yes you could amputate instead. As others have said, the infection travels about 10cm per day, so as long as you can remove above that mark before the virus reaches the spinal column, then you should be (relatively) fine.</p>
<p>Bites on the abdomen would be much trickier because you can't really amputate your torso. At least, not in this sort of survival situation. I don't see many options there beyond getting to a vaccine ASAP.</p>
<p>Buttocks might also be able to be amputated, or might not, depending on what's there or not. But you'd have to act quickly because of the close proximity to the spine.</p></div>		</li>
