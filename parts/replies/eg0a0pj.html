			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, mammals are amniotes, i.e. originally had eggs very much like birds and lizards do, but mammal's eggs don't have shells anymore and aren't laid, they just stay in the mother's body until they hatch (except for platypus, that weird mammal that lays eggs).</p>
<p>All these eggs have two vascularized (placenta-like, let's say) structures, the yolk sac and the allantois, that serve for nutrient exchange (e.g. in birds the allantois wraps around the embryo and under the shell, and would be the one helping with oxygen). The mammal placenta evolved in part by repurposing one of these organs: of the allantois in most 'regular' mammals including humans; of the yolk sac in marsupials</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>chicks taking too long to get out of the shell risk suffocation, just like mammals that take to long to &quot;be born&quot;. </p>
<p>In the egg, the chick doesn´t react to not getting any oxygen suddenly. The CO2 level spikes stronger than normal, and the chick reacts to it. It´s not that brutal as it sounds</p></div>		</li>
