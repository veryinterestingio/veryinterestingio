			<div class="markdown"><p>It tends to just compress everything rather than truly move them. Your bladder and the majority of your abdominal organs (stomach, small and large intestines) are hollow and compressible. As for the uterus itself, it remains anchored but inflated like a balloon to a larger size. So the uterus doesn’t move as much as it expands, and it doesn’t push things away from their Anchorage as much as it just squashes them into whatever space they can be squeezed into.</p></div>		</li>
