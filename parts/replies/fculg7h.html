<p>Just a small quibble here.  The mass loss of the sun is not the primary reason the planets don't move toward the sun.  The primary reason is that they are in stable orbits.  They are moving tangential to their orbits fast enough  that they don't get closer to the sun on average.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always been curious about this explanation for gravity. What causes the masses, in your example the fruit, to press down on the tissue/space-time fabric? Does that not presuppose some sort of gravitational field pulling them down to begin with?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The simple amswer is we don't know. Gravitational energy is one of the few fundamental forces of nature. These are forces or interactions that can't be reduced anymore to anything more basic. Take for example electromagnetic force, or the attraction of positive and negative charges. Why do they attract? We don't really have a definitive answer. Same goes to gravity and how it really works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is where the analogy breaks down. What's really going on isn't two or even three-dimensional distortion, it's actually 4 dimensional and equal in all directions. That's hard to visualize, though. As for why the distortions exist in the first place? We don't have an answer beyond that's how energy works.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I hope you mean to include time, because there is no evidence to support the existence of more than three spatial dimensions.</p></div>		</li>

<p>lmao <em>what</em></p>
<p>The sun accounts for ~99.9% of the mass of the solar system. It absolutely pulls on the earth - we're just moving too fast perpendicular to that pull to actually fall in. That's what an orbit is.</p></div>		</li>
