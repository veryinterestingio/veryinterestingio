			<div class="markdown"><p>This also means they must poop and pee separately, or have specific attachments so they can poop and pee at the same time. I can't imagine laying rope without taking a pee. And given this elaborate recycling process it seems like they're not pooping and peeing into the same bowl or whatever.</p>
<p>I don't know what the point of my comment was, or who I should reply to. I just really wanted to talk about it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As for where the water comes from, after reading an article on NASA.org, it's mostly recycled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That just poses a new question.  If they're recycling the sweat and urine from the astronauts, where is their drinking water coming from?  If that's also part of the recycling system, then they're losing water from the recycling system when they use it to make oxygen, so where's the replacement water coming from?</p>
<p>If they're producing 5kg of oxygen per day, they must be delivering roughly 5kg of water per day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the idea is the recycling is hyper optimal and also the water that is recycled is all drinkable. I just read some other article (which I closed out of) which mentioned the water tastes like bottled water, although it came from urine.</p>
<p>Also /u/ubik2 just posted a good explanation of how the system kind of feeds into itself and how they can get around needing to ship up heavy water to the space station.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since 2010, they’ve also been using the Sabatier reaction. That consumes the hydrogen from electrolysis and the CO2 from breathing, producing methane and water (which can then go back into electrolysis). This means you don’t have to keep shipping up a bunch of water. Unfortunately, that reaction needs more H2 than it frees (to make the methane), so we still ship that up. Fortunately, hydrogen is very light.</p>

<p>Off topic but just a small tip, you can press <code>Ctrl + Shift + T</code> to restore closed tab, works in chrome and firefox. Only on desktop obviously, not sure if there is a similar thing for mobile.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It looks like water is actually pretty constant, it doesn't get broken down by the body. The body just uses it for regulation of heat/waste/stuff. Which means the water you exhale/piss is recoverable, assuming you get rid of the problem heat/waste first.  In fact, you actually generate water! You are a water generator!  In fact, it looks like you produce about as much water as you do CO2  </p>
<p>However, the food cycle is very much not. You have:<br />
Complex Hydrocarbons (food) + Oxygen (O2) -&gt; (Human) -&gt; NH3 (Ammonia), H2O, CO2 + Energy.</p>
<p>Turns out, you can recover the Oxygen and Hydrogen from H20 very easily by adding energy. Reusing the Ammonium and Carbon Dioxide byproducts is harder.  There has been some experimentation with adding H2 to CO2 to make H20, which could then be used some more, but I don't think it is widely used. I don't think there is any process for recovering the Ammonia at this point.  </p>
<p>Regardless, you can only generate H20 and CO2 based on the O2 you consume, so there is still some replenishment needed somewhere.  As I understand it, they do ship up quite a bit of water.  </p>
<p>However, remember O2 is not your output process. CO2 is the product which is vented where you lose oxygen. So, you need as much H2O as CO2 you are losing.</p></div>		</li>
