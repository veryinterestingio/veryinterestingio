			<div class="markdown"><p>yes and no, the fundamental limits are far larger than any human, as demonstrated by elephants, but there isn't enough selection pressure in favor of being huge to overcome the higher probability of health problems that comes with being an extreme outlier on size. </p>
<p>If you're 10 feet tall in a population that averages 5, you need twice the blood pressure to get blood up to your brain, and are unlikely to have a circulatory system up to that task. If you apply selection pressure to increase the size of the whole population over several generations, the changes to the circulatory system will naturally follow.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It‚Äôs why you can build a dinky hut out of mud and grass, but skyscrapers require extremely careful planning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Take a cube, and cut the top half off, it's half the weight, but it's no longer a cube. Now cut the front half off, and it's 1/4 the weight but still not a cube. Finally cut the right half off, it's now a cube again and 1/8 the weight, but half the size in each of the three dimensions. Basically 1/2 <em> 1/2 </em> 1/2.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, my bad. from the way you worded it (half the height) I thought only one dimension was being reduced, so the volume was onlyb being halved once.</p></div>		</li>
