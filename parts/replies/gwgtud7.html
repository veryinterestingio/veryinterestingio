			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, normal music (edit: normal at least for Western music as some here pointed out, many other cultures use different systems) splits the octave into 12 equally spaced notes and we just pick 7 of those notes to form our scales (major scale uses the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 8th, 10th and 12th notes so you can see that sometimes there's a 2-note gap, sometimes there's a 1-note gap). Music in the 7-tone system splits the octave into 7 equally spaced notes so none of them will perfectly line up with the 12 equally spaced notes in our 12-tone system. </p>
<p>Edit: Also thought I'd add that the asymmetry of our 7-note scales in the 12-tone system allows the scales to have a clear &quot;root note&quot; (known as the tonic), meaning that the music makes more sense to our ears since we can adjust to the key of the music (especially since our ears have been trained throughout life to understand 12-tone music), whereas the scales in the 7-tone system leave this unclear since any note could equally function as the tonic, which is why it's more ambiguous-sounding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of, different music has different systems. As /u/snkn179 pointed out this is outside the western scale, but different types of music use different scales. In east Asia they sometimes use a 5 tone scale, in India and the Middle East, they use dozens of notes in a scale. In Indonesia they even use a 5 tone and a 7 tone scale at the same time. Some western musicians are known to use notes that aren't even in our system for a new sound. So, this uses notes not in traditional western music, but that doesn't mean that these are notes that have never been used before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, this would be 7 whole steps per octave versus a traditional major scale - which is 2 whole steps, a half step (E to F), 3 whole steps, and another half step (B to C ...if you started with C).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Do is C</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a point of contention.</p>
<p>The question of &quot;Do = C&quot; vs &quot;Do = Tonic&quot; is undetermined and typically depends on what region of what country you live in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to clarify the other answer you got, not quite. Do re mi etc. is the major scale. If you start from &quot;la&quot; then you get the minor scale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can start minor scales on Do if you want. There are two different styles, Do based minor or La based. It depends a lot on whether you use fixed Do as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The question asked about the system that used do re me, etc. That system is in fact called solfege. The question was not which scale mode started on Do (which is the major mode or major scale). </p>
<p>Solfege is a verbal association system that assigns musical pitches with a syllable to better help learn, read, and sing music. </p>
<p>A metaphor for this system would be writing flash cards with different colored pen for each card so that your brain has a color association to help learn each card.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In this system, all diatonic scales have one of each note, just modified. Db major is Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb C. F# major ks F# G# A# B C# D# E#. If we named each chromatic note differently, we lose this property.</p>
<p>Also would make staffs as we know them more difficult to read. Instead of modifying a note on each line, would have twice as many lines? Muddies things up. I'm sure it could work if we started there, but this is where we are now.</p></div>		</li>
