			<div class="markdown"><p>This is mostly correct but I want to nit-pick a bit and say hydrogen bonding and polymerization are not the same thing, polymerization happens with covalent bonding and is much stronger than hydrogen bonding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I apologize, I'm not well-studied in chemistry and may be guilty of repeating information I may not fully understand. For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_bond#Hydrogen_bonds_in_polymers" target="_blank">Wikipedia mentions these hydrogen bonds in the context of polymers</a> but I'm certainly not prepared to tackle the chemistry details here.</p>
<p>Edit: getting into it, such a hydrogen bond between two water molecules is a water dimer, and many such bonds between lots of molecules should naturally suggest it's a water <em>poly</em>-mer, if I'm not mistaken.</p>
<p>Also, amendment to my original post, evidently some synthetics are susceptible to this phenomenon, though perhaps less so, not sure about that.</p>
<p>Edit 2: I'm seeing references of polymers being defined as covalent bonds, as parent claimed. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supramolecular_polymer" target="_blank">Evidently weaker interactions with polymer-like properties are put in a different category.</a>. So let's just say the effect is polymer-like.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I appreciate the curiosity you show and your willingness to look into it more. Hydrogen bonding does do a lot to help stabilize large polymers, but as you found out, it’s a bit different than the bonds between the monomers of the polymer itself.
Also, I’m not an expert by any means, I’ve just taken lots and lots of chemistry and molecular biology in college lol</p></div>		</li>
