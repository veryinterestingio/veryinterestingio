<p>Can’t remember the name but there <em>was</em> an Aircraft Investigations episode about it</p>
<p>Edit:  got it, guys.  The plane was the Comet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also heard in my engineering class that the issue was not initially caught during testing because they ran proof pressure prior to fatigue testing. Proof pressure is a single load of high pressure (let’s say 2 atmosphere pressure differential, not sure what it actually was). So this high load caused the metal to plastically deform, which relieves some of the stress concentration, as well as strain harden the metal (basically metal has higher strengths you strain it then release the strain, a common process is called cold-rolling).</p>
<p>Then, they ran fatigue testing, which is many cycles of a lower load, say 0.5 atms differential (again, making these numbers up).</p>
<p>Well, the proof test is not run on production units, so the stress concentration was higher around the windows and the metal at lower strength than was observed during the fatigue tests, so the fuselage failed during operation, resulting in tragedy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>100% right. It's a common misconception that we didn't know about metal fatigue in the 1950s when in reality, the science had really taken off in the <a href="https://metallurgyandmaterials.wordpress.com/2015/12/25/liberty-ship-failures/" target="_blank">mid 1940s</a> during WWII. In fact, the Comet was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Havilland_Comet#Testing_and_prototypes" target="_blank">actually tested</a> for fatigue up to 16000 cycles! It was (partially) the oversight that proof testing resulted in stress relief that hid the real issue.</p>
<p>Also, most people believe that the Comet failures started at the passenger windows when it was actually the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BOAC_Flight_781#/media/File:Fuselage_of_de_Havilland_Comet_Airliner_G-ALYP.JPG" target="_blank">square ADF windows</a> on the top skin that failed (the top skin sees higher fatigue loads than the side skins).</p>
<p>Modern testing campaigns must use at least 2 complete airframe test articles for this reason (static/ultimate and durability/fatigue).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ELI15: This is so the stresses in the surrounding structure can be evenly distributed. The failure point is the point of greatest stress. So if the stress distribution curve has peaks and valleys it's those peaks that will lead to failure. And those peaks are what are attenuated with round edges.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stress is force over area. If you apply force on a corner the area of that corner is super small so the stress is orders of magnitude larger than If you applied the same amount of force on a flat plate. My friend did some testing on materials where they have a machine that has a point that's like an atom wide to do some sort of test with stress or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what kind of loading you're talking about. If you're building a bridge triangular geometry is great because it's very rigid, however a triangular piece of glass wouldn't be very strong, the corners would be prone to cracking off. A round window doesn't have any corners so it should be more robust.</p></div>		</li>
