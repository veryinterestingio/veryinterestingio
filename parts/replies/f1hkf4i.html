			<div class="markdown"><p>Canadian here with an interesting fact:</p>
<p>Two of our most popular sports (hockey and curling) use this technique to create the ice we play on. Ever notice how the red and blue lines show up and dont disappear as players skate over it, or when the Zamboni scrapes the surface? This is because the lines are drawn directly on the floor beneath the ice which is formed in the same process described above... Below the floor of the arena there are freezing coils, and the water is sprayed on in a fine mist by the zamboni after levelling and scraping the ice, or in the case of curling rinks, by hand with a mist attachment on a hose, and allowed to freeze.</p>
<p>Edit: yes i now know that the lines and logos are painted on a layer of ice rather than the floor beneath. Theres no reason to inform me of this fact, i learned about it 10 hours ago. Read the nested comments. I was more just talking about how those arenas utilize the same technique for clear ice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An easy way to get clear ice at home is get a small cooler, fill it with water and put it in the freezer for a day-ish. Pull it out and then cut it up.. the imperfections will all go to one side and you can just cut it off. Here's a video I used to learn how to do it: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUHcCHbgX_o" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUHcCHbgX_o</a></p>
<p>It's really easy. I was able to use a shitty old bread knife and a towel, and got the cooler for &lt;$10. I had the coolest ice at the party. HA</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just remember to take the ice out in 24 hours. If you leave it longer it will freeze all the way and the bottom part will be cloudy just like regular ice. All you are doing is forcing the air inside the ice to be pushed downwards. When you freeze regularly it freezes outside in trapping the gasses inside the ice to make it cloudy. When you freeze this method it freezes top down so the air and other stuff gets pushed down. You can watch most of the videos they say to dump that water that's trapped in the ice and use the nice top part. That water has the air and the other stuff in it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Um no</p>
<p>That's how cocktail places without a proper ice program/budget but with ambitious employees make theirs.</p>
<p>Not knocking anyone taking the initiative to improve their ice program, hell I've done this when I wanted better ice at a place without the budget for it but it is not and should not be standard protocol at any reputable establishment. </p>
<p>There are plenty of industrial ice makers from whom you can buy a huge properly processed block and chop it down to size yourself, and some places you can even buy the large 2x2&quot; cubes precut. At my current spot we do just that. They're $0.75 a cube which is expensive as fuck but they're flawless and IMO totally worth it.</p>
<p>The cooler freezing method was more prevalent 5 years or so ago, sure, but since then as the cocktail revolution has gotten bigger and bigger people are taking their ice programs a lot more seriously. Companies of course have catered to this. It's small-scale ice sculpting on a much more profitable level. When was the last time you saw a professional ice sculpture vs. a clear cube in a drink? A 2x2x1' block to be cut for cubes sells more frequently than a 5x5x5' block to be carved into The Thinker does.</p>
<p>Edit: sure, downvote the guy who works with clear ice every day</p></div>		</li>
