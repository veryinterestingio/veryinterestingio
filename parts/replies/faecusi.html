			<div class="markdown"><p>To ask a follow-up question, would the difference in gravity at your feet and head increase as you got closer to the center of the station such that there would be a zero gravity point at the middle with increasing gravity to the outside, or would there be some base level of gravity throughout the station?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Artificial gravity is the sensation caused by the floor accelerating you toward the center of the circle, away from the straight line your inertia would otherwise take you.  You can solve for the acceleration (a) you would experience at any radius (r) with a couple variables and equations.  You need mass (m), force (F), and the RPM of the station.</p>
<p>Given a fixed RPM and mass, we can compare the acceleration you would experience at different radii (i.e. at different distances from the middle of the station. The equation for centripetal force is:</p>
<ul>
<li>FsubC = (mv^(2))/r</li>
</ul>
<p>To know your velocity at a given radius and RPM we need:</p>
<ul>
<li>v = [2(pi)r]/t</li>
</ul>
<p>where t is time. We can then combine the two equations with</p>
<ul>
<li>F = ma</li>
</ul>
<p>to yield</p>
<ul>
<li>a = [m[(2(pi)r)/t]^(2)]/(rm)</li>
</ul>
<p>or</p>
<ul>
<li>a = [(2(pi)r)/t]^(2)/r</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll notice that the experienced acceleration is not dependent on mass, just like real gravity! From this, we can get some theoretical values. The acceleration in the case of</p>
<ul>
<li>2 meter radius</li>
<li>2 seconds per revolution</li>
</ul>
<p>would be 2pi^(2) meters per second squared. Now, reducing the radius to 1 meter, we get</p>
<ul>
<li>1 meter radius</li>
<li>2 seconds per revolution</li>
</ul>
<p>yielding a = pi^(2) meters per second squared. In other words, if you reduce your radius by half, your acceleration is also reduced by half. In the case from your question, where you're in the middle of the station, your variables would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>0 meter radius</li>
<li>2 seconds per revolution</li>
</ul>
<p>giving you an acceleration of 0 meters per second, or zero gravity. Hope this was helpful!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we’re talking about a rotating space station, yes, gravity will decrease as you approach the center. If it was a <del>spherical or</del> (who would build a rotating spherical space station, past self?) disc shaped station (instead of ring) you could conceivably have a zero-g room in the center for recreation. If it had multiple decks, you would feel the change in gravity as you moved “up or down” (towards or away from the center).</p></div>		</li>

<p>a sufficiently accurate gyroscope will let you measure the speed and direction of that rotation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How small could you make a gyroscope like that and how finicky would it be?  Could it be feasibly built into say, a firearm that calculates the effect of Coriolis forces on its bullets and automatically corrects accordingly?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Errr... I'm not sure how something that would fit into a bullet would be able to correct the course of the bullet, you'd need fins and some kind of actuator to move them and a power source and computation for it all... It all stacks up to something that I think you'd struggle to fit into a bullet-sized enclosure.</p>
<p>I don't know about the state of the art, I've only played with cheap MEMS gyros which drift a fair bit over a period of minutes but could perhaps keep a decent heading over the flight time of a bullet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh I’m not talking about fitting it in the bullets.  I’m thinking more like something built into a gun that would combine with a rangefinder to work out the path of the bullets beforehand, then adjust the barrel as needed.</p></div>		</li>
