			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're right that the boundary layer theory doesn't explain everything.</p>
<p>There is also the fact that the dust on a fan blade is more dense, harder to wipe off, than the dust that accumulates on, say, a bookshelf. Maybe there is some effect of the speed of the blade compacting the dust?</p>
<p>It should also be noted that the motion causes the blade to come in contact with more air and so more dust than stationary objects, explaining why it accumulates faster.</p>
<p>I've also observed that the dust on the leading edge of fan blades tends to contain a lot of fibers which seem to be draped over the edge. I assume when a fiber hits the leading edge lengthwise it gets captured.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very rational analysis, and plausible hypothesis. But you can add another thought experiment: even conducting metal blades accumulate dust. </p>
<p>The real explanation is that the fan is attempting to push air in a new direction. Tiny air molecules have tiny momentum, and easily follow the streamlines of the airflow. Large dust particles have more momentum, and cut across streamlines (stay in place while the air moves). This process is called impaction.</p>
