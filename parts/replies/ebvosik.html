<p>It's not mentioned yet and I'm on mobile and can't find the reference, but I believe NASA ran a study on rhythms a decade or two ago in isolation and determined that humans eventually fall into a 25hour cycle. The interesting bit here being that our optimal day would have an additional hour in it.</p>

<p>This is one of those half-truths. The 25-hour rhythm was measured in bunker experiments in the 1960s-1970s, mostly conducted by a German research group (Aschoff and Wever). The reason they measured a 25-hour rhythm is because the results were <em>confounded by light exposure</em> -- the research participants were free to turn lights on and off whenever they chose. Because light can reset the circadian clock, this introduced a net lengthening of the observed period.</p>
<p>In experimental conditions that properly control for light, the intrinsic human circadian period averages <strong>24.2 hours</strong>. This was proven about 20 years ago:

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't speak to your specific situation, but for much of society, yes. Light exposure at typical room light / device levels in the evening and early night is known to significantly delay the central circadian clock. For the same reason, we see much earlier and more consistent sleep patterns in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982213007641" target="_blank">individuals who temporarily do not have access to electric light</a> (e.g., camping) and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982216300185" target="_blank">individuals who live in preindustrial societies</a>.</p></div>		</li>
