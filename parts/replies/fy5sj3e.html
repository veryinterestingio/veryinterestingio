			<div class="markdown"><p>These days, with computer analysis being better than any human evaluation, marks for good moves (! or !!) aren't really a thing, because from a computer's perspective there is generally only one &quot;correct&quot; move and the rest are wrong . So called &quot;brilliancies&quot; don't exist for a computer because it doesn't know about a move being &quot;aesthetically pleasing&quot; or care how difficult it may be to see the move, whether it finds it at depth 1 or 100, as long as it finds it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There still are some move, that takes much time for the computer to see they are good.</p>
<p>They even are moves that the computer will say are bad, then after playing a few moves (of what the computer thinks are optimal moves) the computer finally realizes that the position is better/worst than he previously computed.    </p>
<p>Long story short. Computer are just really good at chess, they do not play perfect. Even they can miss good moves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that’s just wrong.
Even if you only believe in computers you’ll find your opinion refuted by LeelaChess which regularly plays romantic masterpieces against traditional chess engines by finding moves which the other engines perceive as trash until Leela plays them. </p>
<p>The deeper an engine tries to evaluate the position the more unreliable the evaluation becomes (unless it’s a clear cut result of course). That’s called the „horizon effect“. </p>
<p>Am chess player with 2331 FIDE rating so while I’m not that great I know what I’m talking about.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are no wrong moves, just lower-scoring moves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't argue TOO much. I only ever won one tournament match, and it's because he forgot to hit his clock. So I bluffed him for the full hour until he realized his mistake with three minutes left.
He blitzed me for those three minutes, announced mate in three, then his flag fell. Oops.</p></div>		</li>
