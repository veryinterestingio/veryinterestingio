			<div class="markdown"><p>To that end, I'd like to remind everyone that we all sweat. And it evaporates constantly, basically adding the oils from your skin to the air. This will eventually hit other surfaces and pick up other particles (becoming a grease), and it just snowballs from there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plastic blades accentuate this with the static clings. </p>
<p>And you can also consider an air filter. Air filters concentrate all the dust in your home, sucking it through a paper filter and you can see how dirty they get even though your living room isn’t a sand storm. </p>
<p>And while the edge of a fan blade has considerably less surface area, the same principle applies. And as others have said ITT, grease and moisture increase sticktoitness while increasing surface area. So accumulation isn’t linear. </p>
<p>[Obligatory clean your blades before reversing fan rotation here.]</p></div>		</li>
