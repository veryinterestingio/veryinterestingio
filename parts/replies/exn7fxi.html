			<div class="markdown"><p>It's so frustrating that so many countries gutted huge chunks of their own land, but just expected Brazil to &quot;be the good guy&quot; and leave its natural resources alone. </p>
<p>Few countries contributed to the protection of the Amazon or compensated Brazil for that thing they want Brazil to keep.</p>
<p>And now the rest of the world is shocked, calling Brazil selfish / moronic  as if they hold no responsibility for this outcome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Amen to this!  Where is the great North American forest that stretched from coast to coast?  Chopped down in the course of a century to build railroads and houses.  Until the US replant itâ€™s multimillion acre forest, we should stfu about Brazil.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By that logic, each country should be allowed to use as much fossil fuels as the US/UK did. It may sound hypocritical coming from us, but the reality is we now know more know about the environment and we should hold each other to a different standard. I don't mind us being called hypocrites so long as the planet remains habitable for human life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol such a thing never existed. Most of the US has always been great plains. We could do better for the environment but don't make things up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was never such as forest in North America. Lewis and Clark described the endless sea of grass lands with no trees just like it is today. In fact, because of increase co2 and temp, there are actually more vegetation now than ever before measured. We do however, need to protect old growth forests</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, from the point of view of the climatologists and biologists, Brazil is endangering all of humanity through the usual hyperconservative greed mechanism of land exploitation.  Take out the Amazon rainforest and I figure 95% of humanity follows within a decade or two.  Starting on the burning savannahs where the forests once were.</p>
<p>So yeah, Brazil is selfish, and moronic, and their home is going to look like the last stanzas of Cerrone's Supernature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except that other countries could pay for both the protection and for Brazil keeping it, but don't.</p>
<p>Yeah no doubt it's a bad move, but so many of the people acting like they're above these people burning it, are from countries that did NOTHING to fund/protect it.</p>
<p>They need to start putting deals in place with Brazil rather than demanding, and do more for the environment in their own countries.</p></div>		</li>
