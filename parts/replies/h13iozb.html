			<div class="markdown"><p>OK but why then is Nickel (FCC) magnetic? Ferritic and martensitic (BCC/BCT) steel are both magnetic while austenitic (FCC) steel is not.</p>
<p>I think it has something to do with crystalline structure at room temp (e.g. Nickel is FCC at room temp, whereas steel without Nickel is austenitic only at high temps) but not sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay i was trying to stay very high level.  Essentially the electron shell configuration of a metal atom, in combination with its alignment in a crystal lattice, can, in certain metals and crystal structures, align the electrons where, on a macroscopic level, provide a net positive electromagnetic field.  What i mean by this is that in most materials, all the atoms are aligned randomly, where all the little magnetic fields of the electrons throughout the material have random alignments that all cancel out.  For magnetic materials, there is a “synchronization” of the electron spins in a majority of the electrons so that the object has a net magnetic moment (north and south pole).  Almost all metals have this feature, however in very specific cases where the atom nucleus, electron shell, and crystal structure all align in a way that nets in a huge amount of electron synchronization and a large, powerful magnetic field.  </p>
<p>Now, some materials, like ferrite, will do this naturally, while others like steels can be done through forcing specific crystal structures in the cooling process.  Others can be made by cooling within a strong magnetic field.  Electromagnets achieve magnetism through electron current.  Current is induced by applying a voltage difference which induces “free” electrons within the metal to flow, and the flow of electrons (now all oriented the same direction from the voltage) to have a net magnetic moment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right but I was more curious about the actual crystalline structure - Face Centered Cubic is the tightest packing of the atoms and if I understand correctly a Body Centered structure allows more give for electrons to move more freely in the electron cloud which I inferred allowed them to line up spins and therefore be magnetic. However Nickel is magnetic but FCC which was the only exception which makes that theory incomplete.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The lattice gives a structure, but in an alloy where you're mixing Fe, Ni, C, and what have you, this changes the wavefunction of the system dramatically, leading to new material properties. Each atomic type shifts the weights distributed on the lattice, so to speak.</p>
<p>Steels are often doped too, adding further atoms interstitially between lattice points for example. </p>
<p>Whatever atoms are sitting on that FCC lattice (and</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>just to tag in here, Allotropes is the term, basically different structures of physical matter e.g. different crystal structures for iron. Think of it as a phase change but for instead of gas/liquid/solid, its just going through different solid structure phases. The easiest example off the top of my head is graphite and diamonds. Same thing happens with iron and most solid state things.</p>

<p>Its actually pretty neat topic, they have ferromagnetic Q-carbon and all those wacky forms of ice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Steel, especially stainless steel has crystals arranged in such a way that there is not a net magnetic dipole. Certain types of stainless steel is magnetic, which is what he was pointing out.  I mean steel is an alloy of iron, so by definition it would be less ferrous than pure iron.</p></div>		</li>
