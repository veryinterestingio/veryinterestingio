<p>It's a way of showing off that you have a really fast computer. It's not really relevant to mathematics in any way, nor is it particularly newsworthy.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Neither. Pi is not evaluated by taking a physical circle and dividing its circumference by its diameter; that would allow for potential measurement error, which is undesirable. Instead pi is directly computed to arbitrary precision by using any of several known infinite series that have been proven to converge to pi. No physical observations or measurements are necessary.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Most of the time, yes (fast, with a lot of storage, and fault-tolerant). It might also mean you've found a new algorithm for computing pi, and that could be very relevant to mathematics, because a new algorithm for pi probably means a new relationship (or at least a new viewpoint on a known relationship) between mathematical entities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a similar example to provide some more insight on this: √2 is also an irrational number, the same as pi. Yet, you can mark it's <em>exact</em> coordinate on the axis - create a 1x1 square and place its diagonal on the axis. Boom, Pythagoras says you just marked √2 without beinh able to fully represent it.</p>
<p>Same with pi - not being able to write it down decimally doesn't mean we can't <em>show</em> exactly what it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is spot on, but if I may, I'd like to suggest another perspective on it.</p>
<p>Do we know the exact value of 1? It's tempting to say &quot;of course,&quot; but when you zoom in a bit, even the question of &quot;how do you define the question of knowing the exact value&quot; is tricky. In the end, 1 doesn't have a value other than &quot;the value that is 1.&quot; You can give it various properties that define it (set theory does this, for instance), but ultimately, 1 is a number whose exact value is known to be 1, and whose exact interaction with other numbers is well known.</p>
<p>Pi is just the same way. Its value is known exactly, as pi. Its definition comes from other, more fundamental definitions (just like 1's does), and it interacts with other numbers in known, exact ways (just like 1 does). Its definition is less intuitive than 1's, which is why you learn it many years after you learn how to count to 1 -- but other than that, it's not a whole lot different.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>We know pi to many more digits than any measuring device you can possibly use.  Insofar as you can't cut a square piece of paper exactly 4pi in area, the problem is more to do with your tools than with the value of pi.</p>
<p>For example, pi to 17 decimal places is 3.14159265358979323.  Using that approximation,
the area is 12.56637061435917292 square inches, so you need to cut a piece of paper that's 3.54490770181103204982 inches on a side.  There is nothing anywhere on Earth that can measure to that level of precision.</p>
<p>When it comes to actual physical objects, the problem isn't how many digits of pi we have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To the previous commenter’s point, being able to truly “know” a number is not contingent on our ability to define it by real-world physical objects. Part of what makes math interesting is that throughout history we’ve had to stretch our imaginations and expand our notions of what numbers are real (and I don’t mean like real vs complex numbers, I mean in the philosophical sense).</p>
<p>Back many hundreds of years ago someone might look at the following equation and say that it has no solution:</p>
<p>3 + x = 1</p>
<p>Of course we know that the solution is x=-2, but someone from antiquity may argue that that’s lunacy because how can you have negative apples? There’s no such thing as an anti-apple. Of course you or I would probably argue that there <em>is</em> such a thing, in a sense, like if I paid you and you owed me an apple - but yes it is true that there are no literal negative apples in the world. But since we’re all very comfortable with the notion of negative numbers, we would have no issue with saying that there don’t have to be, and that numbers need not be bound by such constraints in order to be legit.</p>
<p>People today give the same treatment to complex numbers (which probably is due to the terrible marketing that came with the name “imaginary numbers”) but complex/imaginary numbers are just as real as real numbers, like how negative numbers are as real as positive numbers.</p>
<p>The same goes for transcendentals and irrationals, which we can’t write down as decimal representations (or in any base number system for that matter). We can intuitively define positive rational numbers in real-world terms, but defining π as the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter is just fine too. Just because π is not constructable on a piece of paper in the form you describe doesn’t mean we don’t know the value of π. You can’t cut out a square with -4 length either, but I think you’d agree we all know what -4 is.</p>
<p>I guess the point of what I’m trying to say is that “knowing” a number means being able to rigorously define it, regardless of whether we can write it down as a finite decimal. We tend to conflate those things because that’s what we’re familiar with; our brains are conditioned from grade school to believe that numbers <em>are</em> what we compose from the digits 0-9. But that’s not true - numbers are what we define them to be, and being able to write them down as a finite sequence of digits is comparatively unimportant.</p></div>		</li>
