			<div class="markdown"><p>That one I'm not sure of! I'm totally guessing but I think bar soap is better, just from what I understand about viruses and so on. I can explain further if you like but honestly it would be pure my own thoughts than actual facts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I tend to use bar soap at home, as pretty much every liquid soap is full of sodium laureth sulphate these days, which was originally used as a degreasing agent until soap companies realised it was cheaper than the old chemicals they were using. It's a known skin irritant, but it's even in the hypoallergenic liquid soaps. My skin has been much better since I've been avoiding it. It's also in some bar soaps, so shop around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neither. It all comes down to a product’s ingredients (edit: and your skin type). </p>
<p>Our skin’s pH is ~5 (slightly acidic). True ‘soap’ (made from alkaline salts and fat) is alkaline/basic, so it can be irritating. This is usually the issue with many bar soaps— Irish Springs, for example, is about pH 10. Dove sensitive skin is about 6, so it’s generally less irritating. </p>
<p>Dr. Bronners, which is pure castille soap, is pH 9. <a href="https://www.lisabronner.com/skin-health-ph-and-dr-bronners-soap/" target="_blank">They claim</a> that it’s been disproven that long term use of basic soaps damages skin, and they do have legit studies that support that,  but there’s still many that say the opposite, so it’s somewhat debated. It’s a frequent complaint that Dr Bronners or any other basic soap irritates or strips skin— however plenty of people report no issues to basic soaps (they have been used for millennia after all) so it seems to be pretty individual. Lots of people advocate for Dr. Bronners, but personally with my sensitive skin, it left my skin raw. (to any Dr Bronners fans out there: yes, I diluted it, and even added jojoba) If you do use a basic soap, just make sure you use moisturizer after. </p>
<p>Most liquid face and body washes aren’t actually soaps, they’re cleansers. Many of these contain detergents that suds up all nice and leave you feeling squeaky clean, but are actually stripping the skin of its natural protective moisture barrier. Sodium laurel sulfate is the most common offender. </p>
<p>There are other ingredients to avoid as well— essential oils can be super irritating, as can any added fragrance/parfum.  Alcohol is commonly used as a preservative in skin products, but it can be very drying (to note, there are certain alcohols that aren’t bad. <a href="https://www.majormag.in/alcohol-in-skin-care-guide/" target="_blank">Here’s a list</a> that breaks down good vs. bad alcohol).</p>
<p>On the flip side, there are lots of ingredients that are helpful. If you have dry, itchy, or irritated skin, look for hydrating/moisturizing ingredients: aloe, honey, ceramides, some oils (especially jojoba, rose hip, and squalane), and hyaluronic acid. If your skin is super greasy, things like salicylic acid can help. If you have any specific issue like acne, eczema, or rosacea, it’s helpful to look for products targeted toward those issues. But these specific ingredient/products usually apply more to face products. </p>
<p><a href="https://incidecoder.com" target="_blank">This site</a> lets you search for products and it’ll break down the ingredient list to show you any helpful or harmful ingredients. </p>
<p>As far as washing your body, you really should only be washing soiled skin. So generally your armpits, groin, and feet, the places prone to sweat and smell. Unless you have a job that you get super dirty, there’s rarely a need to cleanse your arms, stomach, or legs. Bathing is not meant to kill germs, as a lot of people here have mentioned. Yes soap does kill germs (it breaks down the protective outer walls of bacteria and viruses) which is why hand washing is so important. But unless you’re a surgeon, we are not supposed to be sanitizing our bodies. Germs and natural and normal aspects of your skin. Bathing it’s just supposed to lift the grime off your skin. </p>
<p>For both body and face products, just look for something simple and non-irritating. You don’t need to spend a lot of money, there are plenty of good drugstore products. Cerave hydrating facial wash is a good example— it’s $15 for 16 oz, is pH balanced, doesn’t have any detergents or other irritating ingredients, and actually has moisturizing ingredients. Even though it’s marketed as a face wash, I use it as body wash as well. If you prefer bar soaps, then Dove sensitive skin bar is really the only drugstore one I would recommend— pH balanced, non-stripping, has moisturizer as well.  (edit: vaginas are highly sensitive environments, many soaps/cleansers throw that environment off with either too basic pH or too many irritating ingredients. Searching for soaps that are vagina approved yields pretty good results for <a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/g27614313/vagina-soap/" target="_blank">better bar soaps </a>)</p>
<p>As with all things, results may vary. Always test a skincare product on a small section of skin to make sure you don’t react to it. Try to figure out your skin type / major concerns, and search for products that way (literally Googling “best body wash for tough dry skin” will yield you endless Best 10 lists) </p>

<p>There's a reason why this cleanser is recommended so much, it's really amazing. Never thought of using it as bodywash, seems kind of expensive for me to be doing that often.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>2 scenarios I'd like to ask you about, I have never heard about not wanting my entire body and that's extremely new to me! I am a union painter and my natural end of day body is somewhat sweaty but nothing crazy. Should I still only wash my heavy sweat gland areas? And if so, say I have a hard day at work and I sweat enough to be sweaty everywhere, do I wash my entire body?</p>
<p>Secondly, my girlfriend is a manager at a fast food restaurant and she sweats a lot as well, every day she showers her full body, should that change in her situation?</p>
<p>And finally, we use Irish spring bar soap (seems that is not the best choice.) It works fine on me and I have no problems but the gf is always breaking out no matter what she does would you recommend anything for people who breakout a lot?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to this answer in a less ELI5 way</p>
<p>Liquid soap usually isn't soap, with the exception of Dr. Bronners and a few others. It's a detergent (usually sodium lauryl sulfate or sodium coco sulfate if they're advertising as natural/petroleum free) and the reason it feels more slippery is because they add hydroxide compounds to them to decrease acidity and add moisturizers to give the skin that slippery feeling</p>
<p>Bar soaps tend to be made from real soaps (fats combined with lye) rather than detergents. Hard water reacts with calcium and magnesium ions in soap and creates hard water deposits so its important to have a water softener if you use real soap. Its also even more important to moisturize afterwards because there are none mixed in.</p>
<p>There are arguments to be made both for and against detergents and soaps. For example SLS can be bad for people with eczema and soap can excessively dry out skin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes to all of this, but most true soaps are actually bad for the skin because they’re too basic, hence why they can be so drying. The answer is to find a cleanser (whether liquid or solid, true soap or not) that’s pH balanced and detergent free.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s because Dove is pH balanced! Our skins pH is ~5, and Dove soap is close to that. Irish Spring on the other hand is more like pH 10, which is why it can irritate skin.</p>
<p>edit: pH 10 not 8</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s mostly due to calcium soap deposits on the skin which suppresses charge interactions of skin on skin, and keratin in the stratum corneum is more negatively charged at higher pH. Noticeable surfactant dissolution of the lipid components of the SC barrier happens over time and that is what gives the tight and dry feeling. Squeaky clean/grippy is a charge interactions thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a weird feeling! Feeling tight after cleansing is characteristic of dry skin! If you prefer bars, switch over to a synthetic detergent bar that has surfactants like sodium cocoyl isethionate and/or cocamidopropyl betaine. Most liquid cleansers (sodium laureth sulfate, alkyl glucosides, glutamates) are a little gentler on the skin as well around pH 5-7.</p></div>		</li>
