But, just like most issues happening in the world, people here don't really care about the real problems, but rather like to dance with the &quot;news&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now that things have come to this, I'm interested in what do you think is the best way to resolve this?  China as an authoritarian government probably won't back down to a protest, as that will just create more protests down the line.  HK can't just roll over and let this slide after such a large portion of the population protested.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The solution is to agree to some of the demands.  Open up all legislature seats to open election and real elections for the chief executive.  Then the govt elected by the people can have a public consultation and legislate on the extradition bills.  </p>
<p>The police and triads need an independent investigation once that new government is in control.  Plus the complaints and punishment system for them need reform as the conviction rates are insanely low.  </p>
<p>Otherwise protests are going to be a regular occurrence, they already are.  Only free elections can perhaps decrease them as the people will have a legitimate avenue for political change and gain more power in a system controlled by the rich and Beijing.  </p>
<p>The other is to suppress, perhaps violently and push people further afield and out of Hong Kong with living costs to dilute them.  Replace them with more mainlanders.  </p>
<p>If both approaches lead to more protests, why not just grow some balls and let people control their own lives.  They'd be less resentful towards Beijing, as sometimes things aren't actually their fault.</p></div>		</li>
