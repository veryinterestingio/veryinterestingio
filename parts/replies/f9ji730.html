			<div class="markdown"><p>The fact that they look magenta on the wall only has to do with how we see color; they aren't actually changing frequency when they bounce off the same point together (that is, if you looked at the reflection with a spectrometer, you'd see peaks at the original red and blue wavelengths, not at a magenta wavelength in the middle; it our eyes are just a little dumb). Similarly, if you some uv and it in the same spot on a walk you'll see either nothing or possibly blue (because the uv laser is causing the wall to floresce-- this doesn't involve the ir laser at all though)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed, they can't be, since <em>no frequency</em> is magenta, it's not a real colour (you won't find it in the rainbow). The colour &quot;in the middle&quot; is green.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right! Although I don't think I would say it isn't a &quot;real&quot; color; I prefer to say that it isn't a spectral or monochromatic color</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The magenta color only occurs because the red and blue laser separately stimulate the red and blue cones in your eye. They do not combine to create a new light wave with a magenta wavelength (incidentally there is no such wavelength). Otherwise you are right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't exist in that there is not a single wavelength of light that is the color magenta. Your brain interprets seeing both red and blue light (low end of the visible spectrum and high end of the visible spectrum) at the same time as magenta</p></div>		</li>

<p>I know if you shine a red and blue laser at the same spot on a white wall, they will reflect magenta</p>

<p>The light being reflected is still a combination of red and blue, we just perceive it as magenta because it stimulates the cones in our eyes exactly how magenta light would. Some women with four cones can supposedly distinguish between such light (i.e. pure yellow vs. red + green making yellow).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I could be wrong, but I assume that if you &quot;cross the beams of a UV laser and an infrared laser&quot; (in open space) they will not produce visible light until they have a surface or medium to interact on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The medium to interact in is spacetime itself. Binaural beats, the acoustic equivalent, happen when the sound waves combine in the medium itself. The reason that this same effect <del>doesn't</del>  <strong>may not actually</strong> happen with EM waves is because acoustic (and EM) beats result in a wave whose <em>volume</em> (i.e. intensity) varies at a much lower frequency. <del>For sound waves, we can perceive this variation in volume as a tone. But since our eyes don't work like our ears, we likely won't perceive a variation in the intensity of high frequency light as being itself a color of light.</del></p>
<p>Edit, after more thought, I realized that you could also state the new wave as being one of lower frequency whose volume varies at a very high frequency. See my reply to OP for my full answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha, good point. Didn't realize that magenta was extra-spectral although extra-spectral colors were something I had in the back of my mind when writing my explanation. Perhaps magenta arises from seeing both the high and low frequency beats produced by combining red and blue? Whereas when you combine red and green, only the yellow beat in the middle (averaged frequency) is visible and the lower frequency (difference between them divided by 2) is invisible.</p></div>		</li>
