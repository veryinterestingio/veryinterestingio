			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing that makes Buddhism difficult for those raised around Western philosophical ideas is that Buddhism's end goal is completely different from the three main Western religions. In both Christianity and Islam the end goal is to be saved and go to heaven and live by God's side for all eternity. Judaism also believes in ever lasting life with God, it's just the route you take to get there is different. </p>
<p>The goal in Buddhism is to escape Samsara completely and return to the Buddha nature never to be reborn again. Samsara is the wheel of life. It contains all the realms of life and reincarnation. So the goal is to never exist again. This is achieved by obtaining Nirvana. There are some sects of Buddhism that have a &quot;heaven&quot;. This is known as pure land Buddhism. However this heaven-like space is not a permanent location but rather an intermediate step you take while waiting to return to the Buddha nature. This is because the branch of Buddhism in which pure land sects are found believes that no one can escape the Samsara until the entire world has achieved nirvana. So once the individual obtains nirvana it becomes his duty to help lead others to finding their own revelation. </p>
<p>This lack of a soul is a key difference that separates Buddhist Samsara from the Samsara of Buddhism's parent religion, Hinduism. The Saṃsāra doctrine of Buddhism asserts that while beings undergo endless cycles of rebirth, there is no changeless soul that transmigrates from one lifetime to another. The Buddha attempted to explain this with the metaphor that moving between the realms of Samsara was like a flame being transferred from one candle to another.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would you perhaps be willing (<em>no</em> hard feelings if not) to explain how one might live a Buddhist life without attempting to escape Samsara/attain Nirvana? I am unable to place those expectations on myself but would still like to set the precedent for my future lives. I identify personally as a 'shitty Buddhist' because I fit the ideology but lack the practice. I also will not stop smoking green or drinking wine so I'm not a candidate for Nirvana anyway, but would like to do my best.</p>
<p>PM would be fine if you prefer, it is also bedtime in my area so I won't be able to respond until tomorrow if accepted</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree that a zen teacher would likely dismiss the question but other sects focus much more heavily on transmigration/reincarnation and would say we arise from the karma of our past lives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IMO, this aspect of Buddhism is just as bad as any Christian dogma about heaven, hell, purgatory, etc. and God being “all knowing, so why did he put us here to suffer, etc.”</p>
<p>Why should I be defined by past lives that I had no control over and have no memory of now? And, what’s the point of becoming enlightened and freed from the self after death? If I’m freed from myself, or my “earthly” thoughts, then I’m no longer really myself am I? I’d have no memory or understanding of who I was or how I got there.</p>
<p>Maybe I just haven’t read the right books to answer this stuff, but for now I’m just agnostic with no regard for what was or will be.</p></div>		</li>
