			<div class="markdown"><p>I would hesitate before calling fever checkpoints useless.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They would be useless only if fever is NOT a symptom. Please remember that transmission doesn't stop once you develop symptoms: If you have Covid-19 and it has expressed a fever, you are still infectious and the checkpoints are there to help in such scenarios</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every bit helps, since there's no silver bullet for the disease as yet. Any infected identified and singled out from these checkpoints is one less person contributing to transmission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The checkpoints also don't appear to significantly take away resources from other solutions. If the checkpoints are cancelled, it's not like the people manning the checkpoints nor the thermometer manufacturers are suddenly going to start making PPE or test clinical vaccines instead.</p>
</li>
<li>Everybody keeps bringing up the asymptomatic expression of the virus, but I haven't seen any studies that definitively shows the virus is asymptomatic (virus never expresses symptoms) as opposed to pre-symptomatic (virus expresses symptoms later) for a MAJORITY (&gt;50%) of people.</li>

<p>There haven't been, to my knowledge. And most of the reports the people using to push this idea are either incomplete studies, or outright state &quot;asymptomatic at time of testing, with almost all cases going on to develop symptoms later&quot;. Most notably the Finland study where the originating scientist had to release a clarification to combat the misinformation spread as a result of news articles reporting it.</p>
<p>The current understanding is very few people remain asymptomatic through the duration of infection and asymptomatic transmission is not the primary driver of this disease.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One additional downside to consider is that checkpoints that give a lot of false negatives may cause people to be less cautious. If they pass the checkpoint even though they're infected they may think they don't need to worry about it and relax their distancing and other containment measures. And all the people who passed through the checkpoint and think they're only surrounded by healthy people will also change their risk avoidance behavior.</p>
<p>It's still probably a net good, but that should be added to the downside list.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have to get my temperature checked every day to go into work. Last weeks results were as follows: M- 94.2 T- 94.0 W-94.6 T-96.0 F-94.3 S-101.7 then 97.1 after the checker told me to splash water on my face. S- 95.5</p>
<p>I've been taking my temperature at home every day and have been between 97.8 and 98.9 every time. IR thermometer checks are absolutely useless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Checkpoints are certainly not as effective for COVID 19 as they were for other diseases, but calling them useless is ignorant. Fever checkpoints are the way China, Taiwan, and Vietnam have stopped the spread of the virus. They have only been so effective because of the communities’ dedication to social distancing and other precautionary measures, but they are a major part of the solution as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, if around 20% develop a fever, that's 20% you can prohibit from spreading the disease in crowded areas. It won't stop the virus, but it will definitely slow it down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Welcome to the other side of the mask’s debate. It’s just that people don’t like change and don’t want to change their cultural behaviours. Mask wearing is so deep embedded in the Asian culture that it only makes sense for everyone to start wearing a mask publicly.</p>
<p>In the western world it is much harder to convince people. I’m European myself and I do have to say that the first days of wearing one were weird. Like when meeting someone, I would have the instinct to remove my mask. In my culture it’s impolite to cover our faces when speaking to someone. I adjusted rather quickly, but for a whole nation to adjust to a foreign cultural behaviour? It doesn’t go that easily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Personally where I live its impossible to get a mask at all, sold out everywhere and to my understanding the virus is contained in micro droplets that pass through homemade masks, effectively rendering them useless. It's like trying to catch sardines in a net with holes a meter wide.</p>
<p>EDIT: Useless is a bit harsh, but definitely not as useful as other types</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Homemade mask will not protect you from a spreader who is coughing in your face, but they significantly reduce the spread of your own droplets. </p>
<p>Its the reason why Surgeons are wear surgical masks and not N95 masks. The goal is to protect the patient not the doctor. </p>
<p>If everyone wore homemade masks it would significantly decrease the spread caused by COVID-19 asymptomatic (and foolish symptomatic) individuals.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Homemade masks are pretty effective at outward transmission. This is pretty important from a public health perspective.</p>
<p>Masks provide two benefits, the most obvious you alluded to, filtration efficiency. Depending on particle size, a mask made out of t-shirt material can be fairly effective at filtration, 70% off the top of my head.  Filtration efficiency can be improved by using a two layered mask as well, especially of dissimilar materials.</p>
<p>Filtration efficiency is not the primary benefit of widespread public mask usage in all likelihood.  Likely velocity reduction of exhaled droplets or aerosols is more significant. Even a relatively thin scarf that only offers mediocre filtration probably may have a significant reduction in exhaled droplet velocity.</p>
<p>Try blowing out a candle without a mask, then try with a mask. Note the maximum distance you can successfully blow out the candle, and consider that you are using air, never mind anything larger such as a virus particle.</p>
<p>Most mask research has focused on influenza and SARS-1, but there are some preprints available focusing on COVID-19.  We will likely need to wait years to truly get a detailed understanding of optimal mask usage strategies, but in the meantime, some broad conclusions seem evident.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Outward protection is more important than inward protection from a public health perspective, stopping asymptomatic or presymptomatic carriers from spreading</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More people wearing masks is more significant to reducing spread than fewer better masks.  For example, if 100% of people were masks that were 50% effective, that would likely reduce the R0 for COVID-19 below 1 by itself. </p>
</li>
<li>It's relatively easy to make a mask that is fairly effective for Outward protection, assuming you have at least an old t-shirt. Or just wear a bandana. You could do better, but see 2 above.</li>
</ol>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It wasnt just because of the precaution. SARS was more fatal than COVID which limited the spread, because the host would most likely die before spreading further. COVID isnt as fatal as SARS and ebola that it is able to spread much more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sars fatality rate is about a little less than 10% while covid is a little less than 4%</p>
<p>Sars had less chance to spread than covid because the fatality rate is higher than covid. If covids fatality rate was about the same as sars, it wouldnt have spread this much. </p>
