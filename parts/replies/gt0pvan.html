			<div class="markdown"><p>Man I am so confused, as a fellow HoH person. If your aids can't even pick up your own voice are they picking up anything at all?</p>
<p>But man do I feel you on the remodulation, I remember upgrading to my current ones from my childhood ones and everything was so damn loud, even my voice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hear myself but it’s not accurate. Does that make sense.? Right now I talk way too loud because I don’t know I’m loud. I sound normal. But once I get upgraded I’ll hear myself clearly and it will sound too loud.</p></div>		</li>
