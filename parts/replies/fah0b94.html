			<div class="markdown"><p>That shit kinda scares me man. One time I drove to work after only getting like maybe 4 hours of sleep and was feeling groggy. Well I remember pulling out out of my neighborhood, getting sort of entranced by the lines on the road, and then the next thing I know I'm at my work parking space. I had basically slept-drove a 15 minute drive just off muscle memory I guess. I made sure to down a bunch of coffee in the mornings for a while after cause I was so freaked out by the idea of doing it again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tired and sleepy are just two different things. I've driven 800 miles alone and been tired but had no desire to sleep. I also have GI  issues and am never hungry but I know when I need to consume some calories. It's easy to zone out and just follow the white line for 10 hours</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was me in college. Chug a couple of those Starbucks cans from a gas station, windows down, music blarring, eyes drooping, slap to the face, chew gum.</p>
<p>It's horrible and every car should have a breathalyzer and ...sleepy-chemical-brain-scanner... built into the starter. I just realized that it's probably difficult to objectively measure &quot;tiredness&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always thought that I could never fall asleep while driving growing up and yesterday was a true test of will power for me.</p>
<p>I had to literally focus with every fiber of me to not close my eyes, I finally pulled into a holiday gas station and ate some subway and drank mad liquids and got back on the road.</p>
<p>Now It was a race between me and my bladder and didn’t feel so tired.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I fell asleep on a long drive over a decade ago on a trip with a buddy. Luckily the bumps on the shoulder of the road woke me up. Scared the shit out of me and we took a little time to nap at the closest gas station. Now if I'm having trouble keeping my eyes open either someone else drives or anyone with me can entertain themselves for an hour while I take a nap at a rest stop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read about a tactic here on Reddit that has worked very well for me. Count backwards from 100 <em>very slowly</em>. We're talking uncomfortable amounts of slow. Leave what feels like 10 second gaps in your counting. If you lose count, it doesn't matter, just count down from a random number you remember. I don't think I've ever made it to 60.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You need to actively try and think of something else this is distracting but also not intensive. Something free-flowing with <em>just enough</em> concentration to keep it going and push out intrusive thoughts.</p>
<p>The cliche is &quot;counting sheep&quot; but it's way better to be more creative and positive.</p>
<p>For example, design the ultimate recreation room/mansion/treehouse/restaurant Or Waterpark. Whatever. Revel in every detail and just let them come and go without any worry about building permits or how others would judge you. It's a secret place for you and you alone so have fun with it. </p>
<p>Think of it like conjuring a dream and hopefully you can evoke that sleepy dreamy feeling that will transition you into real sleep.</p></div>		</li>
