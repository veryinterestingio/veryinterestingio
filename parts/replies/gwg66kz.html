			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, you'll see B/E#'s and C/Fb notated sometimes to fit standard notation schemes since you don't want to double up notes in a scale. You'll also get double sharps (like Fx) and double flats (like Dbb) for the same reason. </p>
<p>Like say in D# major, the notes are D# E# Fx G# A# B# Cx D#. Enharmonically Fx is a G and Cx is a D but then you'd have two G's and two D's in the notation and it gets messy.</p>
<p>Woe be upon those who write or transpose to those scales though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, if you're playing in C# major the key signature shows both E# and B#. </p>
<p>You already have F# and C# in that scale so if you had &quot;F&quot; and &quot;C&quot; you would have to use accidentals every time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh god. What happens if you try to define all numbers as a fraction?</p>
<p>Some set of numbers {\in} a/b where
a is an integer from -inf to inf
b is an integer from 0 to inf</p>
<p>Wouldn't that set of numbers be R?</p>
<p>Can't we do the same thing with frequency? If we define a distance, a, some number of waves in that distance, b wouldn't there be an infinite amount of wave lengths or is there an upward limit?</p>
<p>Are there not infinity many combinations or does it get fucky as b approaches infinity?</p>
<p>Edit: does this mean that the set of real numbers is not equivalent to the set of &quot;measurable&quot; numbers? As the set of measurable numbers are integer multiplication of the plank distance?</p></div>		</li>
