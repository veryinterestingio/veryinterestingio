			<div class="markdown"><p>A1C is honestly all over the place.</p>
<p>The error bars on average RBC lifespan are large, generally it’s cited at 80 +/- 11 days, and the assumption that RBC synthesis itself remains static regardless of glucose levels is a big one. There’s also several different kinds of hemoglobin present in most people (&gt;90% HbA1, HbA2, HbF), but the proportions themselves can vary, and we don’t know if they get glycated at the same rate, if they dissociate at different rates, etc.</p>
<p>There’s also a long list of things which can alter hemoglobin concentration like thalassemias, which can significantly decrease the ratio of hemoglobin:glucose, meaning higher A1C for one person compared to another with more hemoglobin, but the same actual glucose levels between them. For example, beta thalassemia can make your RBCs substantially smaller, and increase the rate of reuptake by the spleen, giving you a lower A1C when you have the same glucose levels as someone with normal diameter RBCs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A1c is probably the most stable measure we have of blood glucose over time. </p>
<p>Yes it is imperfect, but you really don’t have a better option. Your examples are quite special circumstances. HbF for example is very rarely seen in adults outside of hemoglobinopathies and very young children. </p>
<p>The solution to the problem you’re describing is knowing the context in which you read the A1c.</p>
<p>Edit: Time in Range is a newer measure which will likely come to replace A1c for those who can afford the technology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While a lot of what you're saying is going over my head, I want you to know that I admire the time and effort you must have put in to be so well-versed on the topic. It comforts me to know that there are people working hard to lug the rest of society into a better tomorrow. Thank you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is what I'm saying. I know what HbA1c is. The idea is that men have higher fasting blood glucose so <em>would be expected to</em> have higher HbA1c. However, maybe it is lowered because of higher RBC turnover, leading to an overall indifference in HbA1c between men and women.</p></div>		</li>
