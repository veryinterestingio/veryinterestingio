<p>Not sure the premise is true. I'll grant that complexes are usually branded to appear distinct and independent</p>

<p>That is what the OP was saying. They brand themselves to look locally run, unlike hotels which brand themselves to look like a mega-brand.</p>
<p>I think the answer can be seen by thinking about problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hotel stays are short (and expensive per day), so it's unlikely you hit a problem.  That means you will choose that brand in the future.</li>
<li>Apartment stays are long, so  you will have an unpleasant experience eventually. So people frequently want to switch brands when moving. (Jokes on them unless they dig in to find out who really &quot;owns&quot; their apartment.)</li>
