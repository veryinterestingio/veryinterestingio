			<div class="markdown"><p>You are constantly being exposed to viruses and bacteria. Your body has an innate resistance to infection by nonspecific immune responses. But these immune responses can only fend off so much infectious material before it spills over and you actually get sick. For example, if we shot one single COVID-19 virus at you and you inhaled it, you most likely wouldn't become infected. But if we shoot a <strong><em>cloud</em></strong> of the viruses at you, you're gonna get pretty sick.</p></div>		</li>
