			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a YouTube video documentary of some CSI guy reviving dead tissues. He started work on rewinding the dehydration of dead fingers so he can finger print them. He should sell his formula to lotion
Companies. Dead people literally refill from their shriveled looking corpse to full blown human complexion</p>

<p>thinking that sticking your skin in water will help water retention is logical but it actually speeds up water loss because as the water evaporates, it pulls water out of your skin even faster.</p>

<p>Thank you I was curious about this too. I just took a shower and my skin is so dry now. I hate using lotion though because it's so hard to find one that's not greasy while still being quality and effective.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I usually use a mixture of moisturizers by layering them.  Something like Aveeno, Vanicream, Roche Posay with Aquaphor Petroluam jelly on top depending on the circumstances.</p></div>		</li>
