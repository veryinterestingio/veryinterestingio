			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on this, this is why you need to learn about the type of battery in your device and look for advice on maintaining battery life specific to that type of battery. I still see a lot of advice floating around about periodically completely discharging your battery. This advice came when nickel-cadmium batteries were the standard for rechargeable batteries and those batteries suffered from the memory effect - the battery degrades if you go through a lot of partial discharge/charge cycles. Modern lithium-ion or lithium-polymer batteries do not suffer from this and actually degrade faster if you fully discharge them. They can also brick if they ever really get fully depleted because they can turn into a fire hazard.</p></div>		</li>
