			<div class="markdown"><p>Terminal velocity is the speed at which a falling object is slowed down by friction due to air resistance as much as it is accelerated due to gravity. Since the moon does not have an atmosphere, there is no air resistance, thus there is no terminal velocity for objects falling on the moon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically you could say that &quot;Terminal velocity&quot; on the moon is \~2.38Km/s because that's how fast you'd be going when you hit the surface if you fell only under the moons gravity from &quot;infinity&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the only way to slow down upon falling toward the moon, give parachutes would do nothing, would be reverse thrust - release energy in the form of matter shooting downwards towards the surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A more interesting way to put it is that your speed is limited by relativity rather than friction! (Disregarding the height you'd have to fall from to achieve relativistic speeds)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Terminal velocity would be the limit of speed between crossing moon's SOI (we assume complete standstill at begining, well relative to earth-moon system) and crashing into its surface :)</p>
<p>So 66k km of free fall without air resistance. Still pretty fast.
Would take 2hrs 30min and end up at whopping 14.5 km/s. Nice crater.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: haven't done physics in 20 years. Most likely shouldn't have assumed 1.63 m/s² on whole 66k km SOI obviously. Probably should do it from GM/r² and do... integral I guess?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Terminal velocity&quot; is infinite. Falling from rest the most speed you could gather would be escape velocity (if you fell from infinity) which is √(2GM/R) = 2.38 km/s. That's pretty fast.</p></div>		</li>
