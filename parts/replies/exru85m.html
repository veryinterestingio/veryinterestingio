<p>In the Amazon region, fires are rare for much of the year because wet weather prevents them from starting and spreading. However, in July and August, activity typically increases due to the arrival of the dry season. Many people use fire to maintain farmland and pastures or to clear land for other purposes. Typically, activity peaks in early September and mostly stops by November.</p>
<p>As of August 16, 2019, an analysis of NASA satellite data indicated that total fire activity across the Amazon basin this year has been close to the average in comparison to the past 15 years.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is not acceptable.  </p>
<p>*&quot;The Nazi's have been building these concentration camps for years... everybody is sensationalizing this.&quot;</p>
<p>Taking a stand on sensationalism is pretending that that's not how humans are always motivated.</p>
<p>Your minimalization of tragedy is morally sick.</p></div>		</li>
