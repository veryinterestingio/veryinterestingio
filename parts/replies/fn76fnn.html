			<div class="markdown"><p>If I change the results enough, I could give one state absolute control of the Presidency and the House. Given enough time, this filters out to the Supreme Court and warps the Senate beyond recognition. 50 years later that state directly controls 2 1/2 of the 3 branches and the other 1/2 is likely impotent at best.</p>
