			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if the fact that Florida tends to have shorter buildings/a big patch of wide highway helps with transport? I live in South Florida and one of our big roads is called “Military Trail” because it was build/used during WWII for transport (so it was pre-designed for “wife loads”)? I have no idea if this is true (if it’s a reason), I’m just guessing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's important to note that NASA's mandatory large exclusion zones in case of a crash are largely because of that little bit of toxic fuel up in the payload, more so than the much more massive amount of less toxic fuel in the rocket itself.  After an explosion, there's a long time where only people in full chemical suits are allowed near the crash site, until readings prove the toxic fuels have dissipated from the area.</p>
<p>I shudder to think how the Chinese use those toxic fuels in the big lower stages.  So so so very risky.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Long March 5 rockets are not unique in that respect. The most popular heavy launch vehicles (Delta IV Heavy, Proton-M, Ariane 5) all use hypergolic propellants and/or oxidisers at some point in their propulsion system. Cleaner alternatives are being researched but are at too low a TRL to be used in a design; the risk appetite for rockets is, understandably, very very low.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any idea why they did not choose Hawaii, since it’s closest to the equator? I could think of a variety of reasons, the first of which being that it’s too far away from most of the US to capitalize on all its resources economically, but that’s really just conjecture on my pet</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The economics of shipping over to Hawaii are probably the largest reason if I had to guess. That said, there are some island launch pads in existence. For example, ArianeSpace has a pad in French Guiana.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Cape was the site of an Air Force rocket development/test facility as early as 1949, it was expanded. It was also much easier to ship materials as it was close to major cities and highways, and near sea ports where large assembled rockets could be shipped by barge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All but the beginning of the Space Race was post Hawaii becoming a state. This definitely isn't part of the reason. </p>
<p>The real reason is shipping costs/risks/time. The EU launches from French Guyana because they have no other option due to their location and geography. For the US, the marginal benefits from launching from Hawaii over Florida/Cali are no where near the added risk and cost it would require.</p></div>		</li>
