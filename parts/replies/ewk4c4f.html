			<div class="markdown"><p>If it’s coming near earth, and it’s big enough, it’s probably going to be pulled our gravity. I imagine that if the moon is involved, it’ll only help run inference, except maybe adding to the overall gravity of our planet system. This is based on nothing really</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not sure where this myth started, but it's definitely a myth.</p>
<p>In terms of preventing impacts due to direct collision with the Moon: the entire area of the sky contains 41,253 square degrees. The Moon itself covers just 0.21 square degrees, or about 1/200,000^th of the sky. That's not really helping much.</p>
<p>Now the Moon's gravitational effects extend farther out than its surface...but it's just as likely to fling passing asteroids into our path as it is out of our path.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had to look this up because it sounds awesome.</p>
<p>Found an article that says Jupiter would stabilize Earth's axis to a 10-20 degree wobble. That would suck very badly for us right now, but not preclude life. It also says a retrograde precession should help stabilize a planet's tilt, which happens in 50% of cases. Depends on how it was hit by debris as it was forming. (Ours is prograde.)</p>
