			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Being touched (in a desirable way) by others causes our brain to release chemicals that make us feel good in order to make us want to bond with our family, loved ones, etc. (I think the main agent in this is oxytocin, but dopamine and seratonin may also be involved? Iâ€™m definitely not an expert enough at that level.) If our brains produced that same response when we touched ourselves, that would overwhelm the bonding function. </p>
<p>In fact, that is part of the reason why pornography and masturbation can be problematic for some people. That does recreate largely the same brain response as sexual interaction with another person (dopamine there, I think), and some people build up a tolerance that makes it harder or less desirable to interact sexually with others.</p></div>		</li>
