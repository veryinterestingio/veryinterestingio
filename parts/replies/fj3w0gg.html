			<div class="markdown"><p>Its not exactly microvibrations. At certain points of the vehicle, when we test different components, things are just plain shaken apart. 2000 revolutions per minute at whatever horsepower your vehicle has is mostly directed into the transmission, but no system is 100% effecient and dampening that effect is a big deal.</p></div>		</li>
