			<div class="markdown"><p>Many, in fact. Although many viral genes are present in the human genome, they aren’t usually expressed. They do, however, have promoter regions (Long-terminal repeats, polyadenylated tails, etc.) that promote nearby human genes. It’s believed this is part of the reason why we can share so much of our genome with chimps and bonobos, but are not like them as much as our genome would suggest. Our proteins are expressed to different degrees. They also have their own unique endogenous viral elements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does that gene exist in all mammals? And if not, how do other mammals support a placental pregnancy without it?</p>
<p>Perhaps this is part of why human pregnancy is particularly rough on the mother and why we menstruate. </p></div>		</li>
