<p>I don't believe that qualifies as 'learning' in this sense. Ants are not teaching other ants new behaviors or transmitting novel information. Rather, it is a preprogrammed stimulus which transfers information that is already expected. No more than putting down pheromone trails qualifies as 'teaching'. That is, this isn't learned behavior. </p>
<p>Ants are very determistic and 'fixed' automata. They are <em>not</em> particularly adaptive, though their programming allows them to handle a large number of circumstances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/439153a" target="_blank">Temnothorax albipennis</a> ants were actually the first non-human animal with documented teaching behavior, it's a pretty big deal in the animal cognition world.  Despite seeming simple, ants are incredible socially complex (called a &quot;eusocial&quot; species).  Teaching has a fairly specific definition within animal cognition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The definition of what constitutes teaching in animals has also evolved. Back in 1992, Caro and Marc Hauser, then a colleague at UC–Davis, proposed a new definition of teaching that avoided the problem of trying to determine an animal’s intention. Instead, they said wildlife scientists could identify teaching through careful observation of <strong>three key elements: a change in the teacher’s behavior in the presence of an inexperienced student, a cost to the teacher and evidence that the formerly naive pupil gains knowledge or skills</strong>—through encouragement, punishment or by example—more rapidly or earlier in life than if the student were on his or her own.   </p>
<p>...  </p>
<p>Though most scientists embraced Caro and Hauser’s three-part definition of teaching, more than 20 years passed before anyone was able to show that an animal qualified as a tutor. <strong>The first that measured up was a controversial surprise: a rock ant.</strong><br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, quoting the link that you posted is truly fascinating, and I still argue that that doesn't qualify as teaching behavior, as there is no learned behavior here. It is merely a stimulus that acts upon an already-preprogrammed behavior, which is how ants always work.</p>
<p><em>Temnothorax</em> species themselves are pretty small colonies, and aren't particularly predatorial. I don't keep them (I have yet to successfully rear their queens, as they are generally semi-claustral which is a PITA). I've found colonies in acorns before, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One paper using questionable definitions of 'learning', with the mechanisms not differing substantially from the feedback mechanisms present already in <em>all</em> ants? I see no difference between this and the feedback mechanisms involved in pheromone trails or messaging via antennae. In all cases they are just providing information that inform preprogrammed behaviors - no new behaviors are learned. There is nothing <em>novel</em>.</p>
<p>Before you start using the undermining defense, start by explaining the exact hypothesis of the paper, and how exactly they define 'learning'. Information acquisition is not learning if it cannot result in novel responses. It is just observation, then. Whether or not there is bidirectional communication is irrelevant. If that was all that was required, then every single social hymenopteran <em>learns</em> via pheromones.</p>
<p>Ants are incredibly complex and their behaviors can accommodate a huge number of situations, but their behaviors are also <em>fixed</em> and they are incapable of novel adaptation.</p></div>		</li>
