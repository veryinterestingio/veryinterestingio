			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't diffusion only happen if there is something that the light passes through?  I wouldn't think that would happen much at all in space.  We can see planets in other solar systems, not that well, but with big enough optics we would be able to resolve them, right?  So that light isn't diffused a significant amount.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the diffusion does not require a medium. The intensity of light as you get farther away follows the inverse square law. This is (at least under the standard model) because you have the same number of photons but they have to cover the area of the a spherical shell moving outward from the source. Since the area is proportional to the square of the radius, you get the inverse square relation (photons/area)</p></div>		</li>
