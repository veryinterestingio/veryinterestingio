			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember my old card was tiny but had a massive metal coil.  My new card is in a laptop so I haven't seen it but modern GPU's are huge!  Granted they are way better in terms of space management and form factor as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cost is by far the biggest reason. It costs about the same to make a 12 inch wafer regardless of what you put on it. It cuts the cost in half to get 100 good CPUs off a wafer than if you get 50.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other main point to be made is profit. Chip manufacturers process 300mm wafers with as many finished products within that sized wafer as possible and in the final processing of the wafer they cut it into the final chips. The wafer size is a set variable, but the smaller the chip the more profit per processed wafer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You see changes in the material way before melting. There's a zone called hysteresis where the changes are reversible, but what's happening is the bits aren't responding to voltage differences smoothly and the probability of a bit fllipping randomly increases. So you get errors. </p>
<p>If you heat past hysteresis, you can permanently change the material so it won't respond the same way even after it cools down. At the same time, the different materials expand at different rates and you can have internal warping that messes up the contacts. At this point your chip is cooked and not useful for anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the most accurate answer here. The defect rate is a huge problem.</p>
<p>Another factor to add is that the silicon wafers that CPUs are made from is grown as a single crystal and then carefully sliced. You need to fit as many dies as possible per wafer, so you need the smallest transistors possible. It's more profitable to sell a large number of cheaper smaller chips than fewer expensive bigger chips.</p>
<p>The heat problem, in my limited understanding, is the limiting factor for how small any chip can get.
Nowadays cpu logic voltages are very low (1.35V ish), but, idling, an i7 might pull a casual 100A! </p>
<p>When you make a transistor smaller, it reduces the heat output of any one transistor but they're switching faster and they're packed tighter so the thermal energy is concentrated on a smaller area. This results in higher temperatures, and because they're smaller it's harder to remove the heat fast enough to keep temps down. We're waiting on new semiconductor materials that can operate at higher temperatures before we can switch faster or pack them tighter</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fair, I've gone back and reread the site I read it from, the number I've seen is 144W idle up to 200ish fully loaded. but that's actually the whole system, although it doesn't many specify details.
