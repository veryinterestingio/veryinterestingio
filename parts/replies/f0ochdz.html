			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's converted into light and there is not anything anymore to absorb said light, what happens when the light reaches the boundary of the universe ?</p>
<p>This might sound silly as a question but I'm being serious here. I don't think the universe can continue expanding if there is no matter for it to push that expansion. So it means at one moment (unless the universe is infinite in which case nothing in here needs to be adressed) or another, those photons must attain the ''end of the line''. But what will scatter them if there is nothing to do it? If they are re-emited in another direction, there needs to be matter to make  that interaction.</p>
<p>So all in all, it boils down to: Is the edge of the universe real and can it intereact with stuff or what else?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think one idea is analogous to our universe existing in a black hole. so at the edge of the universe = the edge of this cosmic black hole, the cosmic level fabric of space time is stretched so fast that nothing can escape. in others the edge of the universe isn't so much a wall as it is a treadmill that cant be overcome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, where a black hole is a “sphere” (as far as the event horizon and photon sphere orbit whatever tts called), the edge of the universe is the <em>inverse</em> of that, a black hole pulling at the universe in all directions, and instead of a singularity, it’s an “infinitularity” into which the universe is being pulled outward in all directions?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of our entire universe as being contained within the ultimate black hole where the boundaries from the expanding side are infinite or close to it and on the other side, the black hole, the surface is infinitesimal. Now consider that infinitesimal black hole. Wouldn’t you consider it a singularity? And isn’t it in the exact state the universe was in immediately prior to the Big Bang? Furthermore if you consider the entire universe - not just matter and energy, but time as well - to be contained within this singularity with the beginning and end of time “touching” doesn’t that describe a complete picture? The Big Bang which is imminent on “the other side” is not another universe forming, but our own. Time, like space, is curved. Like a torus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not matter causing the expansion, it's dark energy - an entity that is present in (theoretically) every plank length of empty space.</p>
<p>Assuming the hyperinflation theory is true, then the universe will be expanding at the speed of light by the time proton decay would theoretically be happening. This means that protons would never even be able to reach a &quot;boundary&quot; of the universe.</p>
<p>That all being said, the idea of a &quot;boundary&quot; of the universe is incredibly hazy in itself. My opinion leans towards the &quot;torus&quot; theory where there is no boundary, but travelling in any direction in the universe would ultimately lead you back to where you started.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dark energy isn't causing the expansion of the universe, merely accelerating it. Doesn't invalidate your excellent point but I think the distinction is important</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's no evidence of that yet. Spacetime appears to be flat and the universe's structure doesn't appear to repeat. So if it wraps around, it is on an incomprehensible scale compared to the known universe's nearly incomprehensible scale.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you could travel faster than light, which you can’t.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read a theory, and I know it's controversial, and I'm not a physicist, so don't quote me, but it goes like this:</p>
<p>When the universe decays into nothing, everything will have no mass.</p>
<p>Massless particles always travel at the speed of light, and do not experience time.</p>
<p>Massless particles interact with each other.</p>
<p>The universe might have a curve to it, wherein if you get to the edge, you loop back to the beginning.</p>
<p>If all of this is true, then the universe will decay into a vast sea of particles in whose frame of reference there is no time, and therefore there is no distance, in other words, to whom the vast universe is nothing but a singularity.  An almost &quot;virtual&quot; universe and a new big bang would arise, and the cycle would begin again.</p>
<p>As much comfort I find in this interpretation of cosmology, I really doubt it'll end up being the explanation for everything, but it really is super cool.</p></div>		</li>
