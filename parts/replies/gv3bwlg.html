			<div class="markdown"><p>Rats are one of my favorites! They get such a bad wrap and are actually really intelligent...stay tuned to Animal IQ and they might make an appearance ;) I'm really excited to learn and share more about other animals that are typically over looked. For example, pigs are SUPER smart, as are many species of bird. Goldfish even have surpassingly good memories, despite their reputation!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was also so excited to learn about rats! We have an episode on them that I'm working on now. The cool thing is we we know a lot about laboratory rats, but wild rats are still a bit of a mystery to science. What does a rat do when it's alone?! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ </p>
<p>The episode will be out in a couple of weeks!</p></div>		</li>
