<p>The shuttle didn’t necessarily need to accelerate quickly, it just had to sustain acceleration for a long time and break escape velocity on a very very heavy object. Hell, the catapult on an aircraft carrier only hits about 4G.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Small nitpick but the shuttle wasnt aiming to break escape velocity.  The space shuttle only ever achieved LEO, which means it got up to a max speed of around 7.8 km/s.   Escape velocity on the other hand is roughly 11.2 km/s.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You are driving the average $140,000 Lingenfelter twin-turbo powered<br />
Corvette Z06. Over a mile up the road, a Top Fuel dragster is staged &amp;<br />
ready to launch down a quarter-mile strip as you pass. You have the<br />
advantage of a flying start. You run the 'Vette hard up through the gears<br />
and blast across the starting line &amp; pass the dragster at an honest 200 MPH.<br />
The 'tree' goes green for both of you at that moment.   </p>
<p>The dragster launches &amp; starts after you. You keep your foot down hard, but<br />
you hear an incredibly brutal whine that sears your eardrums &amp; within 3<br />
seconds the dragster catches &amp; passes you. He beats you to the finish line,<br />
a quarter-mile away from where you just passed him. Think about it - from a<br />
standing start, the dragster had spotted you 200 MPH &amp; not only caught, but<br />
nearly blasted you off the road when he passed you within a mere 1320 foot<br />
long race!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've read this before but I never checked to see if the math legitimately checks out.</p>
<p>Turns out it does.</p>
<p>200 miles/hour is 293.33 ft/sec. (1320 ft / (293.33 ft/sec)) is 4.5 seconds. The 1/4 E.T. record seems to be in the 4.4x range, although for safety reasons Top Fuel cars now only run 1000' drags. They would be probably dipping in to the mid 4.3x second range in the 1/4. That dragster would pass you like you were standing still and he was going 140 mph.</p>
<p>They're such impressive feats of engineering.</p></div>		</li>
