			<div class="markdown"><p>Some more background on counting if anyone is interested:</p>
<p>The earliest civilizations only knew three numbers: one, two, and 'more than two'. One is conceptually easy, you can understand it by thinking about things like yourself (ego), the sun and god. Two is easy as well, it is found in concepts like good vs evil, light vs dark, man vs woman, alive vs dead.</p>
<p>For ages, these were the only numbers that were used. Three existed as well, but only to signify 'more than two'. You can see this in things like hieroglyphs, where drawing one tree signified a tree, and drawing three trees signified a forest.</p>
<p>Zero as a concept was also known, because it signified 'nothing' or 'empty'. But the link between zero and one, two, three was not understood.</p>
<p>A lot of civilizations did count things, but without knowing how it worked. Sheep herders for example would put a stone in a basket for every sheep that left their pen in the morning, and remove a stone for every sheep that went back in at night. If there were any stones left after the sheep were all back in, they knew they were missing sheep. But they wouldn't be able to tell you how many sheep they had.</p>
<p>Eventually the number three was understood, and after that the concept of counting spread fast. After all, if you can grasp the idea of three, it's easy to expand it to four, five etc. There was no specific point in time or specific civilization associated with counting, it is assumed that a lot of civilizations all over the world figured this out individually.</p>
<p>After this it still took thousands of years before we started to understand zero as a number. Even with the 'place-implies-value' number system that we still use today, zero was more seen as a placeholder than an actual number. Only when mathematicians started to think about stuff like negative numbers, it became evident that zero as a number was needed. From that point on, a lot of new math was discovered.</p>

<p>Edit: To clarify, in the first part I was talking about the abstract idea of counting, as in assigning names to quantities and to do basic math with them. As with the sheep herder example, early humans found many ways to keep track of numbers, like using your fingers or carving lines on rocks. But they did not know what the concept behind those methods were, just that it worked.</p>
<p>Also, when we say 'the Babylonians knew trigonometry', it's easy to forget that the people who had that knowledge was a very small group of religious scholars. Your average Babylonian or Egyptian did not go to school. But yes, by the time the first real civilizations that we know of rose we already knew much more about numbers that the earliest humans did.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the earliest civilisations apparently counted in a way like trolls in Terry Pratchett novels?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One, Two, Three, Many, Lots.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then the clever trolls combine these into numbers. Like &quot;lots many&quot; for 20.</p></div>		</li>

It's been over a decade since I read Soul Music, but I distinctly remember Buddy of the Holly's troll drummer counting the beat that way.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The whole concept of &quot;one, two, and more than two&quot; is fascinating to me and I learned something similar in a religious studies class years ago.  Numbers in the Bible are symbolic in just that way.</p>
<p>Certain numbers are repeated a lot in the Bible: 3, 6, 7, 40, and 1000.  3 is symbolic of &quot;the best&quot; because in <del>Latin</del> (and possibly other old languages, <em>EDIT: probably another ancient language I got it confused with</em>) you didn't say good, better, and best.  To signify better you said &quot;good good.&quot;  To signify best you said &quot;good good good.&quot;  Bigger was &quot;big big,&quot; etc.  One of these instances survives in a modern translation.  &quot;Holy holy holy Lord, God of power and might,...&quot; etc.  What that means is &quot;the holiest Lord.&quot;</p>
<p>7 is considered perfection, and 6 is considered imperfection, although I don't remember the origins.  But expanding on the 3s, 777 became a symbol of God because it means &quot;the ultimate perfection&quot; and 666 became the symbol of the antichrist because it means &quot;the ultimate imperfection.&quot;</p>
<p>40 is symbolic of &quot;a lot.&quot;  People at the time had a rough idea of what 40 meant even if they couldn't count that high, but they knew it was a lot.  So when it rained for 40 days and 40 nights that doesn't mean it literally rained for 40 days.  It just rained for a long time.  Same with wandering the desert for 40 years.</p>
<p>1000 is symbolic of &quot;more than you can count.&quot;  Today we say millions when we want to convey that there were more of a thing than could be counted.  Sometimes &quot;zillions&quot; to drive the point home.  So when a crowd of 1000 people came to watch Jesus speak it was just a whole bunch of people and more than about 40.</p>
<p>I'm working off memory here so someone feel free to correct me if I'm wrong but that's the general idea.</p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks for all the replies!  I completely forgot Latin does have a good/better/best format in its language.  It was in my Latin class that we learned about the &quot;Holy holy holy&quot; thing, so I may be conflating it with another ancient language that we were discussing in the lesson.  It's been a while.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is so, so, so much saner than literal interpretation of those things.</p>
<p>If what you say is true, it blows my mind that this isn't taught to most Christians. Not only does it make really good damn sense, but it brings a level of believability to those stories.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's not true of Latin, at least Classical Latin. &quot;Good&quot; was &quot;bonus&quot;, &quot;better&quot; was &quot;melior&quot;, and &quot;best&quot; was &quot;optimus&quot;. But the &quot;one, two, many&quot; stage of development among the early Italians would have been long before any language we would recognize as Latin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So is there anything more recent that's comparableâ€”in terms of being something average people learned and found useful, then forgot what it was like without? I imagine &quot;<em>i</em>&quot; (sqrt(-1)) is like that, but it doesn't affect average people. Fractions is probably a big thing, as is digits to the right of the decimal point (e.g. 0.5).</p></div>		</li>
