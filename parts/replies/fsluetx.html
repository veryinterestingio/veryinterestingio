			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea they stick a breathing tube in right after you go under and a machine breathes for you. Which is why you likely had a sorr throat after surgery.</p></div>		</li>

<li>It doesn’t because we’ve used paralysis, and we push air in with a ventilator (essentially an air pump via a tube to the lungs)</li>
</ol>
<p>OR</p>
<ol>
<li>You do breathe, just at a lower depth and rate. General anaesthesia doesn’t obliterate brain stem functions like breathing and cardiovascular control, it just suppresses them to a degree. The deeper the anaesthesia, the greater the suppression, but on average most people will breathe under surgical level anaesthesia. They might need assistance from a ventilator to breathe adequately.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the kind of anaesthetic and what the procedure is.</p>
<p>If you're having gas for a tooth extraction (which admittedly is much rarer these days) you're still breathing for yourself.</p>
<p>Whereas if you're having surgery, you'll likely be put under using an IV-based anaesthetic and on a ventilator.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not always. The main drugs we use in anaesthesia are the anaesthetic agent itself, pain relief and a muscle relaxant (paralytic). If we don’t administer a paralytic agent (because the surgery doesn’t require it, or we are placing a less invasive tube such as a laryngeal mask), the patient actually does breathe, albeit at a slower rate and depth. </p>
<p>Sometimes we can just have them breathing fully by themselves, or in other situations we support the breathing with a bit of extra pressure from the ventilator (assist ventilation). When a paralytic is used we have to take over full breathing control (mandatory ventilation).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m an ICU NP and I deal with this constantly.
Depends what drugs you’re using to get them there. </p>
<p>If you’re using fentanyl alone or with dexmetomidine, probably they are some sort of sleeping in between neuro checks. Not a great sleep, but some type of sleep. Opioids can make you sleep, but can give you wild dreams and hallucinations. </p>
<p>Propofol is definitely not sleep. It’s a whole different type of sedation. I believe propofol is not good for long term use. No REM stages, a lot of amnesia. I’ve seen patients on huge doses of propofol with a RASS +1 or more, they’re definitely not sedated and they still don’t remember. </p>
<p>Benzodiazepines don’t provide good sleep either. Again, basically no REM sleep at all and a lot of amnesia. </p>
<p>Ketamine is definitely not sleep. It’s probably the most bizarre choice out there. Lots of brain activity but lots of dissociation, it’s not a long term solution either. </p>
<p>The best thing is to use the lightest possible sedation, probably using analgesia plus either dexmetomidine or even small doses of neuroleptic like haldol or droperidol, maybe antipsychotic like quetiapine can help as well. Benzos have their place for alcoholics, perhaps. I think RASS -3 is too deep for most ICU patients and it delays extubation. Ideally they should be 0/-1 and able to decide when to sleep or not. We know lighter and shorter sedation improves outcomes and decreases vent days. Vent days are days of poor sleep. Poor sleep leads to delirium and more issues and more vent days and it’s a terrible cycle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great to know!  I know a lot of times we use fentanyl and propofol on our patients we always try to keep them at a rass of -1 to -2 when we first intubate them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also Depends on what your definition of “resting” or “not resting” is.  </p>
<p>A person laying on a bed with a vent is going to “be sedated”.  Their muscles are “resting”:  their internal systems are also “resting”.</p></div>		</li>
