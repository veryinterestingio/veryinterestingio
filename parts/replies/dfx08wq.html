			<div class="markdown"><p>That's fucking creepy. But yeah. That's the downside of compression. If you miss an essential frame, shit will look fucked up until it loads the next essential keyframe (usually on a scene change).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only thing I forgot to add which some others have pointed out is that gifs need to load completely before they run, and movies can usually start streaming almost right away.<br />
I don't understand why that happens, since you'd assume they can just start from the first picture, but that's apperantly not possible. Weird shit.</p></div>		</li>
