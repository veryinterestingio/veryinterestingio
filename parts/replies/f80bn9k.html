			<div class="markdown"><p>Tarmacadam was named after the earlier macadam paving (tar plus macadam), named after John Macadam who came up with the process. So, tarmac is in a way named after John Macadam. (edited to correct the guy's first name!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>fyi I just copied the first part of wikipedia for my Tarmacadam definition from:  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarmacadam" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarmacadam" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarmacadam</a></a> </p>
<p>Tarmacadam was indeed pioneered by John Loudon McAdam, but it was patented by Edgar Purnell Hooley. Had the question been what is Tarmacadam, I would have of course put more in the answer to this vein, but that wasn't the question. </p>
<p>Just letting you know it wasn't out of racism or prejudice. And also if this source material is incorrect - then edit the wiki to set the record straight.</p></div>		</li>
