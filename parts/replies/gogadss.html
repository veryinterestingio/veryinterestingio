<p>CRISPR gene editing is one of the most exciting developments in biomedical research in the last 10 years. It provides an opportunity to correct DNA misspellings that contribute to disease, including rare diseases. Applying this to somatic cells for conditions like Sickle Cell Disease may make it possible to provide a cure. In fact, such trials are already underway for a few diseases. The ethical dilemma relates to the possible use of CRISPR editing of human embryos. The strong consensus of the ethical community, with which I agree, is that heritable changes in the human genome ought not to be undertaken since that would open the door to reengineering ourselves in a circumstance where actual medical need is hard to identify.   </p>
