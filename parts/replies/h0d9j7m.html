			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, so the old ones are cosmic horror creatures that have observed us since ever, and are the closest thing to god that really might exist.
However observing an old one is too much for human brains, and so we just don't &quot;see them&quot; or we pretend we don't to ourselves.
Some people can see them temporarily, but forget as soon as they stop seeing them as the human brain just refuses to acknowledge the horror.</p>
<p>At some point in the last 20-25 years we started finding evidence of dead old ones, it would seem that some type of subliminal message therapy has been deployed by agencies linked to one or more major world governments, and some the few people that can see them have begun to &quot;purge&quot; the old ones when encountering them (subliminally implanted &quot;instructions&quot; for killing them on sight are our best hypothesis so far). If you can read this at all you are probably one of those people, but don't worry you wont remember anything that happens after you have purged, so no side effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Supplementing testosterone (unsure of the levels, the clinical trial I was involved in was a few decades ago and I don't remember the patch dose) causes the testes to stop producing testosterone and sperm.  It happened within weeks and reversed itself just as quickly when the trial was over.</p>
<p>It was very effective for all participants in the study, but supplementing testosterone has its own risks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just want to add, as a woman who cannot take hormonal birth control because the side effects make me incredibly unwell, that although I am aware women like me are in the minority, we do exist in some numbers and the globe.  What you've written is not untrue. For many women, hormonal birth control is a godsend. But for a significant minority, it's absolute hell. And it does raise the risk of specific cancers, of blood clotting... It is categorically not a panacea.</p>
<p>By minimising the potential risks and side effects of female birth control, it reduces the incentive to find appropriate male birth control. Let's not do that. I'm fortunate that I can use the copper coil. But for women who do not have access to that, their options are incredibly limited. Male BC would give these women another viable option.</p>
<p>And I can understand that the balance of risk is seen as pill Vs pregnancy, against male pill Vs nothing. But it does seem a little unfair that simply because men are not the ones burdened with pregnancy, they should not need to be part of the solution to prevent it, if there are side effects involved. Because pregnancy is currently not possibly without both male and female participation, men are similarly culpable for the risk women undertake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. The side effects of hormonal BC are very real and so rarely acknowledged in the conversations on this topic. Turns out my partner has bad swimmers, which means I was finally released from from the grips of BC. I know most are not as fortunate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately the universe is ultimately not fair. it factually does take two to make a baby and men should be part of the solution if they are part of the problem, morally speaking, practically though it is women who ultimately suffer the consequences of unwanted pregnancy. </p>
<p>Personally nothing I have seen from hormonal birth control for men has made in inclined to even give it thought, every study sho far has been happy with just a severely reduced sperm count as opposed to a 0 sperm count. As we learned in health class, it really only takes 1.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Remind me of a TIFU post by a guy  diagnosed with a severely reduced sperm count, he was told he had only a 1:100 chance of making a partner pregnant (compared to an average male). He and his partner thought they had a free pass to unprotected sex so went at it multiple times a day - until she got pregnant.</p>
<p>A 1:100 chance is pretty likely if you try 100x more often than average.</p></div>		</li>
