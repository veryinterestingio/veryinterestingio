			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. Is it okay if I reword that as &quot;evolution is a fact&quot; if I make it clear that I am talking about this underlying phenomenon and not the Theory of Evolution? I believe the theory is not yet complete and still being developed. I wouldn't call that fact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Scientists don't like to talk about &quot;facts&quot; because we are always refining our understanding. That being said, evolution is about as close to a fact as you can get, both as an underlying phenomenon and as the driver of the diversity of life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Evolution  is an observable fact. Our theoretical understanding of it is necessarily incomplete and partially simplified, like everything that deals with complex systems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ernst Mayr, an important evolutionary biologist, broke down &quot;evolution&quot; as described by Darwin into four components: that life has changed over time, that species arise through lineage splitting, that life has single origin, and that natural selection is the main mechanism of change. All these ideas fall under &quot;Evolutionary Theory&quot; or &quot;Evolutionary Biology.&quot; If you want to use the phrase &quot;evolution is a fact&quot;, to me that references the specific fact that life has changed over time, or &quot;evolved.&quot; Secondarily to me that also references that life can and continues to evolve.</p></div>		</li>
