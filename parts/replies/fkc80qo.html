			<div class="markdown"><p>The Fed issues/sells Bonds to banks. Say a ten year bond. Typically the Fed would take the full ten years to pay you back. In this case, the Fed is paying you/banks back early. Now the bank has more money to lend out. </p>
<p>As for what banks. Typically the big banks like BoA. Not your local credit union. Banks are buying from the Treasury then selling them to you for a higher interest rate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Large banks have a wide array of securities that they invest in to make money on the money customers deposit in their bank. This includes government bonds which are bought and sold in secondary markets (nyse is an example of a secondary market). The fed buys a large amount of bonds from these large banks which puts more cash in the banks who then can loan that money out to businesses and consumers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Fed can't compel a bank to sell its bonds to the Fed.  If the bank wanted to raise cash, it could have sold its bonds on the open market prior to the Fed's intervention.  Why do banks sell their bonds to the Fed?  Does the Fed offer a higher price than the open market?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Fed announces a schedule of bonds they are going to buy, including the maximum total purchases they will make for each maturity and the actual price is determined via an auction. Essentially institutions that want to participate submit &quot;bids&quot; of how much they want to sell and at what price. The auction mechanism is a bit complicated and allows for discriminatory pricing (i.e. not every participant ultimately sells their bonds at the same price to the Fed), but I recall that empirically the result tends to be a slight premium.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In times of crisis, the overnight markets these banks use can dry up. If the banks stop trusting each other, they don’t lend to each other. This is why the system almost collapsed in 2008. The fed today is getting way ahead of that potential impact by saying “we will buy your bonds even if other banks won’t.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the banks are compelled to act in accordance with what the Fed wants.</p>
<p>Banks that want access to the &quot;lender of last resort&quot; (the Fed) agree to take on the other side of any open market operations that the Fed wants to do to achieve the Fed's goals</p></div>		</li>
