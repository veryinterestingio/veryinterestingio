			<div class="markdown"><p>Fermentation gradually lowers the acidity of the environment and raises its alcohol content. Yeast strains are responsible for the fermentation to occur. They start to die off when the pH drops below around 2-3, alcohol content raises above around 12%, or if the initial sugar content is too high, equivalent to about 1.100SG in water. Active fermentation requires temperatures around 15-35°C, preferably around 25°C. Some strains can achieve higher alcohol contents of 14-16%. It is possible to achieve higher alcohol percentages of up to around 20% as long as you control the pH, batch feed the sugar to keep the specific gravity in a reasonable range, and use a very large yeast culture so that fermentation is performed FAST and before all the alcohol can kill off the cells.  </p>
<p>This is all under ideal conditions. In fallen fruit, you'll probably get around 10% ABV tops.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's exactly right. Anything above 'wine range' goes through either classic distillation, or -for instance in the case of apple cider- freeze distillation. What's interesting here is that while proper distillation will remove a good part of the fusel oils, acetone, isopropyl alcohol and ethylacetate that is created as byproduct of fermentation, freeze distillation DOES NOT. Which is why apple cider can give you a hell of a hangover.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Certain yeasts convert sugars to alcohol but even the most tolerant yeasts (e.g. <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em>) can only withstand up to around 18% alcohol before dying. Anything higher than that requires distillation - either through heating in the case of spirits or freezing in the case of ice wine or very high strength beer.</p>
<p>Fallen fruit can spontaneously ferment thanks to wild yeasts in the air, but even the best of them is unlikely to ferment past 6% in ideal conditions, which would assume all the sugar in the fruit is available to it (e.g. apples need to be pulped in cider production for the yeast to be able to access the sugars inside the skins), the yeast doesn't get out-competed by other microorganisms, and that the ethanol produced by the yeast isn't fermented in turn into vinegar by acetic acid bacteria.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose fruit could technically get higher than 10% if it dropped, rotted/fermented for a while, then froze. Much of the water content of the juice would freeze into ice (with a little bit of ethanol and other solutes trapped in the ice) , but most of the ethanol would stay liquid, and at a higher concentration, since some of the liquid water was removed via freezing. This is called freeze distillation. Anything at or above 70% would certainly need to be vapor distilled though.</p></div>		</li>
