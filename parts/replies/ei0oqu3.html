Also the FOV. <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/ayfvv6/eli5_why_do_soap_operas_look_different_on_tv/ei1atb2/" target="_blank">There's lots of factors,</a> and Frizbplaya's comment just barely scratches the surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your brain won’t notice the difference between 24 frames and 30 frames. </p>
<p>They’re shot at 60fps or 30 interlaced FPS which is basically 60 “half resolution” frames per second which gives it that ultra smooth look. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the answer. I'm guessing everyone mentioning FSP didn't know/remember that soaps looked different before digital too. Everything about the production has to be <em>fast</em> because they put out five episodes a week.</p></div>		</li>
