			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm working on one of these, hit me with all your questions! It's a really promising technology for many reasons. For one, muscle tissue doesn't actually have a lot of immune cells, and we've been able to show that delivering drug to the epidermis gives a stronger immune response because all the immune cells are already localized in the skin. We're working to develop a covid vaccine that only requires one dose rather than two doses like Pfizer and Moderna's.</p>
<p>Challenges: microneedles are popular as cosmetics but there aren't any fda approved medical devices yet, so we have a somewhat novel regulatory path ahead of us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Self administration is the ultimate goal, though it's probably at least 5-10 years away. It's best to prove the technology when applied by a trained hcp, where there's less chance for user error. A self applied patch should come with an incredibly easy to use and reliable application system, and you want a ton of human factors studies to make sure you've captured every unintended use failure mode. You'd be shocked at the creative ways a user can mess up &quot;put this on your arm and press this button&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh absolutely, we see this as a platform technology that could completely change drug delivery in many ways.</p>
<p>Most people aren't trained to use a needle and syringe, so you go to a doctor or pharmacist for your vaccine. What if you had a patch with an easy to use applicator and could vaccinate yourself? What if we mailed that patch to your home or office so you can get vaccinated without going to a crowded hospital during a pandemic?</p>
<p>We can also change the drug release profile. Many drugs today use an IM bolus injection, which clears from the body relatively quickly. A slow dissolving microneedle can release a drug slowly over days or weeks. For our vaccine platforms, we've shown this better mimics the kinetics of an infection and your body generates a stronger immune response. I know of several University labs trying similar things with birth control or HIV patches for extended release as well</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is SUPER cool. A barbed biodegradable  version would be awesome for long term vaccines.  And polymers vs metal needles means we're one step closer to being able to 3D print vaccines (long term, could have important ramifications for spacetravel)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What does dissolvability look like in a polymer needle and how would this affect bioaccumulation of polymer particles overntime say in a type 1 diabetic over time?  Or would this be only for vaccine use with far less usage over time?  Interesting stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's far harder to deliver the correct dosage reliably. Instead of one needle and a plunger to control, you have hundreds. </p>
<p>Plus, a lot of stuff needs to get into veins or into the muscle, in which case tons of small needles just aren't long enough. </p>
<p>Finally, it's expensive to develop and produce. A needle is cheap, easy, and proven, so people trying to develop patches have trouble making one that is both effective and cost effective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add onto what some people said there’s also this phenomenon called the Research Practice Gap. It’s basically an amount of years (iirc 20-30) before research actually becomes protocol.</p>
<p>Edit: for example, when i was in nursing school our professor told us about how giving beta blockers to patients post MI wasn’t really the norm. Doctors knew it had some benefit but it wasn’t required. Now it’s standard practice but it took nearly 40 years (from my profs reckoning)</p></div>		</li>
