			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok I think the exact same situation happens to me.  I start falling asleep and it almost feels like my body just decides to stop breathing and I have to constantly think about it.  It doesn’t happen often but when it does it REALLY triggers the anxiety.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah this is actually what happened to me when I had covid. Every single night. It’s much better now, but damn if it didn’t leave me traumatized of sleeping... I would try and fall asleep for literally hours and keep waking up, gasping for air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got the same thing recently and went to the doctor for it. He said that it's very likely stress/anxiety that causes it and not sleep apnea (although he said it could still be a possibility). It did happen during periods in which I was really stressed out, so it's definitely plausible that it's just anxiety. It also created a vicious circle because my anxiety got worse before going to sleep and that caused these gasp reflexes and raising heart rate. It got way more manageable for me when I wasn't as stressed anymore and started supplementing melatonin and CBD. It still plays up every now and then when I'm stressed though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, mine was definitely a stress thing too, and I suffer from pretty bad anxiety so this makes a lot of sense. And the vicious circle part is too true; I noticed that as well and it was miserable trying to work through it. I started sobbing because I had been up for over 24 hours when it happened recently, and I was feeling ill because of gall bladder issues, and I just broke down because I couldn't even sleep.</p>
<p>I'm really glad you found a method that worked to reduce it for you! I'm sorry it stills plays up sometimes, but at least now you can be more mildly annoyed by it than fearing it means something more serious; be able to be like, &quot;what the fuck anxiety&quot; instead of &quot;OH MY GOD WILL I DIE IN MY SLEEP??&quot; (at least, that's how I felt over it)</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>That's absolutely how I felt during the first couple of weeks when I got it. It's scary as hell, not gonna lie. Don't feel bad about breaking down because of your lack of sleep, it's a completely normal reaction.</p>
<p>It took about a month for me to be able to sleep somewhat normally again. It sounds weird, but it helped a lot that I used to get severe panic attacks a couple of years ago which I managed to get rid of by meditation, mindfulness, breathing therapy, talking therapy and yoga. The methods I learned from that helped me got rid of this too (not completely like I said, but the worst parts at least, which was the panic for me). It's at a manageable level for me right now basically.</p></div>		</li>
