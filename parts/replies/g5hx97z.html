			<div class="markdown"><p>If your ear feels moist and warm, you likely have an ear infection of some sort. If it begins producing any sort of fluid discharge you’d be best to see a doctor - as ignoring it can lead to whatever the issue is spreading deeper within your sinuses.</p>
<p>Side note - the pressure in your ear could be due to a issue within your body else where, in my case; Ive experienced a cracked moral tooth in which it didn’t feel any ill affects around the tooth its self while eating, rather just an increase of pressure in one of my ears.
That turns out out to be due to the pain signals triggered from the damaged tooth emitting down the nerve endings of that tooth, traveling through the sinus system causing them to respond by filling with fluid... thus creating the pressure in my ear; if it weren’t for the ear pressure I likely wouldn’t have known it cracked as the tooth caused no direct pain at the tooth as I would’ve expected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi fellow reddit doc</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X14649466" target="_blank">It actually is true</a> and, it's why I recommend my congested ER patients to blow their nose with an open mouth, to prevent them from spreading the infection to the sinuses or the ears. It might be a small risk, but I am mirroring what our ENT professor told us 10 years ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The article you reference lists it as one of three possible hypotheses for inoculation of the middle ear. </p>
<p>Contiguous spread, as I described, is another that they list. </p>
<p>This study (1997) no more supports your opinion than it does mine.</p></div>		</li>
