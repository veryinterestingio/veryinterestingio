			<div class="markdown"><p>But surely you can know what a word means without evoking the image every time? Like you don't listen to someone talk and get a stream of images in your head. You can force the images if you want.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that even if I don't force the images, they're still 'there', subtly present. I can force myself to conjure them up more vividly, but it seems that the association between a word and an idea/image is still happening, albeit under the surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's weird, we understand language because you know the syntax of english. Essentially you know where the verbs and nouns are in the sentence, this can't be said for other languages that you don't know. So now you have syntax you can read in a way that lets you know you are talking about something, now you know what something is called because you can read the word &quot;owl&quot;. So we now know we are talking about an owl, meaning is more deeper, you literally have to push an image to know what owl means. However when you read, you don't consciously pull the meaning but just take the concept &quot;owl&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You just know it unconsciously. Based on a lot of repetition and a lot of times seeing the word and evoking a image or definition. Thats why when we are older it is more difficult to learn new words (and stick to them or use them frequently).
For example, when you learn a new language, most of the times you just translate until you unconsciosly learn the definitions. You dont use images, you use symbols (words for another language) because the brain mostly uses symbols and not words</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I don't think we truly derive meaning when we speak, until we force an image. I mean we can be talking about owls and you might not know what an owl is, but you can still understand the conversation based off syntax and that there is something called an owl, regardless of what it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think anyone evokes images when they read (unconsciously that is), that means they don't really truly understand what they read unless promoted to. You don't need to know what an owl means unless I ask you for the meaning is my point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can I also ask, why do we understand better when we visualise as we read (consciously that is), so I would read a word, force the image, read the next word, take that image and force another image to represent the verb and form a movie out of the sentence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here you’re talking about ‘phantasia’, which is the ‘mind’s eye’. A good amount of people have aphantasia, or the inability to evoke images of people, places, things, despite being able to describe them lexically (by using words). People do better with images because we’re visual creatures. Images are a constant, they don’t command or judge, they don’t fade before they’re processed. </p>
<p>To expound on ‘people have filing cabinets filled with all the data they have about words’, not everyone has to force an image to understand a word, they’ll just use other features and attributes to parse it without assigning it a visual in the mapping process</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This can be explained due a lot of diffefent reasons. For example, it can be (usually) just because you are paying more attention.</p>
<p>A trick to remember a lot of random words and look like a genius is by representing the images in your head with an order.</p></div>		</li>
