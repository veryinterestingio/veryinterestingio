			<div class="markdown"><p>Surely you could distinguish Earth descended life from the DNA encoding it uses and multi-cellar life by the fact it would take anything that big centuries to diverge untraceably from whatever it started as. Not that theres likely to be any life that complex from Earth that could survive in any other solar environment we know of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have no idea. But I don't think there's any evidence for multiple separate lineages of life on Earth, so we know if that did happen, it was ~3GY ago. That should make it pretty easy to tell if life we find on other planets is either Earth's progenitors or shares a common ancestor with us. </p>
<p>(Same DNA coding but nothing else in common = earth life came from somewhere else)</p></div>		</li>
