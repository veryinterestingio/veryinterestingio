<p>To be fair, many big policies sound great on paper and win public support.  We only find out just how bad they turn out to be decades later, and the cautionary voices from earlier can only say &quot;I told you so&quot;.  Ask me about the California high speed rail sometime...</p>

<p>Much of this we can thank our auto industry's lobbying efforts for.  I'm not saying the public is blameless, but big auto took every chance they could to assault public transportation usage.  It's the reason so few cities have streetcars.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I just read an article on this the other day:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/07/car-crashes-arent-always-unavoidable/592447/" target="_blank">Americans Shouldn’t Have to Drive, but the Law Insists on It:<br />
The automobile took over because the legal system helped squeeze out the alternatives.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In America, the freedom of movement comes with an asterisk: the obligation to drive. This truism has been echoed by the U.S. Supreme Court, which has pronounced car ownership a “virtual necessity.” The Court’s pronouncement is telling. Yes, in a sense, America is car-dependent by choice—but it is also car-dependent by law.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Through these and other land-use restrictions—laws that separate residential and commercial areas or require needlessly large yards—zoning rules scatter Americans across distances and highway-like roads that are impractical or dangerous to traverse on foot. The resulting densities are also too low to sustain high-frequency public transit.</p>

<p>Orlando has a good bus system, but a normal commute to work and back on a bus can mean 3-4 hours or more spent commuting every day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Trickle down was never sound economics, Bush had it right when he called it &quot;voodoo economics&quot;. Simple sells though and since everyone hates taxes, why not make them the evil thing? </p>
<p>I agree on the big auto, I was going to go on a tangent about it but I stopped short. That deserves its own research paper. From inventing terms like &quot;jay-walking&quot; to pollution to city design auto manufacturers have a lot to answer for. I guess Amtrak is going to be profitable for the first time ever this year or next because kids nowadays don't want to drive. Thank god, our passenger rail is embarrassing. People talk about high speed rail...I just want some kind of reasonable rail that doesn't have to stop for hours to let freight pass.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;jay-driving&quot; also exists, it was just a bigist term for country folk/people that don't know how to walk/drive/act in the city.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, what about the California high speed rail?</p>
<p>Not trolling, I really want to know. I'm aware that its cost ballooned, but lots of other projects do as well, like the F-35. What made it different?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When the CHSRA was first funded, I spent some time digging around on their website looking for reasons to support it.  I never did, but was hopeful there might be some arguments to at least make me consider my position.</p>
<p>One of the most curious things I found was that under the section titled &quot;Economic Benefits&quot;, all of their arguments were just that it would create jobs.  That was it; no income from operation.  We could build all sorts of pointless things if we only want to fund jobs.  The fact that nothing else was mentioned was an indirect admission that it was going to be a constant economical drain.  That, of course, isn't necessarily a terrible idea (most public transit seems to lose money and requires subsidies), but that is absolutely contrary to the arguments that were made when it passed on the ballot.</p>
<p>The initial projected cost was $43bn.  In May, the estimate was updated to $79bn, and they're nowhere close to having the project finished.</p>
<p>Initially, there were only going to be a couple of stops, chiefly SF &lt;-&gt; LA.  The travel time was estimated to be 2h40m and cost $120 one-way.  I fly that route regularly and my total time and expenses average 2h and $80 (at the time they came out with that estimate, it was $40), so what's my incentive as a consumer to use CAHSR?  This is a problem especially when more than one person travels together.</p>
<p>Compounding that problem is that they've now added a large number of stops to the line.  More stops means less time at top speed.</p>
<p>We also have an issue where they aren't using high-speed track for a large portion of the trip, instead sharing it with existing track.  This means it can't hit top speed there, too.</p>
<p>Now, the CAHSR still claims it can hit 2h40m, but there's no evidence to really suggest they can.  Even if it does see completion, I would bet 6 months salary it takes longer than 2h40m for the trip.  And if it costs more than the projected $120, we'll have even bigger problems.</p>
<p>The last problem is that I seriously doubt people will use it frequently.  I don't think the demand is there to drive it.  If you've ever been on an Amtrak in CA, or used any of our public transit options outside of rush hour (and even during rush hour it's low compared to other public transit-centric cities), barely anyone uses these things.</p>
<p>People have train envy when they look at Japan or Europe and want a high-speed rail.  That money would be 10x more effective investing in intra-city subway systems to replace bus routes, or even for the immediate future repairing some of the horrible roads we have.</p>
<p>We don't have the population density or interest to make it work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not true at all.  The boomers didn't &quot;put Reagan in office&quot;, the guy won every group except for the 18-21 bracket and split the people in their 20's 44-44.  </p>
<p>Sure, boomers were the biggest group voting, but they voted the same as the older voters in the 1980 election and he crushed every age group in the 1984 election.  The entire country overwhelmingly approved of his first 4 years.</p>
