			<div class="markdown"><p>The fact that anti-lithium is produce at a millionth the rate as anti-helium in this particular collider is not a good reason to think anti-uranium will never be produced.  The rate that collisions at that collider spontaneously produce iPhones is astronomically lower than anti-lithium, but that doesn't mean we can't make iPhones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The anti-protons and anti-neurons would probably be produced in a collider (although it's possible you could get them <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiproton" target="_blank">naturally occurring</a> in cosmic rays or something).  The key idea, though, is that you would not just collide things together and wait for a bunch of anti-protons and anti-neutrons to spontaneously be created together in a bound state.   The very nature of such a process is that it becomes exponentially rare for more complicated objects.</p>
<p>Rather, you would generate your anti-protons and anti-neutrons, cool them down (since they would be moving ultra-relativistically), then combine them together in an (anti-)nuclear reactor, or whatever future technology you want to imagine.</p>
<p>Likewise, when you want to make an iPhone, you collect the raw materials and them assemble them in a controlled manner.  You don't just throw them at the wall :)</p></div>		</li>
