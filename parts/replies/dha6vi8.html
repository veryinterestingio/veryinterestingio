			<div class="markdown"><p>This is really interesting and I appreciate your response. I tend to get goosebumps pretty easily with specific songs. I notice that it happens more often when I have just smoked a joint or hit the bong. I guess this is because I am immersing myself more fully into the music so it has a greater effect. </p>
<p>It also kind of explains why sometimes the same song won't induce goosebumps. I am probably just not in the right mood to trigger them. But when the mood feels just right, and the music is hitting all the right notes, it is one of the best feelings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's an evolutionary remanent. As you said, intense emotions like fear triggers a chain reaction of signals that make your body hair stand. Look at animals when they're being threatened. Their hair stands to make them look bigger under vulnerability. </p>
<p>We humans look like chicken when we're vulnerable. ? </p></div>		</li>

<p>Goosebumps most often occur when something unexpected happens: A new instrument enters, the form shifts, the volume suddenly dims. Itâ€™s all about the element of surprise.</p>

<p>For me, I always get the strongest chill factor when the final chorus changes up the lyrics a bit. </p></div>		</li>
