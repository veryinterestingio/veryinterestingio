			<div class="markdown"><p>So what happens when it <em>does</em> jump species? From what I understand, the coronavirus we have now was mainly found in bats (or pangolins?) and was only transmitted when consumed by a human. What happened in the body to give the virus the ability to exploit cell machinery at this point?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The virus probably evolved fast enough- ie faster than our non-specific immune response could kill it off, which can takes several days to weeks- until it had a protein structure that fit in the &quot;lock&quot; of the cells of humans, with its new &quot;key&quot;.  Again my understanding is very basic, but many viruses are evolution in action- flu, COVID-19, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the answers here are a little oversimplified. In biology we usually think in terms of huge numbers, so we think on log scales and about things like binding efficiency. You have to keep in mind at a molecular level what's actually happening is these viruses or proteins are just floating around all over the place randomly bumping into each other. If the viral protein that binds the receptor has such terrible efficiency that they only bind together in one out of a billion collisions its effectively useless. But it might have a mutation that bumps that chance up to 1 in 10000, and that might be enough to let the virus get in a cell and start replicating. That won't lead to drastic infection immediately, but while I don't know about coronavirus specifically lots of RNA viruses have such high mutation rates that every single newly made virus has a new mutation. Most of them will die but each cycle of replication the mutations that allow the virus to bind host cell machinery or receptors (or evade immune defenses) are selected for, until eventually your body has developed it's own human adapted strain of the virus.</p>
<p>By the way I'm a virologist not a biochemist and those numbers are completely random, I don't really know what the binding efficiency is.</p></div>		</li>
