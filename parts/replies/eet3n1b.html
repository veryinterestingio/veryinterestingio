			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why the Mississippi basin is full of Asian Carp.  During the Great Flood of '93 the river flooded into hatcheries and released them into the main channel.  The only thing keeping them out of the Great Lakes is an electric gate just south of Chicago. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The gate is the only thing for now. They are also trying to reintroduce the alligator gar in those areas as well since they are about the only predator fish that could help control the carp. It's a pretty cool program.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But if it works, I’ll never get to see an Asian carp jump out of the water and land on my buddy’s face again. (Ohio River, 4-5 years ago, and it bloodied his nose.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gar are crazy. I go to the lake of the ozarks a bunch and one weekend the gar had swarmed down to our cove near our docks. Things were just swarming at the top of the water. Was one of the weirdest things I had ever seen. Turns out, they were just going cove to cove feasting. I saw them 2 days later like 4 coves down. I knew they were at the lake, didn’t realize in such mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I keep hearing that but I swear it's too late. I worked at a restaurant that was on the mouth of a river that dumps into Lake Erie in highschool through college. When I started you just didn't see fish near the surface of the river. When I stopped last year there were tons of massive carp in the river.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Different kinds of invasive carp. Those aren’t the ones everybody is worried about. It’s the silver and bighead are have been causing the most problems. There’s so many invasive species the waters surrounding Chicago. It’s a losing battle. The ecosystem has changed drastically and I don’t see it ever going back. Not in this lifetime.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate the idea of those carp.  The fact that people were bringing in indigenous animals in the first place just makes me angry.  The fact that they underestimated them, and now the carp are killing off our indigenous fish by eating their food.  Terrible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, they are. I watched a documentary on it over the summer; researchers have found traces of carp DNA in Lake Michigan waters, which could only have gotten there if the fish were present in the lake. At the time it wasn't as bad as the Mississippi levels of carp DNA, but it heavily suggested that the fish are in the lake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My buddy had a ranch down stream from a catfish farm. He built some nice new tanks but never got around to stocking them with fish. A few years later he was having a party at the ranch of some of the kids asked if they could go fishing. He said sure but pulled their parents aside and said he had never stocked his tanks and that the kids wouldn’t catch anything. A few hours later, kids coming running with some really nice catfish. They could just guess that a flood had moved the cats and other fish into the tanks. </p>
