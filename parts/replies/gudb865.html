			<div class="markdown"><p>This should be the top comment. Any explanation that treats evolution as a process working towards some specific end goal - also known as a 'teleological' explanation - is likely to be bunkum. That's not how evolution works.</p>
<p>A population exists. Within that population there is a certain amount of inherent genetic diversity, which is added to by occasional mutations (although the significance of mutations is often overstated). Some individuals in that population will reproduce, some will die before reproducing - genetics can influence which individuals and groups are likely to reproduce, but they aren't the only factor. Over thousands of generations, the population will change. That's all evolution is, really - an after-the-fact description of how the genetic material of a population changes over time. And some, but not all, of that drift of generic material will result in observable changes to individuals.</p>
<p>I used to be an editor at the Natural History Museum in London - at the time I pushed for any verb forms of evolution to be banned in our style guide. Evolution isn't an action performed by something with agency; it's an emergent property of a complex system. The idea had plenty of support internally but was considered a little too radical to be adopted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would you elaborate on your statement that &quot;the significance of mutations is often overstated&quot;? Didn't the population's genetic diversity ultimately get that way because of mutations?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not them but the point they’re making is that while mutations are ultimately responsible for genetic diversity, they aren’t required for changes in a population. As long as the genetic combination exists <em>somewhere</em> in the population, it can spread and express itself in the right circumstances. </p>
<p>Take the famous example of moths becoming darker during the industrial revolution as soot stained the surfaces they used for camouflage. This was probably not a direct result of mutations. Instead, there were probably already some moths with the genes for darker coloring in the population, and over time those moths thrived while the lighter-colored moths died out. Thus the population changed statistically without any new genes being created. Theoretically, the moth population could change back and forth between dark and light coloration as their environment changed, without ever needing any new mutations, as long as neither gene was ever fully extinguished.</p></div>		</li>
