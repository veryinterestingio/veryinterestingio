			<div class="markdown"><p>On a related note old films and TV sets were designed with black and white film in mind. High contrast colors showed up better. The set of the Adams family was a shit ton of pink. Not because Morticia loved pink but because it looked better in B&amp;W</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. And some of the makeup schemes they used back in the day look like bizzare clown makeup in color, because the pigments used looked better at highlighting facial features in black-and-white, particularly on early film &amp; TV systems which were oversensitive to certain colors, and undersensitive to others.</p>
<p>In those cases, the colorizers have to make an aesthetic decision - colorize it to what looks good, rather than what the sets, props &amp; actors really looked like.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They sometimes took advantage of this for special effects in Black and White movies too. The old B&amp;W &quot;Portrait of Dorian Gray&quot; movie used an effect where they painted his old man makeup on him in green, then shifted the lights from green to red so it would appear on him gradually.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a popular (and difficult to duplicate) vintage paint color for electric guitars called TV Yellow. It's a <a href="https://images.reverb.com/image/upload/s--rLq3JSxi--/a_exif,c_limit,e_unsharp_mask:80,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_south,h_1600,q_80,w_1600/v1360304555/ormry1uujrxqbde9vplx.jpg" target="_blank">semi-translucent pale yellow</a>. It was created for when B/W shows wanted to have a &quot;white&quot; guitar, because white was actually <em>too</em> white for the camera, and created a blurry glow. Painting the guitar pale yellow instead eliminated that glow, while still looking white on B/W film.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's really interesting I had always been curious as to why that colour was popular on guitars, pretty sure fender still makes telecasters in it. It's a pretty boring colour in comparison to some of the colours that were used on guitars in the 50s and 60s it always stood out to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is interesting because at least some B&amp;W films used a blue-sensitive film stock, so blue would have shown up as light (and yellow, the absence of blue, as dark).</p>
<p>Perhaps TV cameras were the opposite, which is also suggested by the <a href="http://cosmeticsandskin.com/aba/images/televison-makeup.jpg" target="_blank">TV makeup</a> which uses blue for dark lips and yellow for the lighter under-eyes. Whereas <a href="https://static.messynessychic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/clowncountouring2.jpg" target="_blank">this guide</a> as tested by <a href="https://static.messynessychic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/44737ba0-e67a-0131-6d05-0aa0f90d87b4.jpg" target="_blank">this blogger</a> is basically the opposite colour scheme.</p>
<p>This connotes that various B&amp;W processes would have needed vastly different colour schemes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of my favorites is the movie, &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;  In the book, Raymond Chandler spends a paragraph talking about how white the carpet in Sternwood mansion. &quot;This room was too big, the ceiling was too high, the doors were too tall, and the white carpet that went from wall to wall looked like a fresh fall of snow at Lake Arrowhead. There were full-length mirrors and crystal doodads all over the place. The ivory furniture had chromium on it, and the enormous ivory drapes lay tumbled on the white carpet a yard from the windows. The white made the ivory look dirty and the ivory made the white look bled out. The windows stared towards the darkening foothills. It was going to rain soon. There was pressure in the air already.&quot;</p>
<p>In the colorized version of the movie the carpet was pale blue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work in the warehouse for a company that made a lot of textile goods for the restaurant industry-chef coats and table linens and such.</p>
<p>Getting colors to match exactly was always a headache across the board, but the worst was always white. We probably had at least 5 different shades of white circulating in our warehouse from different batches, factories, fabrics, etc. On their own, any of them looked perfectly fine, but when you had them side-by-side, they started to look bad. We had one that was sort of an ivory shade, but compared to the other shades, would look horribly yellow. We had one that was strikingly bright white... until you compared it directly to other shades, and it started to look really blue. Some companies would pitch a fit that their 100% poly table cloths weren't quite the same shade as their cotton blend chef coats, but let me tell you, those two fabrics just are never going to look the same. It was a god-damned nightmare.</p>
<p>I just wanted to rant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds more like a technical oversight tbh, many colorizations are done to match the subjects that are in focus and this could be something that was shot on color sensitive film (there's a bunch of examples online of actors who were painted blue to appear white in B&amp;W) and the colorist probably just missed that while correcting the film to match a light skin tone which could probably be why the white carpet appears pale blue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This reminds me of a time many years ago (At least 10+) I was with my mum and we walked past one of those pop up framed art shops that set up in shopping centres (Maybe it's just an Australian thing, not sure)</p>
<p>Anyway, one picture they had on display was the famous Marilyn Monroe over the air vent with her dress flying up. I've seen the original movie (Seven Year Itch I think?) Now if you watch the original movie or old photos it's clearly white, this picture however had coloured it blue. Now my mum was a big Monroe fan, and her favourite colour is blue, so I thought she'd like it and pointed it out to her.</p>
<p>Cue her going into a small rant about how &quot;The dress is white, how dare they change it!&quot;<br />
Interesting to know the whole &quot;nothing can ever change&quot; attitude towards media is older than we think. (This would've been early 2000s, and my mum would've been in her 40s at this point)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a movie, but I recall reading up how they colorized a photo of some Sherman tanks in the Pacific in WWII, and as mentioned above it is based on research.  For instance, they looked at the vegetation in the photo and found out what species it was based on the island the photo was snapped on, which told them what shade of green to use.  They studied what paint choices were used to on Shermans in the Pacific campaign, and so on.  </p>
<p>In a related note, for the 1944 Captain America serial film, they made Cap's costume grey, white and dark blue.  They knew what colors he actually was, but the serial was shot in black and white.  The color selection was due to the fact as no color was being shown, they went with ones that would photograph better (The audience assuming Cap was in his correct colors through the black and white).</p></div>		</li>
