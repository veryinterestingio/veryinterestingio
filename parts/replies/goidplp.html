<p>Molecular evolution is caused by error-prone polymerases. What role does oxygen have?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely fair. Thank you for the correction. Polymerase error is the greater contributor to the base rate, as compared to redox based reactions on the strands, which are abso real though, and corrected for example by endonuclease III base excision repair mechanisms (see for example Paul Doetsch work). I neglected that, sorry, thinking about it just from the variation POV of the question. I had treated it as a side issue to the one involving the change and newness of the current scenario. Still it deserves mention, especially since different hosts are slightly better or worse at error correction.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So to be clear, one concern I've seen is that because we aren't seeing as many flu cases, it's harder for flu centers to track the mutations and emerging variants and subsequently harder to make vaccines for next flu season. But you're saying that the the rate of mutation is very closely linked to the width of it's spread in the population, and as a result there may be some mutation from the current strains, but they likely won't deviate significantly enough to have an outsized impact beyond?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's believable. A high number of infectious cycles will produce more variants. For that you need lots of people, densely exchanging, and lots of sickness.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Any thoughts on how close we are to a universal influenza vaccine? And what kind of vaccine will likely solve it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's close but a few years away. Also, it will have moderate efficacy. Once I had the idea that you could put all the real flu epitopes anywhere, synthetically, into one polyprotein flu creation, and then that massive thing would be able generate all immunity anywhere. Well. That proved a naive idea. But what Adolfo Garcia Sastre (NYC) has done is, I think, is to make vaccine parts not from highly divergent domains of &quot;head&quot; HA and NA, but rather the more stable &quot;stalk&quot; part of the proteins. The concept is, you make vaccine to the stable parts of the virus that every virus has, the common parts. Then, it's universal. Real problem: It's not very immunogenic. So, it will only provide some protection, for most variants. Many others will escape and not be impacted. I think a universal flu vaccine will eventually work, that Adolfo will succeed, and we will have some &quot;one size fits all product&quot; that you only need to take once, and it will protect you for the next 50-75 years, sort of, for most flu strains. I mean, there were people alive from the 1918 pandemic that still carried immunity in old age for the related 2009 one that was re-emergent. And if we are only generating immune response for the MOST stable, most conserved parts, the most universal bits, you can probably bet it will last even longer. Now then, a question. When we do this, we have an epidemiologically almost identical situation to what the OP started on about in the first place. That is, if we drive down one strain subpopulation, what is the impact  on the herd immunity or the effect on the populace? I beleive we AGAIN will have lesser variation, lesser involvement of reassortment, fewer  chances to make a virus that will kill a half million people. This Universal vaccine would take aim at the breeding ground for new strains. It would help again. Thanks for the thought provoking dialog. TLDR: Yes, soon, but its not panacea. Its another tool.</p></div>		</li>
