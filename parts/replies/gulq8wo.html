			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the biggest advantage of CC. From a security standpoint, if someone makes fraudulent purchases on your CC, you are in a much stronger position. You don't have to argue with the bank to get your money back. The bank is out that money until the matter is resolved. With a debit card, it's the other way around, the money is gone and you are arguing to get it back, but you won't have it until after the matter is resolved. So if you have bills to pay, you're gonna have a bad time.  </p>
<p>If you are responsible enough with a CC, you should use it for everything and pay it off at the end of the month.   </p>
<p>Additionally, for your debit card account, only put in a little petty cash ($50-100) and don't setup overdraft on it. Have a second checking account with no checks and no debit card that all your paychecks and income go into. If you need to buy something, manually transfer the money just before you purchase it. That way the max you could potentially lose or have held up is not enough to cause major problems.</p></div>		</li>
