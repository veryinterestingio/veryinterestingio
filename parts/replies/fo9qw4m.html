			<div class="markdown"><p>It's funny you mention this. One of the surgeries that exists for weight loss is the intragastric balloon. This means the introduction of a saline-filled balloon into your stomach, with the intention of making you feel full more of the time. However, your stomach recognizes something that probably shouldn't be there, so one of the known early side effects is that you try to vomit it up. You try *hard* to get rid of it. Eventually though, your body gets used to it.</p>
<p>My point being, you will feel full for a bit, and then you will vomit marbles.</p></div>		</li>
