			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you help me decypher the end of that article, where he seems to provide three schools of thought:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everettian (many-worlds): 'traveling electons only become *kind-of* decohered'</li>
<li>GRW: 'time asymmetric wave-function collapse but they don't un-collapse.'</li>
<li>Smooth Evolution of Wave Function: Branching rather than collapses.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but you seem to have the gist of it there. QM is full of interpretations (or Interpretations) which try to slap an ontology on the math. The math works, and the interpretations exist for those who feel the need to deal with that kind of thing. </p>
<p>Wikipedia has a pretty good section on the <em>many</em> interpretations that exist: </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretation_of_quantum_mechanics" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretation_of_quantum_mechanics</a></p>
<p>The section on &quot;Comparison&quot; is pretty excellent too, at a glance it gives you a sense of the differences and commonalities: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretation_of_quantum_mechanics#Comparison" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretation_of_quantum_mechanics#Comparison</a></p>
<p>Note that there are 17 separate ones before they run into the catchall 18th of &quot;Others&quot; so yeah, it's a pretty packed field. Part of the reason why this is the case is that, as long as your interpretation doesn't contradict the predictions of QM, you can stick pretty much anything that appeals to you onto the math. I think that realistically &quot;Shut up and calculate&quot; is also pretty common, since it either deals with the practical side, or acknowledges the incomplete nature of the theory without stressing about ontology. </p>
<p>The problem is, as he points out in the blog post, that depending on what interpretation you hew to, things can get pretty weird what with retrocausality or multiple universes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Isn't that what we ultimately want from physics and science in general? We don't just want useful mathematical models, we want to understand the nature of reality. Something has to be causing the experimental results to be the way they are that makes the math work out. And whatever that reality is we want to understand it. Just shutting up and calculating, while useful, is a head in the sand approach. Most likely QM isn't the final word on the matter, and there is a deeper reality which we'll eventually discover. Particularly since gravity and relativity remain problematic when combined with QM, and we don't know what dark energy is.</p></div>		</li>

<p>his explanation is pretty clear there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh I see still confusing though obviously :)
We studied a little about wave functions and a few other things about how electrons behave in around atom or a basic molecule and this part was kinda odd</p>
<p>Thank you</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My pleasure, and you know what they say, if you don't find it confusing, then you're not doing QM right.</p></div>		</li>
