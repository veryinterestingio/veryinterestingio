			<div class="markdown"><p>So in that example if somebody wins its +1, if somebody loses its -1. In equation form +1-1=0 or a zero sum game.</p>
<p>If both sides lose or both sides win it can be written as:</p>
<p>-1-1=-2
or
+1+1=2</p>
<p>A non-zero sum game.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good examples. One example that can apply to lawyers is contract negotiations. In fact, negotiation is one of those things that too many people see as zero-sum.</p>
<p>In a non-zero sum negotiation, both sides gain what they want while giving up something they don't want or want less. That's called &quot;creating value&quot; and is great if you can achieve that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a former lawyer, I can tell you that in many (probably most) cases, lawyers don't 100% win or lose. Or as a former partner put it, you have to redefine the term &quot;win.&quot; Is it a win or a loss if my client got a year in jail but could have (or even <em>should</em> have) gotten 3? Is it a win if my client won $100k, but might have gotten $0 or $200k? Is a plea deal or a settlement a win when you trade risk for a guaranteed outcome? Because that's how most cases end up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Zero sum doesn't need to be all or nothing. All it means is that however much you win is directly proportional to how much they lose. It still isn't a zero sum game strictly speaking, but your first sentence implied the ZS must be all or nothing. For example, if you were to play poker one on one, and you both walk away with your starting investment, it's still ZS.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The greatest example of non-zero sum trade / creating value I have heard is the candy experiment. </p>
<p>You get a bunch of children together. Randomly distribute candy from a variety pack, one piece per kid. Have them rank their happiness with from 1-5, and add up the total. Then allow 5 minutes of trading. If the happiness ranking is tallied again after the trading period, it will be higher overall.</p></div>		</li>
