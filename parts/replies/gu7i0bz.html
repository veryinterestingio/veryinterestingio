			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep! I believe the doctors mentions that in the article as well. Although I find it kinda weird that we call this an afterimage, since it's technically not an image at all, just the brain filling in space where it's not receiving information from</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So based on this, would closing your eyes hasten the recharge, since the photoreceptors aren't being taxed by more incoming light?</p>
<p>Can you also explain how this can lead to permanent blindness at extreme intensities (like looking at the sun through a telescope)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Focus enough energy on the retina and it's going to actually heat up and damage the cells. The sun is already bright enough to do this if you just stare directly into it unaided for more than a brief moment. Use a telescope to gather more of that light and focus it and you're going to burn your retinas really quick.</p>
<p>It's also why lasers can be dangerous if shone into the eyes.</p></div>		</li>
