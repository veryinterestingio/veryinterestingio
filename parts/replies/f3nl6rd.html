			<div class="markdown"><p>The town used oil and stones on my road then 3 weeks later they came by and put down this brown slurry that hardened up after a few hours. My road has been a dark blackish brown ever since. Any clue what that is?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. This is a slurry seal. So in your case it sounds like rather than use a premium asphalt mix with high grade materials, they’ve used a cheaper alternative, possibly recycled, then added a final layer - the slurry seal. </p>
<p>This final coating is used to seal the pavement from water ingress and provide the anti skid properties that the layer below cannot. </p>
<p>It’s typically a very thin layer than should be good for up to a decade depending on traffic loading.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Slurry seal is exactly what it is. Thank you I've been trying to look up the process and haven't been using the right terms. It was the first time I've seen anything like this before and the neighborhood has been curious about how well it will hold up.</p></div>		</li>
