			<div class="markdown"><p>i think I understand what you're saying, but I'm not quite clear. Sorry if my questions are ignorant/irrelevant. I took high school physics 20 years ago so  I know the words you're saying but they don't fully come together in my head.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Does this mean that even though the nucleus doesn't appear to be &quot;spinning&quot; its (electromagnetic?) field displays properties of &quot;being spinning&quot;?</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>So not only do the atoms spin, but they only spin in 1 of 2 possible directions/velocity? That is, spinning is an intrinsic part of their nature vs being spun from physical interaction?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct, but I find it helps not to visualise it, and just to treat spin as an integral factor of a particle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, don't think about it too hard, it makes the thinky part hurt.</p>
<p>Is it possible for a particle (not a boson or fermion) to have a spin value of + - 1/3 and/or + - 2/3 ?  Or does that cause some of the equation sets (that determine or rely on spin) to shit the bed?</p>
<p>Or are spins restricted to integer values and + - 1/2 ?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, this is called quantization. It means that some properties will be at certain values and no others. For example, electrons around a nucleus will only inhabit certain energy levels (distances and patterns around the nucleus). The same thing happens with spins, certain particles can only have certain spin states. The reasons for this are complex and I won't get into them here.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Through interaction you can change the direction of the spin but not the magnitude. So you can't &quot;speed up&quot; or &quot;slow down&quot; the spin. The magnitude is an intrinsic quantity of that particle.</p>
<p>For example, an MRI works by using a magnetic field to orient the spin of certain atomic nuclei into the same plane and then uses radio signals to flip them over. When the radio signal is removed they flip back and give off a characteristic signal which can be measured. Thus you can measure where those atoms are located and make a model based on that. They often do this with hydrogen atoms which are abundant in water and fat in your soft tissue but not as much in your hard tissue like bone, this makes it great for imaging those soft tissues. It also can be done with other elements but that's not as common.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I used to believe that spin could be defined by a single bit of information, say 0=D and 1=U. Now that you say the spin is oriented in a plane, then even the approximate definition of that plane involves far more information.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Since the initial radio signal is a transversal wave in a plane, then  the signal is the release of stored energy  into the same plane.</p>
<p>Can that plane be determined or is this another quantum case where we are only allowed a single test that yields a binary true/false value?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Just a note on the apparatus: The original experiment actually yielded a continuous distribution, just very different from the distribution you would expect — and it did so because the incoming beam was arranged initially in a kind of ribbon to begin with — that is, it was much more spread out along one direction than the other. The magnetic field gradient split the ribbon into two distinct ribbons, bulging out from the original path — but at the edges, where the field gradient vanished, the two ribbons coincided.</p>
<p>That probably sounds confusing, so here's what it looked like, with the field off (left) and on (right): <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wve8g.jpg" target="_blank">https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wve8g.jpg</a></p>
<p>I'm not entirely sure why it was done this way — I suspect that it might have been due to quantum mechanical precision limitations; i.e., the complementarity of horizontal and vertical components of momentum giving a limit to how focused the vertical component could be given sufficient horizontal focus for the experiment to work, due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Either that, or it was just good enough, and this method made it easier to sample the region of maximum field gradient more easily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty sure it was the last one. By 1922 they were approaching being able to make a Transmission Electron Microscope (1928), so they could have done a heck of a lot better than this if they really tried. But this was easily good enough to establish what they were trying to, and had the benefit that you got to sample what would happen at various field intensities and gradients.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do we know that spin has other properties of angular momentum, beyond just operating on the charge of the particle to produce the magnetic field of that particle? Do two 'spinning' particles colliding cause their spins to reverse, for example? Can it be transferred?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it can. For instance, if you put a strong magnet on a torsion balance and heat it up so it loses its magnetism (and thus the net spin of its previously aligned electrons), it starts spinning (very slowly).</p>
<p>There is only one way in which spin is metaphorical - it applies to a point particle as well as an extended one and no motion is associated with the spin. Its carrying angular momentum is <em>highly literal</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. I thought otherwise and asked a couple of times in the thread. I should have wait. It is actual spin. Cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find it interesting that when the electrons are aligned they sum to form a large magnetic field, but the spins don’t sum to rotate the object. But the opposite is true if the electrons aren’t aligned.</p></div>		</li>
