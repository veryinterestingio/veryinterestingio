<p>The trick is to saturate the soil, then leave it to dry out completely(rock the pot until it feels light), then saturate again and repeat.  You might go weeks without watering, but your plant may very well flourish. </p>
<p>You can saturate multiple plants by setting them in a sink full of water for a good amount of time (let me them drain the excess water afterwards). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>interesting that this is a good way to water plants, considering it’s closer to how they’re watered in nature. nothing for days/weeks, then a saturating rainfall.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does that really work for all plants? I thought only succulents could handle the saturated period...</p></div>		</li>
