			<div class="markdown"><p>Crater dating is complicated, especially for very young surfaces with a few small craters, and the age of Giordano Bruno is not settled. A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0032063312002541" target="_blank">study</a> of inferred secondary craters, whose ages are estimated from their size and prominence, from the Giordano Bruno impact at the nearby Luna 24 site is consistent with the Kaguya-derived age of 1-10 million years. On the other hand, the craters in Giordano Bruno itself imaged by Kaguya could be self-secondary craters formed by material ejected at high angles from the primary impact that soon fell back into the newly formed crater. See the first paragraph of section 4 of <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=http://luna1.diviner.ucla.edu/~dap/pubs/078.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiarbzRg-_tAhWJo1kKHRnDAoYQFjAAegQIBBAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw2FPQsZN-DoY1neLirEzaim" target="_blank">this paper</a> (PDF warning) for a very brief review with references of these estimates and considerations.</p></div>		</li>
