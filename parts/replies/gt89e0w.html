			<div class="markdown"><p>The question is are you an alcoholic or not. If you are, you should do it in a controlled manner. Rehab is preferred as they can monitor and give drugs to help with the extreme withdrawal that can cause the intense symptoms. </p>
<p>Of course most people are afraid of the costs of rehab and losing their job. So the next step is to drink less but do not quit cold turkey. Over the course of a month reduce consumption. </p>
<p>Eventually you have to find positive habits to replace the drinking. So working out, hiking, yoga, cooking, something. You want to keep yourself busy. 8 weeks or so of doing this new hobby habit and you may be on your way.</p>
<p>Now you have to find a way to be social in a society that lives in alcohol. Maybe you have friends who go to the bar or having some brews by the bbq. Find something else to drink. La Croix is my go to. When people mention anything, tell them you stopped drinking.</p>
<p>I lost my dad to alcohol. So at the very least, think of your family and friends around you and how theyd be with you gone. They'd be devastated. There is moderation and you can absolutely have a drink every once in awhile. But it is liberating to live alcohol free.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this. Unfortunately, I'm just a grocery store worker. I have had trouble with alcohol abuse for years, but I don't have the time or money to try to find help.
I have a kid on the way and I just don't want to be the same alcoholic father I had. I'll try what you mentioned, thank you again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The physical aspect of addiction: If you are a daily drinker, cut down gradually over 7-10 days. If you only binge once a week, you can stop without the tapering. </p>
<p>For the mental aspect of addiction: Drinking is often a cover to dissociate from emotions of low-self worth or emotional flashback to previous childhood trauma. I would first learn the following by using the internet and youtube esp. (Will try to scatter shot the cheat codes here, but finding precision on what you need will be important and will come with time): </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ol>
<li>Self-compassion: first you need to stop attacking yourself in your mind. You need to support yourself and be very nice for yourself. Why? When you start the grieving process and exit dissociation a lot of negative emotions become alive. If you are habitually mean to yourself you will not support yourself through this but will default to the mean treatment you may have learned through conditioning. I would go to <a href="https://self-compassion.org" target="_blank">self-compassion.org</a> and take their test. It just a rough grade. Ego will have a lot of resistance to doing this and will call it &quot;corny&quot; and &quot;weak&quot; but it's literally normal and a place of strength  to be in support of yourself. Listen to lectures by Kristen Neff about this topic for more. </li>
<li>Figure out if you experienced narcissistic abuse and grieve those painful experiences by journaling or sharing with others. r/CPTSD discord channel is a good place. Think of the subjective experience the child version of you experienced and don't as an adult say it wasn't too bad. If it was overwhelming call it what it was. The point of grieving and connecting with this past is to let go of resentment and regret and to start welcoming in healthy emotional signal in life rather than pushing it down. </li>
<li>Learn about CPTSD and see if you have any features of it. Read Pete Walker's book &quot;Complex PTSD from surviving to thriving&quot;</li>
<li>Learn about Codpendency. Read &quot;Codependent No More.&quot; Figure out do you have patterns of codependency? Do you try to attach to others to escape low self-worth, do you use limmerance to feel better?</li>
<li>As you do this learn what I will term self-efficacy. This will include 1. self care: keeping your room clean, keeping yourself well fed and clean, soothing yourself in positive ways when you recognize that you feel like shit. 2. learn the 9 cognitive distortions described in cognitive behavioral therapy, read &quot;Feeling Good&quot;  by Burns. 3. learn stoicism and setting goals etc. </li>
<li>After you did 1-5. Make sure you are not doing some false enlightenment bullshit via spiritual bypass, becoming a know-it-all, or latching on to a cult of some kind. If not throw 1-5 in the trash and remember the destination, don't let the prescription of recovery become the new god that you worship. Your identity need not be the self-compassion, journaling, non codependent, CPTSD patient, son of an alcoholic that practices stoicism. You are a free person that can manifest a happy and connected life. </li>
</ol>
<p>The general process will be more of a focus on grieving/recovery --&gt; than more and more a focus on self-efficacy and moving forward by accomplishing goals and exiting recovery (acceptance, letting go). If you stay in grieving mode and play a victim for too long it can be dangerous. Don't take this as professional advice, this is only what worked for me, therapist was either too expensive or not helpful. If something doesn't resonate with you ignore it.</p></div>		</li>
