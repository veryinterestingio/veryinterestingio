			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the top commenters and people talking about hydroponics aren’t considering most houseplants. I have a side business selling plants and I have an entire room full of Pothos, monstera, philodendrons and others in water. I have one super large philodendron that’s been in water in my office over a year. </p>
<p>Ultimately it depends on the root system. Any plant that can propagate in water (ie your Monstera) has thick roots that are made to survive like this. In contrast think of what the roots of any edible vegetable, annual outdoor flower, or pretty much any plant that you only see outdoors. These guys don’t last in water over a week, that’s why cut flowers die so quickly and don’t root like a Monstera would.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anecdotally, my cuttings have needed at least weekly water changes and a good spray off to prevent gunk from becoming rot. That's not possible when a plant is potted in soil.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For cuttings, as I understand it, once the roots start growing and rooting hormone is released by the plant, you should refresh the water. Water contains dissolved oxygen and the roots will deplete the oxygen as time goes on. On the flip side, in soil, the excess water will waterlog the plant and suffocate it as it will fill all the little voids of oxygen in the pot.</p></div>		</li>
