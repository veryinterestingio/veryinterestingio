			<div class="markdown"><p>He gently explains advanced concepts, and that's how far into the dummies it goes. They're still advanced concepts, and he will dive deep into them. But, especially that far back in his Youtubing, there was a decent level of knowledge required to hang on. He's improved since then.  </p>
<p>There are levels to learning any form of theory. The question is, what would you, personally, use theory for? Writing? Improvisation? Simply improving your knowledge of your instrument? I can attempt to point you in a more digestible direction.  </p>
<p>There are famous people in technical bands who simply played so much that they developed their ear to a level where they never dove into theory, and are very successful. And others who thrive with the knowledge. If the music gets out of you and you're happy with it, you're good. If you feel you need to fill in some gaps, theory may help.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ooo I'd love to be directed to theory that can be used to help writing and improvisation! I'm currently learning guitar and I'm still very early on (practicing chord changes and only just learning to strum in 4/4 time and 3/4 time) but any links to writing and improv I could look at would be much appreciated! Also is it best to view these things when I am more advanced, or is early on like now a good time?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not even true for Western music. There are songs in major keys that sound very sad and songs in minor keys that sound very happy.  </p>
<p>I think bright/dark are better words to use (wider intervals are considered 'brighter'), although those terms themselves are loaded too. There is an element of culture, but it's I don't think it's mostly the factor, as the concepts of consonance/dissonance and how they are associated with major/minor does scan across cultures, and even appears in the song/communication of other animals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, it's not universally true even for Western music, and thanks for the extra info I do like bright/dark as well. But this is ELI5 and in Western music minor is sad like &gt;90% of the time. Keep in mind that it appears OP has no music theory knowledge so we're probably talking about like common radio music here. In that subset of Western music, &quot;minor = sad&quot; (or at least melancholy, angry etc) is really close to universal. I'll backpedal on claiming the association is the biggest factor, but I'm confident it's very important.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yes, it absolutely is, and you're right, the happy/sad association is certainly widespread.</p>
<p>I also think Adam Neely is great. Although his explanations can require some musical theory knowledge, he is pretty good at making them as simple as possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That whole video was like watching a class on particle physics.  All I learned is some dude named Dorian is frigid. </p>
<p>Seriously though, I wish I understood music better.  As an essentially  non player this video was like watching a video describing geometry proofs to a first grader.</p></div>		</li>
