			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that’s the most common overlooked part and the one I have to explain a lot to parents. If your core strength is weak it is hard for you to be in an upright position which makes moving your arms and hands away from your body with precision harder </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't find out about the core strength thing until college. I was used to drawing while hunched over with my nose like half an inch from the page. Then I got into college art classes and had to learn to do all my work on an easel. It sounds like a little thing but, hooboy did I spend months being sore as hell because having to draw while sitting upright and half a foot away from the page was working muscles I didn't even know I had.</p>
<p>Also: spending 4 years in art classes made my handwriting significantly less chicken-scratchy. I guess improving one fine motor skill also improves related fine motor skills.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Japanese are also taught exactly how to write their systems of writing in a precise way from the very beginning. In English we don't inforce things like stroke order or precise shapes. I know it's not really taught any more, but look at how many of us can't remember how to write a cursive Q. In Japan that would have been drilled into us.</p>
<p>Not to take anything away from their art, but they do have years of the basics as children (akin to practicing scales on the piano).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was looking for a response from an OT! Another thing to add on that I’ve learned as an aspiring SLP is that a lot of kids with dyslexia/dysgraphia will write letters differently every time. </p>
<p>For example, most people write “b” by drawing the line down first, but kids with dyslexia have inconsistent starting points (i.e. drawing the line up, starting from the bottom of the curve, top of the curve, etc) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was gonna ask this. I don't have <em>amazing</em> dexterity, but I play a few instruments and type faster than most of my peers so I would think my writing would look at least halfway decent but it's comically bad. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily, having those attributes will definitely help though. It still requires you to take your time when writing and using proper letter formation. If you are rushing while writing it’s going to be less neat than when you take your team and actually focus on what your writing. </p></div>		</li>
