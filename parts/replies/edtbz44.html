<p>This is true for Uranium &amp; Plutonium but not for Thorium.  Main reason we researched uranium reactors was because they made plutonium and you could make bombs a lot more easily with those 2 than thorium.   My memory is fuzzy, but I think there may be some muti-stage bombs that use other elements for fission just due to previous reactions creating a huge netron surplus that can get used for fission.  Thorium requires a net influx of neutrons to keep the reaction going.  Last I heard, India was working on this tech.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The abundance of hydrogen isn't the limiting source for fusion fuel, we're far more limited by the abundance of Lithium (used to synthesise Tritium). </p>
<p>Li is still more abundant than U, but far less abundant than H. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. The density discussion only explains why H bombs are more powerful [Edit: apparently not even that]. This (mostly the cost and effort required to mine and refine the raw material) is the explanation for why fusion is such a desirable goal for power generation.</p></div>		</li>
