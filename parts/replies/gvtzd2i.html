			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, they start to suck. See, not all wells have pressure and gas that drives the fluids to surface. Wells that do are tied into pipelines to flow. Ones that don't, or only do in bursts, get pumpjacks to draw the fluid out to the pipeline. But sometimes, because of changes in the oil formation, the well goes to negative pressure. It'll start drawing things back down the hole. These become injection wells.</p></div>		</li>
