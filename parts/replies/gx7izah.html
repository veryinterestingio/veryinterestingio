<p>After this, my opinion is that form is most important.  Weight and reps much less so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>30-something year old here with absolutely wrecked knees.  My electric bike changed my life. I got a RadPower bike after seeing Taran review them on LTT a few years ago and have never looked back. Why? The throttle!</p>
<p>The biggest struggle I had with biking was literally starting. Even on the lowest gear, getting a bike going from a stop required so much pressure on my knees it was painful. This made biking a non starter for me due to the sheer amount of intersections I'd have to ride through, potentially stopping and starting at any number of them.</p>
<p>The RadPower was one of the few e bikes (at the time) that had a throttle, meaning I could literally sit back, twist the handle, and off I'd go. Then, when it was already in motion, I could ride doing as much or as little work as I could bare for each given day.</p>
<p>They aren't cheap per se, but compared to other electric bikes they are a steal. That said, you are making a tradeoff for weight. The bike is HEAVY compared to a standard bike, and even compared to other ebikes, but it's allowed me, someone who literally struggles anymore to handle more than one flight of stairs, to be active on a daily basis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now that I think about it, it's hard to &quot;easily&quot; explain. I've been running for well over 20 years now. I just &quot;know&quot; when it's too much because I've been past the too-much level a few times before and I can recognize when the soreness starts to turn to injury.</p>
<p>So the safe answer is the one that gets seemingly overused in the running sub: c25k, which stands for &quot;couch-to-5-kilometers&quot;. It assumes you are a couch potato and guides you over several weeks to be able to run 5km (3.1 miles).</p>
<p>This distance is a very common distance that you can find most weekends in most cities (aside from the last year and a half), so it's a very goal-oriented plan. It starts you alternating walking and running and eventually builds up to running the entire distance. It's mostly fool-proof, and in fact, anyone who is <em>not</em> in potato condition will often get frustrated at how slow the build up seems to be.</p>
<p>So yeah, a quick google of &quot;c25k plan&quot; will give you a few dozen good results and a dozen apps that do all the planning for you, just pick the prettiest or the most popular one and go for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who started running in January I feel like the ramp up is not even that slow. While I've been working out for the last 2 years, stamina was never my strength. And it's amazing how fast you can get to some serious pace.<br />
Never started out with running and walking though, always tried to keep running, even if in a slow pace, to get the body used to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everyone is different, and whatever works for you is what matters at the end of the day.</p>
<p>I started running like you. Pretty much full on &quot;go until you can't go any more&quot;. Fortunately at the time, my 14 year old body was able to overcome whatever I put it through. It has taken me a while to &quot;get it&quot; that people who start running in their 30s and 40s are not going to be used to my level of apparent masochistic training.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some people are just not meant to run. I've tried running on multiple occasions, starting slow like c25k. No matter how easy I ramp up the miles, in the end I suffer from knee pain. Got close to sub 20 5k once before injuries started acting up again after taking half a year to get to 5k. I've just resigned to the fact the sport is not for me instead of forcing it and have crap knees by the time I'm 40.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sub 20 5K is a pretty decent pace though, i.e. one you have to actively train for - especially if you're running on harder uneven surfaces, I find that extra pace does make it more likely I'll hurt something</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like you might have poor running form. Have you tried orthotics in your shoes, or specialist tape around your knees like rocktape to help with muscle activation during the run? You could always get a physical therapist to look at your running form, too</p></div>		</li>
