			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you get the thing where your brain forgets how to read too?  When I get a “good” one I know I’m looking at letters, but I can’t process what they mean.</p>
<p>Edit: (to all the replies) god damn, we are a mess.</p>
<p>Another edit cause I’m lame like that and apparently there are a lot of people dealing with this crap: There is no real research to prove this works and I accept it may be psychosomatic or a placebo effect. I got a daith piercing in my left ear a couple years ago and it reduced the number and severity of my migraines considerably. Just saying. There’s a lot of anecdotal evidence that it works, but again, no real research or studies that I’ve found to prove or disprove it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sooooooooo happy to see others have experienced this. Not to wish ill on you all, but it freaked me out when I was trying to send texts and noticed I wasn't spelling things correctly, but also couldn't correct it. And when I tried a phone call, I had to be very slow and deliberate with my speech. Weird stuff, for sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is EXACTLY how I would describe it. It feels like the language processing part of my brain just shuts off. Letters and words just look like symbols to something I can't comprehend. The first time it happened to me, I thought I was having a stroke!</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's as though the visual migraines impair and short circuit the part of my brain in charge of doing my job right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yeah I pop them like crazy. They seem to help more now as an adult. When I was a teen, I just threw up everything including pills and anything that was in my belly. It would stop the pain in my head while I was throwing up so I would actually sit there with a glass of water and hug the bowl. Sip, throw up, sip, throw up...cry...repeat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to get them in elementary school. My parents thought I was joking when I said I felt like I was dying. They just laughed and said headaches suck. Later got diagnosed with migraines and I still make them feel like shit for it as a I'm 27.
I still get them and they vary in severity and frequency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used injectable Imitrex when it first came out.  It worked, but if you didn't inject it right, it wore off too fast.</p>
<p>Later, I discovered Imitrex is a variant of the caffeine molecule.  Now when I get aura, I take some caffeine.  Aura goes away, pain doesn't develop, but I still get a tired/wiped out feeling after a few hours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to drink a large, strong, iced coffee as soon as possible on aura onset. That sort of worked. l had a cardiac arrest  three years ago and have not had a a migrane since. This may be due to some brain damage, bypass surgery or the beta blockers I am on. Suggest you try the beta blockers in preference to a cardiac arrest and open heart surgery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's really great that caffeine works so well for you.</p>
<p>In case you're interested, the two molecules are actually very different and work in different ways. Caffeine blocks adenosine receptors to cause vasoconstriction, and sumatriptan  (Imitrex) is a selective serotonin agonist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had two of these ever. Within days. First time I was driving, and slowly realized I could barely see. Have to imagine I had the mental capacity of a drink driver. Had one more the next day and went to hospital. Diagnosed with aura only migraine and thank God never had another one. Side note: it's amazing how fast you jump in priority for vision loss, guess it mirrors symptoms of a stroke, was strapped up to an EKG within minutes of arriving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't notice anything other than the aura when it happens, thankfully. I usually get it maybe 2-3 times a year, but it's actually been at least 6-9 months since my last one, so I'm probably due.</p>
<p>For me, I get a bright jagged line, almost like a lightning bolt across my vision. I've had it happen while driving which was scary, of course. It's not sudden, it just sort of comes on and will last for 15-20 minutes in the best case scenario. I can see out of the edges or periphery of my vision during it, so it's not impossible to function. The very first time it happened, in my twenties, I thought I was going blind... At first, I thought it was eyestrain. I work in IT and look at screens a lot, and thought it was tied to that as it would usually happen while looking at a screen. It wasn't until it happened a few times out of that situation that I realized it was more.</p>
<p>When it comes on, I'll usually try to close my eyes if I can, and being in the dark does help. With my eyes closed I'll still see that bright jagged line across my vision, which is how I started realizing it wasn't something specifically won't with my eyes. Very weird stuff, but I'm thankful that I don't get the actual headache part like others as it sounds quite painful and debilitating.</p></div>		</li>
