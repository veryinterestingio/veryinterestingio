			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a huge proponent of the 'calories in, calories out -- it's thermodynamics' perspective on weight-loss, and that people don't really have slow or fast metabolisms (the variance among people is really small), but I've been reading lately about <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/08/inflammations-immune-system-obesity-microbiome/595384/" target="_blank">mounting evidence</a> of the gut biome's role in absorption of calories. </p>
<p>I'm not completely convinced, yet, but I think it's worth keeping an eye on. For example, adults drink more alcohol (highly caloric by itself) which could reduce gut biome diversity and thus lead to further weight gain</p>
<p>Edit: I should note that in my personal, anecdotal experience, if you closely track calories you can predict weight loss like clockwork</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm on mobile so I'll likely not think this out properly but I think CICO, gut health and eating schedule are all important  (excluding nutrition which is also very important but not just talking mechanics). So often people are so adamant about one position vs the others it's more tribal than trying to answer questions.  A shorter eating schedule allows the gut to be at full power for all food consumed vs not having the &quot;energy&quot; or ability to be effective for a prolonged period of time. Rhonda Patrick has talked about this at length and mentioned research at the Salke institute. </p>
<p>I've seen another gentleman named Ben Bickman talk about when humans are producing ketones we may actually just waste a lot so it throws off cico a little for what we would traditionally be able to measure based on brown fat (which you mentioned) as well as urine and breathing them out. But then the fasting crowd also doesn't want to accept that they often eat way less calories too and that it's still important to pay attention to calories if you want prolonged success. </p>
<p>It is all interesting trying to figure this out and seeing everyone has some good points and it's not all that different in the end</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The whole microbiome role in absorption of calories is a canard.  Your normal healthy person will absorb beyond 95% of nutrients.  100% is an impossibility.  So we're arguing over maybe a 2% change in efficency.  Note carefully that there's not a single actual number thrown out in that entire article.  It's all built on a house of cards anyway:  <a href="https://www.stephanguyenet.com/microbiota-and-obesity-is-it-all-hype/" target="_blank">https://www.stephanguyenet.com/microbiota-and-obesity-is-it-all-hype/</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>Your metabolism does not slow down with age, or at least not like you probably think.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It <em>does</em> slow down - by about 30% at age 50. Lifestyle factors certainly play a role in your overall metabolism, but as you age your metabolic process do naturally slow down - which is why an injury takes longer to heal, it takes longer to recover from exercise, and so on.</p>
<p>For most people you're correct, their metabolism slowing down isn't the root cause of their weight gain. But to say it doesn't slow down with age is incorrect and for those of us who have maintained an active lifestyle and have to deal with direct results of it, it is major factor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can confirm both. As an oldish person (43). I normally cycle and go to the gym, depending on the day my TDEE is between 3000 and 5000 calories. 3000 in the winter and 5000 over the summer, I normally cycle more over the summer. At the beginning of the summer I knackered my knee. Apparently it should have taken about 6 week to heal. I'm on about week 10 and it still hurts if I'm not careful - much better than 10 weeks ago when I could barely walk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>30% is so far outside the bounds of what I’ve always been told that that seems ridiculous.  Do you have a source? I’ve heard 5-10% typically with 15% at most (for the average person, not extreme cases)</p></div>		</li>

<p>More recent data has found most middle age weight gain is due to inactivity.</p>
<p>It does get harder to be more active as you age due to stresses of life and being less flexible and able to heal.</p></div>		</li>
