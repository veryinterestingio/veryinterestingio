			<div class="markdown"><p>Heh, I don't think you'll find any self-respecting scientist claiming anyone will understand <em>all</em> the processes. If you liked reading about EPO, may I suggest going down the utter rabbit hole that is our immune system?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm a master's degree worth of time down this particular hole and it's as fascinating as it is hell to wrap your mind around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely fascinating, and so Rube Goldberg complex you’d swear someone made it up just to mess your mind. Like one of those million-domino things only each one’s different, a domino, a Go Stone, Mah Jong tile, slice of Swiss, a towel, gold calf...
Get’em, champ! Thank you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All kinds of hair have a limited amount of time they last and it is not different to the eyelashes.
That means the eyelashes are continuously “dying” and falling off and growing back up.
We don’t notice that because there are eyelashes in all stages of development, so when one of them is falling off, other is reaching its full size</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the reason of not enough oxygen is some other disorder, such as decreased lung capacity or low red blood cell count, would the hormone still compensate by increased blood production, and if so, could this cause other problems such as high blood pressure or heart failure?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the person doesn’t have enough oxygen for some lung problem or other issue that decreases the amount of oxygen in the blood cells, it causes polycythemia, that is a high amount of red blood cells, increasing the blood viscosity and causing many other issues.
If the cause of poor oxygenation is low red blood cell count, or anemia, it varies largely on the cause of the issue. In some cases, the blood marrow will try to keep up with the demand for blood cells and release immature cells in the circulation</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea. It doesn't always have to be tied into the kidneys thinking there isn't enough o2 either. Most &quot;levels&quot; in the body work on a negative feedback loop. Sometimes the trigger to turn these loops on or off gets compromised. Polycythemia (too many red cells) can be caused by a quite a few things. Too much epo, spleen isn't recycling red cells, bone marrow just doesn't wanna listen, ect. People have to get therapeutic phlebotomies for it all the time. They basically take a 500ml (or however much the order from the physician calls for) bag of blood out of you and throw it away just to thin things out so your heart doesn't have to work extra hard pumping super thick blood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>a COPD patient experiences chronic hypoxemia (low oxygen levels in the blood) and the body will try to compensate by creating more red blood cells (RBCs), a condition called polycythemia. it’s interesting because while it makes perfect sense to the body- low blood O2? let’s increase its oxygen carrying capacity by increasing the amount of red blood cells circulating in the blood! - but that is often just a temporary fix and hurts the body in the long run, and despite that the body will continue creating an overload of RBCs. the resulting increase in blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries will cause right heart failure (cor pulmonale) because the right ventricle works too hard for too long trying to pump blood into the pulmonary arteries and will inevitably fail. this is seen a lot in chronic bronchitis patients specifically</p></div>		</li>
