			<div class="markdown"><p>Now, that's an interesting question. </p>
<p>Technically, the sun isn't hot enough to do what it's doing now, i.e. fusion of hydrogen nuclei. It only occurs because of quantum tunneling. Hotter stars can fuse hydrogen classically, and they have much shorter lives. </p>
<p>But we're talking about fission of heavy elements, which can happen even on Earth. Spontaneous fission is what makes them radioactive. Fission can be stimulated by hitting the already unstable nuclei with, say, an alpha particle. Alpha particles can be produced by a nearby atom decaying, which is what causes chain reactions in reactors and atomic bombs. </p>
<p>Alpha particles are nothing more than helium nuclei. And guess what helium is named after. The sun. Which is where it was first discovered. Plenty of high energy alpha particles swimming around in there. </p>
<p>Thing is, hitting these things with alphas in reactors is what made them what they are now, so I'm not sure whether more alphas will make the situation better or worse. </p>
<p>The one thing we can be sure of is that any nuclear waste inside the sun is almost 100 million miles farther away than any nuclear waste on Earth. Radiation drops off with the square of distance. That's also why we aren't burnt to a crisp by the very hot sun.</p>
<p>So, on balance, if we could get our nuclear waste to the sun, we probably wouldn't have to worry about the radiation anymore.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a rocket/nuclear scientist, but I'd wager putting a bunch of nuclear waste on a rocket capable of getting it into an orbit intersecting with the sun may present a risk of said rocket blowing up and spewing radioactive waste all over it's trajectory</p></div>		</li>

<p>So it would require a huge rocket on top of all the other problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it would not be, our sun is hot enough to fuse hydrogen into helium primarily. It is also currently capable of doing a little bit of fusing lithium, beryllium, and boron.</p>
<p>no stable star produces elements higher on the periodic table than Iron. Fusing elements lighter than iron releases energy. Elements heavier than Iron actually absorb energy when they fuse (which would include nuclear fuels like uranium and plutonium.) The heavy elements are produced suddenly and rapidly then ejected into space when a star explodes in a nova.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most used fuel from nuclear reactors sits in metal and concrete containers (designed to survive impact from airplanes) right next to the reactors where they were used. They are very safe and aren’t going anywhere. </p>
<p>It’s always bothered me that people discuss how long lived radioactive waste is, as if other wastes are short-lived. How long is lead poisonous for? Maybe it turns into something harmless after a day or two? Does CO2 in the atmosphere go away on its own (in the absence of regrowing forests)? No, that stuff hangs out forever until someone goes and removes it. Nuclear waste at least gets less radioactive on its own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s one key difference between nuclear waste and all that other waste: it’s incredibly dangerous to handle, and can’t just be dumped. If we dump CO2, the impact is hardly localized. With lead, we only need to avoid water sources, and it’ll be fine. With nuclear waste, we have something that a future civilization might want to investigate, and is almost guaranteed to cause massive damage if they do. We’re concerned with nuclear waste not because it’s more dangerous, but because we can hide it. If we hide it well enough, it won’t even cause environmental damage. No matter what the waste is, if we can prevent it from damaging us or the environment, we should.</p></div>		</li>
