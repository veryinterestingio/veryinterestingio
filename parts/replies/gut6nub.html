			<div class="markdown"><p>No.  The simplifications here are crossing between genes and chromosomes.</p>
<p>You don't pass genes down to your children.  You pass chromosomes, or whole libraries of genes. And there are only 23 pairs to choose from.</p>
<p>It is even possible, although statistically extremely unlikely, that you could have a grandchild that is 100% genetically unrelated to you (discounting mitochondria)</p>
<p>But even just considering the average cases (ignoring mitochondria, the y chromosome, and distant cousin marriages):</p>
<p>Gen 0 (you) - 46 chromosomes </p>
<p>Gen 1 - 23 chromosomes</p>
<p>Gen 2 - 11-12 chromosomes</p>
<p>Gen 3 - 5-6 chromosomes</p>
<p>Gen 4 - 2-3 chromosomes</p>
<p>Gen 5 - 1-2 chromosomes</p>
<p>Gen 6 - 0-1 chromosomes</p>
<p>This means that if every generation were to inherit as evenly as possible from their parents, then your great-great-great-great-grandchildren might have none of your chromosomes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the Y chromosome gets passed relatively unchanged for thousands of years down a male line (ignoring occasional mutations), mitochondrial DNA does the same, explaining how we can check your maternal and paternal lineage, but after 6 generations the rest of you is effectively gone?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, no that's just the middle of the road case, like the hump of a bell curve.</p>
<p>It's possible you're completely gone by generation 4.</p>
<p>It's also possible by Generation 8 that there are 3 of your chromosomes going strong.</p>
<p>But you also have to consider the spread.</p>
<p>By generation 6, on average there is ~1 chromosome of you, but assuming no generational die-offs and average child bearing rates, there are 64+ members of that generation with ~1 chromosome of you.  And sooner or later distant cousins marry, which means you could find yourself finding more of yourself in a distant descendant.</p></div>		</li>
