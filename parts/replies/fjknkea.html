			<div class="markdown"><p>David parker ray aka the toy box killer probably did this. He allegedly hypnotized his victims to forget everything he put them through, and it seemed to have worked. They found one of his victims alive and well and she didnt remember anything until police contacted her about a video with her in it. Fuckin freaky.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC, Carl Sagan's book Candle in the dark explained how bad hypnosis is. I read it last year so my memory is iffy. Hypnosis is a pseudoscience that has been proven to create false memories.</p>
<p>You go into a dreamlike state, essentially sleep paralysis, and &quot;dream&quot; the event. Because you're not in a deep sleep cycle your brain believes the event is 100% genuine. The memory is so vivid and life like you believe it actually happened. Carl talks about a therapist who used hypnosis on a patient, finding out the father had raped the patient. Years later, after being in prison for awhile, the patient realized it was a false memory and managed to get her father out of prison.</p>
<p>Hypnosis works in the since that you're hypnotized (asleep) but you can be easily led to create a false memory. Other research has proven these hypnosis events can be harmful to ones therapeutic progression has you continue to mix false and true memories.</p>
<p>Edit: Also, Sagan explains that people who use hypnosis are typically more open or susceptible to other pseudosciences, such as religion, essential oils, psychics, tarot cards, crystals etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've found that tarot cards can be useful even without any belief in the supernatural in that they may lead you to examine a question from an unfamiliar POV. Basically, trying to apply the meanings of random cards to your question can sometimes make you think about it in a new way.</p>
<p>Of course, this doesn't involve any sprits, magic, or other esoteric forces. It's just a way of tricking your mind into approaching things from a different angle. Sometimes that may lead to good results, other times it won't. However, anyone who claims that there's some kind of mystical force at work in the cards is clearly full of shit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>according to some sources Ouija boards were originally sold as a way to talk to your subconscious, rather than asking &quot;the spirits&quot; questions you would ask yourself and it was just another way of thinking about the question using an external object to force yourself to think differently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As long as there's no pseudoscience or deception involved, there's nothing wrong with that. Like the difference between a magician, where everyone knows it's a trick and is in it for the fun/experience, and a shitbag psychic who tries to convince people they have a supernatural ability.</p></div>		</li>
