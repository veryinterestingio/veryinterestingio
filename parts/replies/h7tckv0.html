			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question: Does this mean that if we build a dyson sphere around the sun, but leave the areas in line with the orbit of the planets &quot;open&quot;, then effectively this would not alter the temperature or net energy received from the sun in any appreciable way? Or would there be any sort of downside to this kind of approach?</p></div>		</li>
