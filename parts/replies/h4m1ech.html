			<div class="markdown"><p>Would the answer be different if you bored to the center and stoped, vs a through hole?</p>
<p>I suspect that it would not - either the “rock” would support the weight of the column of air, or the opposing column of air would, resulting in the same pressure. (I’m ignoring geological things like molten layers and temperature differences etc)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Isn't Jupiter made entirely out of gas? Is what you described the same for Jupiter?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Just FYI, at no point in Jupiter's interior do we expect to find solid hydrogen, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/2DKAzNI.jpg" target="_blank">metallic or otherwise</a>. The pressure is certainly there, but it's simply too warm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Jupiter doesn't have a &quot;rocky&quot; core, precisely. Suppose a rocky meteor hits Jupiter and it's big enough to be mostly intact. The rock fragments will sink into Jupiter's atmosphere, but the deeper is sinks the pressure and temperature increases more and more to the point where the rocks melt and dissolve into a soup of elements. It's much too hot for any sort of rock crystals to maintain cohesion so even the heaviest molecules in the rock like gold and platinum, get broken apart apart an swim about in a core of liquid hydrogen.</p></div>		</li>
