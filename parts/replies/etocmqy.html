			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically thereâ€™s no purely elastic region for polymers, as the response is always viscoelastic.  No matter the stress applied, there will always be some recovery lost, (though something like kicking a ball is going to be negligibly small)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The effects of repeating stress are called fatigue.  But even one load applied to and removed from a polymer will result in a loss of recovery.</p>
<p>The viscoelastic effect can be seen <a href="http://silver.neep.wisc.edu/~lakes/VE1.1.gif" target="_blank">here</a> where the purely elastic response is a dotted line and the viscoelastic response is represented by a solid line. Notice how the strain never returns to zero for the viscoelastic response</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This raises an interesting trade-off between stretching and pressure.  As the balloon inflates, the pressure counterintuitively goes DOWN.  Skip to 2:17 to see the higher pressure balloon empty into the larger lower pressure balloon: <a href="https://youtu.be/W12k1sTw-do" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/W12k1sTw-do</a></p>
<p>Not sure if more air leaks through the highly stretched low pressure balloon or the less stretched higher pressure balloon.</p></div>		</li>
