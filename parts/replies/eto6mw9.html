			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow. I was certainly expecting the answer to be &quot;no&quot; but I didn't expect this level of separation. Space is big.</p>
<p>I'd assume that a system of very close (or relatively close) asteroids would very quickly (again, relatively) either smash itself apart or be pulled to another body (or itself).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's because of the ubiquity of images like this.

			<div class="markdown"><p>People are just so used to being constantly surrounded by “somethingness” and don’t realise just what a strange condition that is, the little clump of matter we cling to being the exception rather than the rule.</p>
<p>It’s frankly mind-crushing to try and fully comprehend the true nature of the “not anythingness” that is the universe.</p>
<p>I like to try and imagine the amount of space between us and the other planets. Then realise there’s a whole other dimension of nothingness “above” and “below” the solar system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of the problem is how asteroid &quot;fields&quot; are depicted in TV and movies with boulders swirling around a few meters from each other.  And ships having to bob and weave between them.  As a result, the mental image most people have is hilariously wrong.</p>
<p>Standing on one asteroid in the densest part of the asteroid belt, you're unlikely to even see another asteroid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be closer to a movie depiction of an asteroid field, but the answer is no, not really.  The rings of Saturn are mostly very small particles of ice. There is some rock mixed in, but it’s mostly ice. Some chunks are the size of small mountains, but the vast majority are like sand grains or smaller.  Additionally, even though the rings have an enormous orbital circumference, they are surprisingly thin. I think the average thickness is only around ten meters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Saturn's rings are a LOT denser than the asteroid belt. The rings of Saturn have a varying thickness, but are at its thinnest point just 10 meters thick (and at its widest points about a kilometer), yet we can still see them. The average distance between rocks in this area would only be on the order of a meter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those are formed by rock and stuff being trapped in a specific zone around the planet (it has a name but I forget it) where the tidal forces of the planet rip them apart, but gravity doesn't pull them all the way down.</p>
<p>I could be wrong but I think the rings are make of extremely fine dust so they cover a wider area more evenly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nothing about tidal forces ripping them apart — Saturn has moons all over among its rings.  Likely the rings formed by a collision event of some kind, and actually will likely fully collapse into moons in maybe a few million years (not sure of that timeframe).</p>
<p>When a collision like that happens, the debris scatters into a cloud around the planet at first; over time, collisions between rocks/particles will eventually cause their orbits to even-out into a single plane.  This plane will be aligned with the planet’s equator, because the planet actually bulges out do due its spin, and this causes any orbits not aligned with its equator to precess,  virtually guaranteeing collisions with other non-equator-aligned rocks or particles sooner or later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My favorite note about how empty the asteroid belt is:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If a probe is going through the asteroid belt, it requires planning if you want pictures recognizable as an asteroid. That is, most of the space probes we've sent through the asteroid belt <em>haven't even seen</em> an asteroid.</p></div>		</li>
