			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a <em>lot</em> more trees in the northern hemisphere than in the southern hemisphere, though. Which is why <a href="https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/webdata/ccgg/trends/co2_trend_mlo.png" target="_blank">atmospheric CO2 levels fluctuate with the seasons</a>.</p>
<p>Presumably oxygen levels do the same? The variance is relatively smaller because there's a lot more oxygen than CO2 in the atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The atmosphere weighs about 100 times more than the entire biosphere. This is enough of a buffer to keep the oxygen levels more or less constant throughout the year. The yearly variation is about <a href="http://scrippso2.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">100 per million O2 molecules</a>. Fun fact, by burning fossil fuels, humanity has managed to remove about 0.1% of the atmosphere oxygen over the last 30 years.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I believe you because that'd be such a weird thing to make but I can not wrap my head around it. Just, the sheer volume that the atmosphere must be in order for that to be true. I literally can't picture it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>there is a measurable fluctuation due to there being more landmass on the northern hemisphere, so both oxygen and CO2 concentration changes can be measured to correspond with seasons. though, the changes are so small they are on the scale of parts per million. </p></div>		</li>
