			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, It does. Here in Brasil on rural areas (please don't picture african Savana and extreme poverty, I'm talking highly mechanized big farms and no not in Amazon rainforest... I live as south as it gets and we have this problem too) back to topic ...I don't know if this species of warthog was native here... We had wild pigs ... But those ... Well they breed like rabbits, walk around in herds wrecking havoc in farms, destroying crops, they are omnivorous eat little sheep and cattle too...  And the males can pass 1000 pounds and they have a skin thick as hell.So evolution played the major role for sure, they also breed with normal pigs creating an hybrid wich oftentimes are raised by the farmers and those lack the thicker skin. Sorry for the horenduous writing   Android app dont let me see the message as I write</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really? Huh. I used to walk around barefoot outdoors a lot as a kid and never knew there was such a thing. I hear that in Australia and NZ, a lot of people go outdoors barefoot frequently (you'd think Aussies would be more careful with all the bitey things, but anyway).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only one I know about that has to burrow through the skin is necator americanus.  I imagine being barefoot all the time can relate to it, but if you're outside barefoot all the time chances are your hands are also in the soil laboring.  Plus sanitation is always key, since like many parasitic worms their eggs are passed in the excrement.</p>
<p>Thanks to Jimmy Carter the guinea worm is nearly extinct, but that one you ingest and it'll end up with a very painful blister on or near your foot so she can lay eggs in water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look up &quot;jiggers&quot; on YouTube. They are a flea native to South America that were brought to Africa where they have a big problem now. They burrow into the skin, usually feet but are opportunistic and will go anywhere if given the chance, and feed off the person's blood while laying an egg sack that can grow to a cm in diameter. It also makes the person hydrophobic to discourage them from washing and make an enzyme that thickens the skin giving it protection. The best way to get the out really is cutting open the top of the lesion and pulling out the egg sack. It can cause major disfigurement and apparently smells really bad too.</p></div>		</li>
