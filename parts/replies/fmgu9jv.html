			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it depends when in a sleep cycle they wake or are awoken.</p>
<p>Most people’s sleep cycles go for about 90 mins. The kids that are ‘allowed’ to sleep for as long as they want often do sleep for this length of time, and then awake refreshed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, at our centre, we have many parents who ask us to restrict their child’s daytime sleep to an hour, 40 mins or even just half an hour. This is terrible and I hate it. These kids wake up groggy, confused and upset. Of course they do! Anyone does who is awoken mid- sleep cycle!</p>
<p>I think adults often are woken up mid-sleep cycle by their alarm because they have to get up at a certain time. If you are able to wake up naturally when you are ready, then you will feel much better.</p>
<p>Having said this though, I think you can train yourself to wake up at anytime without wanting to punch someone. Just become the primary caregiver to an infant! </p>
<p>You’ll be woken up at all hours and you just have to deal with it. Even now, three years after my kids wake up at night, I can still awaken quickly and be able to function without becoming a monster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely right. I'm glad most of the schools where I've worked allow for a gradual wake up time. Lights go on a dim mode, snack is laid out, and gradually little people sit up, yawn, stretch, and have some popcorn &amp; juice. I don't have any children yet, but I will petty automatically wake up between 5 and 6 to take out my dog. I know they can hold it through the night, but I just don't like making her wait if I don't have to. We both go right back to sleep after, but I feel like I'm doing her a small kindness. She's a big dog and drinks a looooot of water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds nice, and much better for the children, to have a gradual wake up. I wish we could do that, but unfortunately we have to concede to the parents wishes and wake the child after a certain time. As you can imagine, insufficient sleep in a three year old is not pretty, and makes for an unhappy afternoon for everyone:(</p></div>		</li>

<p>Even on child free weekends and without alarm, I wake up to a world that is shaking, I feel sick and confused, my head hurts and I cannot fathom for the life of me why I'm awake.
This happens no matter the amount of sleep I've enjoyed.</p>
<p>Fucking hate waking up</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like dehydration to me. If I don't drink enough non alcoholic fluids during the day, I wake up groggy, tired, grumpy and meh. If I drink enough (not just water, mine is a mix of water, coffee and soft drinks) I am fine.</p></div>		</li>
