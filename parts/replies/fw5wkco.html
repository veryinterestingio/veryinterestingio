			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm the same and I've managed to negotiate not working before 10am my entire career (I'm 45 now). Business owners and managers never mind because I work my ass off and get results (other coworkers always try to get me in terrible for &quot;being late&quot; every day, no matter how many times it's explained I work 10-7 or later). </p>
<p>Being on my natural later schedule, I'm better rested with less sleep time and I don't need an alarm clock wake up every day.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: not saying it's the same for you, but anybody with similar issues should try it. I know because I was the same way.</p></div>		</li>
