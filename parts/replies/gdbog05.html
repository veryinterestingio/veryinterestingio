			<div class="markdown"><p>There are probably a lot of caveats but probably several hundred million USD at this point. It would depend on how much would be salvageable of the current structure. I was part of various early discussions that led up to the proposed concept of the <a href="https://baas.aas.org/pub/2020n7i255/release/1" target="_blank">DSA-2000</a>, an array of 2000 small dishes each with a diameter of 5 meters. We were trying to understand how observations of many more pulsars than currently are done could be accomplished in the future, taking into account what is needed for the science, what is needed for the engineering, and what is the most cost-effective method. We determined that a new facility that had pretty much the sensitivity of Arecibo was important going forward - note that the idea was to have this new facility <em>with</em> Arecibo still running as well. It turns out that to get something with the same sensitivity as Arecibo, building a lot of small dishes is cheaper at this point than one large dish, and the cost of that concept is $100M. Other ideas, such as single large dish, a set of cylinders like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Hydrogen_Intensity_Mapping_Experiment" target="_blank">CHIME</a>, etc., were way more expensive. - Michael L</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but can they be used as RADAR? We got direct radar data from Jupiter using the Arecibo dish. Can these smaller dishes achieve the same thing? This is really useful for tracking NEOs and getting accurate telemetry on them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, absolutely not. Arecibo's radar system is one-of-a-kind and as important as I think all of the other science is (including my own), my belief is that this is basically the most important loss, and one that a lot of citizens should care about. As you said, tracking NEOs is important, and everyone should care from a national/planetary defense standpoint. - Michael L</p></div>		</li>

<p>The site has a seemingly has a natural space for a similar scope. Could a new one with modern technology take the site or has technology moved on and it would be redundant?</p></div>		</li>
