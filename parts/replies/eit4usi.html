			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, just the process of transplantation is hard on an organ. Damage from one transplantation would pretty much make it a poor organ for transplant a second time. So, say if someone who got a kidney then a month later was killed in a car accident, no one is going to want transplant that kidney again even though it wasn't rejected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quite the contrary; living donors and living donor recipients are not good candidates <em>at all</em> for future donations.</p>
<p>A common misconception with &quot;liver regeneration&quot; is that livers grow back just the way they were after damage, as if you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between an &quot;original&quot; and &quot;regenerated&quot; liver.</p>
<p>The reality is that the regeneration process is flawed. It doesn't grow back the way it was before. Rather, other parts grow in size to fill the functional and physical void, and the donated lobe enlarges tremendously in an effort to mimic the function of a full liver. There's plenty of scar tissue generated in the process, and you (ideally) end up with both people in a state of liver function that's well within acceptable bounds for day-to-day life but still far removed from a pristine, healthy liver.</p>
<p>It's pretty cool that our livers can recover function in this way, but we have to keep in mind that it's severely limited. If you tried to donate another lobe from a prior living donor, you'd have substantially lower success in the viability (scar tissue, past morphological compensations) and substantially higher chance of complications and death in the donor. If you tried to donate from a prior recipient, you'd really be dealing with a partial (enlarged) lobe and would very likely kill both the donor and the recipient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I do heart transplant and if this happens (immediate rejection- it would happen in the OR, very rare and I’ve only seen it once) they go to the VERY top as you’re now dependent on a bypass pump for circulation and that’s about an 8-10 hour max. There are some cases of this ending up with a whole new organ that fast but in heart transplant generally we put a total artificial heart in you (syncardia) and let you recover, again at the top of the list, until you get the right organ</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have there ever been cases of individuals who just couldn't accept donated organs? Like let's say they put in a donated heart, and it's immediately rejected. They put in a second one, and it's immediately rejected as well. Has something like that ever occurred? Someone who for whatever reason just couldn't seem to take transplanted organs?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why only 8-10 hours on a bypass machine? Stress?</p>
<p>Why not stick with the artificial heart?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Somewhere in between. Sometimes a rejection is chronic and takes years. In that case, you take immunosuppressants and try to make the organ last as long as possible, then have it removed. Once you're within a couple years of needing a new transplant, you go back on the list and hopefully move near the top by the time the first transplant fails. Second is an acute rejection. That's when your immune system decides to just nuke the organ. At that point, you need it out fast and you get put back on the donor list based on how much danger your life is in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The bone marrow transplant cells always attack the recipient.  2 days after transplant, recipient undergoes another 2 days of chemo to suppress donor cells, then recipient immediately begins taking 3 different anti-graft vs host disease medications.  After 35 days they drop down to 1 medication taken multiple times a day.  About 10% of recipients die in first 100 days after transplant, from “complications”.  Transplant is the only chance to be cured, even if only temporary before some other cancer develops as a side effect from chemo.  </p>
<p>Given how transplants are portrayed in the movies, I’m shocked at witnessing /supporting the actual process.  6 months house bound except cancer center visits because one sneeze from measles kid would kill recipient.  Children under 12 are not allowed in the cancer centers other than 1 waiting room because they are deadly risks to most of the people there.  In 2 years her immune system will be strong enough to slowly try and survive being revaccinated to the stuff we all got as kids.</p></div>		</li>
