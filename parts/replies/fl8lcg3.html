			<div class="markdown"><p>flash bulb memories are those which have an intense emotional connection and are much stronger, including traumatic memories. It‚Äôs why so many people remember where they were on 9/11. In fact, most traumatic memories are stronger. current research mostly suggests that the freudian defense mechanism where your brain ‚Äúdeletes‚Äù memories of trauma later doesn‚Äôt really happen, but is more likely they weren‚Äôt encoded in the first place for whatever reason. Also stay far the fuck away from ‚Äúmemory recovery hypnosis therapy,‚Äù since there‚Äôs little research to suggest hypnosis recovers repressed memories, but it DOES help you to create false ones. A lot of people went to jail for false memories recovered under hypnosis in the 80s. </p>
<p>(another thing to add is that even if you had repressed memories, recovering them won‚Äôt help you, but studies show that remembering forgotten trauma will only make patients more depressed)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Flashbulb memories arent real. The only special thing about them is that YOU beleive you remember everything clearly. Look up studies regarding 9/11 memories. </p>
<p>You are, however, correct to an extent regarding the memories not being encoded. Your brain doesn't repress memories. If anything, you've simply forgotten. Which is an issue of failing to re-encode the memory after retrieval. </p>
<p>To ELI5: imagine memory as a filling cabinet. Your brain is a guy who has access to the cabinet, who I like to call Phil. Phil can take files (memories) out of the cabinet (retrieval or remembering something) he can then put it back in the cabinet (re-encoding). However, he could also shred the file (forgetting or what some people might mistakenly call repressing). After the file is shredded, you cannot recover it, but you can Generate false memories (lots of fun studies to read here). Phil can also edit the file. He can change words, or even delete whole entrance and add new ones. Then he puts it back. Every memory can be edited, and is edited a little when you retrieve it. Even so called &quot;flashbulb&quot; memories.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good explanation.</p>
<p>An example is this:
As a child, my family was very close with another family. We were two girls, they were two boys about the same age. Our mothers had similar backgrounds and were close friends, so we spent a lot of time playing at each other's homes.</p>
<p>One of the boys had asthma, and just as we were leaving for vacation one year, he had a bad asthma attack and died. I remembered my mom telling us he was dead, but my memory had switched that shock to the end of the vacation (which is when I actually processed the fact that he was gone and I would never see him again). I believed, my entire adult life, that we had returned from vacation to learn that my friend had died, and that we missed his funeral.</p>
<p>The mother was a Quaker. The son's funeral was held in a Quaker meeting hall. That funeral was the only time I had ever been to a Quaker meeting. As an adult, I remembered the general context of the meeting and if the topic of Quakers came up, I could describe how a meeting took place and what the inside of the hall looked like.</p>
<p>A few weeks after the death, the family picked up stakes and moved abruptly across the country.</p>
<p>We lost touch until 45 years later. We reconnected on Facebook and, while RVing around the country, I visited the mother (now in her 80s) and the surviving brother who still lived nearby. While we were there, the mother started going over her memories surrounding the other son's death. </p>
<p>She told me that when my mom learned of the death, she postponed our vacation for a week and hardly left the bereaved mom's side until after the funeral at the Quaker meeting house.</p>
<p>At that moment, the memory that I had encoded as &quot;Quaker meeting&quot; came rushing back and I remembered snippets that people had spoken at the meeting about the boy who died. Along with that re-encoding, I remembered a few scattered scenes from the week we stayed around while the vacation was postponed. </p>
<p>It was like the website of the funeral had been meta tagged as &quot;Quaker meeting&quot; but not &quot;[son's] funeral.&quot; But once I pulled it up and realized it needed a new tag, seemingly unimportant secondary memories came along with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>nobody remember‚Äôs their life as a whole. only the things our brains have deemed important enough for us to hold onto. if you have a memory or partial memory of trauma and are hurting from that, it‚Äôs different, but remembering more about your trauma or remembering trauma you‚Äôve forgotten probably won‚Äôt make you better. Not a therapist though, I would talk with yours :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Try having a look at some of the resources for PTSD and C-PTSD. Healing can often bring things you've repressed, or haven't 'worked out', but you can take it slow and focus on understanding and chipping away at a little bit at a time. I can't speak to your personal issues, but if you have blocked out a lot of your early life/memories, and/or dealt with ongoing abuse as a child, try Pete Walker's book on C-PTSD. There are a lot of good resources out there, I'm currently working through a few books on understanding and working through/changing a lot of my 'wrong' learned behaviours and the root trauma behind it. It's hard when you can't remember a lot of it explicitly, and don't have anyone that can give you a reliable honest answer, but it's possible. I started just searching for anything on C-PTSD, found a lot of good websites and blogs, and worked from their recommendations for resources and reading lists. Good luck!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look up Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (Google ACT therapy).  Basically the idea is that you need to get over the past and just move on.  Freudian science is BS.  You are who you are and you are the only operator of your brain.  It's like what Timothy Leary taught <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nr8jqQcR8TA" target="_blank">you are the operator of your brain</a>, grow up and take control of your high.  Look you can look for a finger to point at but it is very unlikely that pointing that finger will actually bring about meaningful transformative change.  </p>
<p>The modern trend is nearly 100% unanimous on this.  Read the Power of Now if you don't believe me.  The key to success is embracing the concept of mindfulness (Google mindfulness).  Mental baggage is not real and the sooner you let it go the better off you will be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An educated comment, yay!</p>
<p>Repressed memories definitely do exist, they just can‚Äôt be ‚Äúrecovered‚Äù or ‚Äúretrieved‚Äù for the exact reason you highlighted - they were never coded into explicit memory in the first place.</p>
<p>People who become depressed after ‚Äúmemory retrieval‚Äù are depressed because a traumatic pseudo-memory was created. It‚Äôs not a recovered memory of something that actually happened, it‚Äôs trauma the brain created that comes with all the normal devastation of a real-life trauma for the actual person. The Satanic Panic is the 80s and 90s is the biggest stain on the psych community because therapists were literally harming their patients by prompting their brain into this ‚Äúfalse memory syndrome‚Äù.</p>
<p>The whole concept of repressed-then-recovered memories has been totally sensationalized and is treated as a real thing by laypeople, yet it has no basis in science whatsoever.</p>
<p>Pseudo-memories sure as fuck do, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Traumatic events may cause you just not to remember certain events because of how distracting the trauma is. Trauma can require a substantial amount of internal processing where your awareness of the outside world just isn't payed attention to. That's at least how I've come to understand it for myself. Sensory Processing Sensitivity plus ADHD.</p>
<p>I have a gap of a few months following a painful break up. I eventually married the same person 10 years later after we both matured better. But our families were very protective and against the whole idea. It worked out for the best. Trust wasn't easily regained for those that remembered the fall out.</p>
<p>I can't imagine those who have gone through worse things than a single broken relationship.</p></div>		</li>
