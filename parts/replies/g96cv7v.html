			<div class="markdown"><p>You can see that too if you look at reptile ancestors of mammals like the Synapsids (as example <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Dimetrodon_species2DB15.jpg/1920px-Dimetrodon_species2DB15.jpg" target="_blank">Dimetrodon</a>). The quadruped body plan is just the standard for mammals. Bipedal mammals are the exception.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipedalism" target="_blank">Wikipedia page on bipedalism</a> names a few examples. It's rare enough that in one famous story, Plato defined humans as &quot;featherless bipeds&quot;, inspiring Diogenes to mockingly bring him a plucked chicken (&quot;here is Plato's man!&quot;).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The obvious answer is because that is what suited it. If we're looking at reasons why mammals have four legs and dinosaurs two then there may be no clear answer. However my guess would be that dinosaurs and their ancestors were always ground dwellers and a 2 legged running and 2 arm grasping mechanic worked best, however mammals are afaik ALL descended from tree dwelling ancestors (or small rodent like animals that lived in close proximity to the forest floor (ie, not massive open ground runners)) and for trees a 4 climbing legs approach is far more advantageous than 2. When some of these 'squirrels' we moved to the ground then they adapted their 4 grasping legs into 4 running legs. And we moved back to a 2 arms/2 legs approach, but had lost the tail in the process.</p></div>		</li>
