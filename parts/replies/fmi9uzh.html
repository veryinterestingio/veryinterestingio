			<div class="markdown"><p>My question was more directed to the efficacy of a laundry cycle in rendering COVID19 inert/ineffective/gone/dead/etc. Bills can survive the wash (who hasn’t left a fiver in their pocket?), but can covid? Much of what’s been advised for hand washing has said warm/hot water, not cold. Will a cold cycle be enough?</p>
<p>My instincts say yes, but I’d rather ask the question than make the assumption and spread misinformation.</p></div>		</li>
