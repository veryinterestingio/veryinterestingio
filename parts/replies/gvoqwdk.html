			<div class="markdown"><p>To add, there are actually elements and particles for which we don't know if they have a half-life... We just know the lower bound.  I.e. if it had a half-life of less than 10^x years we'd have been able to detect it by now.</p>
<p>One of the big unanswered questions on science is whether a proton can decay.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a chart of all isotopes which creates a pretty predictable pattern in decay so its not too hard to figure out. Most really big elements spit out a stripped of electrons helium atom, isotopes with too many neutrons spit out an electron to turn a neutron into a proton, isotopes with too many protons spit out a positron to turn a proton to a neutron. <a href="https://www-nds.iaea.org/relnsd/vcharthtml/VChartHTML.html" target="_blank">https://www-nds.iaea.org/relnsd/vcharthtml/VChartHTML.html</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With a little more detail, at about a 6th grade level:</p>
<p>Getting just a gram of an element is on order of 10\^21 atoms for heavier elements. The longest half-life on an element is Bismuth-209; with a half life of about 2*10\^19 years - which indicates that, with 1g of Bismuth-209, you're getting about 50 decays/year; about 1 every 6 days.</p>
<p>The longest half-lives we can accurately measure at this point is not much longer than 10\^22 years for heavy elements, and 10\^24 for lighter elements.</p></div>		</li>
