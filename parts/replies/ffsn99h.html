<p>Like someone literally thoroughly washes them first</p>

<p>Tell that to my coworkers. If I had a dollar for every time someone washed a sauce bucket without even rinsing it first, covering every other dish washed during and after with herbs and spices...I'd be making an extra dollar per hour.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After the first chef left my job and this new one came in, his idea of making the dishes get cleaned faster was to do a quick splash of water and let the washer do the rest of the work. Were always specks and the filters were much worse. Left soon after but feel sorry for the person who had to deal with his bossy ways on something simple like washing a dish.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This drives me nuts. I'm &quot;just a waitress&quot; but when I wash dishes, they come out sparkling the first time. Why? Because I use the fucking sprayer that conveniently dangles in front of your dense fucking face.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Plus they use a ton of water and totally causitc chems you couldnt use in a home environment.</p>

<p>This is half the reason. The soaps used in commercial dishwashers could not be sold for home use. They are simply too dangerous. They act quickly and effectively. I remember seeing warning signs I cannot find by searching now saying never open it mid-cycle and touch the water, or touch the soap loaded below the unit directly. Put the container in there, hook up the plastic lines (wear gloves) and that's it.</p>
<p>Residential dishwasher detergents are sold based on &quot;cuts through grease! Easy on your hands!&quot; meanwhile, commercial detergents will dissolve your hand right off your arm.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As well as this they have large heating elements and are always on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the other half. The thing is <em>always</em> running at a temperature equivalent to the surface of Venus. There is a reason the dish racks are plastic - you need to be able to pull them out and let them cool for a few minutes, and plastic is safe to touch right away - for a few seconds.</p>
<p>Nothing survives the temperature of a commercial dishwasher. Not E Coli, not AIDS, not human skin. This is why restaurant dishes and silverware are so damn sanitary, assuming your dishwashers and line cooks didn't show up to work with The Plague.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, they should be fine even if someone came with the plague. Those things will kill that too.</p>
<p>Edit: And realizing you mean they could transfer it to dishes/food AFTER the dishes went through the dishwasher. Am moron. Pls ignore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Got a drop of the detergent on my hand once while changing the bucket. Started burning pretty quickly, got it rinsed off, and was left with a hole in my skin. Definitely way more hazardous than people realize.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That wouldn't stop my father, who has hated almost every home dishwasher he's had since environmental regulations (for example, 5 gallon toilets had to be replaced with 1.5 gallon toilets) and modern value engineering made dishwashers into flimsy pieces of shit.</p>
<p>He also doesn't make an effort to scrape the crud before putting stuff in the dishwasher though, so that could be screwing things up for him.</p></div>		</li>
