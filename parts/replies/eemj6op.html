			<div class="markdown"><p>...and allowing for a total solar eclipse to occur.</p>
<p>This is a purely amazing coincidence that will only occur on Earth for another few millions years, as the Moon is gradually getting farther from the Earth, so get out there quick and watch any total solar eclipse you can see while you can...!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should anyway, total solar eclipses are amazing.  But, in a cosmic timescale, a few million years is pretty insignificant.  In comparison to a human timescale, it would be just a few minutes of your entire life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep.  Eclipse shades are very important.
Always buy properly approved glasses too that conform to the various standards.  Some people sell cheap badly made glasses that won't protect your eyes at all.  For that eclipse across the US (Aug '17)  I remember Amazon was full of unsafe glasses, which they eventually took off the site.
One scratch on your eclipse shades, no matter how minor, and they are only fit for the bin!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iv always wondered this. This seems such a coincidence that both major heavenly bodies in our sky appear to be the same size. Makes me wonder if i was born 500 years ago whether i would have picked that the earth was round like everything else.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's been pretty common knowledge for at least a thousand years. It's been known in academia for at least two thousand years.</p></div>		</li>
