<p>There are also sometimes odd autoimmune antibodies, one was identified in patient who's blood didn't seem to blot, but she wasn't bleeding out. It was an antibody which bound to thrombin, but not prothrombin.

<p>There are also anti-malaria LAIR-1 antibodies which result in a scrambling where non-immune gene segment is accidentally put into the antibody coding sequence: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4869849/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4869849/</a></p>
<p>There are doubtless other super-powers from strange antibody rearrangements that haven't been documented as they are too niche!</p></div>		</li>
