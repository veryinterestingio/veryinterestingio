			<div class="markdown"><p>To the point where a lot of albums were ruined by its music being so loud that it sounded distorted and it lost a lot of its dynamics.
Metallica's Death Magnetic was that way... it sounded really bad, and made worse because Guitar Hero had versions of some of the songs that weren't the same as the album versions.  The album versions were almost literally two times louder than the Guitar Hero versions... and I'd have to guess they sounded much better as a result <strong>if</strong> they didn't just crank down the volume from the album version because they'd have had the same loss of dynamics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>video is a bit shitty tbh, in that it is changing masters on tune switch instead comparing same melody on both<br />
there are stretches of repeating melody where it should be cut in half so you can hear same tune in both versions</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has gotten to the point where I'm used to songs that really make my stereo speakers bump and the car rumble like this mix:   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMjqGl3UDCk" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMjqGl3UDCk" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMjqGl3UDCk</a></a> </p>
<p>...and it's hard to listen to some of my old favorites which just sound weak and loaded with too much mid range, but are still great songs:    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReuWlABb8FQ" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReuWlABb8FQ" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReuWlABb8FQ</a></a></p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't know much about history, but, in digital sound, there is a fixed amount of maximum loudness in any song. E.g. In 16bit audio, there would be 65535 levels. When you adjust volume, you define what that 65535 is.</p>
<p>In a song, different instruments and vocals will be in different loudness levels. So you set the recording level so that the loudest part of the song doesn't crackle. That would mean most other stuff would be at a lower volume than max possible.</p>
<p>e.g. if drums are the loudest instrument, then it would have the loudness of 65535. That would mean vocals maybe 30000 or something.</p>
<p>Over time, songs evolved to make use of the levels and instruments so that loud parts composed more of the song. So the average loudness of the song can be different according to amount of different instruments etc.</p>
<p>And some songs might not even use the max possible volume, that would be quite than other songs.</p>
<p>To better understand, look at any song in audacity. You can clearly see different loudnesses and max loudness.</p>
<p>EDIT: bad math</p></div>		</li>

<p>That'd be 16 bit. 2^8 = 256, 2^16 = 65536.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're missing the fact that the audio is AC. It has positive and negative peaks. Zero sound level is in the middle of the 65,536 steps. So a silent passage is at 32,768. the largest possible sound goes between zero and 65535. In any case, that only describes the amplitude of the sound voltage representation. Loudness varies by frequency and other factors.</p></div>		</li>

<p>8-bit audio only has 256 levels. 16-bit audio, which is what CD audio uses, has 65,536 levels.</p></div>		</li>
