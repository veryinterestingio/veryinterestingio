			<div class="markdown"><p>The stock grows in value faster than the amount of interest. You have 5 million with of stock, take out a loan for 1 million at 4%, a year from now you owe 1.04 million. But your stock is worth 5.4 million now. You can take out a loan for 1.04 million to pay off the first loan, and it's less of a percentage of your total net worth. In fact you can take a loan for even more each year.</p>
<p>You don't actually literally have to take a new loan out each time, the banks will just give you more money, keeping track of how much you're stock is worth and how much interest you owe. If the stock it's worth enough, you can literally just take out hundreds of thousands of dollars every year without selling any stock or paying taxes on it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you can borrow against your stock without selling it.   But, from there, your numbers don't work.</p>
<p>What happens after 4 years?  Now, you've paid 20% in interest, and you still have to pay back the $50.  To do that, you have to sell the stock, and pay 20% in capital gains.  Great -- you've paid 40%, when you could have only paid 20%.</p>
<p>There are two reasons why it makes sense to borrow instead of sell stock.  Most importantly, if your stock is making 10% per year, and you're only paying 5% in interest, then you want to hold onto the stock.   But, doing so is risky -- the market could turn, and you could lose 10%.   The second reason is that it's hard for people like Bezos to sell stock -- they have so much information about the company that any sale is likely to be &quot;insider trading.&quot;   So, their sales are highly regulated and generally have to be planned well in advance.</p>
<p>Also, individuals cannot use debt to offset personal taxes.  That hasn't been true since the early '90s.  The one exception is mortgages, and even those are subject to a limit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually really easy for an insider to sell stock, they just enter into a 10(b) 5-1 plan during an open period (has to be however far in the future, and they can't change it, they can turn it off in certain circumstances).  </p>
<p>Can be a little harder if you worry about optics, because the sales are reported.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's possible to cancel a 10(b)5-1 though. So in effect you can set one up and then decide at a later date to either follow through or cancel it, depending on how things are going. </p>
<p>It's a pretty obvious loophole, not sure if it's been closed by now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We never sell the asset. We refinance all the debt every few years during the part of the market cycle when debt is easy and cheap like right now. </p>
<p>When the cycle flips, credit markets lock up and debt becomes very expensive, and assets become cheap, but we are liquid enough from the last cycle, and we are the very best borrowers because of all the assets we already own, so we are able to buy assets when they are on sale. </p>
<p>Then, a few years later the cycle has turned again, credit markets are flowing, interest rates are dirt cheap, the market is very liquid and the assets we bought on sale are performing well and valuations are very high, we refinance as much as possible again.</p>
<p>At no point do we sell. We only accumulate. </p>
<p>Nearly anyone can do this. You don't have to be a billionaire. I started with absolutely <em>nothing.</em> I mean no thing. </p>
<p>Just get a skill that can get your household enough money to buy one crappy asset. My first was an 800 sqft 1br condo that I lived in for 10 years. Then just never ever sell it and don't buy fancy cars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where do you get the money to pay off interest, which I assume needs to be paid every month?  </p>
<p>Say you have $100m in assets and you want to buy a yacht for $7m.  You borrow against your assets and now you owe roughly $200k in interest without paying down the principal.  How do you pay the $200k annually or $17k monthly?  You don‚Äôt work a job so you have no wage income and yet we don‚Äôt sell assets so investment income also doesn‚Äôt exist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you have say $20 billion in stock, even if you borrow a billion, your stock will on average grow faster than your interest and while there is some risk of a catastrophic crash, most of the time the leverage is low enough not to matter, so borrowing more to pay the interest is very workable.  Yes, the market is risky in the short term, but tends to go in one direction in the long term, so long as they keep their borrowing limited to a relatively small share of their wealth.  When it doesn't though they can lose everything (which does happen occasionally).  </p>
<p>They're not using debt to offset personal taxes, they're using debt to let them live like a baller without having baller level incomes.</p></div>		</li>
