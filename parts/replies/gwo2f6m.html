			<div class="markdown"><p>think of it like this. elephant cancer was a significant enough threat that the only elephants we have left are the ones that developed mutations to be more resistant to cancer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that's amazing. animals have some crazy superpowers, just to occupy their niche. it's like impossible for a vulture to get food poisoning from rotten meat, or a crocodile to get a skin infection from living in a swamp</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the simplest way to define evolution.</p>
<p>Simply put, you can't have sex (and thereby pass on your genes) if you're dead. And given the fact that random mutations occur all the time, sometimes you get some that help you. And since food/resources are limited and you're in competition for them often in nature, these changes matter and can lead to the &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; as they say.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So there actually another theory that the sheer amount of cells needed for a cancer in large animals to be lethal is very hard to infect. This is because the mutated cells don’t just stop, they continue to mutate. Well if they keep mutating, then it’s likely the cancer will actually mutate and get cancer and kill itself. Quite fascinating.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The jury is still out on this one, actually.</p>
<p>It could simply be that the large body doesn't get damaged that much by cancer.</p>
<p>Think about it. If a whale develops cancer even the size of <em>a car</em>. It's just not a lot compared to the whole whale. And the cancers themselves can get cancer. Or die for other reasons.</p>
<p>It also might take such a long time from them to die from cancer, they die of old age before that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is also worth giving an honorable mention at this point to the <a href="https://youtu.be/1AElONvi9WQ" target="_blank">hypertumor theory</a>. </p>
<p>Basically the idea (not exactly proven yet) that very large animals like whales can survive tumors long enough that the tumor itself develops a (hyper)tumor, which in turn kills the original tumor, saving the animal. </p>
<p>So far not totally substantiated but a mind blowing theory nonetheless.</p></div>		</li>
