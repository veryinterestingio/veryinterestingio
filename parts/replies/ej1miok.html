			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. The two main competing needs are Vitamin D production and folic acid synthesis. Too little sunlight penetration prevents vitamin D synthesis and leads to vitamin D deficiency, which leads to bone deformations. On the other hand too much can negatively effect folic acid synthesis, and folate deficiency in women can lead to birth defects. </p>
<p>More melanin protects the folic acid synthesis pathways, but blocks the vitamin D ones, while less does the opposite. The two pressures balance each other out to get various skin tones depending on how much sun exposure a particular place gets.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>/u/PersnicketyFigment is referring to the evolutionary 'Vitamin D–Folate Hypothesis.'  It is one of a few different theories but there is some good evidence for it.  Here is a good paper discussing the topic:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh this is personally interesting.  I'm 70% Scandinavian and on methotrexate, which depletes folic acid and it's required for red blood cell synthesis.  My red blood cell count often drops below normal despite supplementing with folic acid and was prescribed leucovorin to try to win that battle (of course, my insurance will not cover it).  And also, of course, I'm on 2000 ui Vit D for Vit D deficiency and maybe it's a coincidence but my last RBC was finally above normal and guess who was lax with taking the Vit D?    </p>

<p>I'm almost certain that humans can't synthesize folate. Can you clarify?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd follow that up with probably everyone who doesnt both live in a sunny part or the world and get daily direct sun exposure should take vit d3. I live in Australia and a blood test showed I was deficient in the summer. </p>
<p>I always see things about vit d defiency causing bone issues. But people rarely mention it can also decrease tesoterone levels, which is obviously important for men especially. </p></div>		</li>
