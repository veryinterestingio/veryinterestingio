			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer is we don't really know.</p>
<p>Some people react differently to NSAIDs even though they all essentially do the same thing (aside from Aspirin being a blood thinner and Celecoxib (Celebrex) only working on COX-2 (basically protecting the stomach).  So Ibuprofen might not work for you, but other NSAIDs such as Aspirin or Naproxen might.</p>
<p>Acetaminophen isn't an NSAID (therefore it will not reduce inflammation) and we don't know the exact mechanism as to how it works.  It's thought to reduce the the production of prostaglandins (lipids that mediate pain, swelling, etc) in the brain but we're still not sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It surprised me to see all the people acting like they had the answer when this is the correct one: we don't actually know it's mechanism of action. Kudos to you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But we do know that acetaminophen is centrally acting whereas others have a systemic effect, so it’s not like the headache benefits of Tylenol are a total mystery</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, we know that it’s safe through clinical trials, just not it’s mechanism of action. There are plenty of drugs  for which we don’t know the mechanism of action, but they drop billions of dollars on extensive and thorough trials that are conducted over the course of a decade or more to make sure humans won’t be hurt by it. We know WHAT it does, just maybe not how it does it.</p>
<p>Tylenol isn’t really “safe” to begin with, depending on your definition. It can destroy your liver if you use it incorrectly or if you drink a lot of alcohol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let me ask you something. Do you know why gravity works? Well you don't have to know why it works to understand that dropping a book on your foot hurts. Similar thing, we know the chemical makeup, the effect it has, but not entirely why it works. It is &quot;safe&quot; because the FDA testing regulations say it is. The human body is an incredibly complex and intertwined group of systems. Only through trial and error, and lab and clinical testing are we able to attempt to understand it, and many things we don't understand completely. </p>
<p>Personally, the more I learn about things, the more I understand that everything isn't an exact science, including science itself, and even the top experts don't know everything. There's a reason doctors can require multiple tests to find problems, it's not always this+this=that. It's usually this+this most likely=that but idk for sure.</p>
<p>There are many professions where it isn't understood why certain things work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't fully know how bodies work. We have a very good idea of most biological processes, but we don't understand most things 100%. This isn't because scientists are dumb, it's because bodies are incredibly complex with lots of interactions between different things. Most of the time when you hear we don't know how a drug works we have a good idea about it, just not a complete picture.</p></div>		</li>

<p>From what I can tell, this is the leading theory. But Big Pharma seems reluctant to admit that a medicine marketed to toddlers acts in a vaguely similar way to marijuana.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ibuprofen acts on two enzymes (COX-1 and COX-2) works on COX that directly inhibit the production of inflammatory chemicals called prostaglandins. However, acetaminophen only works in the nervous system to do much of the same thing. As such, acetaminophen works more in the brain to reduce pain and fever where Ibuprofen works throughout the body.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I was gonna say, I'm the exact opposite, only Ibuprofen works for me for the most part. Naproxem Sodium also works but I rarely ever take it unless it's the only thing available. Acetaminophen has never worked for me for headache relief at least. I think it comes down to what your body reacts to and the cause of the pain</p></div>		</li>
