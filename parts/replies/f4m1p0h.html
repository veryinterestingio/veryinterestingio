			<div class="markdown"><p>Fire consumes oxygen while it burns. A room that's on fire is almost completely without oxygen. Sometimes, oxygen becomes the limiting reagent, where there's plenty of stuff that's hot enough to light on fire, but can't find the oxygen to make that happen. So, things don't burn completely. The smoke still has flammable material in it, the fires are hot and low. But it's all hot enough that the second oxygen hits, that fire is going to pick up and blaze through all the smoke and fuel as fast as the oxygen comes in.</p>
<p>They call that a 'backdraft'. You open the door, all of that hot air comes rushing out the roof, hot enough to spontaneously combust anything it touches, like a sheet of flame overhead. Air rushes in along the ground, and any flame it touches leaps and grows, billowing up. </p>
<p>It's bad.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>A lot of things that tend to be burning are wood or woodlike. Wood, when heated in the absence of oxygen becomes charcoal and gives off liquid tar and what is known as &quot;producer gas&quot; or &quot;wood gas&quot; which has several components, the main one of interest is hydrogen.</p>
<p>The exact composition depends on the conditions, but the result is the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's when a bunch of oxygen enters a room on fire that's been starved of oxygen. Makes quite the fireball. If they just put a small hole in a door, they know what they're dealing with before breaking open the entire door and creating an explosion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We really dont put holes in the door. You cant un-hole a door. We pray the door open, by jamming the forks of the halligan between the door and the frame, by stiking it with the flat side of a flat head axe (a halligan and axe is a &quot;set of irons&quot; or just &quot;irons&quot;) and then the 90 degree angle of the halligan allows us to.hook the door tight after it's been opened and pull it to, to maintain control of it and limit airflow.</p>
<p>At least, that's plan A</p>
<p>Well, really plan B.</p>
<p>Plan A is use the door knob. We have a saying. &quot;Try before you pry&quot;</p></div>		</li>
