<p>I've just moved house across the country, it's been baffling me why my soap feels strange! I bought a new bar with me but it's exactly the same I had in the old place, even from the same batch, I thought something weird had happened in storage (I got given a stack of &gt;15 year old bars of soap from someone offloading old stock they found that I'm slowly working my way through, so not unreasonable they could go funny even if I didn't think soap could go off).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We just bought a new house and it was our first experience with a water softener. I thought I wasn't getting clean in the shower. Took a while to get used to!</p>
<p>I am perplexed at why my humidifier gets the pink/orange bacterial residue so quickly, though. I was under the impression the softener would prevent more of that bacteria from forming.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I doubt the softener would have much impact on bacterial growth — it just exchanges calcium and magnesium for sodium or potassium. Bacteria can flourish in any of those, i imagine.</p></div>		</li>
