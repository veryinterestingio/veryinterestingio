			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm forever upset at the doctor who treated my dad. In The Netherlands it's common to treat patients and/or clients as idiots, as everyone just blindly trusts anyone with a master's diploma.</p>
<p>My dad was going to die of &quot;stomach cancer&quot; and the doctor refused to even give him a (latin) name of the exact form of cancer. &quot;It's just cancer&quot;. I'd be dead ass terrified being taken care of by someone like that. It's not like my dad had a pill for specific forms and whatnot, but he wanted to simply be informed. But hey, it's the culture. I hate it.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here’s a quote from Wikipedia: “The most common cause is infection by the bacterium Helicobacter pylori, which accounts for more than 60% of cases. About 10% of cases run in families, and between 1% and 3% of cases are due to genetic syndromes inherited from a person's parents such as hereditary diffuse gastric cancer.”</p>
<p>So if your doctor didn’t care enough to give your  father a single sentence describing his condition that he could have easily researched using Wikipedia or WebMD, he was indeed incompetent. Just a “In your case the stomach cancer appears to be due to an infection by H. pylori” or “It’s not the usual H. pylori. Go home and ask your extended family if there are any other cases; if you find a couple, it’s probably a genetic disorder science hasn’t discovered and named yet.”</p>
<p>Cancers can be classified as adenocarcinoma, lymphoma... Even “I’m so sorry, but we don’t have a name for this particular type because they’re so rare. You can tell it’s not the typical adenocarcinoma because it’s got the lumpy edges right here, see?” would have been useful.</p>
<p>That’s it. Just a pointer in the right direction when the patient asked for information would have been incredibly comforting, right? (And might have given the rest of the family a heads-up that they need to monitor a genetic propensity to stomach cancer.)</p>
<p>Or if the doctor had showed you, “See how the tumor is 6 cm wide in this CT scan and it’s spread along the inner surface of the stomach? It’s very distinct from the surrounding tissue, yes? That means it’s a very aggressive tumor and we need to start chemotherapy as soon as possible.” (Medical details made up because I am not a doctor, but any oncologist with a shred of bedside manner SHOULD be describing what they’re seeing in scan results, especially if they’ve just given someone a fatal diagnosis, or they SUCK.)</p>
<p>I’m sorry for all the “What are you talking about? Doctors are unimpeachable and always communicate everything they know clearly, it’s just our bodies are so ~mysterious~ and ~unstudied~” crowd.</p>
<p>Anyone in that crowd, you’ll notice that this commenter never said the doctor apologized that science doesn’t have a good grasp on his father’s condition yet. They said the doctor flat-out refused to give him any further information other than “It’s cancer, why are you still in my office asking me stupid questions?” I’d be furious too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am sorry to say this, but there is a high chance that the doctor didn't have a specific name for it. They're at the most an encyclopedia of when they were trained in medicine. Knowledge will always be behind current science.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. Doctors here don't give patients enough information. I can understand that if they are investigating and they don't know yet, but in place of being specific about the stages of the investigation, or just giving the information that is required, they very often treat people like you described.
Some years ago my bf stayed almost a month in a hospital and had to undergo a lung surgery. If I ever saw a doctor it was never the same person, they never said a thing, some nurses were unnecessarily rude... My bf was very ill and the way those people treat patients and visitors is plainly rude.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Sequencing shows us that cancers are not diseases of organs. Phrases like &quot;breast cancer&quot; or &quot;Liver cancer&quot; don't make sense anymore. Visualization tools like <a href="https://treehousegenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/tumormap/" target="_blank">Tumor Map</a> instantly show similarities of mutation between cancers in different organs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mutations of similar genes in different organs produce different cancers with different histologic grades, different treatments and different prognoses. For example, p53 mutations have been implicated in premalignant lesions such as breast DCIS and colorectal adenomas as well highly aggressive tumors such as DLBCL (high grade lymphoma). No one defines a cancer as a “p53 cancer” and treats it with that information alone. Further, most of our knowledge of how to treat as well as prognosis is based on the organ of origin - not the type of mutation alone. Of course, some treatment plans and clinical prognosis can be further stratified based on mutational status, such as hormone markers in breast cancer or p16/HPV status in head and neck SCC.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially yes, but the common root cause is still a mutation. So a holy grail of a solution that we're looking for is detecting what mutated, and revert that mutation</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's less likely that we will see more oncology specializations for different cancer types arise as it is likely that we will see more sensitive, higher resolution diagnostic tools and treatments develop for current specializations. Biomedical researchers and cancer pathologists will work closely with clinical oncologists to test patient's tumors, deduce the specific presentation, and decide the best treatment going forward. This is already standard practice to some extent, but I see cancer treatment adopting a team-based model with heavy integration of high-throughput technologies to quickly diagnose and treat cancers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When a cancer &quot;stages&quot;, it may mean it's evolved into a new organism.</p>
<p>The oversimplified version I heard:</p>
<p>First is a random break in a single cell's division mechanism, stuck on.  If nothing else happens, in about 50 divisions (minus all the divisions the original broken cell had gone through since conception) the ultimate descendant cells hit the preprogrammed Hayflick Limit- these decendant cells become &quot;old&quot;, don't reproduce well at all after that, and don't thrive.  They would die off eventually.</p>
<p>But, one of those cells (there are MANY, if it starts with 2\^30 divisions left, that's a billion cells in the final generation) may randomly create a mutation that breaks the Hayflick limit, they have no limit on how many times they can divide, and still divide all the time.  But, they still can't do much except make one big static lump as they multiply continuously without any limit, one that may be outgrowing its blood supply and thus starving its bloated mass.  </p>
<p>The third blow is when one of these endless cells mutates the right way and discovers how to request new blood vessels from the body- angiogenesis.  Now it can metastasize- cells that leak into the lymph nodes and blood act as seeds that can grow elsewhere.</p>
<p>So, if the tumor promotes itself, it evolves into a new disease each time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, not all cancers involve genetic mutations in genes. Some of them are the result of mutations in (non-coding) regulatory areas of gene. The result is abnormal levels of certain proteins that lead to the cancer state.</p></div>		</li>
