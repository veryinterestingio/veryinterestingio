			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://insitome.libsyn.com/tibetan-denisovans" target="_blank">A recent episode</a> of the Insight podcast on genetics discusses how variation among Denisovans far exceeded variation between modern humans and Neanderthals. Denisovans probably represent a vast and diverse group that will change our understanding of Homo diversity.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I recently found out about this group. The only hominids I know are erectus, habilis, neanderthalis and sapien.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Currently reading this, glad someone mentioned it in this thread!  It's extremely interesting, and I'm only on chapter 3. The hybridization of humanity is fascinating. I discovered I have &quot;above average&quot; amount of neanderthal DNA through 23 and me, which is super cool imo.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The hominids include all great apes, so I suspect you know more already.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is some different distribution of hominid DNA across racial lines though. For instance, Subsaharan Africans are (iirc) the only homo sapiens group with no neanderthal intermixture. Meanwhile itâ€™s comparably high among Europeans and certain Asian populations.</p></div>		</li>
