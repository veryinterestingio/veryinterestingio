			<div class="markdown"><p>One point of confusion here. Purple doesn't have a wavelength, as in the color purple isn't in the light spectrum. It's a combination of the two sides of the visible spectrum (red and violet). So does this have to do with how the &quot;red&quot; part of that combination is affected? </p>
<p>Or perhaps we're meaning two different things by purple.</p>
<p>Edit: Or maybe with the glasses you're seeing the &quot;same&quot; purple that optypical people see? As in all of our brains give us an imitated sense of seeing purple - it has no wavelength.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes you make a good point. I glossed over the details to keep it &quot;ELI5&quot; friendly. I think some of the other posts in the thread have addressed it in some ways.</p>
<p>Essentially though, the <strong>cones</strong> (the brain's &quot;colour sensors&quot;) that process certain light wavelengths in our eyes don't develop or have developmental problems. So it's not possible for us to process the wavelengths properly. So you're right in saying that the red wavelength isn't being processed correctly (or at all) and so we'll only pick up portions of the wavelengths that *are* being reflected off of whatever we're looking at.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I was just watching a video about the way colorblind people see the world. It said that 1 in 10 people have some version of it. Three quarters of the way through the video there was a yellow and purple volleyball, but they said it was yellow and blue! I first thought, &quot;oh shit, I'm colorblind!&quot; NOPE, I forgot to turn off the blue light filter on my phone this morning. It turned to blue when I switched it off. It kind of made me realize what it would be like to be colorblind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the person you replied to, but I have protanomaly as well and, yes, it's basically not being able to see the red hues in purple so it just appears blue to me. Sometimes if I really stop to think about it, or look at something under a different light, I'll realise there is some red in it, but I can rarely tell the difference between blue and purple.  </p>
<p>I haven't tried the glasses so I don't know how it looks with them, but I've read a lot about how they work and it's basically by filtering out the wavelengths of light that you're less sensitive to and/or turning up the saturation of certain wavelengths of light to help distinguish between colours. So I would be more likely to tell the difference between blue and purple because the purple would look more red to me - but it wouldn't be the &quot;same&quot; purple as everyone else, because I still wouldn't be able to see all of the wavelengths of red in it, just more of the wavelengths I normally see. So it would be kind of like turning up the red saturation on a TV or PC monitor, but just to exaggerate certain bits of certain colours.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Precisely. This shit about &quot;I never realized the world was so beautiful&quot;, as if all of a sudden you can see hues you never could see before, is total BS.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's really intriguing. One question if you don't mind me asking: What does Purple look like to you without the glasses?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No worries for asking -- I think it's a fascinating subject.</p>
<p>So what I see is a colour that in my mind is either exactly the same as or so similar to the colour I would call &quot;blue&quot; that my brain has a tough time telling the difference. If I really concentrate and compare the colours around what I'm looking at, sometimes I can tell it's actually purple. Most of the time that's easy to do on a blank white surface (like on a computer screen), but in real life (movies, video games, wildlife, plants, etc) we rarely see that.</p></div>		</li>
