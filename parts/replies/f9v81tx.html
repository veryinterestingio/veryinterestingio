<p>It appears that your brain keeps tracking using sleep cycles - you wake up and your brain says alright you completed 5 cycles, so that should have been about 8 hours.</p>
<p>People that had interrupted sleep - say they did 3/4 of a cycle, woke up and then went back to sleep for another 2 - thought they had woken up like 5 minutes into their 3 hour sleep, when it was actually 1 hour into a 4 hour sleep.</p>
<p>surgical amnesia doesn't put you in proper sleep cycles, so your brain says 0 cycles, 0 time. Similar things can happen with people taking sleeping pills where their sleep clock will be short and hour or two, or if you have bad sleep apnea or similar where you never actually get all the way to REM sleep it's also difficult to keep track of time passing.</p>
<p>Nap disorientation comes from a similar effect - bright light, especially natural light, can the body from falling all the way asleep, which is why people are so often time disoriented from daytime naps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I has surgeries and I couldn't agree more on that. I remember waking up and thought &quot;the surgery was super short&quot; when it was literally 1 or 2h later. It was interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same! I had a surgery for my collarbone. I remember they put the mask on me and told me to count to 10. I don't remember counting to 10 at all then I just woke up. So in my memory I started counting to 10 then I woke up was how it went. LOL.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The one that gets me is the &quot;count back from 10&quot; you see on TV, with them counting back from 10 and passing out at like 3. For me it was more like a lightswitch. I was in preop, then I was opening my eyes in recovery.</p>
<p>The big difference I noticed - I tend to wake up really slowly. But I woke up from the anesthesia in what felt like a second or two.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>you probably just donâ€™t remember. I think there was an askreddit or something for anesthesiologists some time ago that asked about the difference between how much the patient remembered and how long they were actually conscious, and pretty much everyone was awake for longer than they realized</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I had a surgery that put me under for around 4h, and likewise, when I woke up, it felt like it was super short. I distinctly remember thinking it odd that the sun was already setting when by brain clock thought it was early afternoon.</p></div>		</li>
