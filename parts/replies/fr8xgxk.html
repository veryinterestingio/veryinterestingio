			<div class="markdown"><p>Look up Misophonia. It's a serious condition that seems trivial but can ruin people's lives. With a genuine five year old I wouldn't even describe it for fear of inducing it. Some people just get irritated with others, but some people cannot eat with other people. Ever. Some people have to live with sound blocking windows and curtains, preferably alone. Very unpleasant.</p></div>		</li>
