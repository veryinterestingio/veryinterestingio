			<div class="markdown"><p>I also want to throw out that the COVID vaccine is not simply the product of 8 months of work... tons of work on other similar virii, like SARS, had already been done, and we'd been working on the mechanics/production of mRNA based vaccines for a long while too. To a degree, we got lucky with COVID in that it behaved similar to things we already understood, and that we'd been working on mRNA-based vaccines for such a long time already.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The wild thing is most of the work was the trial. Once the virus’ DNA was mapped and disseminated around the world, these labs discovered a potential vaccine within a couple months and began testing it. And it works. Wild.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The pharma companies were probably not sharing information on the vaccine development so it was more like any other pharma product development. You’re right in the sense there were many companies working towards the same goal so the chances of success are higher here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All of this, and also it was incredibly easy to recruit enough suitable trial participants.</p>
<p>Finding people of the right range of ages and ethnicities, with sufficient exposure to the disease being protected against, to participate in any medical trial is usually super time consuming.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So a family member of mine started working at CureVac 3-4 years ago, right around the time they received $52mil in funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. She has been working in mRNA research since then, to trigger immune responses for various diseases, especially Malaria. Now, they appear ready to use this approach to develop and produce a mRNA vaccine for SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p>So really, from a zoomed-out, historical perspective, i feel like we are extremely lucky that humanity was at a point just after the breakthrough of mRNA-based vaccines, when the Corona Pandemic broke out. Timing is the one factor we just can't know when it comes to novel viruses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, mRNA is the way to go into the future.  This pandemic just provided the motivation to reduce the use of the old technologies &amp; start using mRNA properly.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s really interesting, and it makes me feel a lot better about our chances of the vaccine being effective enough for life to get back to normal. Tell your family member thank you for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We weren’t exactly here by accident. The work done in identifying the coronaviruses in the wild but likely to become transferable to humans was no small feat. Unfortunately the act of shutting down this work and the pandemic response team was done at just the wrong moment by Trump, otherwise I expect we could have been much faster.</p></div>		</li>
