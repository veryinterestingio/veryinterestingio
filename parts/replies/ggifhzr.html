			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not an expert in diseases by any means, but isn’t chickenpox completely different because the virus stays in your system for the rest of your life? To me It seems more likely that people with chickenpox more than once would probably be having something more like “flare ups” than reinfection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Herpes viruses (including chicken pox) can stay in your nerves, which have immune privilege, so your immune system tends not to attack them. You're not experiencing an active infection whole they're dormant, but when they spring up again it's very similar to re-exposure from any other pathogen, it just happened to have a different source.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah, shingles presents very differently because it involves the nerves, multiple cases of chickenpox are much more rare and will have very different symptoms due to route of infection. Theres lots of diseases that will have very different presentation based on infection route. If you get infected a second time your immunes system is basically good enough to keep the latent infection under control but when faced with new invaders it can’t respond fast enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>isnt that basically the same thing? you overcome a sickness, build immunity and when you face the same virus again, no matter if it came from inside or outside, you should not get sick again... flareups and reinfection are basically the same thing, you are facing the same virus ravaging your body again...</p></div>		</li>

Almost like I speed ran it, I lost sense of smell for about 3 days, nausea for 2 days, muscle pain in my chest for 5 days, headache for a little more than a week.
