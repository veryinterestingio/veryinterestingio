			<div class="markdown"><p>My family members literally fight over who gets to sit next to me because they will be totally ignored if I'm there. I once sat next to a friend for a couple hours wearing pants and and long sleeves and she was in shorts and a tank top. She got less than 5 bites, my hands and feet were completely covered. It sucks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm the same way. With full body coverage and bug spray I'll get 20+ bites when others around me get a few or none. I am sensitive to smells so I dont wear any purfume... my husband and I use the same toiletries so it's not that. I have heard that o positive blood attracts them (which is what I am). </p>
<p>Maybe if two people like us hung out together we would half our bite count!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How hard you breathe? Haha but seriously a lot of it also has to do with your skin; how much hair you have, how hard it is for them to find and bite areas with no hair, and also your own allergic reaction to a bite. People can be getting bitten the same amount but some people's skin has a greater reaction and so it feels like more bites.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe it helps, i am a smoker but when im sitting outdoors having a cook out or something I chain smoke, mostly just to deter the mosquitos. I get eaten to death regardless though. I'm a skinny bitch with a fast metabolism and O+ blood type. I also have a diet high in sugar which probably doesn't help much. I have super sensitive skin as well so I don't use bug spray unless I can be certain that it only gets on my clothes and not my body itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got the blood that mosquitoes hate. I get bit if I go out into super long grass just swarming with the buggers. Otherwise they leave me alone. </p>
<p>I don't think I have ever been but by a type of fly either. </p>
<p>Bees tho, they love me. Good thing I'm not allergic. But, as a result, I have a pathological fear of bees.</p></div>		</li>
