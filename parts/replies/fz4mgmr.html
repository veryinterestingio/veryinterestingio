<p>Bathing additives are useful adjuvant treatments for atopic dermatitis. Benefits of these compounds are derived from anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antioxidative, and skin barrier repair properties.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Last few sentences of the abstract. The abstract only mentions dead sea salt, not the other two.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The conclusion is that they are beneficial when used in addition to primary treatments, such as topical steroids. </p>
<p>“DS salt, commercial baby cleansers, oatmeal, rice, and oils” were concluded to show promising results as adjunctive therapies. “These additives work to decrease inflammation, repair SBF, and restore the skin microbiome. Bathing itself seems to provide stress reduction to improve skin inflammation and itch symptoms.”</p>
<p>Additives have potential to regulate GI dysbiosis, which has been shown to contribute to cutaneous inflammation in AD, but needs further investigation. Magnesium salts (e.g., Epsom salt) should be further investigated. This is definitely interesting because in larger amounts magnesium ions act as a laxative.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Magnesium acts as a laxitive because it is poorly absorbed by the gut and so draws water into the stool by osmosis (or stops it being taken out).</p>
<p>Wouldn't work like that on the skin.</p></div>		</li>
