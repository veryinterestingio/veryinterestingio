			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a set of behaviours known as <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_functions" target="_blank">executive functions</a>, which are involved in behavioural control. These can be things like cognitive inhibition, or the ability to &quot;tune out&quot; information thats irrelevant to the situation or mental state, attentional control, the ability to actively choose what to pay attention to, and working memory.</p>
<p>Higher order executive functions, which usually use multiple basic ones,  are much more complex, and involve things like the ability to plan and fluid thinking (the ability to solve novel problems, if you're into AI or even just sci-fi, think of a 'general intelligence',)</p>
<p>One of these higher order functions, a relatively rare one in species to my knowledge, is the ability to suppress, or otherwise go against, natural instincts. It can be hard, some instincts hit harder than others, but you can go against the natural response to various stimuli. It's not easy, but practice helps.</p></div>		</li>
