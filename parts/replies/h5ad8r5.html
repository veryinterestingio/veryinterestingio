			<div class="markdown"><p>No, there have been many periods of deflation, <em>especially</em> when currency was tied to precious metals like gold and silver. The global Great Depression of the 1930s was deeply deflationary. One of the reasons nations gradually abandoned the gold standard in the 20th century was the realization that tying a currency to gold made it impossible to control inflation and deflation, and the result was endless cycles of high inflation followed by destructive deflation. Since the late 1900s national currencies have been <em>fiat</em> currencies, which can be controlled in a way that gold-backed currencies cannot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was plenty of inflation back then too, caused by the same fundamental thing: an increase in the amount of money in circulation. What that looked like back then was the discovery of new gold or silver. IIRC, the Malian king Mansa Musa destroyed the economy of the Muslim world for years since he gave away so much gold during a pilgrimage. Spain also caused inflation throughout Europe when they brought mass quantities of gold and silver from the newly-discovered Americas.</p></div>		</li>
