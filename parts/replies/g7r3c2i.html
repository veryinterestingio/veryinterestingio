			<div class="markdown"><p>Here is the conundrum though. A car gets into a wicked front end accident, car gets fixed and a independent repair shop and is not reported on a carfax. Therefore to the prospective buyer, this car was never in an accident. Another car gets a minor fender bender and the rear end bumper is replaced at the dealership where it was bought. This will show up as and accident on the Carfax.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, not necessarily true. Carfax gets the vast majority of it's vehicle collision data through police reports. Some collision repair shops may also report (usually large chains and dealers), but in my experience shopping around, most use the fact that they don't report as a major selling point for their business. Insurance companies DO NOT report to Carfax and won't disclose their records to anyone that isn't the owner of the policy.</p>
<p>If you're in a collision and you don't want it to show up on your report, it's a pretty straightforward process to keep it off your report. The rub is of course that some insurance companies will tell you that there has to be a police report to determine fault. So depending on the circumstances, it may not be practical to avoid a police report.</p>
<p>Plain and simple, if a previous owner had repairs done without a police report ever being filed, you will never know without having a mechanic look for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have a reputable mechanic check out the car (as would be the responsible thing to do when buying used anywhere), there is literally no way to hide a &quot;major&quot; accident like that. It is virtually impossible.</p>
<p>Water damage is scary though, don't mess with that shit. Don't buy used cars from the gulf states unless you're really confident in the condition of the car and get it looked at.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OK... but your qualification here is a notable one. There are tons of shops/buddies/mechanics that will do good enough or even great work (especially on older cars) that will take cash and couldn't care less about what happened or that it gets documented properly.</p>
<p>As I see it, once a car is no longer a &quot;new car&quot; and under that initial warranty, it is on you as the buyer to look for that CarFax / certified pre-owned / stack of service records, ask the owner, etc... but the older the car is, the harder it is to believe that history and you should be considering that in what you end up paying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like last year i was looking at a Taurus SHO, accident report listed a minor rear end collision. Look at the car though and body panels are misaligned EVERYWHERE on the vehicle and moreso that you would expect for something &quot;minor&quot; and on the opposite side of the car. open the trunk and under the deck lid you can see where the main body shell had folded and then been pulled back out. With no extra metal added to reinforce that part, Which means its going to fold at that same spot again and much easier. That wasnt a &quot;Minor&quot; rear end collision, that was the entire back end smashed in on that car.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>calling it out hypothetically doesn't make it go away. </p>
<p>The point is that it's pretty realistic that you could not know the complete history, for many reasons. One is that some person, somewhere along the line, committed insurance fraud.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the ELI5 way of explaining this is: </p>
<p>There is a point metals can be bent to. Before that point, the metal will 'spring' back into its original shape. After this point, the metal will become permanently deflected. Where this point is varies metal to metal.</p>
<p>When this permanent deflection happens, the metal becomes weaker on a molecular level at the area of the bend itself. You can bend it back, and even get it almost identical dimensions to how it was before, but you cannot undo the weaknesses in the molecular structure that happened at the bend.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have a REALLY GOOD body guy you can rest assured it's as good as new (as long as the frame doesn't get bent). My body guy does Porsches, AMGs, and he gets any kind of crashed car like brand new, integrity wise and panel gap wise, you literally can't point a finger at what he does. There's body shops and body shops</p></div>		</li>
