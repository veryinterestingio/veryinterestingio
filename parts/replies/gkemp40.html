			<div class="markdown"><p>The SSME are widely regarded as one of the best (and very expensive) rocket engines ever built. They have also constantly been tweaked and upgraded over time since the first space shuttle flight.</p>
<p>It's a shame that the SLS only exists to please congress.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Interestingly enough, I just finished the (freaking excellent) Werner Von Braun biography (Nuefeld). In the foreword, the author mentions various terminology decisions (like what to call the V2 rocket based on the different versions), and he mentions that what most of these people do isn't rocket &quot;science&quot;, but rocket &quot;engineering&quot;, and makes a good case for that.</p>
<p>Semantics, but semantics can be interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, that makes a lot of sense at least by the common definitions of the terms. “Science” is the theoretical part, which is hard because you have to figure out how shit works and create the mathematical models and solve equations and so forth. But “engineering” is hard in a different way because, even though someone else did all that, you have to figure out how to build the shit, and understand the limits of the physical materials in a way the theorists didn’t always have to worry about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You say science is theoretical. I'd argue that both engineering and science operate on theory. Science is the <strong>experimental</strong> part. </p>
<p>Theory and experiment are similar, but there's a slight difference there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, that's essentially how the author discussed it, and how much of it was &quot;dirty engineering&quot;, where WVB wanted his engineers to be hands-on. You even read about that sort of thinking in the Apollo program, &quot;well, let's try this and see if it works&quot;.</p>
<p>Speaking of rocket engineering, the restored Saturn V in Houston - it's like a religious experience, walking around that thing with your jaw flopping on your chest. My wife (anthropologist) was like &quot;OK, we'll go see your silly rocket-thing&quot;; she spent 90 minutes going &quot;what civilization <em>did this</em>??&quot;</p></div>		</li>
