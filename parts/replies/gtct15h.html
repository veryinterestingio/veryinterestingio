<p>As for creating a &quot;superbug&quot;. The short answer is no, because we don't use alcohol as a method to treat infections. The longer answer is yes, survival of the fittest says that some bacteria are more tolerant of harsh conditions (like a flood of alcohol) than others. The cells that survive the purge will pass on their tolerance, some will mutate to become more tolerant, and over successive cleansings tolerance is all but inevitable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But can bacteria, fungi or viruses even become long-term resistant to highly concentrated alcohol (ethanol)? Alcohol in high concentration has been available for thousands of years and as far as I know even with intentional breeding of yeasts we‚Äôve only managed a resistance to ~20% concentration.</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC140401/" target="_blank">This study</a> showed an increase in resistance to 75% alcohol in a specific mycobacterium.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So to put that in context, the yeast is active up through 20% alcohol. It doesn't die past that piint, it just goes into hibernation until conditions improve. And that strategy is marvelously effective, there was one example of a team who managed to revive 4500 year old bakers yeast from a clay vessle stored in an Egyptian tomb.</p>
<p>Back to brewing, a portion of that dormant yeast from the completed fermentation is saved and used as a starter for the next batch. With the improved conditions the yeast becomes active again and goes to work.</p>
<p>So in the context of our sanitizer, the bacteria on your hands don't need to be able to survive 70% ethanol indefinitely, just to tolerate it for the 15 or 20 seconds before your body heat evaporates off the alcohol. That's a much lower threshold for survival.</p></div>		</li>

These bacteria were buried in sediment that was 101.5 million years old without a known source of energy since the sediment is too dense to let anything through. They were just discovered last year so there is still more research to be done.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But this is absolutely correct. Life is extremely adaptable. Evolution to survive an anti-biotic is relatively simple since they rely on relatively specific exploits to effect bacteria but not so much the cells of multicellular organisms like humans. However evolving to survive alcohol, fire, intense radiation or things along these lines is a much more difficult thing. That isn't to say it isn't possible, just that it's not like a switch will be suddenly be flipped in the genome allowing the cell wall to filter out alcohol or something like that. It's going to be a much more complicated process that is unlikely to happen on a scale of a year or even a century.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the growth was very obviously in the shape of our thumbprints.</p>
<p>The agar media is boiled and poured hot, so the dish is actually sterile until you open it to do the thumbprints. (It solidifies into a gel when cool)</p>
<p>I wish I still had the pictures, because while there were a couple tiny nonspecific colonies that popped up from environmental contamination as we worked on bench top (presumably some kind of airborne yeast or mold spore) you could actually see the ridges of your fingerprint in the growth patterns.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To your sanitation point, isn't viral load one of the key factors in this pandemic?  If you decrease the viral load, the will be less spread and less illness. So if you clean like crazy and manage to kill 90%, your chances of your body fighting off the 10% and not getting sick is much better.  Or, if you are vaccinated and still catch the virus, it has a much lower chance of replicating, and you are less likely to spread the virus.</p></div>		</li>
