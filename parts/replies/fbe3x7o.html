<p>So changing the pressure will adjust what temperature it freezes, boils, sublimes, etc at.</p>

<p>Interestingly, once you reach the critical pressure, which is 218 atm for water, increasing the pressure no longer effects the temperature at which the liquid and gas transition happens. No matter how much more pressure you apply, you cannot turn gas into liquid unless you drop below the critical temperature, which is 374Â°C for water.</p></div>		</li>
