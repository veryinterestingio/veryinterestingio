			<div class="markdown"><p>Holy shit I had no idea microwaves would fuck with WiFi. I’m supposed to be tech literate as well and just never thought about it. My girlfriends grandma had a good router and solid wired connection but WiFi would just drop right before dinner and I’m willing to bet it was because it was right beside the microwave. Thank you sir.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In fact, microwave ovens and wifi both use the same radio spectrum ~2.4 GHz! It's just at massively higher power for cooking. The wavelength is around 4.8&quot; which is why it's called microwave.</p>
<p>They both use this spectrum because it's an unreserved band and doesn't require a broadcast license or anything to use.</p>
<p>WiFi can also run on 5 GHz channels, which won't conflict with microwave ovens, but are more easily blocked by walls.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My microwave oven knocks out the major network channels (2 through 7) in my area but not the indie channels above 7. Maybe they are UHF? I don't know. Sometimes just turning on my laptop takes down the TV reception. I use rabbit ear type antenna because the TV towers are line-of-sight just a few miles away. Incidentally--and tin foil hat paranoia--I step out of any kitchen when the microwave goes on. The old power fades at the square of distance rule.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It does, which led to this lovely <a href="https://xkcd.com/654/" target="_blank">xkcd</a>.</p>
<p>Also, 5g literally uses radio frequencies in the microwave range — the exact same microwaves you'd use to heat up your food — which is part of why people are so freaking worried about 5g. That said, my microwave oven is rated at 800W, and metro-area 5G towers (ranges measured in hundreds of meters) are rated at up to 20W or so, so those concerns are massively overblown.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and 4G/LTE cellular have been using the same frequency band as microwave ovens for years. EM radiation at those wavelengths is non-ionizing, so it can't do any damage other than making water molecules vibrate enough to create heat by friction. As you noted, the low power levels involved limit that heating effect to a small fraction of a degree, so they're about as harmful as a wool hat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two &quot;categories&quot; of 5G: sub-6 and above. As in, sub-6GHz. &quot;True&quot; 5G, the one that is so easily attenuated that you need transmitters on every block, that can get you insane speeds, is a much higher frequency: up to 39GHz. If you've noticed on newer iPhones with 5G, and other competing phones, the antennas are visible from the outside. They have to be more or less exposed because if you bury them inside the phone the attenuation is way too high and it won't work well. They're also extremely directional.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don worry, no one should be freaking out about “5G” using “microwaves” - microwaves have been used for TV, point to point radio links, space communication, baby monitors, cordless phones and every generation of cell technology for 40+ years. The power levels aren’t higher in 5G either. Your phone transmits and receives at mW levels of power. WiFi uses 2.4ghz (or 5Ghz) microwaves with similar power levels. 5G uses from 0.5GHz to 30Ghz. The Bad Stuff starts many orders of magnitude higher in frequency - UV starting at 800 Thz getting dangerous once you reach PHz (X-ray) another thousand times higher than UV in frequency… TL;DR it’s not even close.</p>
<p>Microwaves have not been proven harmful at low power and the physics are dubious since microwaves are non-ionizing radiation. Any joe of the street should know about “UV” with regards to sunburns. Most are familiar with the idea that UV light can cause skin cancer. It can do so because it is high energy/small wavelength. Microwaves are many times lower energy/bigger wavelength. They’re not small enough and high energy enough to knock electrons off atoms which is how EM causes chemical reactions that damage DNA/proteins etc. Microwaves instead just wiggle molecules with certain “dipole” electrical field properties like water. This is how they can be used to heat food - the alternating microwave electric field makes the water molecules wiggle, gaining heat energy as they rub against each other with this induced “wiggling.”</p>
<p>Notably, it takes a lot of energy and an alternating field for that wiggling to do something. Cell towers and WiFi access points are most definitely not that. If they were, you would literally feel hot.</p>
<p>So relax, you’re safe! :)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why not though? Since nerves work by sending electric signals, shouldn't brains be conductive?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nerves aren't simply electric, they're electrochemical. The nerves aren't directly touching each other. They use neurotransmitter chemicals to bridge the gap. A magnetic field wouldn't have the same effect that it would on a current-carrying wire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Magnets work by inducing current in metal.  We do have very tiny amounts of electricity moving through nerves, but EM doesn't interfere because the nerves aren't metal.</p>
<p>Very powerful electromagnets placed right on the scalp will interfere with some senses -- it is not a strong effect though and that has only been seen in a laboratory. The effects are transient.</p></div>		</li>
