			<div class="markdown"><p>The water is already at pressure when it boils. You boil the water at high temperatures so it boils hotter. The steam that goes into a turbine may be in a 24” pipe but it comes out into the condenser jn a 200” pipe </p>
<p>The real reason is water is safe and has a ton of heat carrying capacity. The heat of evaporation of water is massive so boiling it puts a ton of energy into the steam that can be recovered in the turbine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Makes me wonder, given those characteristics of water... is there not another substance that has those same characteristics but is “better” for energy production? Or did people working on steam engines in the 1800s stumble upon the absolute best substance possible to use for their contraptions?</p>
<p>Sure, the fact that water is super abundant and safe is a really great selling point, but let’s forget about abundance and safety... is there something that would work better than water for this sort of thing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d have to do some figuring but I’d wager water is the best. </p>
<p>Water has the highest heat of vaporization known. I think this is related to the shape of the H2O which also leads to ice floating which is unique as well. </p>
<p>But I do wonder if other fluids would offer other advantages. </p>
<p>I know super critical CO2 is sexy now in R&amp;D around combined cycles. This is due to the high densities and mass-flows of the cycle leading to very compact and energy dense turbines. </p>
<p>The problem with steam is you need very high pressures to keep volume of your boiler and high pressure sections low enough to build pressure vessels. But steam at those pressures needs to be very hot (&gt;1000F) so materials start getting expensive and hard to work with. </p>
<p>Super critical CO2 isn’t as hot but you can cram more mass into smaller volume as your not dealing with the same levels of temperatures so your using more mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't answer your question directly, the thought has honestly never crossed my mind for some reason. But I can tell you after working as an engineer for 10 years in power gen that boiler leaks happen all of the time, the water in the heating circuit is constantly replenish from a water treatment plant. This is a huge cost to operation. Using anything apart from water would make the margins so much thinner.</p>
<p>Also supply is never an issue. You'll know if you order bulk chemicals for a process sometimes something crazy happens. Like there is a big fire at a chemical works and everyone is fighting over the last dribs and drabs of chem A. Factories using it as a raw material shut down until they can get supply back. This is just an unacceptable window of potential failure of the process. You want to be worried about your engineering, your supply chain should look after itself as much as possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Density of steam is important as it keeps volumes down but the problem is the temperatures at the pressures which those densities occur. </p>
<p>Supper crustal CO2 cycles over come the short falls of the heat carrying capacity with the higher densities of CO2 at higher pressure. </p>
<p>It’s all a balance (costs vs performance) and water has so many advantages.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The safety concern is very true, which is why acetone specifically wouldn't be used, but something similar. And gases take up the same volume no matter what they're made of, 22.4 L at STP, it's just the liquid that's quite dense, but acetone is nearly as dense with a far lower boiling point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a mole. A liter of acetone boils to ~420 liters of gas(at 373k/100c) vs a liter of water boils to 1200 liters (at 373k/100c) at 1atm. Makes sense to use the fluid with more expansion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it's true that acetone is much larger per mol, so it's obviously not a great choice as you pointed out. But surely there's some low-molar-mass fluid with a low boiling point?</p></div>		</li>
