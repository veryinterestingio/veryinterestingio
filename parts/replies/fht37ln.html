			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean I think there's a distinction that needs to be made between interesting solid/liquid changes in cooking vs, say, metals melting. </p>
<p>Most of the time the irreversible reactions that happen while cooking come from things like cross linking polymers or denaturing proteins. From a materials stand point, cooking techniques are relatively low temperature reactions (highest I've ever seen in a recipe is around 500F). </p>
<p>Cheese burning/caramelizing is a caramelization reaction but it is <em>not</em> a phase change in the conventional materials science sense. It is a non enzymatic reaction but it is not a phase change. </p>
<p>Conversely, the phase transitions of most materials (especially metals and their alloys) happen at temperatures well above those required while cooking. At these higher temperatures, most things that would be used for cooking would turn entirely liquid (or even just combust) as the energy present greatly exceeds the bond strengths between carbohydrate or protein molecules.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The source of that distinction is deeper than temperature. For example mercury is a metal that is liquid at room temp. </p>
<p>Foods are a more complex mixture of elements than most alloys, there are a lot more potential interactions there. An apple and a rock on the ground may look similar but the apple has 100x elemental diversity, from internal organelles to the microbes it hosts. That apple even has some of the same molecules the rock has in it. </p>
<p>Perhaps more importantly: foods are made of mostly organic compounds while metals are inorganic. They're fundamentally different and that's why they react differently to different conditions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would assume that if it was just melting cheese it would re solidify into a similar substance as a single curd of cheese. There is likely also a chemical reaction that occurs resulting in the cheese cooking not just melting. Same thing goes for butter. While it does indeed melt, it also cooks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Butter only has to be just over room temp to melt. Cheese can be melted and kept liquid like cheese dips and then resolidified when cooled. There's no chemical reaction there. </p>
<p>When eggs become solid by heat, a chemical reaction is the only explanation. </p>
<p>I think that's the answer OP is looking for. </p>
<p>Of course you can modify the conditions, yes heating cheese even further (or anything) will cook/burn it, but I don't think that's what OP is asking. </p>
<p>Still, maybe I should amend my answer to  &quot;it has to do with whether the substance is chemically reactive or stable <strong>under the conditions in question</strong>.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
