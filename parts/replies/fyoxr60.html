			<div class="markdown"><p>Remember that it got that way for a reason. Long ago, dealers underwent massive risk to get cars to cities so they could be sold there. Come to today where it is as you described it. It's those people fighting to maintain their status quo because they don't want their livelihoods ripped away from them. So they lobby and fight for what they have to be protected, so what they have worked hard to achieve can be maintained. Same reason Taxi drivers lobby to keep light rails and trains separate from airports. It makes no sense to the average person, but it protects the livelihoods of many taxi drivers at the expense of the public. There are tons and tons of examples like this. Should it be changed? Probably. Life sucks sometimes and innovation can really hurt some people. It doesn't mean you shouldn't change. Life must go on.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They're all basically Luddites who figured out that lobbying was more effective than storming factories to smash looms.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Never thought of this, but that is such a sleazy law to milk more money out of people needing a ride..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Random question for you or anyone scrolling:  </p>
<p>Why couldn't the expansion of light-rail be predicated on a jobs guarantee for the taxi fleet drivers?   </p>
<p>Like &quot;We know we're going to kill 500 taxi driver jobs, so we are giving preferential hiring to the first 500 taxi drivers, will train and re-skill them.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, do the dealerships order cars for you or do you have to hope to find the right configuration there? Or do american brands just not offer that many different configurations? </p>
<p>I could literally make a million different configurations on some german cars for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much just walk into the dealership, see what they have.  If they don't have what you want, you can generally order it, but most of the time, they're package deals.  You can only get the configurations they have available.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A little of both.  When I got my first car I wanted a stick shift mini.  I configured it at the dealer with the colors and things I wanted and they ordered it.  It took a little over a month to arrive.  My later cars, they had what I wanted anyway so no need to wait.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can configure at a dealer. You can also configure on a manufacturer website but when you get to the end they usually “connect you with a local dealer”. In some sense I get it because it’s like the difference between buying from a national chain and buying from a local store. In theory, going in person to the dealership should get you better customer service, you develop a relationship with people (my dad has bought his cars from the same dealer for 40 years despite moving away from where he grew up), and they do stuff like wash your car for a year or 2 when you buy from them. But overall I think it’s a dumb system and even dumber that it’s mandated by law in the Midwest (because of automotive influence on legislators in the area) because it just adds a layer of middlemen to the transaction which drives up prices. Right now in Michigan, if you buy from Tesla, you have to drive to a neighboring state to actually get your car. Which is insane and ridiculous. Tesla can have stores in Michigan they just can’t complete the sale there, even though you can register and insure them in Michigan.</p>
<p>Also dealers are pretty good at stocking popular configurations and have space on their lot for 100s of cars. They know the options people want and they also package things together in ways that they can make it seem like a deal. Like oh we’re throwing in these upgraded floormats for free but would cost $150 ordered through the manufacturer. When they miscalculate the configurations and end up with surplus you get the big sales. So again, are there benefits to the system...yes. But it still isn’t the most efficient.</p></div>		</li>

<p>after it's produced you can just pick it up at the factory.</p>

<p>and if you're an American you can make a nice vacation out of it with European Delivery... you go to the factory, pick it up, (usually get a tour, maybe some sort of driving lessons if it's BMW), drive it around for a week or two, then leave it at some major city's for its transport back to the states.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>America dealerships started as one centralized location to keep a bunch of cars for buyer convenience.</p>
<p>Like everything else in America, that &quot;industry&quot; became entrenched and wealthy enough to buy politicians, thus cementing them as the &quot;Legacy&quot; players in that market. Now that they are the main players, the rule makers and the gate keepers, they can keep innovation/competition out, keep the barriers to entry high and maintain their now obsolete status quo. </p>
<p>Just taking the invisible hand theory, eventually we would be in a similar situation as Europe, as the market should continue to evolve to best serve the consumers, but because of the rules put in place by the legacy players, that will never happen. </p>
<p>For another great example take a look at cable/internet providers in the US. They've bought enough politicians to successfully outlaw public internet services in most states. They outright admit to not competing and never face antitrust action because the officials that would bring action are all former cable execs or the beneficiaries of big campaign contributions</p></div>		</li>
