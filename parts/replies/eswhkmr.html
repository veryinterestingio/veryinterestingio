			<div class="markdown"><p>If they orbited closely to their parent star relative to the distance of the encounter they may be able to maintain orbits, although they would be changed a lot (they may become more eccentric for example). This is because locally the stars and planets would move together, and the black hole's influence would be largely the same on both of them. If the planets orbited the barycentre of the binary pair discussed, they would be subject to different forces compared to the stars. They would either be slingshotted as well and become rogue planets or orbit the black hole in a similarly extreme way as the captured binary star.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If that were to happen to our sun, would earth be able to withstand that encounter? Or would the forces involved make it uninhabitable? I realize the orbit would become more eccentric as stated above, I'm more wondering if the direct gravitational forces and or radiation coming from the black hole itself would destroy the crust, heat up the atmosphere, radiation levels going too high, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>what would the perspective be for a civilization living on one of those planets? would it be a sudden catacalysmic event that happens over the course of a few moments, weeks, days, or years?  would time slow down and the black hole never even be seen?  would they see a gradually increasing black hole in the sky that never seems to get any closer? or would it be world ending sky falling apocalyptic in a matter of moments?  Or would they see the coming doom but it would take billions and billions of years in their time frame and have enough time to leave the planet before the doom?</p></div>		</li>
