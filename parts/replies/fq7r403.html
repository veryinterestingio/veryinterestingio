<p>I would not recommend chewing ice. If the ice is hard enough, you can chip or even fracture your teeth. I do, but I do so very carefully, and with full knowledge that I may cause irreversible damage to a tooth and may end up needing a crown or root canal, if the fracture happens on a certain part. Fracture is more likely to happen to a tooth with a filling or decay, but is possible to happen to healthy teeth too. All about leverage and forces. </p>
<p>You’ve been warned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not Pica. There is correlation found to people with low iron levels and chewing ice I read an article years ago discussing the correlation. Unfortunately so much time has past that I only remember the correlation exists and not the theories explaining why.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Mayo Clinic: <strong><em>Doctors use the term &quot;pica&quot; to describe craving and chewing substances that have no nutritional value — such as ice, clay, soil or paper. Craving and chewing ice (pagophagia) is often associated with iron deficiency, with or without anemia, although the reason is unclear.</em></strong></p></div>		</li>
