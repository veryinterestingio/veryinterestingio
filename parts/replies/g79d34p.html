			<div class="markdown"><p>What's the reasoning behind implementing it this way? Reading it the first way makes more sense to me as I'm familiar with function notation like that, but on e.g. a calculator is it more efficient or easier to parse somehow in reverse/mixed order?</p>
<p>edit: excellent replies from all, thank you! Clearly I retained more maths than computer science because it seemed obvious as soon as the word &quot;stack&quot; was uttered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In programming, this is called postfix notation. A common algorithms course exercise is to transform the regular notation we use (infix) to reverse polish (postfix)</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because postfix is a trivial calculation with a stack structure on a computer.</p>
<p>Every time I find a new number, I push it into the stack. Every time I come upon an operator, I take out two numbers from the stack, execute the operator, and return the results to the stack.</p>
<p>Given the example</p>
<table>

			<div class="markdown"><p>RPN is used in combination with stack-oriented programming languages. In computer science, a stack is a data structure where one can only add new elements to the top of the stack or remove elements from the top of the stack.</p>
<p>Consider a calculator where the user inputs commands using RPN. If the users wants to compute &quot;2 + 3&quot;, the command sequence entered is &quot;2 3 +&quot;. Starting with an empty stack, the calculator first receives the 2 and adds it to the stack. Then it receives the 3 and adds it to the stack. Then it receives the +, which is an operation instead of a value. + takes two operands, so the calculator takes the top two items from the stack and performs the operation. The outcome is 5, which is put on top of the (now empty) stack. If more inputs follow, the calculator will proceed in the same way, or it will show the 5 as final outcome.</p>
<p>More complicated calculations work in the same way. Consider 4 <em> (2 + 3). In RPN, this would be 4 2 3 + </em>. When entered into the calculator, the stack is filled with a 4, then a 2, then a 3. The + is entered next, the top two items (2, 3) are popped off the stack, added up and the result (5) is pushed back onto the stack. The next command received is *, so the calculator takes the top two items on the stack (5, 4) and multiplies them to get 20.</p>
<p>The great advantage of RPN is the simplicity of operation for a calculator that uses it. With each new entry, the calculator either has to add it to the stack or perform a basic computation. There is no need to keep track of the full calculation as intermediate steps can be computed directly.</p>
<p>Compare that to PN, where one always has to evaluate the rightmost operator first. This means that the calculator has to store the full calculation because there is no way to know if more operators will be entered later.</p>
<p>With our regular notation (&quot;infix&quot;), it's even more complicated, because the order of operations doesn't solely depend on where in the expression an operator is located, but also on which operator it is and on modifiers like parentheses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you haven’t planned and written out everything ahead of time, RPN allows you the ability to add operations as you go. For example, if you want to buy 7 t-shirts that are $4.25 each and a bag to carry them in for $1 you would calculate cost like this:</p>
<p>PN: + * 7 4.25 1</p>
<p>RPN: 7 4.25 * 1 +</p>
<p>But then you realize that you forgot to account for a 5% sales tax. The equations for that would be:</p>
<p>PN: * + * 7 4.25 1 1.05</p>
<p>RPN: 7 4.25 * 1 + 1.05 *</p>
<p>So you see in the reverse notation, we could add that on at the end, but in regular notation, we can’t because we’re missing the operator at the beginning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>*+++1 2 3 4 5</p>
<p>We first do the innermost operation, which is adding one and two.</p>
<p>*++3 3 4 5</p>
<p>Then we do the innermost operation, which is adding three and three.</p>
<p>*+6 4 5</p>
<p>Then we do the innermost operation, which is adding six and four.</p>
<p>*10 5</p>
<p>And now we multiply.</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>So, you can see that *+++1 2 3 4 5 is NOT equivalent to (1+2)*(3+4+5).</p>
<p>How do we determine what the actual notation is for a given normal mathematical expression? Well, we can build it backwards. The last thing we need to do is multiply two values together</p>
<p>*a b</p>
<p>And a is just + 1 2</p>
<p>*+1 2 b</p>
<p>And b is just ++3 4 5</p>
<p>*+1 2++3 4 5</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes sense, thanks.  It seems they sacrifice an intuitive format for a lack of order of operations.  If you were doing complicated math, I could see this format slowing you down, because a long expression would require you to take some time to identify where the middle is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>The number of operands that goes with a given operator is fixed. We know that + uses two operands, as does *, etc...</p>
<p>This does mean there's a minor complication with -, because in our regular notation this symbol can be used for two operators: The binary operator of subtraction and the unary operation of the additive inverse.</p>
<p>With the regular infix notation, it's usually clear which variant is intended when we encounter a minus sign. When using a prefix or postfix notation, it is helpful to define a separate symbol for one of the two. Or to never use the unary minus and instead use the equivalent of &quot;0 - x&quot; to represent -x.</p></div>		</li>
