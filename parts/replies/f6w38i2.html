			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting question, I hadn't thought about music in that context. I actually can call back music in my head a <em>little</em> bit, much better than I might be able to with voices or spoken conversation in general (including my own). It's like the continuity and identical repetition of the music after listening makes it easier maybe?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly enough, it doesn't seem so. It is difficult to tell, since language or read seems to be processed by both hemispheres. This is still theory, especially since cases are so rare and difficult to study, but they seem to still comprehend language and read texts, but can't form any language on their own.</p></div>		</li>
