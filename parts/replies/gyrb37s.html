			<div class="markdown"><p>i believe many microorganisms go dormant, although it varies. i don't know if we can call it sleep in the same sense that we would talk about a more complex organism sleeping. the most complex animal im seeing that never sleeps is a bullfrog, and frogs are generally not very aware/active while awake in the first place, so it seems that anything that doesnt sleep has another method of conserving energy, like for instance not being able to move, or for jellyfish, just basically being plankton and drifting with the currents. other animals that never sleep are generally ones with very short lifespans like bugs/insects</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An important point for OP’s question is that sleep isn’t binary. It’s not a yes/no question regarding whether something sleeps. It’s a scale, with some things showing sleep-like tendencies. Even plants have been found to do something similar to sleeping.</p>
<p>There isn’t really a hard line on what does or doesn’t count as sleeping, it’s just natural for life forms to develop patterns in their behaviour and sometimes that manifests as periods of reduced activity.</p></div>		</li>
