<p>Would just like to add a few points. Business bank accounts usually have to pay for their transfers and BACS is cheaper than FPS.. although the fees are small it does add up.</p>
<p>There is also the ability to halt the transaction in some circumstances due to the 3 day clearing time, handy if a mistake was made. With FPS if you make a mistake there isn't much you can do as it's usually cleared instantly and the money is gone.</p>
<p>FPS is also not necessarily for one off payments either as standing orders use it.</p></div>		</li>
