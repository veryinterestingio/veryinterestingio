			<div class="markdown"><p>US tax lawyer here - can confirm this is an excellent summary. </p>
<p>One point I would note is that while the US is not a party to CRS/AEOI, they actually started this method of international transparency with FATCA (which predates CRS by a few years). FATCA ended up being much less of a burden than most US tax lawyers expected simply because compliance with FATCA or similar regimes became standard globally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>FATCA would be a lot less burdensome if it were better implemented. For individuals, gathering the required information and submitting it is ridiculously hard, particularly when the IRS has the data anyway. It's analogous to individual income tax - they already have the data but we have to manually recreate and submit it, introducing inevitable errors and thus putting ourselves in jeopardy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The federal government only has your tax documents, not all the data on your itemized deductions. How exactly could they simply send you a bill?</p>
<p>I hear this argument repeated everywhere (&quot;the IRS already knows what I know, why should I have to figure it separately&quot;), but that's never true, because they don't even know whether or not you have enough deductions &amp; credit to benefit from itemizing.</p>
<p>Have never received a coherent response to this point, only downvotes. I'm all ears. If there's something I'm missing do tell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not my area of expertise, to be honest. This probably sounds weird coming from an offshore lawyer, but the reality is that the tax analysis is all done onshore (US, EU, etc.) because its those taxes that companies are looking to minimise.</p>
<p>But to give you an example: WildClover Oil Company needs to insure its rigs against loss or damage, insure its workers against injury or death, insure its ships against loss, insure against its risk of environmental damage.</p>
<p>It can go into the market and buy bespoke insurance from an insurer. This is expensive and will require renewal from time to time. Entire billion-dollar businesses <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-greensill-credit-suisse-insig-idUSKBN2BO4VP" target="_blank">can unravel very quickly when insurance is not renewed</a> as they expected. In the meantime, the insurer takes the premiums paid, invests the money, and hopes that it can make more money through investment than it might ever have to pay out. In practice, the insurer lays off most of this risk to other insurers (re-insurers) and other investors through securities it creates.</p>
<p>Or, WildClover can set up its own insurer, that only writes policies covering WildClover companies (this is called a 'captive' insurer). This way, WildClover gets to keep all of the investment profits that the insurer makes, gets to set its own rates, gets comfort it will always be able to renew its policies each year, is able to ensure its insurance division has a true understanding of the business and a better judgment of the risks. It still has access to all of the re-insurance and risk lay-off techniques that a retail insurer would have.</p>
<p>Where to set up the insurer? Well, let's say WildClover has operations internationally - a field in the Gulf of Mexico, a rig in the North Sea but 90% of your operations are in Nigeria. The HQ is in Sweden, but the company is listed on the stock market.</p>
<p>The 'right' answer to that question is somewhere where the insurance regulatory market is sufficiently advanced to permit local insurers to write international policies, somewhere where you can set up a specialty insurer without having to comply with the same requirements that Geico or a retail insurer has to comply with, and (most importantly) somewhere that doesn't take the company's taxed profits from oil extraction, and tax them again when the company buys insurance from itself, and tax them a third time when the insurance division makes a profit, and tax them a fourth time when the parent company of the insurance company takes those profits up the corporate ownership chain. In practice, you also want a jurisdiction where you have a reliable legal system that does not periodically appropriate wealth, a solid base of local financial services professionals (lawyers, auditors etc), and somewhere where your employees in the insurance division can get work permits and don't mind living. That crosses Nigeria off the list, and probably Norway and the US as well. The 'right' answer to that question is <a href="https://www.mondaq.com/insurance-laws-and-products/1041458/why-choose-bermuda-for-your-captive" target="_blank">Bermuda.</a> (I have no connection to this author/article.)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing I don't understand about your example is that I think the way an Insurer works is they have multiple clients and that's how they reduce risk exposure (insuring 1 person is dangerous, insuring 10,000 people can make profit – similar to bookies).</p>
<p>How can WildClover insure itself?  Maybe you're talking about getting into some insurance market without paying the middle man?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Loss carry forwards --&gt; if your net income is negative you can use that negative balance to lower your taxable income in the following years (up to 80% of the profitable years income). You can keep carrying it forward until the loss is $0. Lots of large companies have consistent operating losses - Uber, Snapchat, Zillow, Tesla, Spotify, etc. The purpose of the carry forward is to not discourage companies from forming and operating and to help those that aren't profitable. </p>
<p>So for example, if company X made -$100 last year and made $20 this year, they can lower their taxable income by (20 x 80%) = $16. So they're paying tax on $4 not $20. The carry forward balance is now $84 and you can apply to each year in the future until it runs out. </p>
<p>Prior or to the Tax Cute and Jobs Act you could carry <em>back</em> two years and carry forward 20. Now you cannot carry back but can carry forward indefinitely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most cayman entities are not for tax avoidance but rather for tax-neutral pooling (as mentioned above). If you want to run an investment fund with investors globally, you pick a no-tax jurisdiction like cayman so your investors pay tax at home but not in cayman.  </p>
<p>Some companies do things that are legal but may be seen as less ethical. Imagine if you owned a shoe company and you made shoes in china and sold them in Europe and in America.  You have a European entity to do business in Europe and an American entity to do business in America.  </p>
<p>[This next part is a HUGE oversimplification and is just meant as an examples so don’t take it as tax advice]</p>
<p>If the American company owned the European sub, generally what happens is that the EU sub makes a profit and pays taxes in Europe and then when those profits are sent to America it gets taxed again as “dividends” (lots of exceptions to this but this is just an illustration).  If you were to have a cayman holdco (that owns both the US and EU companies) the profits could be sent there (at a 0% tax rate) and then you would only be taxed on the global income when you “onshore” income back to the US. </p>
<p>The reason some companies do this is because they have complex global operations and the lack of an international tax regime makes it easier to park everything in a tax neutral place. I’m not 100% convinced it’s bad. It’s just a result of being cross border.</p></div>		</li>
