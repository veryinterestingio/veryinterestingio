			<div class="markdown"><p>Juries still out on that one. Like yes you will eventually get wet and all things lead to the oceans but is this dollop I put on my face <em>really</em> going to still be harmful when it gets there??? I have no idea. In the interest of being low-waste I'm using up the not reef safe stuff I've got (not going to the oceans) before switching.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I always found that whole reef safe a little weird. Isn't that just assuming that the water from the septic tanks don't get treated before being recycled? It's not like I'm swimming in the ocean</p></div>		</li>
