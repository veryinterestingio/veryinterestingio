			<div class="markdown"><p>This is so critical, purging educated populace makes them easier to control and education has always been a threat to the ruling elite. </p>
<p>Which is why I find it so confusing when people in our modern society shun knowledge.  We literally have the power earlier generations couldn’t even fathom and continue to blindly believe insane things. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's telling that even today, in modern hospitals in China you often find a large TCM department. It's not just the older generation, but even young people who believe strongly in TCM. Combine that with a strong increase in wealth and a strong demand for anything rare, you have a huge market suddenly.</p>
<p>Though consider how in the West there are plenty of people who believe in non-science like anti vaxxers as well homeopathy I guess we are lucky non of those believe that bear bile helps. And as someone in China, it doesn't matter how much proof you show that TCM has <em>zero</em> scientific support, they often believe stronger in that then modern Western medicine. It also doesn't help that frequently in China Western medicine is tainted. Few months ago again vaccinations were found to be fake (while being issued by a state owned company).</p></div>		</li>

<p>The solution was a big propaganda push emphasizing the superiority of “ancient” Chinese medicine, which was at that time an eclectic collection of folk remedies. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I met a woman in Beijing who studied holistic medicine.  It blew my mind, and she didn't want to indulge me in the details; but I always wondered why they'd have that for a college level degree.  That makes odd sense.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>People still go to &quot;traditional medicine&quot; hospitals to get hodge podge of different ingredients that the &quot;doctors&quot; won't divulge exact amount of each ingredient or mixture because it's a &quot;trade secret&quot;.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Yet people scrutinize actual medicines and food for what's on the label.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In China, Traditional Chinese Medicine have their own dedicated medical schools and conduct &quot;scientific&quot; research. Legally, TCM is considered a legitimate branch of medical science. </p>
<p>This predates the current PRC government too, with Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine being established in 1924 under the KMT government. TCM is even taught as a mandatory class in medical medical schools.</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese doctors are given the same status and respect as Western medicine doctors and have their wards in hospitals. In fact, many  people trust Chinese medicine more than Western medicine. </p></div>		</li>
