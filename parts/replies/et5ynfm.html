<p>Also. When I was four, my gpa gave me this date spinner he had that calculated days of the week up until 2020. Lost it two moves ago, but that thing was one of my favorite “toys” so YES five year olds are interested in this question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding on: there's a cute little thing that helps you memorize the odd month doomsdays: &quot;I work 9-5 at the 7/11&quot;. Meaning that the 9th day of the 5th month and the 5th day of the 9th month. Ditto for 7/11.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>you can find the difference between July 15th and June 6th (39 days.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Easier to use the difference between July 11 and July 15th (4 days).</p>
<p>Also worth memorizing: 4th of July and Halloween are doomsdays.</p>
<p>As for anchor days, it's also worth knowing:</p>
<ul>
<li>It increments by one every year, except leap years where it increments by two</li>
<li>It increments by five every four years, and you don't care which of those four was a leap year. That's the same as subtracting two.</li>
<li>It increments by one every twelve years.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've memorized the anchor day for this century by knowing that &quot;in <strong>two</strong> thousand, it was a <strong>tue</strong>sday.&quot;</p>
<p>So typically, when I want to know doomsday for a certain year, I start with 2000 = Tuesday. Then I figure out how many 12s since then (for 2019 it's one, taking us from 2000 to 2012) so I add that many days, getting Wednesday in this case. Then I figure out how many 4s since 2012 (again one, taking us to 2016) so now I add five, getting Monday. There are three years left, so that gets me Thursdau.</p>
<p>I didn't know the Y + Y/4 rule before; that's very good to know. I'll probably use that from now on.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm pretty sure that's equivalent to your first bullet point - It increments by one every year, except leap years where it increments by two.</p>
<p>y is the number of regular years, y/4 is the number of leap years, so y + y/4 is the number of times it's incremented.  Similarly, 4(y + Y/4) = 5Y, so 5 increments in 4 years.  And 12(Y + Y/4) = 15Y, which is 15 days every 12 years, and 15 is the same as one in &quot;days of the week&quot; math.  (Modular Arithmetic for those of you interested in the topic for googling further reading.)</p></div>		</li>
