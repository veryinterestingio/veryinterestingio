			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless you're accepting that it's possible for 80 year old men to be just as jacked, just as easily as 30 year old bodybuilders, then you've gotta accept that age <em>does</em> factor into it and it has to start at some point. That point is around 40.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s even earlier for us, unfortunately. “Age-related muscle loss, called sarcopenia, is a natural part of aging. After age 30, you begin to lose as much as 3% to 5% per decade. Most men will lose about 30% of their muscle mass during their lifetimes.”</p>
<p>Goes to show the benefit of learning and adopting healthy lifestyle habits early on when our bodies are so much more “plastic”.</p>
