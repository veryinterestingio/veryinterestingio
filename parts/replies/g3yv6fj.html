<p>At best my hands will remain in their pockets. But a steady rotation of in pockets, crossed arms, hands behind the back and Mr. Burns ‚Äúexcellent pose‚Äù is ideal for maximum comprehension in a conversation for me.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Crossing your arms: you're nervous or feel vulnerable, you're protecting your internal organs!</p>
<p>No. Some people just find it more comfortable, or maybe they're a bit cold.</p>
<p>So much of it is laughable, self-aggrandizing bullshit. Certain things are useful, such as learning to move/adjust your chair when entering an interview/meeting, even if it's already in a good location/easy to sit down or get up from. It's a way to display your &quot;claim&quot; in someone else's domain. Though I'd argue that's not necessarily &quot;body language&quot; per se but a straight up direct action.</p>
<p>Body language &quot;science&quot; is the chiropractic of communication. Some of it is useful and applicable but for the most part it's just cosplaying as a valid science.</p>
<p>e/also to add your coach is completely incorrect regarding hands at the sides. Your body does not like dead weight. Your arms are heavier than you realize and the shoulder joint capsule is extremely shallow. When they are simply hanging you are allowing gravity to passively stretch and pull on the underlying support structures, such as your labrum. Your labrum is an attachment site for the ligaments of your shoulder and unlike tendons do not like to be stretched, this is how you end up with sprains. It's uncomfortable partly for this simple biomechanical reason. Your body &quot;likes&quot; to have some sort of tension throughout all of the skeletal muscles, this passive tension is what is commonly referred to as <em>tone</em>. The passive tension provides much needed support around your joints and also allows for quicker movement/action. Most of your subconscious movements and repositioning are simply the result of your brain knowing your body better than you consciously do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I mean for what it's worth, I think you are correct in that people may cross their arms for other reasons as per the examples you provided. </p>
<p>I don't think that necessary contradicts the idea of what that same body language conveys to other people generally. I do think that people subconsciously read other people body language and make assumptions - whether they are correct or not. Humans misread each other all the time after all.</p></div>		</li>
