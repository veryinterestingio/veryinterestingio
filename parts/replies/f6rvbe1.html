			<div class="markdown"><p>Famously, the kosmonaut struggeling to get in the airlock after the first spacewalk was pretty much drenched in sweat. So a human in a (crude) space-suit is probably more likely to die from overheating than freezing to death. Space suits today have cooling systems for this reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Temperature (in Kelvin) is directly proportional to the energy of the particle, so it would be proportional to the square of the speed.</p>
<p>So a particle at 330 degrees Celsius (~600 K) is moving 1.4 times faster than a particle at room temperature (~ 300 K).</p></div>		</li>
