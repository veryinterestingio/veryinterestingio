			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. My body seems to heal remarkably fast and most of my scars (I had and have a ton of them) fade over 2-3 years, leaving no mark behind. I do have two scars, where the structural damage to the tissue was deeper and I would assume they will stay for the rest of my life, because now, after 5 and 21 years, they lightened a little but visibly remained on my skin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Serious not trying to pick, but couldn't it be possible the reason it faded after 30 years because the rest of your skin changed to closer match it? Again I'm not trying to be mean here. Just asking questions</p></div>		</li>
