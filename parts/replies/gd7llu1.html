			<div class="markdown"><p>I read about that, but then how does the body <em>stop</em> making that protein again? At least I assume it needs to stop at some point, because I imagine otherwise our immune systems will constantly be fighting off a fake virus for the rest of our lives. Would an mRNA vaccine like this just slowly stop telling our cells to build more of that protein?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So then how long is the vaccine effective for?  Does the second shot do something that keeps the ability to produce the protein so if you're exposed to COVID 5 years from now, you're mRNA will remember how to produce it again?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>RNA only lasts for a short period of time before it is degraded or destroyed.</p>
<p>To make a permanent change to the cell you'd have to use DNA, and splice it into the chromosomes in the cell's nucleus.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If that's the case then what is the advantage of your body producing the protein over just injecting the protein itself? Does the vaccine cause you to produce more than you could safely inject?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thatâ€™s what others are doing, but it takes longer to grow it and mass produce it, which is why Pfizer/BioNtech and Moderna bet on the mrna approach</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But that's what the RNA vaccine is! It contains a fragment of the thing that infects cells (i.e. the RNA) and gets them to produce more copies. The other proteins help the RNA to do its thing, but without the full RNA sequence in a cell the virus is powerless.</p></div>		</li>
