			<div class="markdown"><p>On my 12 year old PC I would hear the CPU fan rev up for now apparent reason and it seem to run slower than usual. I ran a benchmark/diagnostic and saw that the CPU was getting throttled due to overheating.</p>
<p>All I needed was to reapply some thermal paste and that baby was running good as new. </p>
<p>So while it's true that CPU performance does not decay, there could be some CPU-related issues slowing it down</p></div>		</li>

<p>I wish I only had to repaste every 3 years lmao.</p>
<p>I take good care of this computer and have had it since 2013. The hard drive is slowing and it's the last thing (besides cpu) that I havent replaced yet lol. My cpu is actually pretty decent. 8 core 3.4ghz. It just get SOOOO hot lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Clean the fans to maximize airflow. Fan speed is a direct consequence of un-evacuated heat. Someone below recommended re-applying thermal paste. I can't directly comment on that but I will say that 99% of people use too much and it becomes insulative. A thin enough layer that it starts becoming barely translucent - that's the correct amount.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Since you have never done this before I would recommend getting thermal paste that is NOT conductive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're running Windows, for example, you almost never reformat it to the original version of the operating system you once had. You might get your original version back for a few hours as updates install. I think the people who are addressing bloat are dead on, because even if you reformat your system, you're reinstalling the ever more bloated operating system. And that's before you even install and open a web browser.   </p>
<p>With all this being said, computers don't really get slower in my opinion. I've got a Packard Bell 486 SX system that flies with the software it has installed on it. But I've frozen it in time as it were, the software on it is steady and never updated to newer versions. Also, the hard drive is 25 years old and no noticeable slowdown occurs. So, not sure about the whole idea of SSDs and HDDs making a noticeable slowdown.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>&quot;bloat&quot; can be a misleading term here, the OS being larger and slower isn't the same as it being bloated. Software is designed against constraints around the expected performance of the market, with feature vs speed tradeoffs. Those tradeoffs can be the right tradeoffs for 95% of the market while being negative for the fraction with the slowest hardware. A lot of things are designed to hit something like a 95th percentile latency, when those are below a critical threshold (e.g. ~50 ms, but it depends on the type of feedback, iirc) it's mostly invisible to the user. So things will make design tradeoffs trying to hit below that threshold for almost all users while doing as much work as possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except the calculator app that takes ~100ms to open on a brand new state of the art system (and several seconds on a 5yo mid range system), is no better than the one that opened just as fast on a 486.</p>
<p>Similarly the options dialogue that takes 5-10s to open has less options on it (because a third of them were left on the dialogue it replaced, and a third of them are in a separate dialogue that is 5 clicks away for no god reason). The start menu search responds much slower (and yes, windows 2000 and xp had this, it would highlight what you typed) and  gives you a useless/malicious program from the windows store rather than the installed program with the same name 50% of the time.</p>
<p>So tl;dr, it's bloat.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Hard drives work like records or CDs. The older the drive the wider the read/write tracks/paths. A scuff or a spec of dust would cause less damage simply because the area is less dense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep it ina clean environment and minimize fragmentation and they can last a long time. Also the manufacturer you choose your s hugely important. Cheap drive manufacturers may not use the best practices during assembly (clean rooms) or use failure prone parts thus lowering their life expectancy. Frankly you might say they dont make um like they used to and dont care much about longevity these days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently swapped the old, dying HDD (was warning that it was dying during boot) on my 10 year old laptop for an SSD. I had the original Win7 cds I'd burned the day I bought the laptop, but couldn't find them, and installed Ubuntu instead. It's as good as brand new.
I have the windows serial sticker on the laptop, so I could technically download win7 and set it up, but the cd also had necessary drivers which I once tried not setting up while reformatting before to cut down on bloatware. It was a disaster and I had to find out which ones are absolutely essential and which can be bloatware and honestly, I wasn't able to cut off many. I don't want to chase after those drivers 10 years later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't find the picture I took of my serial number on the sticker for Windows 7 and I've had to get a new laptop no thanks to the veterans administration and my software for disability only runs on Windows 7 so I don't have any way to type in the serial and download it. If you don't want your Windows 7 I'll happily give it a home! I've checked around online and even local computer stores and all the places that have it are charging like $400 and you can tell it's already been open and of course the veterans aren't helping pay for that either and I don't care that it's not supported anymore it's the only thing that my other software can work with, the Veterans Administration computer lab is still running Windows 95 in Windows XP at best so there's been tons of pushback trying to get Windows 8 or 10 because they don't even use it. The local blind and deaf school was trying to help a bunch of us veterans but with the quarantine and something else happened that the funding fell through so the school isn't upgrading their laptops, so they can't help us either. It sucks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also adding to this: So does cooling paste. This is a heat conductive paste that is in between heat-producing components and it's coolers (Mainly the CPU and graphics card). It helps transfer the heat from the chip to the cooler greatly. </p>
<p>Over time this paste will dry and degrade, and the temperature of your components will go up. This is very common, especially when the owner is not very knowledgeable on computers. I would highly recommend replacing this paste at least once a year, preferably once every 6 months. It's very cheap and pretty simple to do. And if you really don't dare to do it, you can ask a friend or family member with knowledge on computers to do it.</p>
<p>If they do, be sure to ask them how they do it and to pay attention, so you might be able to do it next time. In my experience a lot of people don't mind doing stuff like this once in a while for a friend or family member, but they don't like it when you start treating them as free computer-support every time they visit you. By learning it from them, you don't have to bother someone every 6 months and you expand your knowledge on computer-maintenance too! It also shows them that you are interested in their hobby and that you don't use them as a free IT support. Win-win.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also a big factor. I cleaned out my 2007 MacBook unibody and swapped thermal paste and it became almost like new again. I wasn’t able to run 720p YouTube before as thermal throttling would occur, but have no issues now. Definitely recommend trying</p></div>		</li>
