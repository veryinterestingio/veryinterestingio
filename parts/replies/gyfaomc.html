<p>And also wrist contain much less muscle than arm and leg due to it being a joint.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Injuries in the wrist itself are typically damaged connective tissue - ligaments, tendons, etc. - not damaged muscles. The muscles that apply power to the wrist are the forearm muscles - still quite a significant size (compared to e.g. the finger adduction muscles in the hand).</p>
<p>Athletes can damage their major muscle groups through lifting too much weight. They can also get joint injuries from highly repetitive motion with too much strain, e.g. a runner injuring their knee (just like there aren't muscles actually in the wrist, there also aren't muscles in the knee) or damaging the connective tissue in the bottom of their foot (plantar fasciitis).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As long as you're being responsible, 100%. Also, in every day life 100%. I think these are what you're referring to and I completely agree.</p>
<p>But if you're training, you can train up your muscles faster than the ligaments and run into some big issues. Proper coaching/training plans are important if you're looking to push yourself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Typically weight training involves lifting a weight around 10 times, then taking a 1 or 2 minute break, then repeating a few times, followed by resting that muscle group and not working out with it for the next 1 or 2 days.</p>
<p>It's a specific process designed to just do enough damaged then allow the muscle to heal.</p>
<p>Doing the same movement thousands of times, day after day is what will do damage to you.</p></div>		</li>
