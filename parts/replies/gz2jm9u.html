			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it is conclusive and perfectly normal. Though when one sneezes for example there is a multitude of viral particles, many are not even viable. Besides that, those that do get inhaled have to find suitable host cells, infect and replicate potentially forming thousands of new virions from a single infected cell. So the initial number of virions matters both because many of them are not infectious anyway and because even a small increase in the initial particles that successfully infect the host cells will result in a massive increase of &quot;first generation&quot; virions, and therefore higher chance to defeat initial host defences.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is something I've been wondering about for a long time. If a virus finds its mark and infects a cell, it can unleash a massive amount of new virus. It seems like exponential growth would quickly swamp out the effect of the initial viral load. Is this not the case?</p>
<p>On a related topic. I've heard there is a min number of virus particles required to cause infection. Is this down to needing a lot to actually have one get through and infect a cell, or does it need to infect a lot of cells to take hold?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds plausible and perhaps likely, but it's not the only possibility.</p>
<p>It could be the reverse- at some scale of &quot;first generation&quot; virions the immune system recognizes the problem and reacts very quickly. Whereas at smaller scales it takes too long to identify it's been invaded and mount a defence, and then it's overwhelmed.</p>
<p>That's why I was wondering if somebody can link to conclusive results one way or the other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  But.... Probably too many co-morbidities and complicating factors.</p>
