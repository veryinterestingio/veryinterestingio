			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh no doubt! Especially when starting exercising DOMS feels like an accomplishment. </p>
<p>The problem is as we move in to intermediate level of lifting you stop getting the soreness and people think they aren’t working the muscle hard enough. This ain’t true!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Legs can hit you so much sooner than the rest of your body for some reason, one time climbed a mountain trail while carrying my little brother for a trip thing he had to go on and I was fine the whole way up and down but when I tried to get out of the car after getting home I literally fell on my face because my legs stopped working after sitting down on the ride home lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At the gym I used to go to all the weights were on the second floor and there were more than a few times I felt like just sitting on the stairs and sliding down on my ass like a toddler after doing legs. I had a death grip on the handrail because every step down I felt like my legs were just gonna quit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Muscles stopping working early in training is actually fascinating. It has to do with neurotransmitters at the neuro-muscular junction.</p>
<p>Happy to explain further but don’t want to write a novel if people won’t read.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fact that trained people don't get sore blows so many peoples' mind. Yes I can squat 4 times a week and still walk.  Why? Because I squat 4 times a week,  every week</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The answers to all your questions is it depends. At a certain point you need a huge amount of stimulus and volume to progress. Sure, you COULD do 100 reps in one day, or you could split it over a few sessions with similar results.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Squatting 4 times a week sounds like way beyond maximum recoverable weekly volume.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fatigue shouldn’t hurt the way DOMS does.</p>
<p>When you’re trained you can fatigue a muscle with little to no soreness. Conversely, when you are a novice lifter you can do a small amount of reps and wake up in agony the next day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. After a particularly hard leg day, walking down the stairs I feel like total jelly but it isn’t painful. Next day they definitely hurt thanks to them DOMS.</p></div>		</li>
