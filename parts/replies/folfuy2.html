			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes the head is heavily irrigated and also the big blood vessels in your neck are very close to the skin that's why the head and neck are where the most heat is lost through radiation. But in the warm bed in a cold room scenario, you also thermoregulate by breathing cold air so some of the heat from your respiratoty tracks and lungs is tranferred to the air you breath (that's why your exale breath is hot) that cool down the blood that is irrigating your lungs and when it circulate in the rest of your body, it cools it down a bit too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That the head loses more heat than any other part of the body is a myth. It was examined by researchers who found that the head, which has about 10% of the total skin surface area, loses about 10% of the body's heat, not factoring in clothing. It can be a major source when the entire rest of the body is covered, but if you covered up your head and left your arms bare instead, they'd be the majority of heat loss instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh thanks,sorry i didn't really do the research about the head thing, just repeated what i learned from my lifeguard courses but it was a long time ago so it's completely possible that they then found out it was just a myth. Didn't mean to spread missinformation.</p>
<p>(For curious we were taught that the amount of heat lost was superior in the earea where big blood vessels were closest to the skin (and thus closer to the cold water) so like the armpits, the groin, the neck and head... It made sense in my head so y didn't fact check it my bad  And the amount of heat lossed by the arms and legs is reduced because of vasoconstriction in the extremities but that only applies for hypothermic situations like being plonged in super cold water not for here )</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. Grew up in AZ and now live in Chicago. Hats make a world of difference in winter, too bad I always forget to wear them. Luckily I finally have a winter coat with a hood that stays on my head...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was taught that your whole body radiates the same, but we lose the most through the head because it’s exposed. If wore a ski cap, jacket and no pants, then it would be your legs and feet that “lost” the most heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, radiation depends on the surface temperature and area of the body. Assuming our whole body is pretty much at the same temperature so will radiate the same when exposed.</p>
<p>Edit: I'm not completely sure about the biological aspects of this. I assumed blood circulation does a fair job equalising the temperature, but I guess our limbs cool down faster coz of the increased surface area.</p></div>		</li>
