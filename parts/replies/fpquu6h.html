			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the fluid between your joints also contain nitrogen gases that all collect together to one big bubble over time. Popping your knuckles causes the gas bubble to dissipate into many tiny bubbles, which then collect together again for you to pop again later. </p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>A biology major</p>
<p>Edit: Please reverse the above. According to a study, the cracking is the forming of one big bubble from many tiny ones. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4398549/" target="_blank">Here</a> is a discussion of said study. TIL.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't do it anymore.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Liquids become gas in low pressure. A gas forms due to local low pressure.</p>
<p>Vacuums don't really exist on earth. Just low pressure gas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically true. . . but useless. Technically space isn't a vacuum either depending on what scale you're looking at. A single atom in a cubic mile of space is technically not a vacuum. Technically, researchers can't get a perfect vacuum in a lab, or even close to the density of space, which is still not a vacuum.<br />
But, you know, most of those scenarios are close enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perfection may not exist either, but it's still useful to hold to its definition because of the possibility of contrasting things with it. Maybe vacuums are the same. I don't know. I'm not even sure that he's right about vacuums. Aren't they just local reductions in density/pressure?</p></div>		</li>
