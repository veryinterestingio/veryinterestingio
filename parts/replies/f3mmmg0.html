<p>food waste would increase heavily and the supply chain would need to adjust for shorter food shelf-lives</p>

<p>Then maybe there would be a market push for more locally-sourced food.</p>
<p>Example: Back as late as the early 1980's - local small farms used to raise small scale eggs in my neck of the Midwest. A truck would come around to the farms weekly, buy the eggs at wholesale in cases of 30, and take them to a larger grading and packing facility.</p>
<p>That doesn't exist anymore, so small producers like me with under 100 hens are stuck with a limited market, and we have to sell direct to retail ourselves. Which is a <strong>pain</strong> for $80-100 a week.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The market wouldn't push for that on its own, the government would need to regulate the industry to allow the market to move in that direction. Most consumers in the US won't accept the drastic increase in prices needed to reach that model again.</p>
<p>You're asking the industry and technology to jump back almost 40 years in progress. It's much easier to adjust the feedstock for our plastic to sugarcane or some other renewable source and burn it in a waste-to-energy process. PE, the most produced plastic in the world, already has a commercial production process from sugarcane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC the LCA on sugar cane derived plastics (think Braskem) is worse than that of traditional petrochemical derived plastics. IMO, the real change needs to be development of local (can’t be sending it overseas) recycling initiatives and subsequent development of additional streams of FDA compliant PCR stocks. It’s easier yet to increment down virgin content as recycled streams become available. There’s just a lot of infrastructure investment needed to make that happen locally. </p>
<p>Also, kudos on your uncharacteristically accurate description of meat packaging layer distribution! I bet I could guess which company you worked for in 3 tries—not that many specializing in meat and cheese these days with all of the consolidation :-)</p></div>		</li>

<p>While I agree with you that they wouldn't accept the <em>sudden</em> increase in prices, maybe this is still what our country needs - distributing the benefits of &quot;trade&quot; deep down the capillaries of our nation rather than just to the large population centers.</p></div>		</li>
