<p>Questions if you don't mind.</p>
<p>1) So in theory, if the main problem is that the dna is too old, if they were to take dna straight from a newborn baby, the clone should stand a better chance? Also could they then keep the dna, wait a bunch of years, and then clone again and again?</p>
<p>2) In theory if a pair of clones (male and female) of an extinct animal successfully made it to their adult years, ie sexually active (e.g. 1yr for dogs) and mated and somehow successfully gave birth... Would the babies be normal healthy babies or a little messed up with the same genetic issues the parents had?</p>
<p>I don't really keep up with science when it comes to clones, so if these questions have alrd been answered by experiments, I do apologise for not being up to date.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>a) yes. You can pretty successfully clone from early embryo (thats basically how identical twins are made). The main thing is you usually want to clone an older organism. Second part is yes in theory, but freezing and storing introduces a whole another step. And usually this is very inefficient process. Eg. in one of the recent cloning papers they used several hundred fertilized eggs to do IVF, ended up with a dozen or so pregnancies and like 3 live births (that also died within a week of unknown causes).</p>
<p>b) we dont really know. From purely genetic standpoint everything should go as normal. But for epigenetics... who knows. Another thing to have in mind with these kinds of &quot;specie revivals&quot; is that we usually don't have huge variety in DNA samples to start with, so those two clones would likely already be (closely) related.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Unless there have been new developments in the field of epigenetics since I graduated, which is very likely...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So could something like this be possible in the future? </p>
<p>At some point early in your life (like shortly after birth) a sample of your DNA is taken and safely stored somewhere. When you're 50 you need a new pair of kidneys for some reason. They take some of your DNA sample to clone and grow you 2 new kidneys which are then transplanted into you. Since they share your DNA they function just like an original set of good kidneys would and without using anti-rejection drugs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not an expert but at least for the second question, we can say there must be a method used in natural birth to wipe clean the epigenetic slate and refresh telomeres. Now, with faulty gene expression, there's absolutely a chance that this system breaks down but that'd be on a per- clone basis.</p>
<p>The FDA has <a href="https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/animal-cloning/myths-about-cloning#Myth3" target="_blank">stated</a> that the offspring of clones are fine, so I imagine that if epigenetics messes up your ability to clean the slate, it's a nonviable clone</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The above comment should be taken with a grain of salt.
1: Aging is not perfectly understood and research indicate the role of telomers have been widely overemphasized.
2: During embryogenesis (formation of the embryo) telomerlength is reset. (Also for clones).
3: The sources he linked also states that there is no data suggesting clones age differently than normal animals.
There is more to this of course, for example that cloned animals show no increased &quot;epigenetic noise&quot; etc.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is this a major contributing factor to death of old age? Or do we die long before the buffer is used up? Or, conversely, do we continue to live for a long time while we're already cutting off vital DNA?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Firstly, it's important to know that i) your cells replicate, and therefore telomeres shorten, at different rates; and ii) your body retains pockets of 'quiescent' (or 'dormant') cells with long telomeres throughout life, and it's these that seed cell lines that become replicatively active. In other words, different bits of you are different 'biological ages', in a sense, and 'age' at different rates. Most of your gut is mere days old, for example, whilst bits of your liver have been around since childhood.</p>
<p>So, with that in mind:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How far along this telomere shortening is a person at the end of their life?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It depends entirely on which cell / tissue / organ etc. Even at 75 years, there will be pockets of stem cells in your intestines which haven't 'woken up' yet, which retain much of their entire telomeres. Meanwhile, cells in your 5 year old self were wilfully self-destructing following the complete degradation of their own telomeres. More sinisterly, cancer cells often 'figure out' ways to maintain telomere length, and will multiply indefinitely without ill-effect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is this a major contributing factor to death of old age?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yup. By-and-large, despite what I mentioned above, overall the proportion of your 'active' cells which exhibit shortened telomeres does indeed advance as you age, and telomere shortening is strongly associated with senescence. Short telomeres typically trigger a slowing or complete stop of cell division, or worse, activate cellular self-destruction. The older you are, the fewer 'younger quiescent' cells you therefore have to rely on to replace dying ones, as they all eventually get used up, and more non-dividing bits of tissue start building up. DNA damage, amongst all the other hallmarks of ageing accumulate, and you slowly but surely become increasingly unable to maintain a fully-functioning body. </p>
<p>Hence, death!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does affect you. There are even services that offer telomere length sequencing to see how many years you theoreticaly have left. There are some conflicting views. Lots of types of cancers have short telomeres, and old cells as well, but division is not the only thing affecting them. Stress and radicals (oxydation) also affect them. And furthermore, longer telomeres mean more energy is needed to duplicate the entire genome so that is not wholly beneficial in itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have something called telomerase which is capable of extending the telomeres. In adults it's mostly active in cells that has to divide often (like sperm) but also exists elsewhere. Telomeres is a likely factor in aging but it's not, as far as we know, the main one.</p>
<p>Telomerase is what cancer cells needs to survive infinite replication so it's not always a good thing to express.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty sure the telomere theory has been disproved. A quick google mentioned an experiment on cloning cattle measuring how their telomeres changed over development, and the telomeres returned to normal during embryonic development.</p>
<p>The question is over 5 years old, not sure why the theory is still spreading.</p>

<p>Not <em>quite</em>! It's more along the lines of 'it's complicated' and 'evidence points both ways', hence my initial emphasis on 'it largely depends on how the cloning is undertaken' and the later reference to more recent success deriving, for example, multi-generational rodent clone lines with persistent telomeres.</p>
<p>As your link describes, it seems to indeed depend largely on the tissue source of the somatic cells one begins with (given we're a veritable mosaic of cells with varying biological 'ages', as described <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/i29bhr/why_do_clones_die_so_quickly/g034k1s/" target="_blank">here</a>), and, if done successfully, isn't often a problem. But when it does go a bit awry, the consensus across much of the literature seems to indicate short telomeres a factor of influence - particularly with respect to cloning attempts through the early 2000s and failures to serially clone any species except mice.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.karger.com/Article/Fulltext/452444" target="_blank">Bugstaller, J.P. &amp; Brem, G. (2017)</a> review cited goes into a little more depth.</p></div>		</li>
