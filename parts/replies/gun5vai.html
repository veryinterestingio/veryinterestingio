			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah also what are you gonna do?  I imagine being a baby is a pretty hellish experience.  Or at least full of incredibly wild ups and downs.  Pain without having any understanding of why, confusion all the time, no wonder they’re constantly wailing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a lot of what gets passed off as teething pains might also be these growing pains. My son acts the same way as he does with the teething, minus the bite drive or pressing his face into a hard surface, and confused me until I saw this question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After our second child was born, one of the nurses offhandedly mentioned how, when a baby is first born, every minor discomfort is literally the worst pain she's ever experienced. </p>
<p>That's been a helpful epiphany for me when dealing with young people ever since. That splinter in her finger is literally the worst thing that has ever happened to her, until that paper cut overtakes that pain. She has no idea about broken bones, or heartbreak, or war. She is literally incapable of perspective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Being a baby would fucking suck. You’re literally helpless and also can’t really communicate in any way other than screaming. Whenever my daughter was frustrating me with her crying as an infant, I remembered this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My husband had bad growing pains, so he would always check in with my toddler and ask if her legs were hurting etc during growth spurts. Since he remembers the feeling he could describe it a little better to her. Luckily she's always said no, even at her biggest growth periods so far. I is short and do not know these things.</p></div>		</li>
