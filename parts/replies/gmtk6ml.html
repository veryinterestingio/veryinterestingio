			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the proportions of baby's are good, but they can still be ugly to you in many other ways. Pups are not human, so we both notice less of the human ugly features in it, and when we do notice an ugly feature, we often can overlook it. But ofc with babies being human it's a lot harder.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Furry mammals are likely cute to us because they resemble baby dogs rather than baby humans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans babies are born ‚Äúprematurely‚Äù on evolutionary terms. This is because when humans started to walk upright, hips narrowed and brains got bigger, so the baby needs to be birthed relatively early so that its head will fit through the birth canal. When puppies/foals/kittens etc are born, they quickly look more normal and are walking around shortly after birth (and look very cute). Meanwhile human babies don‚Äôt look cute until a few months of life ‚Äî until then they look a bit weird because in the grand scheme of things they are ‚Äúpremature‚Äù in some sense.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I was a victim of a childhood predator, and I think there's just so many more predators lurking about than we even realize, so I kinda just feel uncomfortable interacting with children at all. Just thinking of the way the people that turned out to pedophiles in my community interacted with kids--super over-the-top nice--gives me the creeps and I always feel like I would give the parent of a young child that impression (not that I would act like that, I just don't want to even risk making a parent worry about that).</p></div>		</li>
