Hence why this is a big deal since its just an impressive feet of mathematics. The problem itself is best explained in the top comment.</p></div>		</li>

<p>To give that a little more context, there have been many complex problems in pure mathematics fields like number theory and abstract algebra which have been proved in modern times which require at least one of the following:</p>
<p>(1) Integration of such disparate other fields that many collaborating mathematicians are necessary</p>
<p>(2) some sort of computational aspect in which mathematical programming is both a large aspect of solving and a large aspect of the output</p>
<p>(3) a complete trail blazing of essentially new mathematics in unchaarterwd territory just in order to approach the problem</p>
<p>...which all results in mathematical proofs <strong>which can be hundreds of pages long.</strong> In such cases, itâ€™s a safe bet to assume that no single mathematician can check this, but instead large swathes of the academic community check the bits most relevant to them and discuss amongst eachother before such a proof is accepted. </p>
<p>This two page proof is what a mathematician would call elegant, or perhaps in this case even <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Paul-Erdos#ref752819" target="_blank">one from the book</a>, a high honour indeed for any mathematical proof.</p></div>		</li>
