			<div class="markdown"><p>Hydrocephalus is not related to drinking too much - alcohol or otherwise.  Hydrocephalus is a case where the cerebrospinal fluid which circulates through the brain and spine is either blocked or being generated too rapidly, causing it to flood the brain in excess.  This buildup of pressure can damage the brain severely if it's not treated, and when it occurs in unborn children, it can cause the head to visibly swell up as the skull is still somewhat malleable.  To stop hydrocephalus, a syringe is used to pull out some of the excess fluid (usually taken out through the base of the spine - it's all connected to the same reservoir of fluid, and that's the safest area of the CNS to poke around in).  If there's a blockage, surgery may be attempted to correct it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also chemical imbalances in the brain, that your brain tells you is pain. </p>

<p>Wow. Didn't know this was a thing. Do you have a source? As someone who has frequent migraines I am very interested. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Took me a while to find the article I read a while ago. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/73936.php" target="_blank">What is causing this headache?</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This includes the blood vessels, muscles, and nerves of the head and neck. They may also result from changes in chemical activity in the brain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So not necessarily chemical imbalances, but changes in activity. </p>
<p>The article was written in 2017 and reviewed by UofI - Chicago: School of Medicine. Pretty interesting read on headaches. </p></div>		</li>
