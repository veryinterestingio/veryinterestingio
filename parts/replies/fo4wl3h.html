			<div class="markdown"><p>In all seriousness I’ve always been big on sleeping. I just like to sleep. I can do nothing but sleep and be somewhat content. Everyone has always asked if it’s depression. Is it really? Im sure I’m dealing with some form of mild depression to some degree but just cuz a guy can sleep constantly does that mean its directly correlated to depression? Really always wanted to know this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excessive tiredness/sleeping can be correlated to depression in the sense that it’s a very common symptom of depression. But it can also be a symptom of many other conditions, not to mention everybody has different sleep needs. People tend to ask or bring it up because depression is a pretty common condition and over 90% of people with depression report fatigue.</p></div>		</li>
