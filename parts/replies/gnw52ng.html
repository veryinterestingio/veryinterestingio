			<div class="markdown"><p>Howdy @sexrockandroll! This one is pretty interesting.  The USGS has some good pages on aftershock forecasts for events and how they estimate the potential after a new event (<a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/data/oaf/" target="_blank">https://earthquake.usgs.gov/data/oaf/</a>).  In general, events that happen in the same patch of fault that broke in the original event and are smaller than the mainshock, are classified as aftershocks.  For really large events such as the 2011 earthquake, these aftershocks can last for decades.  There was a large earthquake in 1872 near Entiat, WA and some of the small earthquakes happening there two are suggested to be aftershocks from over one hundred years ago!  </p>
<p>Regarding monitoring, immediately after a large event it is common that we set out extra seismometers, gps receivers, or other monitoring devices.  This extra monitoring may last days, weeks, or maybe a few months but does taper off as the number of aftershocks lessen.  After that, most seismic networks will keep their regular monitoring systems online and watching for any more aftershocks or possible larger mainshocks! Seismic networks work 24/7/365 and I have the pager on my hip to prove it!  -Mouse Reusch, PNSN at UW</p></div>		</li>
