They still have a big layer of fat on top of the tree trunk sized muscles underneath. Every day is leg day when you weigh 350 pounds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>NSFW but I know exactly what you are talking about.  I got teased by my friends for having a “type” which they were trying to say was chubby guys but I was not going to kiss and tell that I was digging the musculature in the legs and booty during naked time.  Even if there is fat visually covering the muscles, again during consensual naked time, you get to get your hands all over and feel all of that.  Like if you are on top, you can reach back and put your hands on the quads and feel them flexing. Speaking from a sexual partner’s perspective, it’s pretty nice and very much adds to the whole experience.</p>
<p>I haven’t seen a ton of naked men but I’m a life-long gym rat and have seen all kinds of body’s in motion and you kind of get the idea from that.  Also the guys wearing kilts out as bars and festivals - I think they’re trying to show off the legs with the kilt -so I assume it’s a thing that they are aware is attractive.</p></div>		</li>
