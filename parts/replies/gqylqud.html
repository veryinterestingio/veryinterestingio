			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I have no idea what he’s talking about. I’ve worked at way to many call centers for that to even make sense. Who on earth gets paid per call as a customer service agent? Hourly is literally the only thing that makes sense.</p>
<p>Also, I noticed no one in the comments is taking consideration that call wait times are longer at certain times or days of the week. </p>
<p>What’s interesting is sales is the complete opposite. Companies will over hire just to make sure the calls are being answered as quickly as possible. Sales agents probably do a fraction of what customer service agents do as well, yet get paid a lot more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sales agents create revenue to the business. Any role that “brings in money” is more likely to be highly compensated. That’s why departments and jobs like HR/CS are usually the first ones to be cut when there are financial issues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that is call centers in general. They are very min max in terms of volume, handle time, number of agents etc. Call center agents deal with an extreme amount of bullshit and stress depending on what you are doing. Would not wish that job on anyone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the scummy part is when you can't get your issue resolved by calling.  Online chat and automation should be enough to solve almost any problem, but those that can't should be solved by a call.  If I need to call and must wait 5-10 minutes to get a solution... so be it.  If I wait that long and get the typical nonsense... that is super scummy.</p></div>		</li>
