			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more than the unconcious brain. The muscles deposit calcium salts as a waste product of ATP-ADP energy use. Those calcium ions build up at the neuromuscular junctions and physically keep the muscle fibres active. It's like an electro chemical short circut. I'm also an LMT since the late 90s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting. Guessing this is why yall tell us to hydrate after? Flush the sodium away?</p>
<p>Ignorant as I am can I ask how Potassium and Magnesium play into this? Often recommended for muscle issues?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe stretching before exercise (and, if particularly susceptible, any sustained motion like walking, climbing in and out of tight spaces, etc.), and a diet reduced in Sodium are the two mitigating factors usually suggested to reduce the incidence and severity of muscle cramps and spasms.</p>
<p>The first one must work out &quot;kinks&quot; in the fibers and add flexibility / range of stretchiness to them a little bit, while the second must help with that balance of calcium salts, maybe requiring more muscle use before enough waste has been deposited to cause the short-circuit or something.</p>
<p>I do a fair amount of elder care these days and I know a lot of older folks with shitty, high-salt diets who sit around all day get cramps like you would not believe the moment they have to get up and do something, especially anything involving flexibility like getting in and out of a car or retrieving something from a high or low place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, but there’s a difference between not going into details and glossing over so many details and giving answers that have no evidence so that you’re just wrong. The equivalent of many explanations in this thread would be a kid asking why it rained and to avoid going into the water cycle, mom just says that it’s angels crying.  Sure it’s simple, but it’s just wrong.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Keep your bullshit detector on when speaking to any massage therapist or Chiropractor. Hell, even MD's still spew outdated information regarding massage. </p>
<p>We really don't know as much as we thought. Get a massage because it feels good. If it doesn't feel good, don't get one or find a different practitioner that you like. You'll know when you get a good, relaxing massage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know there's a lot of controversy about what they are and if they're real etc. All I know is that I had one physiotherapist who was able to find the knots. I could feel them, they hurt. She would then simply apply pressure with a thumb or finger knuckle. It would hurt a lot at first but the pain would subside. Afterwards, I could feel for myself that the muscle felt smoother and more supple and the tenderness that once was there had gone.</p>
<p>So, I'm convinced there's something to the concept of muscle knots. What their true nature is, I don't know. I just wish I had someone around to find the bastards every day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to do some personal injury defense, and when a plaintiff submitted a bunch of chiropractor bills, I was always happy.</p>
<p>I spent a day to learn enough about that bullshit to work up a fun 4-hour deposition that would pin any chiropractor down.</p>
<p>&quot;Counsel, unlike you, I get paid by the hour, and so I'm happy to depose the chiropractor about the magic of spine manipulation, or you can just remove those bills yourself.&quot;  Usually was all it took.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find I get the opposite of relief from a massage when I have a tense or “knotted” muscle situation. Massage further inflames the area and causes more tenseness. </p>
<p>I get more relief from anti-inflammatory medication, and sometimes muscle relaxants like flexeril.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I appreciate your input as a stretch therapist, however as a med student nearing graduation, this process of maintained contraction is the result of low calcium levels, low ATP levels, and dehydration which result in muscular myosin bridges to remain attached and remain in a contracted position. This is also why rigor mortis sets in after death, except after death it is permanent throughout the body because the body is no longer supplying ATP (energy) to break the myosin bridges which form contractions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every professional massage I've had has involved the therapist selecting some arbitrary muscle and then repeatedly squishing it against the adjacent bone until it's sufficiently bruised. I can't tell whether this is because my muscles are small enough that they feel like mere knots, or because massage therapists hate me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is how I felt about massage until I tried one more time, and found this lady who used to massage horses.  I told her I didn't like massages,  and I just want to relax.  Okily-dokily.  Had a couple of relaxation massages, then I slowly asked her to increase the pressure where she needs to.  I can tell you, there's a bit of pain involved, but we work together on those spots and it makes the world of difference.</p>
<p>Tl;dr:  Get you a massage therapist you can talk to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are they actually bruised, like purple skin, or do they just feel bruised? Because after the knot comes out, the muscle is going to be sore, which would feel like a bruise since it's in one spot.</p></div>		</li>
