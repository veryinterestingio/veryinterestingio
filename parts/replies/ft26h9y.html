When you save a JPEG in a program like Photoshop, it has options for you to select if you want the image saved standard (line by line) or progressive (low-res to high-res). So for each image, someone made that choice (or just picked whatever was the default for their software).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not aware of any phones that offer support for saving it as progressive- they all just do the standard line-by-line. Nothing's stopping them from offering that as an option or making it the default, it's just probably not a feature that gets requested very often and with companies trying to move away from JPEG, it's probably not high on anyone's list of features to add.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The why is, that line by line was invented first because its a really simple idea. All images in the web loaded like this. But internet connections were slow back then, images took seconds/minutes to load.</p>
<p>So some smart person came up with the idea of progressive images, the image is stored not line by line but staggered, so the first pixels read will form a very low resolution version of the whole image. This allows the first few bytes streamed to people computers to make up the whole image even if blurry/pixelated (the blur effect is done on the client machine not in the image). Greatly speeding up how quickly a person can 'see' what the picture is while its still downloading.</p>
<p>It is still left up to the image creator if they want to create line by line images or progressive ones. If you take a picture of a bird, progressive might make sense, but scan a page of text line by line would be better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't seen people talk about code complexity and compression.</p>
<p>Usually top to bottom streaming is easier to code, thus widely supported. Older file formats usually always support this. Also it is easier to compress the data if it is streamed from start to finish because you can compress images better by packing up nearby similar pixels into chunks. Real life images always have patches of pixels that have the same or similar colors. If you were to send every nth pixel, it would be difficult to compress since the pixels are less correlated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, progressive loading images generally use more space, so it's a tradeoff for user experience vs. bandwidth. Some fancier websites (and fancy CDNs) will dynamically choose to send different image formats for different devices (and guessed bandwidth) as part of this tradeoff.</p></div>		</li>
