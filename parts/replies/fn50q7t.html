<p>Grog... it is thought to be named after Old Grog, a British Admiral, Edward Vernon.  The same Vernon that was the namesake of George Washington's home, Mount Vernon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The stereotype is more based on the fact that there’s nothing to spend money on while on the ship and they usually get paid once they make port, plus drinking while working wasn’t really encouraged so you have a bunch of men who suddenly have money while not being able to get drunk for weeks or months on end and when they finally make port they go wild</p></div>		</li>

<p>Alcohol is a diuretic (causing increased passing of urine). So if all you drank was high alcohol content booze you would lose more fluids in almost all cases then you would be taking in. (One of the reasons for hangovers.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the booze wasn't to disinfect the water it was actually to mask the taste of the nasty water. Sailors used to be given a ration of spirits to mix in the water but sailors would hoard their small daily ration of the spirits over multiple days and get blasted. To counter this they would premix water and spirits together. This grog is most often associated with Rum due to the English conquering of Jamaica and rum replacing the other things used prior.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The mixture of alcohol, typically rum, into the drinking water didn't occur until around 1740.</p>
<p>That concept was widely introduced by British Vice admiral Edward Vernon. The concoction was called grog. Named after the type of coat he used to wear made of grogram fabric.</p>
