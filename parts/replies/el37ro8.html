			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow-up... So it’s not unrealistic to think eventually (at some potential point in humanity), this approach will change? Seems awfully reminiscent of geocentrism. Or maybe I am actually 5.</p>
<p>Edit: Thank You everyone for the insight and input... however I should have been more clear on the “potential” part, I was referring to space travel.</p>
<p>Edit 2: my point about geocentrism pertains more to our proclivity to use earth as the reference point. Although I now get that that until we find a more practical origin, that’s the point we will have to use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Constellations are pretty reliable because they don't change over the course of one's lifetime. They appear at different relative positions depending on the time of day and day of the year, but those are known so you can always find back where you are looking in absolute.</p>
<p>You can also use the North Star since it's always at the same spot on the sky all over the year. </p>
<p>Over longer distances, you can use more exotic objects. Pulsars appear as objects that blink like light houses, and they typically have an unique &quot;signature&quot; (frequency of blinking, etc) so you can use them as galactic points of references. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_Golden_Record" target="_blank">The Voyager Golden Record</a> includes the position of the solar system relative to nearby pulsars. </p>
<p>For even bigger scales (extra-galactic), I guess you can use active galactic nuclei (quasars, etc) but I'm not sure. </p>
<p>In practice, astronomers use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_coordinate_system" target="_blank">Equatorial coordinate system</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Astronomer here! To add to this, we have also done extensive surveys of the sky at many wavelengths. I just did a project looking at some interesting radio sources for example, so in order to see what the sources looked like in optical light I just entered the coordinates <a href="https://aladin.u-strasbg.fr/AladinLite/" target="_blank">here. </a> I was particularly interested in radio sources coming from within a few hundred million light years from us, and the “SDSS” catalog there for example is complete out to the distances I care about, so if I saw a galaxy at the coordinates I associated it with my radio source. If nothing was there, most likely it was from further away in a Galaxy too far to be seen by the survey. </p>
<p>I hope that helps explain what an astronomer does!</p></div>		</li>
