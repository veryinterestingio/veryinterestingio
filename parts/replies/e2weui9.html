			<div class="markdown"><p>I met them at a river 2 weeks ago, they bit me through my shirt and I still have several red spots on my stomach and arms ? the only way to escape was submerge myself in water up to my ears and swat like crazy. They bit my friend on top of her head, through her hair.</p>
<p>Horse flies are evil incarnate.</p>
<p>EDIT: bites not stings!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bites not stings...but yes, they are evil buggers.<br />
I got bitten half to death by them a couple of weeks ago while putting up a big tent in a field.<br />
Managed to swat one and ended up with a big splat of blood over my leg.  (Not sure if mine, his or someone else's though!)</p></div>		</li>
