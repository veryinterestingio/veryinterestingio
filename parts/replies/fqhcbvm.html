<p>If something orbits the earth it has to keep the center of the earth in the middle of the orbit. If it's at the equator it can stay over the same latitude. If it is at the right distance it can stay over the same point.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just expanding on this a little. If you want something to stay in orbit and remain above a single ground location, that would be called a geostationary orbit and requires a precise altitude and velocity. A geostationary orbit is also a circular orbit and you can have other circular orbits at various altitudes.</p>
<p>Not all earth orbits are circular however, most types of orbits will be elliptical orbits, where the orbiting object will have Earth at one of the focii.</p>
<p>Number of elliptical orbits possible &gt;&gt; number of circular orbits possible &gt;&gt; number of geostationary orbits possible (=1)</p></div>		</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>in order to maintain a single spot in space above the earth you need a geostationary orbit </p>
</li>
<li>an elevator in a polar orbit wouldn't work because there is not geostationary polar orbit for the earth</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of mistakes being made in this discussion.  A tethered satellite is not in orbit, and it doesn't have to keep the centre of the Earth in its orbit.  You could tether from a higher latitude; the spacecraft would circle perpendicular to the Earth's axis, but would be pulled slightly closer to the equator than the tether's base due to the Earth's centre of gravity.  But there would be a stable equilibrium position where the spacecraft would just 'hang' over a fixed point on the ground.  The tether itself would also curve slightly towards the equator, depending on its own mass.</p>
<p>The only disadvantage I can see to using a higher latitude is that you would need a longer cable (ideally the spacecraft would circle the Earth just outside an untethered geostationary orbit, so that there is enough tension in the cable to lift whatever weight you want to get off the Earth).  A secondary disadvantage is that the equilibrium point would not be as stable as one at the equator: the spacecraft would swing about more on a longer tether which doesn't travel so fast along the ground--if the tether were at the North Pole, there would be zero stability and the spacecraft would likely just crash.</p>
<p>However, the thing stopping us realizing a space elevator right now is that we don't have the technology to make cables strong enough which aren't so heavy that they don't just pull the spacecraft down.  And being forced to use longer cables would make the problem worse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have thought a lot about this over the years (since reading Red Planet). I often wonder about alternative concepts to the traditional single tether elevator. </p>
<p>Like a skyhook that only dips down to the level of a high altitude balloon. Use sliding weights to adjust the rotational forces of picking up and setting down. </p>
<p>Or, tethering in three points on the earth that run along tracks leading away from the center. Pull those three points out, and the elevator drops closer to earth, come closer, and it rises into the sky.</p>
<p>Or, lastly, how would it behave if it was tethered at a pole, and the tether (which would be parallel to the ground) rotated. Spinning the whole thing outward at two or three times the speed of the earth's spin. Seems that would shorten the cable distance. </p>
<p>Course, set up of anything would be nearly impossible.  Fun concept though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is a pretty good explanation. Although one thing to add is that another disadvantage to tethering from a higher latitude is tether needing to withstand greater tension. The reason why the spacecraft is pulled closer to the equator is that the horizontal (horizontal to the Earth’s surface) component of the tether’s tension needs to balance out the opposing horizontal force, which is the horizontal component of Earth’s gravity due to spacecraft not being at the equator. That horizontal component adds to the total tension.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This it how I figured it would work. I can't help but think the top commenters didn't read the question properly, because they otherwise sound like they know what they're talking about. I suppose the could have just looked up space elevators real quick. The only question I have is about the instability you mentioned. Would that come from the bow in the cable swinging?  That's the only difference I can think of between this and a much smaller system, and I can't think of any reason it would be unstable in a small system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>just for my own curiosity on this point, would the rotational tilt of the earth have any effect, or would it be that from the frame of reference of the orbit, there is no change. i.e. is the rotational tilt only in frame of reference from other celestial bodies?</p>
<p>eta: my terminology is probably wrong, I'm no astrophysics</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The plane of the geostationary orbit will necessarily be perpendicular to the axis of the earth’s rotation. In that regard the tilt isn’t relevant. Whatever direction the earth is tilted, the plane of the orbit must be perpendicular.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>also realizing now that I'm dumb and didn't think that through. the Earth's tilt doesn't change (on our time scale), it just stays the same and the position of the tilt in relation to it's solar orbit is what causes seasons.</p></div>		</li>
