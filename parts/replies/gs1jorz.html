			<div class="markdown"><p>It also depends on the instrument.  Something like a piano can only be tuned in one temperament (equal) because each key can only play one note, but a violin can be played in either equal or unequal temperament because you can just adjust your finger.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Pianos can be tuned to different temperaments, just not in the same way you’re describing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Found the piano tech.
One question I always had about this: To what extend is the steel frame of a piano designed for the exact forces that are produced by the strings tuned well-tempered in 440-443 Hz?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A piano can be tuned to any temperament, but it would have to be retuned every time you change the key. This is the reason that equal temperament is preferred for modern music: In exchange for every note being ever so slightly out of tune (barely noticeable), it allows tuned instruments to freely change between keys.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In earlier temperament systems, there is a difference between A# and Bflat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But in non equal temperament systems, there is also a difference between G and G... depending on what key you're in.</p>
<p>So I don't think the temperament system is the real answer to the question.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is (almost) the correct answer. Not only hapsichords but all intruments had different ways to deal with temperaments (lutes had frets that could be moved to fit a temperament, f.e)</p></div>		</li>
