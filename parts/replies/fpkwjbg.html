			<div class="markdown"><p>those additional bedrooms were also usually smaller back then because they didn't have anything in them except a twin sized bed and a dresser. People didn't need room for a desk and computer then, and spent most of their time either in other rooms or outside.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I loved the way they look but now i have a traditional floorplan and wouldnt trade it. Kid practicing piano? Great - I'll go in a different room. Someone stopping by for a quick visit? Keep the front room straightened. Its also easier with the dogs - even though our kitchen is open to the family room, there is a step, and the dogs know that during dinner they are supposed to stay in the family room. Clear deliniation between rooms, and walls to  block sounds and sites.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ditto. Open floorplans sound appealing for people dreaming of frequent entertaining, but we’ll host like one house party a year. Unless you’re having a ton of people over, it’s just wasted empty space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At least once a week I would have a bunch of people over in college and we'd make food to eat, and I had several friends from Nepal who were vegan and had been since birth... the smell of cooking meat really bothered them and I never really thought about how a separated floor plan could help prevent inconveniences like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't stand the tiny kitchens. It feels so confined and isolated and closed off from the rest of the house, so I can't imagine anyone who spends a lot of time cooking enjoys them. An open kitchen was my #1 criteria when we started looking to buy our own house.</p>
<p>I feel bad for women in earlier decades for whom it was the norm to cook and clean all day and be shut off from the family. I'm wondering if maybe women's increased agency/impact on the market influenced this design?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Confined, isolated, and closed off from the rest of the house is exactly how I like my kitchen. I'm the cook in my household, including for parties and social gatherings. I like being able to keep the mess confined to the kitchen and just bring out the finished product.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isolated so the sound of dishes doesn't fill the whole damn house but with enough space to work. Space is the important thing! My last place had a kitchen open to the main living area but hardly any room to work; it was the worst.</p>
<p>My house isn't perfect, but it has my Goldilocks kitchen!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isolated is where it's at! Add in a butler's pantry and a small bathroom and it's perfect. The doors that open up into the kitchen from the side of the house are amazing too! </p>
<p>I just need a butler's pantry and more counter space in my next old house. The previous owners knocked down the wall separating thenliving room and dining room and we actually wish we had the wall back. Some pocket doors would have been the best solution. Husband and I have no clue what to do with the empty space.</p>
<p>Best part about old homes is you can close off rooms to hide the mess!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. I especially love those giant islands that are perfect for baking as I can spread out everything including my baking mat. I've been putting up with tiny kitchens for a decade and it's driving me nuts trying to find space for all my ingredients and appliances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hell, ever look at appliances from that time?   I was looking at a place that belonged to a co-worker's elderly mother....  it still had the original wall-mounted oven...  </p>
<p>I didn't open it, but it looked like you might have been able to fit a rotisserie chicken into it.</p></div>		</li>
