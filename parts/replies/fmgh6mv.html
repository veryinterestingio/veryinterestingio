			<div class="markdown"><p>This is tangential, but I recently learned this and want to share it as much as possible. It turns out that two kinds of swine flu were originally human flu that spilled over into pigs, then spilled <em>back</em> over into humans. Crazy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In medical terms, this is called genetic reassortment. Human flu virus swaps genomic fragments with the pig flu virus, giving rise to an entirely different type of virus. Example genome HUMAN x PIGSY becomes HUGSY and PIMAN. Since our bodies can only properly respond to known pathogens, it doesn't know that HUGSY can also cause flu and has no immunity to it. This genetic reassortment happens in influenza virus very frequently and that's one reason why flu vaccines change every year and the ones you've received last year becomes useless this year.</p>
<p>Even then, these vaccines can produce only a few types of flu virus antibodies because there are so many varieties of flu virus. And the strains they cover are anticipatory; nobody knows which strains will cause problems this year so we try to predict which ones will rise this year and cover the most severe 3 or 4 strains according to the WHO recommendations. Anticipatory, because if we only start making vaccines once we have problems, it will be too late as many people will have already fallen ill and have suffered from many health problems. Vaccines are, after all, best used as preventive, not reactive after things get out of hand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's certain that it started in bats and it's very likely to have gone through pangolins to get to humans. Just like Ebola came from bats and went through monkeys to get to humans. And SARS and MERS took similar paths. It's also suspected that other diseases like Measles  may have originally started in bats.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Important to point out that these two origins are not mutually exclusive. Given the vast diversity of viruses it's certainly plausible that they &quot;originated&quot; more than once.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>There is a great episode of PBS Eons about this</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So a virus genome can actually be embedded into host DNA, and somewhat safely? A lot of times the symptoms an infected person are caused by the immune response itself. Could a type of vaccine work by using CRISPR or something to intentionally embed the virus DNA or something similar, so that a person's immune system doesn't attack the virus? Or would the virus then just keep replicating and cause other issues?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work at a medical library. Many years ago a professor at the desk got to rambling about his research, and mentioned that he'd discovered a gene the flies use to create fine blood vessels in their wings are expressed in humans to create fine blood vessels in the placenta during pregnancy. Those same genes don't show up in other mammals, only primates (or maybe just only humans).</p>
<p>According to him (mind you, this was 10 years ago and my memory's fuzzy), the working theory was that viruses were responsible, somehow. I think, like, it involved flies getting a virus that cut up their DNA, and some of that DNA was introduced into some primate by another virus, while the virus was trying to reproduce in primate cells. Then the primate ended up integrating the DNA into its genome, which by wild fluke was a beneficial development.</p>
<p>I wish I could talk to the guy again to have him tell me again, because it sounded wild and I'm sure I'm forgetting critical elements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Horizontal gene transfer. Retroviruses use a special enzyme to write their RNA to DNA and then put it inside host cell's DNA. Sometimes, this viral DNA gets expressed so a fully functional virus can be built. In some cases, a host gene might be nearby and get transcribed with the viral genes. Then, this virus with an additional gene might infect another organism's germline cells, integrate it's genetic material but not get expressed. The additional gene from the first organism might be fully functional. </p>
<p>It is possible for what you are saying to have happened. Not very probable for any specific case, but possible.</p></div>		</li>
