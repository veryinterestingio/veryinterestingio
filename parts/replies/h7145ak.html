			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure about chronic sleep restriction, but I do a lot of research pertaining to car accidents for my job and there's a definite correlation between drowsiness and crashes. The CDC says that driving while sleep-deprived is just as dangerous as drunk driving: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about\_sleep/drowsy\_driving.html#:\~:text=Studies%20have%20shown%20that%20going,(BAC)%20of%200.05%25.&text=Being%20awake%20for%20at%20least%2024%20hours%20is%20equal%20to,blood%20alcohol%20content%20of%200.10%25" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about\_sleep/drowsy\_driving.html#:\~:text=Studies%20have%20shown%20that%20going,(BAC)%20of%200.05%25.&text=Being%20awake%20for%20at%20least%2024%20hours%20is%20equal%20to,blood%20alcohol%20content%20of%200.10%25</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This has always raised a lot of questions to my mind. Like why is it legal and socially acceptable to schedule work shifts that would make it impossible for someone to get 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep? EMTs, for example, often work crazy hours, and also have to drive an ambulance. Retail managers often have to close (the store), and then turn around to open the next day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Driving while tired is scary! We should be allowed to stop and nap in our cars anywhere that we wouldn't be obstructing traffic. Better to have people sleeping in parking lots and residential areas than to have them causing potentially lethal accidents. </p>
<p>But of course if you stop to nap in front of someone's house or in their business's parking lot, they call the cops!</p></div>		</li>
