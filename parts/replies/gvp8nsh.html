			<div class="markdown"><p>Trials in this population are underway, but itâ€™s not looking great. At least in transplant patients, there seems to be a blunted (or no) response after a single dose of mRNA vaccine. Time will tell how this looks after a second dose. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Annecdote time:</p>
<p>I'm a 38 year-old transplant patient taking a cocktail of immunospressants.  I got the first dose of Pfizer in Feb, and had no adverse reaction to it (except  a sore arm).  After my second dose I got very very mild symptoms (slight aching joints, sore eyes).</p>
<p>After reading that after 1 dose there were little to no antibodies in immunosuppressed transplant patients, I was pleased to have some reaction no matter how minor.  I have no idea if I have any protection against Covid, and I'll still be taking precautions, but I do feel a bit more confident.</p>
<p>The likelihood is that studies will confirm that there is lower vaccine efficacy for people with compromised immune systems.  The real protection for us is from everyone else being vaccinated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For these patients, monoclonal antibodies will probably be the mainstay of treatment. Right now many are being used to prevent high-risk patients with mild to moderate covid from progressing to severe covid, but trials are planned to study their ability to fully prevent infection in un-infected individuals.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Seems like it would be extremely expensive to be giving monoclonal antibodies to people for preventative purposes on a long term basis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the 3 vaccines that are two doses, a significant level of protection is achieved after the first dose. Studies have shown between 60-80% protection after one dose which then increases after the 2nd dose. The 2nd dose is also thought to increase the durability of your immunity so it lasts longer.  </p>
<p>The protection from one dose has also been shown in real life data in the UK. They went with a strategy of delaying the 2nd dose to get as many people as possible their first dose. Looking at their case rate, you can see it is clearly working which shows that you are given some level of protection from 1 dose.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only that, but the 1nd dose may also have an effect on decease severity (on average). So you may still get sick, but with a better chance to experience a mild case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theres already evidence of permanent lung damage. There's far less chance of it killing a healthy unvaccinated 30 year old than someone elderly, but still a decent chance they will have issues for life. </p>
<p>But a vaccinated person, no matter the age, will have a much higher survival rate than anyone who isn't.</p></div>		</li>
