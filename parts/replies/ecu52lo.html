			<div class="markdown"><p>If the universe was static, then eventually yes.
However the universe is expanding which causes light from more distant objects to red shift as it travels through the cosmos.
So the light will red shift down to extremely low photon energies long before this happens.</p>
<p>The era of the Universe dominated by bright stars will be over within a hundred billion years, long before this can happen.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The finite age of the universe and the expansion of the universe are both sufficient to explain Olber's Paradox on their own, however it turns out that both are true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this mean that the universe could be infinitely old if you assume both that it has been expanding infinitely and there are an infinite number of stars that are far enough where the red shift causes those distant stars to be invisible?

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the cosmic microwave background (the after glow  of the big bang) has stretched out in wavelength due to the expansion of space, but at one time it would have shifted throught the visible light spectrum.

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an insufficient explanation. Even if all the stars in the observable universe were visible, space would still be much brighter than it is. The reason not all these stars are visible is because of redshift. The further away the stars are, the faster they are receding (Hubble's law). Therefore the further away the stars are, the more they are redshifted. Very far away stars are redshifted out of the visible spectrum (infrared) which is why the universe has a black background.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a scientist, but I suppose so.</p>
<p>The explanation still stands, because every star's emmision spectrum has a &quot;peak&quot; at a certain frequency of and declines as frequency goes up.</p>
<p>(For example the sun's spectrograph peaks in the Infrared) </p>
<p><a href="http://wtamu.edu/~cbaird/sq/images/sunlight_frequency.png" target="_blank">http://wtamu.edu/~cbaird/sq/images/sunlight_frequency.png</a></p>
<p>Redshift would cause the entire graph to shift to the left, and while a receding star wouldn't disappear immediately, it's visible brightness would decline exponentially after the peak of the graph enters the Infrared. </p>
<p>I didn't think about this until you pointed it out, and I could be wrong here, but that explanation makes sense to me</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are going to the wrong end of the spectrum. If things were going to increasingly higher frequencies life would be impossible. Things are shifted towards lower frequencies and I do believe that is why radio frequencies are so noisy. If I recall correctly this is the snow you would see on older televisions. This is also why we can see the Cosmic Microwave Background of the universe (in all directions?) marking the big bang.</p>
<p>Someone that has studied this more recently and in more depth should probably answer your question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the semi classical approximation this is true, but if you calculate the number of photons emitted by a star you get a rather large number. And thus a very large distance before this occurs</p>
<p>But then things like the observer effect start to intervene. Wave-particle duality makes thing very very screwy</p>
<p>EDIT:
Also the angular photon density of the star remains constant, the number of photons from the star that reach the observer falls, but the angular size of the star also falls. Which means overall the brightness of the sky will remain constant.</p>
<p>(Less energy reaches the observer but it Is concentrated into an ever smaller part of the sky, so energy per unit area stays the same.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's basically just another way of saying that if the universe is infinite and has infinitely many stars, then they together emit plane waves that don't diverge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The paradox is that, while what you mentioned is true — that brightness = luminosity/(4 <em> pi </em> r^2) — the number of stars in an imaginary shell surrounding you at r distance away will be related to that shell’s surface area . . . Which equals 4 <em> pi </em> r^2.</p>
