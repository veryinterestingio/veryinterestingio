<p>(and it's not a full immunity, should be clear but there are people who misunderstand this as a freeby not to use sunscreen)</p></div>		</li>

<p>You know every &quot;racial/cultural&quot; group that exists has evolved certain strengths and weaknesses. Some peoples can hold their breaths for 7 minutes. Some can see clearly underwater. Asian people have shallower eye-pits to better deflect constant winds and particles. </p>
<p>A notably easy statistic to see is that every group has some apparent resistances to some types of cancer, and penchant for others.</p>
<p>Yes. Darker people are more resistant to UV related skin cancers. But in turn, obviously, we also die more often from dehydration as our skin heats up too hot to let us vent it. We also can't get any laser skin treatments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe darker skin only has slightly more protection against UVB rays (the ones that cause sunburns), but not so much against UVA rays (the skin cancer ones), and it's only equivalent to an spf of about 13</p></div>		</li>
