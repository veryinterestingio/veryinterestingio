			<div class="markdown"><p>medline makes a bulk packed toilet paper (think like businesses and public restooms that buy by the case) that's something like 40% recycled and 60% bamboo/sugarcane/grass. it was surprisingly decent but it did cost more when we used it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate to say this and I have no idea how you could quantify it, but I'd imagine using this might do more harm than good. First, bamboo and sugar cane have to be shipped from very different parts of the world, and then be shipped to you. 100% post-consumer recycled toilet paper is almost certainly available from your local store. I have a hard time believing this is better. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might not be, but I suppose its possible that further development of the processes that use sugarcane bagasse or bamboo might lead to being able to do the same with wheat chaff or corn stalks? Turning waste cellulose products into useful stuff might have some promise if it can be localized to whatever a region's waste product is.</p></div>		</li>
