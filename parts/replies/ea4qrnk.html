<p>Edited to add, since I was being more glib than clear: I mean the change in the True Kilogram over centuries, not this week's redefinition.  &quot;The amount of matter in the True Kilogram has been changing over time&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;The way we define the fundamental units, such as the second, the kilogram, and the metre has been moved from relying on physical artefacts to using physical constants, The kilogram still weighs exactly one kilogram, but it is no longer defined as 'something that has the same mass as a lump of platinum in Paris.' It's now derived from a fundamental constant that is the same throughout the universe.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The mass of the True Kilogram hasn't changed, though, or at least not as a result of the new definition.  It's still 1kg, to the limit of experimental precision.  It's just that it used to be 1kg by definition.  So instead of the True Kilogram being exactly 1kg because everyone says it's 1kg, it's (almost) exactly 1kg because we've defined the kilogram (based on universal constants that don't change and can be measured independently) such that the True Kilogram just happens to be (almost) exactly 1kg.  With the added bonus that if the mass of the True Kilogram <em>does</em> change in the future, as pretty much all physical artifacts eventually do, we can now measure that change.  Before this, if the mass changed, we could never know if it did, or by how much, because we didn't have anything to measure it against.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The mass of the IPK - International Prototype Kilogram has fluctuated when compared to its copies.</p>
<p>It's mass, by definition, has not changed. But since all it's copies have changed slightly, then probably something about the IPK has too - maybe its composition, maybe it's amount of molecules.</p>
<p>We can't know for certain if the IPK lost matter or if its copies gained.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, now I have a question.</p>
<p>A second is defined as “the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the cesium 133 atom.”</p>
<p>1) How do you even measure that?</p>
<p>2) Can the duration a transition change based on temperature, pressure, etc.?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ooh, time metrology is so cool.
It's a pretty ingenious trick, I think. Since a wave's period is one over its frequency, if you can make something which oscillates at the same frequency as the caesium atom's hyperfine transition, then you have a clock ticking at 9192631770 times per second, and you can relatively easily calibrate everything else based on that.
So what happens is someone makes a microwave generator where you can adjust the frequency a bit. They adjust the frequency of the generator until the caesium atom absorbs the most light from the microwave generator (which is when they match) and use feedback loops to keep them locked together.
From there, it's a relatively easy process of multiplying by 9192631770.
The duration of transitions absolutely does drift with different environmental parameters! The full definition specifies that the caesium atom has to be at rest at absolute zero, but in practice your atoms have a nonzero temperature and velocity. One of the main troubles is that as temperature &amp;c become bigger, the uncertainty of the transition frequency gets bigger, so a lot of the work in making the most precise clocks is to compensate for that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the only way the duration varies is due to relativity. </p>
<p>If someone is traveling at 0.866 times the speed of light and has a cesium 133 atom with them you will only see 4,596,315,885 periods in his atom while yours do the normal 9,192,631,770 periods. But that's the thing with relativity, time is relative and 1 second is always 9,192,631,770 periods so it means that for that person only 0.5 seconds have passed in the time 1 second has passed for you. </p>
<p>Temperature means faster vibration and velocities of atoms so due to relativity the duration would change since the atoms is moving faster when at a higher temperature but it would be a incredibly tiny amount.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, good question. Well I work on quantum computers for my day-to-day and I got interested in some metrology projects which were relevant to that. It's not really my job to work on these bits of metrology, but I've published successfully in Metrologia recently and it's gained me a lot of social and intellectual capital. Thinking about it, I'm not really sure it counts as a side hustle as much as a pet project, but there's a chance it'll make me money in the long run. Does that satisfy you? :)</p></div>		</li>
