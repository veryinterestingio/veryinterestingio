<blockquote>
<p>Topaz is a semiprecious gemstone that occurs as very hard, transparent crystals in a variety of colors. It is naturally amber-colored, but becomes colorless after exposure to sunlight. Topaz forms within cavities of the volcanic rock rhyolite, from eruptions that occurred during the Tertiary Period six to seven million years ago. Topaz is embedded in the rhyolite rock, and also found loose on the slopes and arroyos. </p>

<p>Thanks, does the Topaz bleach from the outside in, or just fade uniformly? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure about Topaz, but for most gems that fade or change under UV, it will be a generally uniform shift if the stone itself is uniform in color to begin with. The UV radiation must hit a chemical bond in just the right way to break it. It's a bit like hitting the lottery, and most radiation will pass through the crystal without incident. The bonds that happen to line up correctly with any one UV photon will be, over time, distributed evenly all over the crystal. There's likely exceptions to this that I'm not aware of, in any case.</p>
<p>For a piece whose original color is already non-uniform, most likely because the impurities that result in that particular color are unevenly distributed, naturally the answer would be different.</p></div>		</li>
