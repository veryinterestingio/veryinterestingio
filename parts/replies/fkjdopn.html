			<div class="markdown"><p>Not at all.  As a doctor in the US I don't care and don't even know how I'd be able to find out, unless the patient/family told me.  I can look up insurance information if I need to (e.g. to arrange follow-up or to see what's on the insurance company's formularies), but it's not included in the demographic information I normally see on the computer.  For ICU level care it's irrelevant so I never bother.  The people involved in billing and the people involved in medical decision making rarely interact in the ER or hospital setting.</p>
<p>The only way it ever comes up is that rich assholes threaten legal action, and poor assholes threaten physical violence.  If you are on three vasopressors and the ventilator in the ICU it doesn't matter if you're a billionaire or homeless, things aren't looking good and there's not a lot that anybody can do for you.  Cost isn't really a consideration.  If anything we should be looking for ways to save money on everyone, but as it stands everyone gets treated the same and the hospital expects to get stiffed on the bill more often than not.</p>
<p>50 years ago this was a big issue.  Now we have EMTALA so hospitals prefer to avoid even the appearance that they're transfering or prematurely discharging patients based on financial reasons.  There are also Stark laws that prevent physicians from getting paid kickbacks or bonuses based on what we order.  You have two or more generations of physicians who trained under the current laws, so it's pretty much unthinkable for emergent and critical care.  For outpatient and elective stuff, yeah, you gotta be able to pay for it.</p></div>		</li>
