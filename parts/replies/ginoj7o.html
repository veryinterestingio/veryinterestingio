			<div class="markdown"><p>By your reasoning, does that mean we can never come up with a definition of “life”?</p>
<p>If we cannot, then I guess we’re done with this thread!  But if we can, then presumably we can then define non-life (as the complementary set to life: something is non-life if it doesn’t fall under the definition of life, excluding any boundary cases — although the boundary cases are interesting too, like viruses). And if we can do that, then we can ask how non-life can become life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, we can. But that's going to be an arbitary line - I'm not aware of anythign fundamentaly different.</p>
<p>We are indeed able to ask how non-life (by a given definition) becomes life. But as long as the line is arbitary, the question lacks any deeper meaning. </p>
<p>I may be in the wrong, but to me the original question comes with the implication that &quot;life&quot; and &quot;non-life&quot; are fundamentally different, and as such there needs to be a special way for the jump from one category to happen. I'm critiquing the assumption that there is a fundamental difference.</p>
<p>If the intent was to just ask &quot;by what mechanism set of basic chemicals became a more complex, self-reproducing set of chemicals&quot;, that's very valid and intersting, and adequately answered elsewhere in the thread :)</p>
<p>(By fundamentally different I mean something like phases of matter - separate, discrete, clearly inherently different with crystal clear line separating them. By not fundametally different would be something like sepration between liquid and solid with amorphous substances - there really is no &quot;right&quot; answer to when the transition happens, and it's just a matter of convention)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bacteria are considered alive, but I doubt that they are conscious in a way that's at all similar to what we consider consciousness. &quot;Life&quot; is usually defined by having means of reproduction, reaction to stimuli etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would it be? You need brains for that. I think there is no good definition of life, that excludes everything, thats not alive</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, no. I'm hoping you don't get any snarky comments or get downvoted, because this is an excellent moment to learn something.</p>
<p>Our current definition of &quot;life,&quot; or the things that separate something &quot;dead&quot; from something &quot;alive,&quot; is that living things have the <strong>capacity for growth, reproduction, functional activity, and continual change preceding death</strong> (source: Oxford Languages.)</p>
<p>By that definition, an oak tree is just as alive as any person, even if the tree doesn't have consciousness while the person does.</p>
<p>When it comes to describing the spectrum of intelligence in life, there are a few terms you need to know:</p>
<ol>
<li>Consciousness: an entity that is conscious means that it is aware of itself and the world around it.</li>
<li>Sentience: sentience is the ability of a conscious entity to sense their environment or have the capacity to feel emotion. Essentially, it is subjective consciousness.</li>
<li>Sapience: wisdom, or rather, knowledge and the ability to apply that knowledge.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, which living things do or do not exhibit these traits can be debated, but if I'm not misunderstanding the concepts (and someone please do point it out if I've made a mistake,) the loose hierarchy goes like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most humans are conscious, sentient, and sapient.</li>
<li>Most mammals are conscious, might be sentient, but probably aren't usually sapient.</li>
<li>Living things in the Animal Kingdoms of Plants, Fungi, Protista, and Monera probably aren't conscious, sentient, or sapient.</li>
