			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also less cooks because it's less time consuming to make a dozen 20-person portions of food to throw in a serving tray than it is to make even 20 individual-portion meals. Dishwashing is the closest next bottleneck, but once again it's made up for by the fact that the dishwashers don't need to stock the cook areas to be plated they just need to dump a stack of 60 plates into a warmed dispenser.</p>
<p>We had twice to three times as many cooks depending on the night in the traditional restaurant compared to the buffet for the same traffic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having worked at a movie theatre I feel obligated to share the truth of this.</p>
<p>Soda is the single biggest rip off  next to popcorn when it comes to cost vs price.  Now, popcorn is an even bigger offender. A 50 lb bag of kernels is roughly $20. A 5 gallon bag of syrup for coke is like $100 give or take. There are roughly 3oz of kernels in a large popcorn $7.50 price. That means a profit margin of $5800 per 50 lb bag of popcorn when you get a large. There are roughly 3oz of syrup in a 16oz soda. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True. Seeing &quot;getting your money's worth&quot; only in the view of someone else losing money is a sad way to live. It's why people spend hours looking for deals and buy sub-quality crap that they won't even need. Cool, you think you beat Wal-mart by buying 7 packs of margarine using an exclusive internet coupon. Enjoy your 1-day till expry margarine you wont use -- you TOTALLY bested Wal-mart by purchasing goods they had to get rid of!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know about other places, but here in Texas waitstaff are paid $2.13 an hour. Dirt cheap labor and they usually pitch in to help. I worked at a buffet and we had waitstaff that only brought drinks. They also bussed the tables, so saved money there. You try to let as much of your kitchen help go home as soon as possible; that’s where the labor costs really are, and then you overwork the managers (50-60 hours a week).  At least, that’s the way the buffet restaurant I worked in operated. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Federal min wage is always effectively higher than that ... you can't really be paid $2.13/hr.  That is, you can be paid $2.13/hr, however the total of your tips must still be equal (or higher) to the $7.25 federal level.  So, if your tips any given week were low, the company has to pay out the difference.  </p>
<p>If any employer is actually paying any staff less than an effective rate of $7.25, they are breaking federal employment law.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is technically true, but largely ignored. I have never seen a company cut a check to an employee to compensate for low wages in any given week. In the long run, most servers make well over minimum wage. If you don’t you’re in the wrong profession. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While not wrong, that difference over $2.13/hr isn't in the operating costs of the buffet restaurant as most servers make enough in tips to bump them over the minimum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where I live, it is a family business.  Their kids are working the register when they aren't in school.  Mom is the manager, Dad is the cook.  2 waitresses that also clean tables.  You pay up front before eating.  The food is excellent.  I have watched them make the sushi and sashimi and it is pretty fresh.  Some of it is hard to mess up (California Roll).  They also do to go at $4 a lbs.  I can get a lot of sushi for $4, or load up on all the other food they have.</p></div>		</li>
