			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, I that's exactly what I would expect them to do.</p>
<p>Somebody else mentioned 5 positions with 5 depths giving 3125 combinations. Well, change that to 7 positions with 7 depths and you're getting close to a million. 8 positions and you're at closer to 7 million.</p>
<p>With 7 depths, you'd need 7 unique parts (if I understand locks correctly). Not that hard to arrange with a robotic process. Print the number with the associated box (to order multiple locks that work with the same key), mill a number of blank keys accordingly (also possibly an automated process).</p>
<p>Mix in a few different manufacturers, and you have plenty of potentially unique keys. Doesn't at all seem unreasonable to me - it's really quite similar to dealing with digital data, but in a physical form.</p>
<p>Hell, if this is the modern standard, maybe I should start a lock business! Of course, a lock mainly provides psychological safety.</p></div>		</li>
