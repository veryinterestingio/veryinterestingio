			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. Unlike other immunosuppressants like steroids, or those used in organ transplants, anti histamines pretty much work specifically on those symptoms associated with seasonal allergies etc.</p>
<p>The majority of the Immunsystem ist completely unaffected by blocking those responses to histamin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was unaware that allergy medicines work as anti-inflammatories. Does that mean that other anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen may assist, even if not as effectively, for allergy responses?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Allergy medicines aren't quite anti-inflammatoires. Inflammation is a process that can be triggered by a number of things. Anti-inflammatoires tune down inflammation, while allergy medicines block the signal that triggers the inflammation.</p>
<p>That said, anti-inflammatoires will reduce some allergy symptoms (ie. inflammation and its secondary effects) but not all symptoms. You'd still sneeze loads, and would probably have a runny nose, but you might get a little less puffy and congested. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Paracetamol isnâ€™t considered an anti inflammatory. It modulates the endocannabinoid system as opposed to inhibiting the action of COX. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer, can you also comment on this : I've often heard many of the serious health problems humans encounter as they get older are down to the damaging effects inflammation has and how the body applies it indiscriminately or non localised, is that the case? And if inflammation was somehow eliminated unless induced artificially by us when needed, would our lifespans and quality of life increase?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The role of inflammation in aging and long term disease is still being explored to be honest. For example, it's well established that people with recurring depression tend to have low-level systemic inflammation. This doesn't mean that the inflammation is the cause - it may be a side-effect of the actual cause. Anti-inflammatoires haven't shown much effect on depression. </p>
<p>Also, inflammation can be extremely helpful in every day situations. Your small cuts and bruises would heal a lot slower and a lot less well without it, for example. There's also increasing evidence that long term use of anti-inflammatoires can be very damaging. I don't think it's clear yet whether it's the medicines themselves or the lack of inflammation that is culprit, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really, I did not know that about depression and will research that further, I also learned that the inflammation lets healing cells access the area more easily which makes sense and is interesting. </p></div>		</li>
