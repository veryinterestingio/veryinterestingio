			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem here is that the insertion point of the triceps is actually on the olecranon not on the shaft of the ulna making it not quite analogous to leg extension. For those not as familiar with anatomy, this means that no matter what way you position your arm the tendon that the triceps uses to pull is always basically straight, meaning there is no place to insert a fulcrum. This is contrary to the leg where the quadriceps tendon bends around your knee. </p>
<p>Your original explanation was perfect though!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep! Increasing the length of the olecranon achieves the same effect as the patella.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Point of interest: the kneecap is a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesamoid_bone" target="_blank">semasoid bone</a> meaning it's a bone that develops due to stress on the tendon.  Babies don't have them, and don't start developing them until they start walking.</p>
<p>It's possible, in extreme cases, to develop semasoid bones naturally in unusual places, like elbows, as other follow-ups have asked about surgically inserting them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That can't be the reason: dogs have kneecaps and no elbow caps, and they <em>do</em> walk around on their &quot;hands&quot; all day.   </p>
<p>Bipedalism is not the reason we have kneecaps, because non-bipedal animals also have kneecaps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is correct. Quadrupeds in general generate the largest amount of force in their hind legs, where the patella still provides mechanical advantage. The orientation of bones in the forelimbs is also different, with the olecranon of the ulna providing advantage in lieu of a patella-like structure.</p></div>		</li>
