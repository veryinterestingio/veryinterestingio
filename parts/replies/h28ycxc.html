			<div class="markdown"><p>True, free floating RNA is a natural adjuvant because normally it's supposed to be inside cells so it's either invading RNA or a sign of cell damage (which is of course what adjuvants are supposed to mimic).</p>
<p>But the thing is, I thought these vaccines aren't just free floating RNA, precisely because it is so readily destroyed by the immune system. IIrc they package the RNA in a lipid vesicle to shield it until it enters the cell, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eventually the RNA will be released from the nanoparticles, and then they will probably cause the adjuvant effect. Probably the nanoparticles themselves (without the RNA) also enhance the immune response.
I don't think the exact pathways are well understood already.</p></div>		</li>
