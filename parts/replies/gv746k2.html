			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for this great question! Antimicrobial use in animals is a major contributor to the problem of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) which is why the push to approach this issue from a &quot;One Health&quot; perspective is gaining prominence worldwide. Not only are antibiotics used in animals for treatment of infections, but they're also used for prophylactic purposes and have been used for growth enhancement. Also, many medically important antibiotics that are used in clinical settings are used in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>To tackle this problem in the US, the Food and Drug Administration has a &quot;Five-Year Plan for Supporting Antimicrobial Stewardship in Veterinary Settings&quot;. FDA has issued guidance documents that will help industry change the approved marketing status of medically important antibiotics from over-the-counter (OTC) to prescription (Rx). FDA has also eliminated the use of these medically relevant antibiotics for animal growth promotion purposes. Countries around the world are also taking steps to tackle this issue. For instance, Denmark banned the use of growth promoting antibiotics in food animals</p>
<p>In the future, I expect greater emphasis on the use of vaccines in animals for disease prevention as well as robust disease management practices.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The CDC has been promoting Hospital Antibiotic Stewardship Programs and keeps track of physician prescription patterns. Maybe we'll see a similar program be implemented for veterinarians.</p></div>		</li>
