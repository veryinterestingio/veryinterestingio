			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. The chemical is called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_luciferin" target="_blank">Luciferin</a>” and the enzyme that catalyzes the reaction “Luciferase”. I can add that different species flash their lights in different patterns so they can help tell each other apart, and that they flash in a sequence that is kind of unpredictable if you don’t know the code so it helps attract mates but not predators.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting tidbit about these chemicals, Luciferin/Luciferase are used in biology sometimes as bioluminescent indicators for certain experiments. The reaction was used pretty regularly until the discovery of GFP and other fluorescent proteins, which serve that purpose better because they fluoresce (which requires only light, not chemical stimilus), while the Luciferin/Luciferase reaction requires Calcium (I think).</p>
<p>Fluorescent proteins are really cool, and so are many of the animals they come from.</p>
<p>Edit: I've gotten some replies from people who still use luciferase for assays, so it wasn't replaced by fluorescent proteins; they're just more convenient for certain applications, and can be used in ways that the luciferase reaction cannot, but I assume the inverse is also true.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It takes ATP and then oxygen to decarboxylate Luciferin into oxyluciferin. Oxyluciferin then produces a single photon from it's excited state.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another interesting tidbit. We use cells tagged with GFP and Luciferase to measure the amount of cells (cancer cells in my field). We can inject these cells into mice, treat them, and track their cancer burden by injecting the mice with luciferin and take an image in a fancy machine. We can take blood samples from these mice and run them on a FACS machine that looks at cells on a singular level. We use the GFP to differentiate them from mouse cells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I still use luciferase! I  actually just ran an assay last week that I'm still analyzing. I could probably use GFP just as well, but this assay is really easy to do and very quantifiable, which is useful since I'm comparing different conditions to each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is confusing. Because of the complexity of the pattern and periodic gaps when they don't shine light it is hard for predators to figure out where they are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe they are “honest signal” by the firefly to warn potential predators that they are not a good meal. Similar to how poisonous animals tend to be brightly colored.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are they signaling this to other creatures or is it possible the would be predators instinctually know these guys aren’t worth eating either way? It seems like the aversion to brightly colored animals would be instinct right off the bat because messing it up means death, unlike with light bugs.</p>
<p>But since it doesn’t kill them could it become an instinct or have to remain a learned thing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In this case they are really toxic, so anything eating one gets really sick and learns not to eat the glowy thing again... except for some predators which specialize in eating them.  One type of Firefly has females that eat male fireflies of other species by luring them in with flashes of their species and then eating them.</p></div>		</li>
