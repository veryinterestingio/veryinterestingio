			<div class="markdown"><p>You're drummer does sounds a bit obsessed with tuning if they down tune with the band!  I might do a quick checkup before practice but I'm not fucking around with tuning after that.  It is true that each drum has a range of pitches it can be tuned in, but they don't necessarily have to be tuned to standard guitar tuning.  They just have to compliment each other and not sound dissonant.</p></div>		</li>
