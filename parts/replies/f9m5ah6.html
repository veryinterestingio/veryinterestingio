			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're talking about the pure, unoxidized metal, then yes you would be correct. The d orbital -&gt; s orbital transitions typically take more energy than what's available for visible light so none of it gets absorbed.</p></div>		</li>

The others are not all the same shade of grey either. You can definitely tell a lot of them apart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolute side tangent, but when you said unoxidized it made me think... What would it look like if you managed to polish rust.</p>
<p>I don't know if it'd be possible as the formation of iron oxide dramatically changes its physical structure. But if it's possible to get enough rust together to polish it, I wonder what it would look like</p>
<p>Edit: I'm dumb, hematite exists and can be polished...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Osmium metal has a nice blue hue to it. It’s my favorite looking metal. The pictures online don’t do it justice but it’s  <a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/EyGdaGYXpWJaSqFw9" target="_blank">noticeable</a> especially when next to other metals.<br />
And as far as the others they are close to silver in color but there are differences in their shades of grey. Some are lighter, some are darker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh. There's an interesting difference in density in that image - all three billets are one troy ounce, but the ruthenium billet is much bigger than the iridium and osmium billets.</p>
<p>Also interesting that the ruthenium billet is 0.0001% more pure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where does the blue light go when it is 'absorbed'. Do the photons at a particular frequency just hit the gold atom particles, and then bounce around inside the gold and fail to escape? Or do the photons get converted into something in the gold?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a more generic ELI5 question about light absorption in general (it's not specific to metals), but essentially all absorbed light becomes heat energy. It's just incredibly minor amounts of heat ( usually, for gold materials).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When a photon hits a gold atom it either gets reflected or absorbed by an electron, depending on its wavelength. (In general it could also go straight through, or be “transmitted”, but this is gold so that almost never happens.) The reflected light is what you see when you look at it, and the absorbed light is quite literally “absorbed” by the electron and ceases to exist. Energy must still be conserved, though, so the total energy of the photon gets transferred to the electron. The electron then has more energy than it’s able to hold on to, so it quickly (in much less than a second) loses that extra energy by giving it to the rest of the gold lattice structure. This causes the gold to vibrate a little bit more, or in other words, the gold heats up slightly.</p></div>		</li>
