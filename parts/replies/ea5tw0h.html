<p>I've always been jealous of singers with power and range.  I was born with a good ear and musical talent, and was a singer in choirs for a few years (took voice lessons and all that).  But I just wasn't born with strong &quot;pipes&quot;.  </p>
<p>I imagine it's a bit like having natural talent for basketball but being very short.  </p>
<p>Anyway, not trying to throw myself a pity party, a lot of people are in this situation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Throw away this &quot;I just wasn't born with strong &quot;pipes&quot;&quot; mindset. It's a debilitating and limiting mindset that holds so many people back. As soon as singers drop that belief they usually see rapid improvement. </p>
<p>The 'hardware' of a powerful singer isn't much different than anyone else. They don't have stronger arytenoid muscles or kevlar coated cords. If you can cough you have orders of magnitude more vocal cord strength than you will ever need for singing. A powerful singer is using <em>less</em> laryngeal muscle than a straining soft beginner, not more. </p>
<p>Singing with power is a muscle <em>coordination</em> thing and has almost nothing to do with the actual makeup of the cords or laryngeal muscle strength. If you doubt this listen to the power and projection of a floppy newborn who can't lift their head and has had <em>zero time</em> building up their vocal muscles. </p>
<p>If you've taken voice lessons try a new teacher that doesn't put limiting beliefs in your head. My first teacher gave me limiting beliefs about my voice's capabilities and I smashed them all (and she was in a prestigious music school). Most of singing is <em>unlearning</em> neural inhibitions and <em>not</em> contracting certain muscles. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While he’s correct that you can learn to sing with power through practice and training. There IS the factor of you chest size and your head size. AKA your breath source and your resonating cavern. For opera singers (especially male) this can be a huge factor in your sound output because you’re able to create much more breath pressure. </p>
<p>BUT unless you’re trying to be an opera singer, these two thing won’t stop you from having a relatively powerful voice. There are some small opera singers who just learned extremely good vocal coordination and breath management and you can as well. And if a small person can sing over a 50 piece orchestra, you can have strong pipes. Your actual vocal folds can be trained and more importantly correct breathing for singing can be trained and practiced. </p>
<p>Breath exercises every day. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not about the ability to push out lots of air, it's about the skills required to control that flow of air and to make it resonate. I used to suuuuuck at singing, but I've made huge strides to get better in just a few months! You most definitely can, too!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never lost my voice so I have a very hard time relating to people who say they've lost their voice. Is it that it just hurts too much to try talking or that they literally can't make sound no matter how hard they try? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I must have a sensitive throat because I lose my voice at least once a year. One time I wasn't even sick, but woke up without a voice whatsoever for a couple hours. I could whisper, that was it, no vocal chord participation at all. But if I have already a sore throat and then I have to talk (I work in a retail environment), it'll exacerbate it to where I'll lose my voice through the day.  </p>
<p>Have you never been at an exciting concert or sporting event where everyone's screaming and yelling? I've definitely lost my voice due to an overly exciting hockey game also.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You go to speak and the sound has gaps in it like a phone with a bad signal, and some parts of speech come out high pitched and squeaky. You can't control it but you can try to overcome it by speaking louder, with more force, but that can hurt and it hinders your vocal cords from healing so it's best to just keep quiet.</p></div>		</li>
