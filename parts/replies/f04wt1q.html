			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the explanation. I have a follow-up question. Commonly, you'll see people recommending turning this feature off. Is this to improve performance (ie it's a taxing process on the computer)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  There are different methods to applying and rendering the Anti-Aliasing.  There is FXAA, MSAA, TSAA, etc.  FXAA (fast approximate anti-aliasing) being the most common and least resource intensive (Even to the point that it has little to no performance hit when enabled and improves image quality by quite a bit).  MSAA (Multisample anti-aliasing) is usually regarded as more resource heavy and requires a bit more power.  </p>
<p>It's also good to note that you can choose WHAT does the anti-aliasing.  Do you want the Software/Game/Program to handle it?  Or do you want to override it and force your own settings via your video card?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>SSAA (supersampling anti-aliasing) is generally the most resource-intensive, and it works by taking a higher-resolution version of the image and averaging it at the edges to create a smoother change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That depends. There are multiple ways to do anti-aliasing. Some of them are more expensive because they use multiple samples of a pixel to a better value, so it can increase performance to not do that. Other techniques are applied to a finished image. These are generally pretty fast, but they can make the resulting image kind of blurry looking. Depending on preference, that may be less desirable than the aliasing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As monitor/TV resolutions increase the jaggies are less of an issue, the problem now is that highly detailed textures can cause aliasing shimmer/strobing which is much more jarring.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why at 1440p on a 27&quot; monitor, I disable AA on every game because I don't notice the jaggies, it runs better without any AA anyway. Of course it's a big performance hit to run at a resolution larger than 1080p.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>The jagged appearance of curved objects on a screen is called aliasing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's like somebody asked what &quot;food&quot; means and you answered by describing the shape of a toblerone.</p>
<p>And even in terms of video game bullshit, that's still wrong. The problem <a href="https://i.imgur.com/3SIFFg4.png" target="_blank">is not curves, but angles</a>. The &quot;aliasing&quot; is where e.g. a perfectly straight line at an 80 degree angle doesn't appear straight, but instead looks like some sawtooth or triangle wave.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, trying to figure out a way to describe &quot;aliasing&quot; was substantially harder than describing what anti-aliasing is, haha! I suppose I missed the mark on that one. </p>
<p>You're right, it is more about angles than curves! I don't know why I focused so heavily on curves</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As the name hints, aliasing is what happens when a signal is ambiguous or misrepresented, usually due to a lack of information, and the resulting message ends up with distortions and artifacts.  Anti-aliasing is the process of mitigating or removing these distortions.</p>
<p>Aliasing is a fundamental problem with transmitting information.  Most of the time, the information we want to send (be it audio, video, etc) is going to exceed the available bandwidth we have to send it.  And any time this happens, information must be removed, and the removal of that information will result in aliasing, because now multiple </p>
<p>It's hard to describe because we've done a really good job at solving this problem.  A CD can seem pretty damn accurate, as will a 32 megapixel image on a retina display.  The caveat is that these will only seem accurate to humans.  If we were dogs, you could easily describe aliasing by <del>barking</del> saying, &quot;aliasing is the funny way CDs sound!&quot;  Likewise, a falcon would not be impressed by your DSLR picture displayed on your Macbook Pro.</p></div>		</li>
