			<div class="markdown"><p>It's possible that some aspects are relics of an earlier time. At some point, shirts served a very practical purpose. We soon decided boobs were sexy. Then, even when western culture spread to places where shirts aren't so necessary, we kept them because boobs didn't stop being sexy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some places never picked up the &quot;boobs are sexy&quot; idea though. I've heard in a lot of non-westernized parts of the world our men are seen as infantile for being obsessed with breasts. Because the only real purpose they serve is for babies. Women there gob top less and no one cares because it's about as sexy as a hand or elbow to them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>and that is a very valid point. but the question is when were clothes first used and why? was it for modesty (sexualization came first), or was it from necessity (clothes hiding bits making them mysterious, and more alluring). i think if that question can be answered, so will the question in the original post. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well think about it, in northern climates where it's colder we spend way more time with our whole bodies covered. That could have had a great deal to do with how the unusual uncovered body became the taboo. Whereas hotter climates have seemed to have much less stigma around naked bodies. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the only counter argument is that the NEED for clothes POSSIBLY came first in which case it would be the other way around. but since the biological drive to reproduce has been around since the beginning, even before our need of clothes (fur and such from more primate times), i will still stand by my first thought.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's worth noting that what <em>causes</em> different cultures to sexualize what they do is a complex and nuanced question under active study. A search for &quot;sexualize&quot; or &quot;sexualization&quot; on Pubmed or Google Scholar will give you hundreds of results on different facets of sexualization in a number of different cultures. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two case studies on this topic.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>After the invention of photography , Victorian society had photographs of naked children.  However, at that time, naked kids were considered to be an artistic representation of &quot;nature&quot; and &quot;innocence&quot;.  Woah how times have changed on that subject.</p>
</li>
<li>Child beauty pageants were  banned in France just less than 5 years ago, after having been legal for decades.  Some statements made by parliamentarians prior to passage were eye-opening.  </li>

<p>The general society does not see those photos as sexual. Rather people recognize that a small segment of society does and that there is a danger. Those photos are better because we don't see children as sexual </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You say that, but I think a lot of people would feel uncomfortable just <em>looking</em> at child nudity, even in an artistic context and in private. That's nothing to do with us worrying about other people being pedophiles, we're uncomfortable because we view children sexually. Compare this to babies, which we would be less uncomfortable seeing naked. I think the age that we are no longer comfortable seeing naked is getting lower.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not really. Many parents have photos of their naked kids. Some friends have even posted an occasional photo on social media.</p></div>		</li>
