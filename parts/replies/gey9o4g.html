<p><em>That we know of yet</em>. Let's stick to science, we can't categorically state that he/she may <em>not</em> have Neanderthal superpowers! /s</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My father in law had the same info on his test. Check it carefully...does it say you have 86% more neanderthal dna? Or does it say you are in the 86th percentile? Those aren't the same thing. 86th percentile means you have more than 86% of the people in the tested population, but it could be that you only have 5 or 10% more dna bases than most people. Does that make sense?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You say .86% isn't noticeable but we share 60% of our dna with bananas. So 40% is the difference between us and a fruit, I'd think around 1% could have some noticeable effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think thereâ€™s slightly more to the science between humans not being living bananas than a 40% difference in DNA.</p>
<p>Donâ€™t forget: everything on earth evolved from a single ancient ancestor. The DNA of everything on the planet must be fairly similar.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;I think thereâ€™s slightly more to the science between humans not being living bananas than a 40% difference in DNA.&quot;</p>
<p>Since DNA is the blueprint for each organism that 40% is everything.  After all, in terms of DNA a 40% difference is huge.  Less than 2% separates us from chimpanzees and less than 3% separates elephants from their closest living relative, the small furry hyrax.  40% is more than enough to separate mammals from fruit.</p></div>		</li>
