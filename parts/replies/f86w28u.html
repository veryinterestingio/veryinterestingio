			<div class="markdown"><p>I learned in a tox class that chemicals can be absorbed through the skin and enter the blood stream. Why doesnâ€™t this happen with topical ointments used on skin or open wounds? Wouldnâ€™t they quickly end up in the bloodstream, also producing systemic effects?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably certain chemicals, not all of them. You can't be hydrated by taking a shower. If skin were so permeable, it'd defeat the purpose of skin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>(1) An ointment is lipophilic, preventing it from being absorbed readily into into the skin (compared to a moisturizing cream for example that is easily absorbed because it is hydrophilic).</p>
<p>(2) The amount of drug in the tiny bit of ointment you put on your skin isnâ€™t nearly enough to reach toxic levels (or even therapeutic levels) in the blood even if it was fully absorbed through the skin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correction, lipophilic substances more easily diffuse through the skin (cells are lipids after all). Which is why topical steroids (very lipophilic) readily diffuses through. </p>
<p>But your second point is entirely correct, even if parts of something diffuses, skin does not absorb everything, and blood concentrations will generally be low. Increase the concebtration or surface area, and you can get more significant dosage (a ton of nicotine or phentanyl patches)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if the skin barrier and size of the wound inhibits how much is absorbed? Perhaps the amount of ointment used is also not too large and maybe doesn't contain quite as high of a percentage of antibiotics?</p>
<p>Just some thoughts. I don't study life sciences, but have an interest in it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the drug molecules mostly, highly lipophilic molecules such as fentanyl can be absorbed through the skin hence patches for systemic absorption.</p>
<p>Older patients generally have thinner skin as well and absorb drugs more readily, regardless you have to really try to formulate topicals to get into the blood stream and use highly concentrated formulas to get modest absorption.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah - anesthesia; we aren't really antibiotic experts (that's more infectious disease and probably to some degree family practice / hospitalists), but we give prophylactic antibiotics before surgery ('just in case' stuff isn't as sterile as hoped having a therapeutic blood level of appropriate drugs is good risk mitigation), so 'what drug is appropriate to what surgical site' and 'what's a decent back up if people have allergies' is in our day to day. (This is mostly just basic pharmacology stuff that anyone would get in a decent pharm 101 sort of class)</p></div>		</li>
