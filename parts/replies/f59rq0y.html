			<div class="markdown"><p>I give my engineering students a problem related to that. I set a bottle of Dasani on the desk and say &quot;Estimate the probability that some of that water was peed by Julius Caesar&quot;. Spoiler: It's essentially a slam dunk.</p>
<p>The key to solution is that the number of molecules in a liter of water is <em>very</em> much bigger than the number of liters in the oceans...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s interesting, but I was thinking more in terms of a discernible quantity. Dinosaurs were in the billions at any point in time and lasted hundreds of millions of years. A lot of water went down their gullets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hold up this doesn’t seem right at all. Sure if you are comparing molecules to liters there is a large difference, but considering that there are orders of magnitude more molecules of water in the ocean I don’t see how its a “slam dunk” of a probability your bottle of water to contain the urine of Julius Caesar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way to set it up is to build an expression for the probability that one given molecule in the bottle is NOT a Caesar molecule; raise that to a power equal to the number in the bottle; then subtract what you have from 1.
Well, whaddya know, it's been on Reddit before: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/2dgnun/what_is_the_chance_the_average_person_has_redrunk/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/2dgnun/what_is_the_chance_the_average_person_has_redrunk/</a></p></div>		</li>
