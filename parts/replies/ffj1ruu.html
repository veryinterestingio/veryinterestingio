<p>Very few species engage in recreational intercourse in nonfertile periods overall, too.  Dogs don't mate unless the female is in heat.  When she does go into heat, she puts out very clear signals to males in that fertile period prior to ovulation.</p></div>		</li>

They earned less during non-fertile phases, and those on hormonal birth control didn't have increases or decreases that were quantifiable.  </p>
<p>It's been a while since I read the article, but the authors suggested there might be subtle fertility signals sent to their customers. Or maybe the strippers danced better.</p></div>		</li>

They don't know whether it's the men sub consciously aware that the woman is ovulating (whether by pheromones or signals etc) and is more attractive, or because women feel more sexy during ovulation, so the stripper is putting more on a show and getting more tips for it.</p></div>		</li>

As soon as she heard them howling she was like hey big boy what’s up and wanted to breed our lab is a little slut haha</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lots of herbivorous species do it. White-tail deer for example definitely do it. And it makes alot of sense. It makes most sense to give birth during the spring when vegetation is plentiful and temperatures are warmer. The whitetail gestation period is about 6.5 months, so mating in the later months of the year, would put the birth in the first third of the year around the spring-early summer time.</p>
<p>The rut usually starts around September-October timeframe (depending on how far north you live) which is when both males and females are seeking mates to reproduce. In the months leading up to this, white-tail bucks have a big increase in testosterone, begin growing antlers to fight, and start &quot;scraping&quot; or marking territories by digging a shallow hole and peeing on their own knees, which contain glands that secrete potent pheromones. The whitetail does start joining groups or &quot;harems&quot; around the alpha bucks. And the bucks end up losing alot of weight, spending alot of their time roaming and fighting to contest the alpha bucks. The bucks and does fornicate, and around January-February, the bucks shed their antlers and their testosterone levels drop, and the does leave the harems. This is the point when their sex drives shut down, and will restart again a few weeks before the rut. Typically outside of the rut, does dont want much to do with the bucks. They will live and eat together, but they keep their distance, and focus on finding food to carry the fawn until birth in the late spring.   </p>
<p>Source: not a zoologist, just an avid deer hunter that has learned alot about deer mating patterns, as they directly apply to the hunt. May have gotten some things wrong, this is generally what i have read and observed out in the field.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Crouching on their knees to pee or aiming to actually pee onto their knees? I think the former but idk shit about deer.</p>
<p>Also, their knees secrete hormones or their pee? I think the latter but again I'm clueless lol.</p></div>		</li>
