			<div class="markdown"><p>Momentum is kg(m/s) while mass is just kg.  So, no, you can't state a photon's momentum in terms of mass, as they have different units altogether.</p>
<p>What you can do is convert a photon's <em>energy</em> (which is purely kinetic) into units of mass using the relation E=mc^(2), however this is <em>just</em> a convenient unit conversion and does not have any real conceptual merit.  The resulting quantity is typically called &quot;relativistic mass&quot; and is widely considered outdated and redundant, as it is always numerically equal to a body's total energy up to a conversion factor, and we already have a more intuitive name for that concept:  &quot;total energy.&quot;  So relativistic mass just isn't used anymore because it adds no value and only serves to confuse the difference between the concepts of mass and energy.</p>
<p>Hope that helps,</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because we completely arbitrarily picked mass as a base unit because it was easy to measure and fix reliably at the time of the creation of the metric and MKS (metre-kilogram-second) systems. The predecessors of SI. </p>
<p>Take electric charge for example. Ampere is the base unit of SI, but really a coulomb (As) would make more sense as an ampere is just a coulomb flow rate. Ampere was just easier to measure and deal with at the time the MKS was being made in the late 1800's. Millikan didn't determine the electron charge until 1910. The electron charge NOW weirdly back defines the amp first rather than the coulomb as we can quite accurate define charge as a constant. But amp is still the SI base, weird or not.  </p>
<p>Looking at E^2 = (mc^2 )^2 + p^2 c^2 , you'll probably note that a joule might be a more natural base unit. That would make kg = Jm^2 / s^2 and momentum Js/m. There we go, &quot;no mass in momentum&quot; now as per your thought process. Just energy, time, and distance. This is equally as valid as saying kgm/s. Both &quot;mass and momentum have energy&quot;, and &quot;momentum has no mass&quot;. I know you may be thinking, isn't momentum on an everyday day level p=mv? Sure, but it's also p=2E/v too. Hell, if we're feeling like reinventing an arbitrary decision, we could have made momentum the base unit and energy and mass based on it.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I think that's one of those physics &quot;white lies.&quot; It conveys something true (rest-energies dwarf kinetic energies in our everyday experience), but for the wrong reason (it's still true when setting c=1, as c is just a unit-conversion factor).</p>
<p>The relevant equation in natural units is E = m/sqrt(1 - v^(2)), which shows that kinetic energy (E - m) is far less than mass (rest-energy) at everyday speeds, and doesn't equal it until v gets to sqrt(3)/2, or ~0.866. So the rest-energies of the macroscopic things around us are far greater than kinetic energies we ever encounter.</p>
<p>But of course the E=mc^2 &quot;explanation&quot; is easier to grok.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm still not understanding how massless photons have momentum, even by setting m=0 in the full equation. How does that give us the value of p (momentum)?</p>
<p>In other words, I'm not understanding how I &quot;can see this by setting m=0,&quot; but I also dont math so good</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, photons are massless, but have energy, so for photons you have <code>E² = p²c² + 0</code>. After reducing, you get <code>E = pc</code>. This is the basis for photonic momentum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, the photon's energy is actually determined by its frequency: E = hf where h is a constant known as Planck's constant and f is the frequency of the light (think of its frequency as what &quot;color&quot; it is). </p>
<p>We can equate this to the whole E^2  =  (pc)^2  + (mc^2 )^2 thing but since we know that the photon is massless, this reduces to E = pc or, equivalently, p = hw/c.</p>
<p>Fun fact, this momentum is the reason why &quot;solar sails&quot; are actually a feasible idea for space travel.</p></div>		</li>
