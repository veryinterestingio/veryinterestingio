			<div class="markdown"><p>Modern German was basically created by Martin Luther when he translated the bible into German. Before him, there were drastically different dialects. Smart man that he was, he took small bits from every dialect, until it became one Germanic language soup. The fact that Gutenberg had his success a few decades prior IIRC sold the deal.
It keeps amazing me that this one man single-handedly created the beautiful abomination we speak today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I posted above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Okay this is hugely misleading. It’s <em>by the time of Chaucer</em>, not Chaucer’s innovation himself. Etymonline gives a better explanation: specifically that it’s an orthographic convention arising in the mid 13th century (well before Chaucer) that ‘i’s became ‘j’s when isolated or at the end of groups (anyone who studies medieval manuscripts will be familiar with Roman numerals written as ‘iij’ or ‘vij’). ‘j’ was used like a ‘long i’, much like the ‘long s’ or the consonantal ‘u’ (‘v’). It’s a matter of making it easier to read on the manuscript page, which then became convention. This was also around the time the “I” was solidifying as the first person pronoun, as opposed to “Ich” or “Ic”.</p>
