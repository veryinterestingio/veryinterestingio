			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard too that when the chip is used at point of sale, the code is changed and stored at those institutions, making it so even if you could duplicate the chip, somewhere along the way there will be an issue if both cards were used and one had a code that was already used somewhere else, and would allow the credit issuer to see a giant red flag, rather than just &quot;that number has been used here and here&quot;  in this case they know something is up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is called the ATC code however there is a wrench in that in some EMV/Chip cards are allowed to do offline transactions. Those transactions are just authorized by the chip and no contact is actually needed at the bank. However the ATC code is primarily used to prevent replay fraud</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They use asymmetric encryption, this means there's one key to encrypted and another one to decrypt. The encrypt key is superduper safely stored on the card and each transaction is padded with some random data, so two transactions are never the same. That way the bank knows which transactions are real.</p>
<p>Btw: these chips are extremely well engineered to make it almost impossible to retrieve the key inside. They have unnecessary circuits so you can't reconstruct the key from the power consumption, light sensitive components that break the key if the chip is opened and much more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to add that many chip cards are actually kind of a computer. They have a CPU, RAM, ROM and an eeprom (which resembles the hard drive of the micro computer). Now the exact specifications differ of course and there are chips that only provide an interface for data access but afaik cryptographic chips are often more sophisticated.</p></div>		</li>
