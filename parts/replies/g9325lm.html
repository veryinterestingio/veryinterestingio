			<div class="markdown"><p>I have read that humans are micro-evolving to have a third artery in the arm and to not have wisdom teeth. So it may be possible that some have more or less veins/arteries</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's been studied more on a population level. Not like this guy has 20% more veins than normal, but 20% of people have this particular extra vein. These sorts of variations exist within a lot of anatomy. Nerves also have common variations. The roots of teeth have variations in number of canals per tooth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. Look at faces and how much they vary. All <em>more or less</em> the same, but I wouldn't want to have facial surgery based on the surgeon looking at a model of a &quot;perfect standard&quot; face. Your insides vary as much as your face does from person to person.</p></div>		</li>
