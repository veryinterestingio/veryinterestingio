			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeh I ordered one the same dimensions as my license plate when I lived in Florida. Because those tolls are crazy. I built it into a frame etc etc. kinda jerry rigged and hotglued everything but it worked on a switch behind the steering wheel. Anyways I wanted it to where it would blur when I hit the button so I could pass the toll and then have switch it off. Turns out you have to keep it on while driving then switch off when you drive under the toll. Within a few days my battery was drained because I still wanted it to be clear when the car was off as I didn't want to attract attention. Ended up just taking it out. I wasted like $100.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In that case...</p>
<p>Evil sorcerers summon a demon and ensnare it in the tempered glass. Pushing one button adds a drop of holy water, making the glass go clear. Pushing the other button causes a small silver knife to stab at the demon's soul, angering it and turning the glass cloudy.</p>
<p>Don't push the buttons too frequently.  If the window begins a pulsing demonic glow or ooze with a liquid that looks like blood, have it replaced immediately by qualified &quot;window technicians&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We lassoed lightning and crammed it into a metal tube. Then we picked up a rock and taught it to think.  Now, on our command, we tell to rock to give lightning to a bunch of melted sand, metal, and other rocks so we can see through it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These types of windows are made from Polylmer Dispersed Liquid Crystals (PDLCs).  There are materials being developed that reverse this process (i.e., the windows are transparent when inert, and become opaque/translucent when a voltage is applied).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to make it more clear (ha!), PDLC is contained in an 1/16-inch interlayer between two panes of glass that are laminated to each other. When you touch this glass you are touching glass just like any other glass. </p>
<p>Bonus fact. it takes 15ms to turn on switchable glass, but 50ms to turn it off. </p></div>		</li>
