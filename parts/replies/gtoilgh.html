			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the ideas of Cthulhu/Lovecraft if I perhaps remember correctly is it's a being of a &quot;higher dimension&quot;. What people see is it's shadow akin to when you see visualisations of the shadow of a 4D object. People realising what they're actually seeing is what makes them go insane when they perceive an old god.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're interested in higher dimensions, I would highly reccomend slowly, methodically going through this 3blue1brown video, trying to pay attention to, and visualize each thing he mentions, and understand them, go slow and you'll be able to understand.</p>

<p>Higher dimensions are the very very tip of the iceberg in terms of math creating strange and inexplicable things. Every little crack and crevice of the mathematical world is filled with &quot;wait, oh my god why is that the way it is???&quot; </p>
<p>That same channel has a video as well that briefly explores <em>infinite dimensional</em> space, and even beyond that, infinite dimensional spaces of different infinities!</p>
<p>When I was young, I spent months and months each month on the bus meditating on different aspects of a 4-d cube, and by the time I decided to stop, I had brief moments where it would suddenly CLICK into place and I could visualize it as its own thing moving in 4d space, before I lost it again moments later.</p></div>		</li>
