			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, it happens toe more often than peeing. Maybe because I drive long distances a lot. But you'll start a drive and feel a poop brewing and your fine until you pull into the drive way and everything goes into emergency mode, the walls are about to breach, and you're dangerously close to shitting yourself.</p>
<p>I work on a ranch and there have been a couple of times I was in a back pasture, far from a toilet and I couldn't hold it and had drop trou and literally pop a squat. After that my body knew I had low standards and wouldn't give me the courtesy of waiting for a toilet. It took me a couple of weeks of saying &quot;No! This is not an acceptable toilet.&quot; </p></div>		</li>

<p>You also realise that you are clenching your jaw and aren't sure how to relax it.</p>
<p>Maybe aswell your buthole is itchy and you may be covered in teeny spiders..</p></div>		</li>
