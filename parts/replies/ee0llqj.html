			<div class="markdown"><p>Outside of out local galactic cluster the other particles of the universe are not gravitationally bound to us. That means as spave expands so does the distance between these local clusters. Space is always expanding. If one meter of space expands at X speed. Then two meters of space expands at 2X speed. That may be really slow at those small distances, but get enough space in between two objects and the total expansion due to the space will exceed the speed of light. meaning that even if you travel at the speed of light to another one of these clusters, you'll never reaches them because they are &quot;moving&quot; away from us faster than the speed of light. I say &quot;moving&quot; because they actually are not moving faster than the speed of light. No massive particle can. But nothing says that space can't expand faster than light. Since it is not a particle. So while they aren't moving at that rate. The distance between the object is increasing faster than light.</p>
<p>It's really sad to thing that humans will be trapped forever in a tiny speck of the entire universe. Neber able to get outside of it.bunless we find a way to break the speed of light somehow. Though it's very very unlikely. As it will mess with causality. You can get into situations where A causes B to happen. But then B happens before A.</p>
<p>It's like shooting a gun before you load ammo into it. It just dosen't make any sense. Or arriving at location B before leaving location A.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wormholes are consistent with our understanding of relativity, but there is currently no evidence they actually exist - and we certainly don't have the technology, energy source, or matter to create them. I would reckon global warming will eliminate humanity's chances of acquiring those things as well. </p>
<p>At the moment, wormholes are just plausible science-fiction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Distance probably still matters. Wormholes are a function of gravity bending spacetime, gravity effects are limited to light speed. Logically once the two exit points of a wormhole speed away faster than the speed of light(which is solely based on their distance to each other) they can’t remain gravitationally bound. </p>
<p>Either that or they are stationary in regards to expanding space. Most likely though they are extremely unstable if they exist at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Based on our current assumptions about black holes, I don't believe that's possible.</p>
<p>Our current assumption is that everything inside the event horizon collapses into a singularity at the centre of the black hole. This doesn't have size, it's literally just a point. The event horizon is then defined as the boundary where light speed objects can't escape. The 'size' of this might vary (because a 'metre' now is different to a 'metre' in a heavily expanded universe) but it can't tear a black hole apart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Small objection, if the singularity inside the black hole was a point it couldn’t have a spin, which black holes do. In fact some argue that this spin is what prevents the complete collapse of the central mass in a black hole.</p>
<p>Though I think it’s fair to say we have no clue what goes on behind the event horizon. It’s interesting to note though that very large black hole event horizons can be safely approached and even entered as the gravity gradient isn’t very steep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Considering the expansion rate is so low it’s countered by gravity(the weakest force) even on galactic distances it’s fair to assume that no fathomable size of a black hole would be large enough to be torn apart from it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would imply that the expansion somehow overpowers gravitational and/or intermolecular forces, which I’ve never read anything to suggest could happen. The “speed” you refer to is the rate at which distant objects move apart, not actual motion of bodies.</p></div>		</li>
