			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. The spectrum does not contain all colours, because it is missing the purple line - the blend between red and violet. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Uhhh, purple is very much on the spectrum of visible colors. It is higher in energy than blue. It is simply blue with a lack of green as perceived by your brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He’s not saying purple isn’t a spectral color. He saying that there should be more colors in the visible spectrum that this color spectrum model doesn’t completely show. They exist as a blend between magenta and purple and this model shows a straight line between those two colors called “the purple line” which is the straight line at the bottom. It’s one of the reasons that this model isn’t completely correct even if it’s very useful overall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No it’s not, purple has red, in it you’re thinking of violet. Violet is spectral, purple requires the mixture of violet or blue with red.</p></div>		</li>
