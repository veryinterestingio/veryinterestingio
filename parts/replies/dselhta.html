			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not an expert, but the stress hormones are mainly cortisol, epinephrine (adrenaline), and glucagon. Yes these are really released in your dream.</p>
<p>The second question is tricky, but I would think probably yes. For example, high levels of cortisol may decrease release of chemicals that stimulate neuron growth in the hippocampus. This is known as the stress theory of depression. I can’t answer to how much it would increase your various risks, but I probably wouldn’t worry about it. That would just increase your risks more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This made me chuckle. I have a faster than average heart rate, but whenever I check my bpm I notice that it’s high, then I get annoyed/anxious like “why is my heart rate so high - I’m just sitting here?”. As a result of this thought process my heart rate immediately jumps up around 5bpm.
If anyone could worry themselves to death it would be me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow up to a follow up....why is my sense of reality still distorted when I wake up? Objects seem larger or look like they're subtly shifting and moving. And this was happening as a child, long before psychadelics were introduced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something something reticular formation, acetyl choline, wakefulness, orexin, histamine, raphe, random jargon.</p>
<p>Tldr; your neurons are transitioning from sleep to wakefulness and I’m guessing it didn’t complete the process yet. It’s like starting up your computer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Makes sense. It only seems to happen when waking from a stressful nightmare where I had to tear through the chains of sleep paralysis to wake up. Naturally rising to wakefulness allows everything to come online the way it should.
I will assume this speculation as fact and do no further research.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I woke up once in college, and the first thing I saw was a poster on my dorm room wall of a musician I used to really like. My brain hadn't come fully awake yet, and it didn't recognize the face as a face. It was more like a nightmarish amalgamation of shapes that went to the deepest part of the uncanny valley and started digging to China. Super unsettling, and not a fun way to wake up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When we dream, we see things that aren't there and can touch and feel them. Is that not psychedelic? </p>
<p>It seems that scientists are a little divided over the issue, but we have the necessary enzymes to synthesize DMT endogenously, and may in fact synthesize it during REM, during near death experiences etc. </p>
<p>DMT is the active ingredient of Ayahuasca, a psychedelic drink that more or less takes the user on a lifechanging vision quest. It has been used for at least 500 years in South America.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol thanks Joe Rogan. I'm well aware of all that. I only qualified my statement that way to rule out the possibility that my dabbling in certain substances didn't just leave a few doors ajar in my mind and are now causing the lingering hallucinations when I wake up from a nightmare......but all moments of conscious life are indeed psychadelic experiences.</p></div>		</li>
