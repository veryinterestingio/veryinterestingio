			<div class="markdown"><p>It's thought that zebras evolved to be barcode-horses (r/ProperAnimalNames) partly because it makes it hard for predators to know from looking at a herd where the head or hind of a specific animal starts or ends, and partly because flies can't differentiate between the black and white portions and constantly try to micro-adjust to avoid a perceived physical obstacle which is actually a simple optical illusion :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So Zebras were actually specifically discussed on the new Life in Colour series and it was really interesting.</p>
<p>It's two parts like you said:</p>
<p>One, their predators have short bursts of energy and have to focus on one target to secure a kill. When Zebras run together it creates a disorienting effect to the predator and a few seconds of confusions can by the Zebras time to dodge attacks etc. It's more confusion of if they are still tracking the same Zebra since they can't lock down one target. </p>
<p>Second: they believe it also disorientated the flies and they can't figure out the correct distance they need to land. So they kind of hover around the Zebra but can't figure out where to land. </p>
<p>The effect of the stripes is called &quot;motion dazzle&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>Motion dazzle!</em> Yes! :D The military used this too and it's awesome.</p>
<p>There were a bunch of <a href="https://content.nroc.org/DevelopmentalEnglish/unit06/Images/Reading02_USSnebraska.png" target="_blank">weird-ass warships</a> which were painted in such a way that the enemy couldn't figure out precisely which direction they were travelling, which was their angle of attack, or even what was the front or back. So if they got fired at with torpedoes, there was no guarantee of a direct hit. The ships could absolutely be seen, no doubt, but they couldn't be reliably targeted.</p>
<p>A similar method was used when building <a href="https://star-castle.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/History3.jpg" target="_blank">castles</a>, too. They'd be built in star shapes with canon on each point, so there was no reliable way of using siege equipment on a flat side of the fort without exposing that equipment to elevated defensive weapons at optimal range. Weird geometric shapes used to vex the enemy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yeah man. :D I read that a while ago when building Games Workshop models: i painted my tanks <em>blue</em> (of all colours) with white and grey triangles on them to obscure which direction they were facing. On the battlefield - gaming table - they legit merged into the scenery despite being a different colour from it, and it was hard to tell at a glance which way either was facing.</p>
<p>Those ships, man. Utterly amazing. Can't get a torpedo into their flank at a 90* angle if you don't know the angle it's facing! </p>
<p>I was looking into castles and fortifications, too, and how they were designed in such a way that there was never a flat edge facing outward. Cannonballs could only hit at an angle, and would likely bounce off. And any siege weaponry used against them would be immediately flanked by weapons from an elevated position.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're also horribly farsighted. Hence the whiskers, which assist them in detecting things super close to their face. When you go in to pet a cat, you shouldn't quickly reach for their face because it's disorienting. you need to let them slowly become accustomed to having an object around their face or they'll rear back and become defensive.</p></div>		</li>
