<blockquote>
<p>A tingling or numb feeling is a condition called paresthesia. Itâ€™s a sign that a nerve is irritated and sending extra signals. Think of that pins-and-needles feeling as a traffic jam in your nervous system.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And nerves are very slow to heal when damaged.</p>
<p>I damaged my ulnar nerve, causing the outer part of my hand to go numb. Even though it wasn't injured enough to cause a  loss to strength or mobility, it took about 9 months to heal. Even now, 2 years later, there's still some residual numbness. But I only notice it if I think about it.</p></div>		</li>
