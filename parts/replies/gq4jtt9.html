<p>I'm thankful for both the one with the scalpel, and the one in the bag behind him. I couldn't fill either role.</p></div>		</li>

<p>that always fascinates me about surgeons, the way they navigate through inside people, it all just looks like bloody meat to me</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be honest while the video is good I think the guy does a poor job of explaining stuff, because he names a lot of things without really explaining what all the names mean or what those things are (it is a short video tho). </p>
<p>In reality when dissecting a body, even though everything does look like kinda beige meat and fat, you can tell stuff apart because everything feels different, is shaped differently, and looks subtly different. For example you only got a brief glimpse in the vid at the abdominal muscles (rectus abdominus etc) but when dissecting you can literally peel away different muscle layers, and they feel tough and stringy like near, Vs the surrounding very hardened skin or soft spongy fat (adipose) tissue.</p></div>		</li>
