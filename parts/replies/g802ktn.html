			<div class="markdown"><p>How do satellite clocks work? Are they digital or is it based on their position relative to earth? I don't understand how digital clocks could perceive time difference depending on how high they are. Isn't it just coded in?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most satellites use atomic clocks. The second is defined as the length of time for a cesium-133 atom that is excited by radio waves to vibrate exactly 9,192,631,770 times. Atomic clocks work by counting the vibrations of cesium while shooting radio waves at them to keep the rate of vibration constant. This method of timekeeping is extremely precise and cares very little, if at all, about what sort of environment it’s in.</p>
<p>We can then have the clocks in orbit tell us how much time has passed for the satellite and then compare that to an identical clock on the ground.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If i recall correctly, the best clocks we can make measure time by abusing energy absorbition and release of atoms.</p>
<p>Basicly, they pulse a electric wave at a material, that material has a single frequency it loves and absorbs more energy in.
That frequency is a property of that material and it will never change.  </p>
<p>By measuring the absorbtion you can make sure your input frequency never changes from that perfect frequency, a frequency has precise timing and can be used to track time by counting ocillations.</p>
<p>Definetly not my expertise, but maybe it helps. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_clock" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> </p>
<p>When you seperate these clocks putting one of them into space they drift appart, eventho they both work flawlessly, which is how we know that somethings fucking with time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a note, all computers have a clock in it. Its actually the same thing in digital watches. A crystal that vibrates when you send electricity through it. The computer tells time by counting the vibrations. The code runs based on this clock. </p>
<p>That said the sattelites use something else way more accurate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m sorry, you mentioned that if in an extremely fast ship, we’d see light moving at that speed from all directions and then concluded that we cannot catch up to light.. I’m a little lost on how you reached that point or if you could explain the “light coming from all directs” part a little further...?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure. As an analogy, imagine you’re on a boat on a windy day. Let’s imagine the wind is going north at 15 mph. If your boat is also going north at 15 mph, you won’t feel any wind as a passenger on the boat. On the other hand, if your boat is going south at 15 mph, the wind would appear to be moving 30 mph to a passenger on the boat. If it were possible to catch up with light, we’d expect it to behave similarly, just with much greater speeds. </p>
<p>Instead, light behaves very differently. Imagine that you are sitting in front of a lightbulb. You measure the speed of light coming off of it. Then you measure the speed of the light while moving towards the lightbulb at 15 mph and again while moving away from the lightbulb at 15 mph. You might expect that the speed of the light would appear to be 15 mph faster while moving towards the lightbulb and 15 mph slower while moving away from the lightbulb. But every time we try this sort of experiment we see that the speed of light is the same while moving away from the light source as it is while standing still or while moving towards it. It’s always 299,792 km/s.</p></div>		</li>

<p>you would still see light from every direction moves at that same 299,792 km/s</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meaning that if you were travelling at 100,000 km/s and flash some light forward, it's relative speed to you would still be 299,792 km/s, and if you were to flash light backwards it would also travel at 299,792 km/s relative to you. But both would also be travelling at the same 299,792 km/s relative to an observer staying still.</p>
<p>This is very different than what would happen with slower speeds: if you are in a car and throw a ball forward, to a non-moving observer the speed of the ball is whatever the speed the driver threw it at + the speed the car was going at, and similarly a subtraction if the ball was thrown backwards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If two light beams were to be fired parallel to each other in the same direction towards the same planet from a starting line would both beams look at the other and see a beam of light moving ahead at the speed of light?  Would they both arrive at their destination in second place?</p></div>		</li>
