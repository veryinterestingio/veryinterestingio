			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the job of the stomach. Once it leaves the stomach it is liquid, or at least paste. </p>
<p>Food actually sits in the stomach for quite some time before it gets into the intestines.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anatomy 101 - the stomach connects to the small intestine where all nutrients &amp; fluids are absorbed - the food is already disintegrated into a paste-like substance when it leaves the stomach &amp; duodenum</p>
<p>Then as it dries out &amp; compacts it moves to the large intestine &amp; is stored as stool ready for excretion via the colon which is the end of the large intestine / gerbil adventure park</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the large intestine does absorb the food.  It's job is to deal with the waste. The small intestine absorbs nutrients and such into the bloodstream and then the large intestine squeezes the leftovers, absorbs most of the water and expells the resulting poo out of your body.    </p>
<p>To put it in another way, your small intestine only works with a wet paste, but your large intestine dries everything up.  They are in that order because they only work in that order.</p></div>		</li>
