I don’t think we’re getting protection from SARS or MERS with this vaccine (but we don’t really need it, those diseases kill way too fast to become a pandemic).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sequence of the spike proteins is similar but has still a lot of differences (see <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166309/#!po=30.1980" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166309/#!po=30.1980</a>).
If I understand correctly, the mRNA vaccines program the human cells to produce the spike protein on which the immune system trains and generates antibodies against. If an antibody happens to target an epitope that is equal in both strains, it could theoretically also recognize the SARS-CoV-1 protein.
But I guess that especially the exposed parts of the protein are different, because they likely get more selective pressure.
I'm sure that has been checked by someone already. Does anyone know better?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We generally only develop vaccines if a disease becomes widespread and is likely to continue spreading (because vaccines are both expensive and time-consuming to develop). Since SARS and MERS were both contained quickly, there wasn't much reason to devote resources to vaccines for them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The nasal spray version of the flu vaccine is even a benign <em>live virus</em>. The cultures are kept going, and each year it's altered to express the desired surface proteins for the upcoming season's flu viruses.</p>
<p>The new mRNA technology is pretty cool, but you gotta admit that domesticating a mild strain of the flu, selectively breeding it, genetically engineering it to outwardly resemble the strains we're worried about, and then sending it off to program people's immune systems is also pretty bad-ass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct.</p>
<p>mRNA vaccine hasn't been used in high profile vaccines before because there is no significant money in it in normal years. Attempts to use it to cure cancer and other fantastic uses have so far failed.</p></div>		</li>
