			<div class="markdown"><p>Not an optometrist, but if your eyes hurt from bright light, you should probably cover them better. Your eyelids do substantially reduce the damage simply by the fact that they block some light, so it seems like it would be difficult to get permanent damage if you werenâ€™t looking <em>directly</em> at it and your eyes are closed.</p></div>		</li>
