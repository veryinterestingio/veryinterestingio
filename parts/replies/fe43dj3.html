			<div class="markdown"><p>Isitbullshit that when you start to feel thirsty, it’s already “too late” and your body and brain is already running at reduced capacity? I’ve heard it thrown around a lot but I don’t really feel like I’m that impacted, unless I’ve been thirsty for a long time and not had a drink.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What that means is a lot like the comment you replied to, before you know you’re thirsty, your body is already trying to recover fluids. It’s not full blown dehydration though. But I’m sure it’s best to try to keep up on hydration without having to feel thirsty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's largely Gatorade propaganda. Your body signals you that it needs water when it needs it, and stops signaling it the moment you no longer needs water. All that bullshit about you becoming dehydrated without noticing is actually false and potentially harmful.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Like needing to shit after a big meal. You didn’t digest the meal that quickly, your body is making room for more shit.</p></div>		</li>
