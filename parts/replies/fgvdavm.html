			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite everything is dependent on multiple genes... However, if not then genetics only allows two or three discrete options. See: tongue rolling, widows peak, blood types. But yes, a trait showing continuous variance won't be controlled by a single gene</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's one gene with three alleles that you have two of. A from AA or AO, AB from A and B, O from OO</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Itâ€™s multiple alleles but one genetic loci. There are dozens of blood groups. ABO and Rh(+/-)  are just the most the import for donating blood as matching those usually sufficient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You mean six different genes, surely?</p>
<p>And yes, I don't disagree. But the comment above me said everything depends on multiple genes when in reality there are some things determined by but a single one. It's all pedantic however, since penis size definitely is not one of the things depending on a single gene.</p></div>		</li>
