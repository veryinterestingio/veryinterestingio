			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. It’s not good. But you also have a set number of years to learn how to not hurt/kill people. If you want me to get the same amount of experience working 40 hours a week you’d have to make my 5 years of residency 10 years.  You want your doctor to have double the training or half of it and be better rested?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>what is the benefit of this? Not a critique but a genuine question. If you work long shifts and rest for a couple days, during the days off someone else works the long shift - why don't the you guys just have shorter shifts and alternate working? or is there not enough staff for this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some say the &quot;benefit&quot; is less hand-off, which the industry claims is where mistakes/miscommunication arises. It's certainly possible to have one person do night blocks for a week (12 hrs shifts) and one person does days, then swap. There are more hand-offs that way. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, we don't get to rest for a couple of days. We get a post-call day (a &quot;day off&quot; after working 24 hrs, where we mostly just sleep), but we're expected to be back to work the following day. There isn't enough staff to have several days off. We're lucky to get a full weekend off (we call them &quot;golden weekends&quot;). </p></div>		</li>
