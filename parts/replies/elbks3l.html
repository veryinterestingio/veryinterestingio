			<div class="markdown"><p>Small distinction but many will read that you need sugar as needing actual dietary sugar. Dietary sugar and carbs are not required. Your body manufactures glucose if you donâ€™t consume any. You can follow both anaerobic and aerobic metabolism pathways on a zero carbohydrate diet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely true. I stared at the word &quot;sugar&quot; in my post for a minute, trying to find the balance between accuracy and accessibility.  I obviously chose the latter but you make a fair point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;You get what you train for,&quot; simply put, is the principle of Specificity.  If you have a thing you're trying to get better at, you need to challenge yourself in that arena.  </p>
<p>For aerobic stamina (long duration, low to moderate intensity), choose an activity, research how safely go about it, set some short and long term goals that are self-determining (&quot;I will exercise twice this week&quot;, &quot;I will run to the end of the block&quot;), and commit yourself to it.  The greatest factor in determining your success is your adherence to the program. Stick with it, keep pushing yourself and setting new goals as you achieve them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The more you move the more energy you require. It totally depends on what you do daily, how much muscle mass you have/how much you weight (muscle uses more calories so there is a difference). More active people require more energy. To give you an idea Micheal Phelps when training for the Olympics would swim 6-8 hours a day and consumed on average 10,000 calories in order to keep his body fueled. But that is next level &quot;high stamina&quot; and most people will never get to that level of fitness.</p></div>		</li>
