			<div class="markdown"><p>Question for you, being a PsyD:</p>
<p>How often would you say people are prescribed SSRIs, etc. for a short(er) period, concurrent with CBT or other counseling vs many who seem to post that they have been on meds for an extended period of time (I see many references to people stating they’ve been on ____ for years)?</p>
<p>Also, I’ve always wondered, what is the differentiation of being a <em>Clinical</em> Psychologist?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sadly, I'd say most people are prescribed antidepressants as a cheap and easy fix all with no view for the long term. Many people (at least in the UK) take them for years with no support in tapering off and it breaks my heart when I meet people who've been taking them for years and who have been told they'll always be depressed, when they've never been offered any effective talking interventions to actually address the root issues contributing to their low mood.</p>
<p>I'm all for short term and well managed antidepressants alongside psychotherapeutic or even social support, but only as long as people are supported to stop them. I'm also personally looking forward to the greater acceptance of psychedelic supported therapies which are far less harmful than psychotropic drugs like SSRIs.</p>
<p>Regarding Clinical Psychology, its a protected title compared to how anyone can call themselves a psychologist without having to do a doctorate (and in my case a BSc. And MSc.). We have a very intensive university and real world placement-based course. We use psychological theory and evidence to help treat mental distress. Hope that helps!</p></div>		</li>
