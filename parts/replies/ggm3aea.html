<p>I've left off vibrational and rotational relaxation, which can also take place at the same spot as the solvent relaxation steps. There's also a whole mess of excited state energy transfers to other molecules and such that are possible as well as none radiative emission back to ground state.</p>

<p>There's also doppler shifting as the source and destination move.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. I forgot this was an astronomy question. Thanks. </p>
<p>I'm a physical chemist, so doppler shifting isn't something I normally have to worry about with my samples.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically correct and very thorough, but I just want to point that this does not pertain much to simple atoms that are responsible for majority of absorption and emission in the atmosphere of the Sun and the stars of similar (or higher) temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a fair point I hadn't thought of. The outer edges of stars do in fact act more similar to atoms in vacuum. There is no solvent to relax. </p>
<p>Thanks for pointing this out.</p></div>		</li>
