<p>Also just because you look over and they're looking at you doesn't confirm anything.  People are always looking at everything around them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This, and the actual top answer, are both right, just for different circumstances (in your peripheral vision or not).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but this answer actually corrects the negative assumption in the question to begin with.  In fact, if you see someone in your peripheral then you're not &quot;feeling&quot; anything.  You're seeing it.  So this one is the more correct answer.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I hate when people say &quot;that person is staring at me&quot;. Well how would you know? You're staring at them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you serious? You've never been in the situation where you happen to glance (not <strong>stare</strong>) at a person and notice them looking at you. And you look away for a good few seconds, glace back and notice them still looking at you. And maybe you look away for another 10 seconds or so, glance back and see they're <em>still</em> looking at you? That's how you know someone is staring at you even if you're not staring at them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, you're right. I should have said one quarter of all the types of data, or something like that.
The final point in that list would probably constitute almost all of the data, while the main one, the least.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To your excellent long answer I'd also add:</p>
<p>People are very bad at estimating probabilities and look at each other a lot.  All the time.  Pre-COVID it would not surprise me if a normal person got looked at between 100 and 1000 times per day.  1000 sounds high at first, but just think about how many people you look at  when you're picking a line at the grocery store and how long it takes to do so.  I can't speak for you, but I do a casual measurement of each line, judging not merely by head count, but also by what they look like (eg she looks like a mother of 5 and has enough space ahead of her that there's probably a cart there -&gt; pick a different line), so I end up looking at ~5 per line and at peak times its not uncommon to see 10 lines going at once, so that's 50 people looked at in the span of less than a minute... and that doesn't count butts I may have checked out while getting my foodstuffs... or the drivers going the other way as I'm driving there or back.  And if I get into a conversation I'll look at the person, and then away, and then back at them many, many times.</p>
<p>So 1000 doesn't strike me as an unreasonable ballpark number of people looked at in a day, so I'd expect to be looked at about the same number of times per day, so it's really not terribly surprising when you see someone looking at you... or at least it shouldn't be.</p></div>		</li>
