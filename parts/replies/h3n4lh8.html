			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this include the harvesting of the materials needed to produce the batteries?
Everyone brings up coal but I'm baffled by what I've heard about the digging they do just to get the resources for batteries. Isn't only one country doing it?

<p>Yes.  Even if you account for the batteries, electric cars <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/es903729a" target="_blank">are still better for the environment than gas cars</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have the necessary expertise to evaluate the merits of this study. And it generally fits with what I think about it, but I still think this is worth pointing this out. </p>
<p>&quot;We appreciate the financial support for this research, which was provided by Axpo Holding AG.&quot;</p>
<p>Axpo is a renewable energy company. Doesn't mean it's wrong. But it's worth knowing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was a good read and an excellent point. </p>
<p>It is contingent on the electricity supply coming from renewable sources though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are several things to consider here.  First, the mass of stuff you need to mine for a battery is small compared to the amount of fossil fuels you need to mine to power something over the course of its lifetime.  Second, internal combustion engines and the associated parts (catalytic converters, engine plumbing, etc) also require specialized materials that have to be mined.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe for the cobalt, which is used in lithium ion batteries, the supply is mainly a single country, that being the Democratic Republic of Congo. But I know that at least Tesla has replaced the cobalt with silicon in their newer batteries, silicon being one of the most abundant resources in the Earth’s crust. I’m not too sure on battery recycling/disposal procedures, I think it’s possible to reuse materials from a battery pack to help create more battery packs. So unlike the counterpart of burning fuel into emissions and thus to a non-reusable state, you are able to reuse the battery packs to help in the production of more battery packs. I’m not sure of the efficiency there, but even some saving/reuse of materials is good.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Note: even if you live in WV which gets \~ 90% of it's electricity from coal, an electric car is better than a gas car (although in high coal states, a hybrid is better than both)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually coal is the one type of power plant that is about exactly equal to automobiles in terms of thermal efficiency.</p>
<p>However coal produces significantly less greenhouse gasses per unit of energy than a gasoline automobile so it is still a win for electric vehicles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s really not equal efficiency-wise unless you’re considering ridiculously old coal plants. The average US car is 16% efficient <a href="https://matter2energy.wordpress.com/2013/02/22/wells-to-wheels-electric-car-efficiency/" target="_blank">https://matter2energy.wordpress.com/2013/02/22/wells-to-wheels-electric-car-efficiency/</a></p>
<p>A coal plant from the 1960s is ~40%. That’s 2.5x. And then like you said: large scale generation plants have better emissions per unit than small engines especially with the less controversial gasses - acid, smog, and lung disease inducers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, to get truly correct numbers would require a huge amount of research.</p>
<p>I chose to err in the direction of gasoline automobiles being the most efficient they can be and coal being the least efficient.</p>
<p>The truly accurate numbers will make an even better case for electric vehicles.</p></div>		</li>
