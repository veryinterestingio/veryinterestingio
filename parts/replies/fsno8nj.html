			<div class="markdown"><p>No, Hans Zimmerâ€™s score for Dunkirk uses Shepard tones to build tension. <a href="https://youtu.be/LVWTQcZbLgY" target="_blank">Great video on this by Vox. </a>If you want a Zimmer soundtrack that uses tones to generate unease, check out his <a href="https://youtu.be/1zyhQjJ5UgY" target="_blank">Joker theme</a> from The Dark Knight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I knew about the Shepard tones; I'm pretty sensitive to those since I first noticed them in Pink Floyd's Echoes. :) I must have confused it with another movie as I thought it also used the unsettling low-frequency stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard of that before. I'm still a little doubtful, but it would be great to do an experiment with it.</p>
<p>I don't think it would work with movies, though, (at least not in digital format) because low frequencies need bigger speakers to have the same energy, and because digital formats compress the audio to not have frequencies that humans can't hear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, term is 'infrasound', frequencies your brain may process as 'sensations' as opposed to 'sounds'.  There's been lots of research, both academic and military, into how people react and behave when exposed to infrasound.  Still being done with various movie sound designs, but does require a very good playback system to be effective.</p></div>		</li>
