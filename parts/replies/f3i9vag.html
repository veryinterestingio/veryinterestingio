			<div class="markdown"><p>Emotion regulation is a complex process, with lots of variables in the way. The stimulus, past experience, expectations, context and chemicals in our brain, for example. There is no short and accurate response that isnt too simplistic.
You could search for Gross, a phd specialized on Emotion Regulation.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not that they're suppressing it- it's an unconscious physiological response process- but rather they just experience less of a change vs. someone whose system just dumped a lot of chemicals into it.   So the calm person <em>is</em> calmer, but not by dint of conscious regulation, it's just that their body has a higher stimulus threshold that would elicit a similar response</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ehh maybe as a starting point, but it's entirely possible to learn to control physiological responses and emotions. Your responses can be conditioned with time and practice. Meditation has been shown in many studies to change brain chemistry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel as if Marcus Aurelius would disagree with you. As well as many religions. I believe conscious regulation can have a big part of how you react when tight or flight is enabled. Look at Navy Seals I can't imagine they all get in by chance if their experiences, brain chemistry and life experiences are the same. Some of this would be situational conditioning. You could dip into even more recent like the Wim Hoft method.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I would just add that it can be easily conditioned, whether by choice or not. Military and other high stress training can do it, as will serious trauma from seeing someone die to abuse. Etc.</p></div>		</li>
