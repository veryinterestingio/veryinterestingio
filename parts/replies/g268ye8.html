			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the weird part. In any production line you'd plug the new machines in <em>first</em>, test run them until they're stable, and <em>then</em> take out the old. Installing complex new machinery like that never goes without hiccups. </p>
<p>Or only take out the old first when there's absolute nothing running through it anymore, but it really doesn't sound like that is the case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have room to run both at the same time. </p>
<p>Sometimes you take down the existing equipment, prep the site for the new equipment, then setup / burn in. </p>
<p>With multiple sites, you just do a few sites at a time. Usually less in the beginning to iron out the process and bugs. Then you get up to velocity in swapping out equipment. </p>
<p>If there is a massive productivity increase, it might be better to replace everything at once. You still do a pilot run to validate the process. And itâ€™s a huge risk that you know all sites will be similar and / or no delays in delivery. And leadership is ok with stopping a service for the short term instead of reduced capacity for a longer time. Rarely pays off due to unforeseen issues and normal hiccups</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's probably not the room in the facilities to have both installed at once. But you should still wait until just a day or two before the confirmed delivery timeline of the new machines before taking out the old ones.  It should only be a few days of manual sorting in each facility.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You will almost always have a slowdown during upgrades, whether mail or business. That's just logistics. Let's say you have 3 production/sorting lines. You need to upgrade them, so you take 1 offline to upgrade and have 2 running. You're now down to 66% efficiency. It will stay like that as you finish the first line, bring it back up, and bring down line 2, until the job is done.</p>
<p>Alternatively to avoid that, you can create an additional production/sorting line before you bring the first one down for upgrades, so that 3 are always running. But to do that you need to spend money on a temporary 4th line (for the space and equipment), money which will just be wasted when you go back to 3 production/sorting lines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Upgrading machines takes time. Hell choosing the machines and getting the planning in order to get them running takes a lot of time. I know from experience. You can't just come in, secure a ton of new equipment and upgrade everything like it's nothing. They won't have the new equipment ready by the elections which is most likely the plan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing is the post office is supposed to be a national service, and while in a city it can pay for itself, in rural communities, it can be more costly... but it is a necessary service, especially in those remote areas, and we sometimes have to use tax dollars to pay for such services. We pay for services like police, schools, and military, this is also a service that was foolishly attempted to be spun into a private business.</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="https://facts.usps.com/innovation/" target="_blank">Your last source</a> just looks like a list of things the post office was already doing well, and I don't see specifically where they are talking about increasing volume or efficiency in 2020.</p></div>		</li>
