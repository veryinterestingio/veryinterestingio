			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s actually really light-weight, cheap and totally food-safe. Might pay a little extra for shipping, but there’s no special considerations like there would be for aerosol or pesticides. Can also ask a local store to add it to their stock. Saves you from extra shipping costs and gives them a non-toxic big control to advertise</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We used DE and sticky traps exclusively for months to fight a roach problem. I think it really helped to cut their numbers. But they didn't go away completely until we used some chemicals which caused deformities in their offspring. Eventually, the sticky traps stopped catching any (do I need to state that we were still replacing them and at they weren't just losing their stickiness?) and we declared success (left the traps in place for a couple more months so I think we'd have caught a couple in that time if they were just decimated).</p>
<p>I'm not saying DE is bad or doesn't work -- it was actually great you could watch the roaches becoming disabled as they crawled after becoming covered with it. But for us it wasn't a complete solution, and there was an unsightly amount of white powder through our kitchen while we used it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, I get it now. But it's weird, because last year there was a powdered roach poison that we used to apply on a surface, and upon contact, the cockroaches would die. In recent times, this same poison has become ineffective at killing them. I'm sure from last year to now, we've hosted a lot of roach generations. So is it possible the new generation developed immunity?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More likely either that the poison has changed formulas or that the ones you’re seeing not die instantly now were the same ones (same family line, anyways) that didn’t die instantly last year (out of sight of course); to develop an immunity or even strong resistance in a single generation (and to be able to inherit that trait, for reasons others have explained very well) is very unlikely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is almost certainly the explanation.  Borax (sodium borate) has been replaced with borax substitute (sodium sesquicarbonate) due to toxicity concerns and the substitute lacks many of the qualities of the original.</p></div>		</li>

<p>OP said this occurred over a year, that is many generations and plenty of time for resistance to build up in the population. Its very likely that they have built up resistance to any pesticide they have been exposed to over a year.</p></div>		</li>

But they won’t be going away</p>
