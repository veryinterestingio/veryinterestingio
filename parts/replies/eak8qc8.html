			<div class="markdown"><p>Same thing with my fiancé. She gets hives every time she goes to sleep. She’s tried cutting out common allergic foods but nothing seems to work. She just has to take Benadryl or she can’t sleep. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel ya, so annoying. I get this when I don't get enough sleep or there's a lot of stress at work etc. Really itchy. Seems to be at pretty random places, but let's say if I bump my hand into something then I'm more likely to get a hive there than other places. Also when I first got this, it was stressing me out because I didn't know what was happening so of course it just got worse. But being relaxed definitely helps with this for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I started getting them around 9-10 years ago as well. I have a lot of allergies, both food and environmental. My doctor has me take 600mg Tagamet when they start getting really bad/often. </p>
<p>Funny enough, I've had some silly theories like what if patterns are going to prominently develop on my skin in the future as part of some dormant evolution thing or communication with the psilocybin dimension (cause I see patterns of dots) or something like that.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also see patterns of dots! - dotted lines patterns, bunches of dots. When they appear like dotted patterns, do they itch/are they raised for you? They just seem to be on or in my skin but not raised above it.  I feel like they've just appeared in parts of my arm when I feel like I'm getting hives. These dotted patterns have only recently appeared like in the last year or two... so strange.  Hives, I've had for sure for like 10 years.</p>
<p>hmm never thought about the dormant evolution thing lolol.</p>
<p>Tagamet? I think my parents take that for heartburn sometimes. I hope it's ok for you... I was prescribed the generic Zyrtec (cetirizine hydrochloride) that I've had to take almost everyday for 10 years.  I can probably go a few days without it... but after the few days - the itching gets even worse.  </p>
