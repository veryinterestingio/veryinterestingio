			<div class="markdown"><p>Fish get groomed too. Specialized species run &quot;cleaning stations&quot; where fish can go to have parasites picked off. Remora hold on to larger fish and apparently clean them too. </p>
<p>Animals with very delicate skin don't seem to enjoy, nor should be petted. Amphibians need their layer of mucus to stay healthy. Not sure less complex animals like cuddles and how to tell. Bees groom each other too, but being petted by a human? The difference in size and wrong smell probably aren't comfortable. Snails sometimes don't mind being touched, but how do you tell whether it's happy unless it's choosing and devouring its favorite food?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a vid some person made on youtube a few months ago about raising bees as pets. They too seemed to like being petted (not trying to pick your statement apart or anything, it just happened to be relevant and kind of fun to watch)</p></div>		</li>

<p>But they do seem to like getting pets from the diver who removes fish hooks from their mouths.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked with sharks for a couple of months in South Africa and they are in fact on a step between fish and mammals.</p>
<p>30% of shark species birth living sharks
70% of shark species still lay eggs.</p>
<p>Etc. A great white is for those reasons closer to a mammal than to a fish. Some of those little riffsharks are closer to being a makkerel though.</p>
<p>Edit: guys, please stop the &quot;no hair, no titties, cold blood&quot; comments. I know. I'm only stating that they are on their way to become mammals. Could take 50 million years, could take 1 billion years, could take until our planet get eaten by the sun. But however long it will take - they are on their way.</p></div>		</li>
