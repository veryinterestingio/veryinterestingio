			<div class="markdown"><p>Awesome read, thanks. Added evolutionary bonus extra: if women had evolved to give birth to such vast-headed monsters, they would not have had the hip stability to run, making them fair game for those sabre toothed cats in the long grass of the Savannah even when not pregnant. No wonder we evolved socially the way we did!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition there is studies showing that humans in general are having larger heads, and woman’s with narrower hips, and this is because of the use of C-Sections. Prior, a woman with small hips could not pass a child, and would die, or the child’s head would be too large and they would die. Now those deaths are preventable which had prior not contributed to the gene pool.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There really <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2115103-are-caesareans-really-making-us-evolve-to-have-bigger-babies" target="_blank">aren't any studies to support that</a>.</p>
<p>It's a special kind of junk science that sort of makes sense, but falls apart when you think about it.</p>
<p>Just logically, babies' shoulders are wider than the head and are the main <em>shape</em> reason a baby can get stuck and causing complications.  A broken should can occur naturally during birth of in rare cases it is required to deliberately break a babies shoulder to force a delivery.</p>
<p>Babies head bones are flexible.  A babies head can always fit through a birth canal, even it does come out a bit squished.  A big headed baby can tear the mother to shreds just fine.</p>
<p>The main reason babies get stuck is about 3% of babies are &quot;breech&quot;.  Upside down and facing the wrong way. It just means the angle of attack is wrong, nothing to do with size.</p>
<p>The second minor reason is some women have pelvises that may have less room in certain parts (anthropoid, android, platypelloid).  Most women have the most ‘desirable’ pelvis shape (gynecoid) for birth.  Again, not related to head size.</p>
<p>tl;dr baby head size is not related to C-section and isn't &quot;evolving&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Real quick, are you referring to when a baby <em>can</em> start next eating solid foods or when they should? I had someone tell me that women should breastfeed for 2 years</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Breastfeeding for 2 years is recommended by WHO. It isn’t meant to be an exclusive source of nutrition tho. Other food should be introduced at 6-12 months.</p></div>		</li>
