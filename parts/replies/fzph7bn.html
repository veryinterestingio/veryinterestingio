			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically the dealer and pit boss know how much a table should win based on statistics. </p>
<p>When a table is underperforming or a dealer thinks your betting strategy is out of the ordinary they signal the floor manager and they investigate further they track your betting with cameras and/or send someone over to the table and have talk with you. </p>
<p>This can range from a &quot;hey mate you have played enough for this night, here is a free drink voucher&quot; to &quot;sir please leave the premises and don't ever come back&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>there a basically 2 ways to profit from card counting. Sit at the table, bet the minimum, and when the table gets 'hot' (a lot of 10 points card left) you increase your bets. This means having enough money to last the deck.</p>
<p>Or you stand at the table count, jump in a seat when the table gets hot.</p>
<p>Both highly suspicious actions which a seasoned dealer will spot in no time.</p>
<p>There are variants on this of course but this is the basic stuff they look at.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Now add card counting in the mix and you can drop the house edge to 0.5%</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that's if you don't change the amount you bet each game. Changing the amount you bet while also counting cards can put the edge well into your favour.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The math in this post is incorrect and the conclusions made by the post are wrong as a result.</p>
<p>There is no statistic for the house edge &quot; without tactics&quot;.  Everyone plays different.  some people follow &quot;perfect strategy&quot; which this post calls tactics, while other people will hit on 20.</p>
<p>If you follow perfect strategy, depending on the rules of the table and your ability to adjust your strategy to those rules (IE Hit or stand on soft 17 and whether or not you can surrender) you can get the house edge to about 0.4%.  which means for every $100 that you bet The casino makes $0.40 regardless of short-term outcome this is their profit in the long term.</p>
<p>once you add card counting If you do it well enough, If you vary your bets enough, You can gain an edge of about 0.3 or 0.5%.  </p>
<p>Think about it why would MIT and major gamblers use card counting if the best you can hope for is the casino still profits in the long run?  Because that's not how it works, If your card count properly and use perfect strategy you can profit in the long run.</p>
<p>But because the casinos would literally rather kill you then have you make a dollar off of them they claim this is cheating even though players are just using smart strategy.  Courts have ruled that this is not illegal therefore it's not actually cheating It's just casinos goal to extract every dollar from you no matter what</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People go to casinos for fun. Gambling is fun. There is nothing wrong with that. Most people have no problem with gambling and go with the mindset of spending X dollars like you would for any other event. </p>
<p>Now if you want regulations on it, they should run a credit check before you buy chips just like taking out a loan, and you’re only allowed so many chips based on income and debt. That will never happen tho.</p></div>		</li>
