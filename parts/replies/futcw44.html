<p>all teeth are various shades of yellowish</p>
<p>hell, i even get some black stains on mine.. the dentists i have seen says its from a strain of bacteria, but that i should be happy because they fight bad mouth microbes. idk though, i could do without the black stains, but i dont have any cavities or anything else so maybe its true :p</p></div>		</li>
