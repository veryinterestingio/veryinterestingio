<p>Real quick so basically it actually will take more fuel to take off horizontally to get to height and speed then going straight up and then curving?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You want to end going fast sideways, so doing it first doesn't really help as you still need to get up high, and then go fast sideways again. The fast sideways speed can help get you upward, but we're fighting against the thicker air at low altitudes, so it's not as efficient in something that demands efficiency to work well.</p>
<p>Now, something like a mass driver does send things sideways fast before going up, but the launch vehicle here is sped up with magnets before the rocket engine takes over. Think of it like a slingshot pointed up that then has a rocket after it's fired. The disadvantage here is that a mass driver is very large and expensive to build. It also requires loads of electricity. The only one in pop culture I can pull off the top of my head right now was in the game Ace Combat 5 (the White Bird Part 1 mission).</p>
<p>Basically, as long as we're not using a rocket engine it'll likely be cheaper and more sustainable for a launch to get the rocket as fast or as high as it can be before needing to use its engines. The thing is we still need the rocket engine to actually escape the atmosphere and go places in space, so we can't fully escape it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rockets at take-off are fully packed with fuel - they are so heavy that they are <em>just</em> able to take off. If you try to take off sideways they'll crash into the ground.</p>
<p>Wings could prevent that but wings are heavy and you don't want to bring them along for the ride. In addition it would mean spending more time in the thick atmosphere: More drag.</p>
<p>Rockets break the speed of sound after something like a minute and at an altitude of commercial airplanes.</p></div>		</li>
