<p>This is precisely why you need to get a different flu shot every year, because it is changing constantly.</p>
<p>The big difference between it and COVID is that COVID started out more dangerous, so its mutations are also more dangerous.</p>
<p>We see fewer mutations in some of the really, really deadly (but rarer diseases) like Ebola simply because they are so deadly, they kill their host off too fast to spread far and wide.</p>
<p>COVID is so dangerous in part because it has hit this sweet spot of being crazy contagious and not instantly killing all of its hosts, giving it lots of chances to spread, and lots of chances to mutate.</p></div>		</li>

<p>He gave a talk in 2006 where he acted like it would be a good thing if 90% of humanity died from airborne Ebola.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When they formulate a flu shot each year, they make a guess about which variations might be most common, because they <del>kept at the mall</del> can’t do them all. And of course any new variations that arrive won’t be in this year shop, but will be a candidate for next year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hear and read a lot about the yearly flu shots people get in the US but we never get them here in The Netherlands, except older folks. Now I’m wondering why this is? I heard people say it is because you don’t get sick leave but that is speculative.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Until around 2005 the flu shot had moderate side effects (high chance to miss one day's work, minimal chance of anything worse than that) and so many places regarded it as an over 60s thing or even an over 70s.</p>
<p>The shot has improved since then and usually the side effects are just a couple of hours of mild fatigue, no worse than having had two hours' less sleep the previous night. </p>
<p>Public health advice is catching up to these changes at different rates around the world.</p>
<p>In Australia it's now quite heavily pushed for 60+ and easily available and recommended for under 60s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>About 6 million people (roughly a third of the population) are invited to get vaccinated for the flu every single year. This is just the people that are 60+ or those vulnerable to more severe symptoms of the flu, so unless you or someone close to you falls under these categories you are unlikely to notice much of the campaign.</p>

<p>Edit: You can also get it yourself if you don't fall within one of these categories, just go to the pharmacy and buy one, then ask your doctor to inject it. You do have to pay for it yourself in this scenario.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's mostly city growth. Most people today live in cities, after all. So you can look at historic maps of cities and watch them grow especially after WWII. </p>
<p>A bit contrary to that some cities also changed parts of their structure. In many American and European cities poor people lived in very cramped conditions, this lead to a high population density. Since then apartments often became larger and people added more space between buildings and also more trees. So the space cities occupy grew faster than the population growth. Better public transport and suburbs did help with those as well. </p>
<p>Many European/American cities will never again reach the population density they once had around 1900, and that's a good thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's mostly improved sanitation, access to better nutrition and access to medical services.</p>
<p>Also worth pointing out that global urban pop went from 30% in the 50's to about 56% in 2020. So while definitely a lot more people live in cities it does not by itself account for the increase in population.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The human ingenuity and hard work that has gone into disease mitigation is so impressive, that many resonable people are not aware of how disastrous unchecked influenza can be. I defintely didn’t!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>you may be discounting that you’ve rarely had the flu because everyone else around you has been limiting your exposure by being themselves vaccinated etc </p>
<p>and the millions in federal funding to track flu infections and to fund local health systems to prepare for them.</p>
<p>anyways, fascinating stuff what goes into certain issues so the outcome is that we don’t realize they are issues, kinda like “what was all the hullabaloo about polio or 19th century famines!”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh definitely you're benefitting from the work. In the US, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/vaccine-supply-historical.htm" target="_blank">(very) roughly half the population</a> gets the flu vaccine every year, severely limiting it's ability to spread and mutate throughout the year.</p>
<p>Our constant companion &quot;the flu&quot; is actually many different strains all constantly evolving throughout the year, hence the need for a new vaccine every year. The more it spreads, the more opportunity for mutations/evolution. The more mutations, the greater the risk it will find some new variation of itself that's particularly deadly or particularly contagious.</p></div>		</li>
