			<div class="markdown"><p>I just want to say I don't know your personal situation, but there are wrist exercisers for sale on Amazon and such places for &lt;$50. I do suggest you do your own googling/youtubing on the subject and really try to listen to your body. My fiance bought me the elgin professional foot exerciser. That and proper squats  corrected a limp I've had for five years. I'm young, still, but I'm not letting myself get old yet.
P.S. I forgot to reiterate that you should keep talking with your doctor about this, that is very good, but I feel like doctors are just people and people forget that exercise is medicine as well. I think I have npd, I need to stop giving unsolicited advice.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I tried all sorts of stretching and core strengthening exercises to help with my back pain. Turns out I had Spondylolthesis, where my vertebrae had slipped forward pinching the nerves. Today marks 1 month post op from spinal fusion surgery</p></div>		</li>
