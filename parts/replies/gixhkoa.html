<p>Technically I've sorta done it as an unpaid reviewer for academic journal (science is weird, free labour for a paid submission...).</p>
<p>Not in academia anymore but sometimes try to explain to someone why their multi-page company white paper has about four lines of useful content and despite their multiple degrees they have no competence in sentence structure, paragraph structure, argument structure nor any empathy with how a reader parses material.  It is EXHAUSTING.  And as I mostly write code people don't believe I do english good and therefore aren't that interested in considering corrections until I intellectually carpet bomb their writing, which makes them sad.</p>
<p>PS. last time I did this on reddit is here: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/kcxjhh/why_can_we_develop_a_vaccine_for_covid_in_8/gftvp9w/?context=3" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/kcxjhh/why\_can\_we\_develop\_a\_vaccine\_for\_covid\_in\_8/gftvp9w/?context=3" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/kcxjhh/why\_can\_we\_develop\_a\_vaccine\_for\_covid\_in\_8/gftvp9w/?context=3</a></a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd be willing to bet money that you're a software guy, and not a hardware guy. </p>
<p>The first one is direct and concise. &quot;This is this, and that is that.&quot; Hardware guys don't beat around the bush. </p>
<p>The second follows a cause-and-effect rhythm. &quot;If this is true, then this. When that is true, then that.&quot; Software guys tend to like the step-by-step flow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My guess would be you have some engineering background and kind of knew this already?  It's harder to spot these kinds of issues if you are very familiar with the subject, in the same way that it can be hard to spot misspelled words in a familiar text. </p>
<p>Strictly speaking the second answer has more information and detail (specifying the various connection mechanisms that count as a sprocket, discussing ratchets and tracks) which will please someone familiar with the subject.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Before this I knew the layman's definition of gears and the fact that for some reason the bit on a bike is called a sprocket. The reason why this is called a sprocket and the difference between a cog and a gear was new to me.</p></div>		</li>
