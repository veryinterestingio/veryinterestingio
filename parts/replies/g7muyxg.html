<p>I get people don't want to be wrong on here, but a simplified half-truth is enough to sate the curiosity of someone who doesn't understand anything about the subject.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that generally people are trying to follow that thing Einstein or whatever, which to paraphrase went something like we should try to simply the truth as much as possible, but no simpler. Meaning, not simplify it to the point of being at all wrong. There are a lot of science misconceptions, I have even spread some, and they spread easily on sites like this. We have a duty to try and avoid that I think, but I'm definitely sympathetic to your frustration here. Most people have trouble simplifying, I know cause I have literally written reddit comments that had to come in multiple parts lol. It's nice when people have various levels of condensed explanation, ideally not misstating it at any of them but just leaving out details even when without them one might have nagging questions still.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But if it's only half-true then it's half-false and how does that do anyone any good?  The reality is most explanations are context-dependent.  Is an F-150 a car?  Well, in the sense that it's not a plane and it's not a dog, yes it absolutely is.  But if I'm trying to understand the difference between cars and trucks, then no it's not and it would be unhelpful to say it is.</p></div>		</li>
