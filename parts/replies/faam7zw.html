<p>Habitability and life are a completely different thing... usually just speculation... but if you want to find intelligent life we can comunicate, it needs to be similar enough...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is where I think our assumptions and our observer bias diverges away from the likely reality. Similar enough...that is a measure entirely unhelpful to the search for intelligences other than ours. In a universe as enormous as the one in which we exist, it is and always was, folly to look for things we recognise, rather than to look and at EVERYTHING, with the potential that it might harbour a) life, and b) intelligence. We have to learn to look and find things that we would not recognise, actually approach the matter as if at least partially motivated by a proper, rigorous, scientific method, which discounts only things it has observed up close and found to contain nothing of note, and considers all other things a potential source of wonder and new learning. </p>
<p>This ought to apply to the search for intelligent life as much as it does any other exploration into a matter. </p>
<p>If we always searched for that which we recognised, we would never have realised that there was no such thing as luminiferous aether, because we would have spent all our time searching for it, and ignoring results which didn't seem to fit the model of it, rather than really, honestly and without bias, examining the universe to find what it contains.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By the weak anthropic principle, we have to be the most common type of life form in the universe. While the exact implemention of the reference class may vary, carbon for its reactivity and water for it's solubility in a region of space that supports liquid water are very probably the most likely location for life. Of course, other types of life can exist, but to assume our form of life is the outlier puts the Earth and humans back at the center of the universe as &quot;special&quot; where we don't belong. </p>
<p>As such, while looking everywhere is important, with limited resources, it is eminently reasonable to constrain the search to locations that currently have the highest probability of finding life.</p></div>		</li>
