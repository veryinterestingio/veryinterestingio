			<div class="markdown"><p>Its really amazing how much science went into all our dating methods. Whenever people cast doubt on the accuracy of a method, they usually dont realize how much corroborating evidence we have.</p>
<p>Tree rings, carbon dating, fossil records, ice layers, (written) eyewitness accounts, patterns in   solar activity, plate tectonics, archeology, etc. Etc. All provide their own measures of when certain events happened, and they all corroborate to provide the full story.</p>
<p>If you are curious,  the list on  Wikipedia is a great start:

It's super interesting, and a pretty quick read.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn’t directly relevant, but the fact that looking out far into space is looking back in time can give us confidence that the universe appears to work by consistent laws. I don’t know if there’s observation that specifically confirms radioactive decay works the same, but we know the fundamental things it’s based on. They would likely have to change over time too for radioactive decay rates to change. I don’t think we see evidence that these laws and constants were different long ago.</p>
<p>Could use some confirmation from a scientist though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There actually is! A supernova we detected in 1987 (I believe) happened far away enough that we know it happened in the very distant past and from that supernova, we could detect trace amounts of some elements with short half lives. By continuing to observe the supernova, we also detected those elements disappearing at a rate that we expect today, showing the decay rate hadn't changed in the past few thousand years (I forget exactly how far away it is, and can't look it up right now)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's a fascinating book called <em>The Singular Universe and the Reality of Time</em> (by Unger &amp; Smolin) that discusses the possibility that fundamental laws of physics might change over time, and specifically that there may have been differences in the early universe:</p>

<p>I doubt this could applies to radioactive dating techniques, but I'm not an expert.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn't answer this question though.  You can have high accuracy in the short time where all tests agree and have horrible inaccuracies at longer time scales.</p>
<p>We have reasons to trust a 350 year old sample, but how do we know the methods are accurate for 350 MILLION year old samples.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same reasoning, different specific methods. </p>
<p>It's obscenely unlikely that the decay rates of <em>all</em> the isotopes you're using would shift at exactly the same rate over millions of years, so if all your methods still give you an answer in the same ballpark, it's safe to assume that that is the ballpark of the truth.</p>
<p>Also, one thing you do learn as a scientist is that any answer you have right now is your - and humanity's - <em>best working theory</em>. It's your duty to make those theories as good as you can, but if something better comes along, you can and must switch to that as soon as it is clearly shown to be better or more accurate than what you had before.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I wish more people understood that.  A lot of the silly arguments going around out there act like it's scientists making shit up because we (collectively) were wrong about stuff before, therefore we know nothing now.</p>
<p>Not happening here that I can see (not going to check the bottom of the comments), just nice to see it written out well the way you did.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can only work with the information you have at that given time. When more info presents itself its important to be open minded and understanding that we could learn something new at any moment that could potentially change that which we think we now. But with that said it always amazes me how much we know and understand. While there's obviously always more to learn and plenty of mystery out there,  its still amazing how much we can explain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The real answer is: radioactive decay is *very* well understood from a physics/chemistry perspective, and according to our known laws, there's no reason to believe it would have changed. We're not just saying, &quot;well we see them decay like this now, so they probably did in the past&quot;. We know why they decay, and the reasoning is very stable over time. That is why we believe it's a stable process.</p>
<p>Of course, we could be wrong and radioactive decay might've changed some time before recorded history. Gravity could also stop working and we'd all float off into the void. As a physicist, I'd put the likelihood of either of those two events within a similar order of magnitude.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was an arbitrary example. You can generally find overlap and congruence even among the dating methods for older items. The logic holds.</p>
<p>Of course the margin of error increases, but that isn't really an indictment of these methods. It speaks more to precision than it does accuracy.</p></div>		</li>
