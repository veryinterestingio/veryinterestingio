			<div class="markdown"><p>It's definitely being researched and we already have the processing equipment that we would need, it's just not economical at the moment.</p>
<p>You can imagine having a recycling plant sort incoming garbage would be 10+ times as efficient as trying to dig up and sort old garbage. From what I've heard, we have way more material being sent to recycling plants than we can process anyway, so digging up old stuff just doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>Mining asteroids will be great long term because they are so rich in minerals, but we would need cheaper rocketry or an entirely new propulsion system to make it efficient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would it be more economical if you were able to separate all the materials and sell them individually? Sell the plastic to plastic manufacturers, paper to paper mills, glass to glass manufacturers, and metals to metals processors. Between all those sources of income I bet it would be able to run a profit at a large enough scale.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In mining you generally just throw away the trash rocks from the mining process, if you were able to sell that material you would make more than just tossing it away like you would with rocks when mining copper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i still cant wrap my head around space mining. i know it's just like make rocket, land on asteroid, mine stuff, and go back but it sounds so futuristic. like something that will come in 2100 with flying cars and stuff</p>
<p>and yet technology in my daily life are still &quot;normal&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this (metallurgical engineer here) virgin ore i.e the stuff that we get from the ground hasn't be alloyed yet so doesn't have all that other stuff mixed with it. Example is recycled steel there are certain things that recycled steel can't be used for as it has higher concentrations of copper then virgin iron and copper can't be removed from solution with steel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Places that but waste for energy are merely collecting that which was not destroyed by the process, not all metals will survive the process however, and the ones that remain will still have to be sorted. I don't know the particulars, but many businesses will attempt to make <em>some</em> money off waste like that because it's still worth <em>something</em> and the alternative is to pay to dispose of it anyway. </p>
<p>There wouldn't be a good way to separate Tin from Lead from Iron for instance, like if they were all used in a computer apaprt from paying someone to disassemble every computer by hand and sort it out which isn't economically viable. If you just burn the thing to get the iron, the tin and lead would melt first and form some alloy or slag that would take further refinement or separation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good to know. I heard there is a mining operation at my local landfill to get metals out of W2E ash but it didnâ€™t sound lucrative. Unfortunately we have a giant recycling problem now so the agency I work for is almost in a state of panic over waste to resource issues.</p></div>		</li>
