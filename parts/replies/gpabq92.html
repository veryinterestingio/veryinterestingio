			<div class="markdown"><p>For some, maybe. Most animals adapted to retain as much salt as possible though, using kidneys to super concentrate waste in their urine, and retain as much salt and water as possible.</p>
<p>However salts are incredibly important in the body from everything from conduction of nerve signals to actiating muscles. Reducing overall salt levels would probably be detrimental for most animals</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting point. If that was the case, animals might have different amounts of salt depending on the amount of adaptation. All I could find quickly was &quot; The salt content of the blood and other body fluids of marine mammals is not very different from that of terrestrial mammals or any other vertebrates: it is about one third as salty as seawater. &quot; from scientific american.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funfun bonus: You can desalinate seawater with a balloon and piece of string.</p>
<p>Stick 1m (3') of string, cotton works great, into a balloon leaving about 1/8 hanging out.</p>
<p>Blow up the balloon and tie it closed. </p>
<p>Let the string soak up salt water. Evaporated water trapped inside the balloon is free of salt. It takes some time and bright sun def helps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is implying that salt endlessly accumulates in the oceans over time, which is not the case. There are outputs as well as inputs of salts to the ocean and it’s the balance between those two which determines the level of any particular salt, as the top answer here explains. The Earth’s early oceans are in fact thought to have been much saltier than those of today.</p></div>		</li>
