			<div class="markdown"><p>Clouds reach to the troposphere, topping out as cirrus. Considering a typical cruise altitude of 30,000 ft? Plenty of moisture there to form cirrus and other ice clouds. The fact that commercial jets have to dodge round cumulonimbus clouds should speak volumes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing is, when clouds are already made of ice crystals as cirrus clouds are, the ice does not tend to stick to and accumulate on the aircraft. Aircraft are generally only in danger of icing between 10 degrees C and -20 degrees C because above 10C it’s too warm to freeze and below -20C the moisture is usually already ice and doesn’t stick. One major exception to this is towering cumulonimbus clouds which are full of supercooled droplets brought high into the atmosphere by strong updrafts that stay liquid below 0C but will readily freeze when they hit the skin of a plane. The danger of severe icing is one of many reasons planes don’t fly into thunderstorms (others are strong and unpredictable updrafts and downdrafts, severe turbulence, hail, and lightning). But it is not so critical to avoid ice clouds like cirrus.</p></div>		</li>
