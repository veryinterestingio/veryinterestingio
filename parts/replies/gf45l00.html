			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're more used to being awake longer hours your body will adapt and learn that it needs to lengthen its cycle. Your eyes will still get dry but it won't be as dry and it will take longer to happen. </p>
<p>Or if even though you had pulled an all nighte if r you weren't awake in the morning it could be that your body's sleep schedule has rotated to compensate and instead of getting dry at night yours will get dry in the morning or afternoon of the following day.</p>
<p>The human body is pretty adaptable on that level so if its a common thing your body with try to adjust to allow for it.</p></div>		</li>
