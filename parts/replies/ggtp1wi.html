			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're interested in growing (non-water-adapted) plants in liquids, then &quot;hydroponics&quot; is the term to google.</p>
<p>Generally there are three approaches to the problem you describe.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Tidal water - i.e. the water level rises and falls periodically so the roots get access to water but also access to air</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;aeroponics&quot; involving a fine spray of water - often by having tiny bubbles rise up through a bath and making a fizzy surface</p>
</li>
<li>lots of air blown through the water so that it forms a seething mass of air/water mixed together</li>
</ol>
<p>Which one is used depends on various trade-offs in terms of energy usage, noise, and what the plants in question work well with (and probably other stuff - I'm not really an expert, just a nerd who did a few experiments after some googling :-P)</p>
<p>The tidal water approach is the most common, as I understand it, and can be fairly easily achieved with a pump and an autosiphon, the water flowing out from one section can be used as the inflow for a lower section, meaning a single source of inflow can be used for a larger area of plant growth.</p>
<p>The other thing that needs care is ensuring that the water contains all the necessary nutrients that would otherwise be provided by the soil (/compost/fertiliser...) One approach to this is called &quot;aquaculture&quot; which involves cycling the water between hydroponically grown plants and fish or other aquatic animals. The plants use the natural fertiliser produced by pooping fishies and provide clean water for the fish. Depending on the fish and plants, you can even feed the fish with bits of the plants that aren't your crop, though you'd have to provide more food than just that because of that pesky second law of thermodynamics :-(</p></div>		</li>

<p>Are you talking about just using one of them &quot;bubble bars&quot; that you get in an aquarium store? or something significantly more &quot;bubbly&quot;?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>also, </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is all true, but OP mentioned he is growing lucky bamboo, which generally grows with submersed roots, sometimes fully submersed for long periods of time. I'm growing them in my aquarium, actually. Not quite sure what OP's challenge is, but lucky bamboo has some odd lighting and nutrient needs - good candidate for aquaculture/aquaponics, tho!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey OP, a lot of responses to this thread don't apply to lucky bamboo. You shouldn't have to worry about oxygen too much as long as you are doing your weekly water changes and keeping the lighting somewhat minimal. There is a lot of info on lucky bamboo all over the internet, but if you are getting root rot from growing in a jar, there might be something up with your plants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi they're fine so far, I change the water once up to two times a week and use mineral water. They drink extremely much. I also always clean the jar they're in. So far their roots look orange, I'm just scared that it'll start rotting when it gets older.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add on to the other good replies, water temperature has a massive effect on dissolved oxygen (DO) so much so that if you water gets up near 80F (26.6C) you're going to quickly run into severe problems with lack of oxygen, algae colonies ( which will fuck with the DO and nutrient composition), ph imbalances, which will all change nutrients uptake by the roots.  Good rule of thumb if you can't keep things between 68-74F don't bother.   Granted, I know nothing about bamboo, but all my knowledge comes from Deep water culture DWC, recirculating DWC, and flood to drain cannabis hydroponics. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Brilliant! I am in SE Spain (hot, hot, hot all year round) and I have a greenhouse on the balcony. I have played with the idea of a simple hydro system many times, but simple scrapped it since the sun/heat here makes it pretty much non-viable and there is no temperate control in the greenhouse.  I experimented with Hempie pots tho which I think are quite fun!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: soil does the same thing by drying out. Voids in the soil form when water is evaporated, filled by air. That’s why packing soil too tightly can be deadly.</p>
<p>It’s not the water that drowns a plant, but the lack of evaporation.</p></div>		</li>
