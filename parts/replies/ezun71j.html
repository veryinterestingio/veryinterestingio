			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not how autotune works at all. It does exactly what it sounds like, takes the existing out of tune note and shifts it to an in tune note. It can be more nuanced than that, but it's basically how it works. It doesn't generate multiple copies around the note as you state. You can use tuning technology to do that, if you wanted, but that's not the general case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you manipulate the digital signal and do convolution or phase transformation you are essentially multiplying with signals of different phase, frequency, or both and that is kind of what OP is saying in a more simplified way. If you just change the frequency it will sound wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's true that pitch correction is not easy. If you change the pitch naively, it will also change the timing of the sound and the timbre will not be realistic, especially as you change it farther and farther from the original pitch. That's why the plugins that can do the tuning in a realistic sounding way were such a revolution when they came out.<br />
BUT, the way that OP is describing it is WRONG. The note, when autotuned, is not duplicated above and below the note, nor does the note waver above and below the note (it would sound like vibrato if it did, something that singers can naturally do). Something sounds autotuned (e.g. the T-Pain effect) when it is pitch corrected in such a way that it sounds unnatural. This is a combination of the pitch being unnaturally in tune, shifting very abruptly between notes, and the artifacts of being pitch shifted (as we discussed, pitch shifting without changing the timbre to be unnatural is difficult).<br />
These days the tuning plugins are very realistic sounding, even when pushed to an extreme. If the pitching is kept to be more natural instead of robotic, you'd never know it was done. Likely you've heard many songs where it's been done and don't know it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also : you'll notice some singers start singing out of tune if they can't hear themselves. A crowd works like a feedback, where you can tune yourself to what other people are singing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is monstrously wrong. Pitch does not &quot;average out&quot;. If an orchestra has literally one player out of tune, you can EASILY hear it.</p>
<p>This is a terribly misguided answer and I ask that you remove it. This isn't how tonality works psychologically (how our minds process music) or physically (the actual relationships between pitches as waves).</p>
<p>On top of that, that isn't how autotune works either. Please remove this answer. I don't mean to be rude, but this is just completely incorrect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I edited a couple things to clarify a little, but your orchestra example isn't what I was saying.  A single instrument that's off in an orchestra that is otherwise perfect is definitely going to be noticeable, no doubt, but that's a single obvious error</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If two people are equally out of tune, one is 10 cents sharp and one is 10 cents flat, it would be worse than if just one person was out of tune. There is no point in which multiple people being out of tune will ever average out or center around a single pitch. Pitch is just a frequency of vibrations or pressure changes or the air. If two people are playing the same note perfectly in tune, the waves won't interfere with each other. (this isn't actually 100% correct of me to say since harmonics are formed through interference of multiple in tune notes, but that's not important right now). When those 2 people are out of tune, the waves DO interfere with each other, and you can <em>literally hear</em> the waves in the sound. The waves slow down as the players get closer in pitch until they match perfectly with zero waves.</p>
<p>The autotune part isn't what I'm concerned with, it's the rest of your answer that is wrong.</p></div>		</li>
