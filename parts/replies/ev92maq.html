<p>As is, it's too small.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>10-20 for short lived deuterium fusion which is not sustainable. To be a star you need sustainable fusion. Proton-proton chain reactions would start occurring if Jupiter is around 75 times more massive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it's formed of the early nebula at a distance far enough away that solar emissions did not affect it beyond a very small value.  This means Jupiter is a good representation of origins.  Jupiter would have to be many multiples of itself to maintain a stable fusion core, somewhere just above eighty if conditions were met.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Jupiter is composed primarily of Hydrogen, much like the sun. </p>
<p>If it were <del>~10x</del> ~100x more massive, it would be hot enough in the middle to sustain fusion, and it would be a small star instead of a gas giant.
You can think of it as a failed star. </p>
<p>It'll almost certainly never become a star, as it would need to accrete <del>~10x</del> ~100x its current mass in hydrogen, and that's not feasible in our solar system.</p></div>		</li>
