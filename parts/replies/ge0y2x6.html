			<div class="markdown"><p>A word of caution - I did some digging into that first source, since accidentally contaminating Mars with fungus would likely have made massive waves, and it looks like the submitter, Rhawn Gabriel Joseph, is known for pushing his theories on panspermia and the origins of life, even suing NASA for not investigating a rock he saw in a photo which he deemed a fungal colony. While the photos he uploaded are indeed from NASA, his added captions (&quot;A majority of Biologists and Geologists agree [that this looks like fungus]&quot;) don't seem to be sourced and are likely bogus. </p>
<p>Would love to hear if there are any more verifiable sources on contamination/sterilization failure, though! I imagine the human-inhabited stations make sense, since humans can't avoid carrying spores and whatnot with them, but it'd be a different story with unmanned interplanetary vehicles.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for picking this up! As I mentioned in my other reply, a lot of the good sources on this topic are behind paywalls so I am having trouble. Iâ€™ve made a minor wording change in my original comment to reflect the questionable nature of this source.</p>
<p>Yes, manned missions are certainly the main concern, this is where my work was. There were projects by others in my group on Mars rovers though. <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/06/190627121252.htm" target="_blank">Here</a> is an article addressing some worries about fungal survival on spacecraft exteriors</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2007/11may_locad3" target="_blank">This article</a> has some, including how power failures caused a rise in humidity favouring mold growth, and how a floating globule of infested brown water almost the size of a basketball was found in an less-accessed area. There's then things like mold growth on spacesuits, rubber sealing, communication devices etc., the same sort of stuff that's seen in the ISS. <a href="https://scienceline.org/2018/03/fungi-love-to-grow-in-outer-space/" target="_blank">One secondary source</a> mentions that the inside of Mir apparently smelled like a rotting basement</p>
<p>Unfortunately I'm struggling to give any other good examples, most of the best primary sources on Mir (incl. N Novikova and team) are paywalled, and my research in this area was too brief and too long ago to remember any good stories</p></div>		</li>
