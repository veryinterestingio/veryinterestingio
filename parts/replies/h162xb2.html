<p>Taking this potential at face value, it does certainly have infinite range, just like the Coulomb potential. But because of the confinement term, at reasonably low energies we only ever observe color-charged particles in confined bound states. And QCD bound states have characteristic sizes on the order of femtometers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this part requires some additional explaination. The confinement terms scales positive with r, which means it becomes even stronger with distance. This again means that the field between two color charges quickly becomes so strong, that it is just energetically easier to generate a q-q_bar pair from the vacuum which binds to and neuralises these free separeted charges again. And that is exactly what happens. This is why we only ever observe bound strong states.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Quite the opposite.  Particles and antiparticles <em>cannot</em> come into existence at random.  Creating particles and antiparticles requires energy, and energy is conserved; the vacuum is the lowest-energy state that is accessible, so you can't pull energy out of the vacuum to create real particles and antiparticles randomly, as that would require violating conservation of energy.</p>
<p>On the contrary, when you have quarks separated by a large enough distance, there is enough potential energy available in the system that a quark-antiquark pair <em>can</em> be created, and with enough distance it becomes more energetically favorable to do so; therefore it happens.  All conservation laws are respected during this process, including conservation of energy.</p>
<p>Hope that helps,</p></div>		</li>
