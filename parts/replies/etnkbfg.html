			<div class="markdown"><p>You're welcome. It's a great channel.</p>
<p>PBS also has a channel called Eons which is about paleontology that is awesome. Some of the topics are elementary but I've seen videos that teach me something different from what I learned in school. Which then makes me feel old because I realize how long it's been since I was in school...</p>
<p>Point is, PBS studios is great</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, also that said that butterfly wings aren't really blue, the just reflect blue light and absorb the rest, which as far as I know all colours work...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't watched the video in a long while but if I remember correctly he said the blue in the wings are not from pigment but due to a structure of molecules and how they reflect light.</p>
<p>You're right in your assessment of how colors work but for animals to be blue they need to go a different, and more rare, route</p></div>		</li>
