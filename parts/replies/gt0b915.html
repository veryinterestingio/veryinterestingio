			<div class="markdown"><p>I knew a guy who ran sound for a venue and he had something he called &quot;the suck button.&quot; He'd only deploy it if the band were acting like dicks. The time I saw him do it, the band was warned multiple times they were going over their allotted time, and purposely ignored it to stay on stage longer, taking time from the other musicians on the bill.</p>
<p>He adjusted some things on the board to give <em>just the singer's monitor </em> a one second delay and a half step pitch adjustment. Almost immediately he started singing off time and out of tune. He kept stopping to figure out what was going wrong, but could never figure it out. He tried powering through, but then the bassist and drummer couldn't handle the weird time difference.
The whole band fell apart in seconds. Rather than the triumphant ending the singer was clearly aiming for, they skidded awkwardly to a stop and shuffled off stage in shame.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never induced latency (or pitch shift) on a vocal monitor before, but that is absolutely killer.. nobody could sing through that haha. I'd be worried the band would figure it out honestly, could totally get reprimanded (or even fired) for fucking with a band's set.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Thought 1:  As a singer, this is some Satan-level magic here.  Harsh as heck.</p>
<p>Thought 2:  This is why you should have forgiveness for anyone who sings the Star Spangled Banner in a stadium.  Problems with delays, echos, sometimes even tuning are common, and sometimes hard to correct, too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, those are called in ear monitors (IEMs).</p>
<p>Not too long ago bands would have big wedge-shaped speakers facing them so they could hear themselves.</p>
<p>These days most bands have switched to IEMs. Each musician gets exactly the mix they want (more guitar, less bass, etc.).</p>
<p>Some bands have even switched to a &quot;silent stage&quot;, where even guitars and drums are digitized and sent straight to the ear, without traditional amps. And this isn't just happening for American Idol pop singers - bands like Metallica have been ampless for some years now.</p>
<p>Edit: I should add that some bands send a &quot;click&quot; track through IEMs to help everyone stay on beat. Some bands also have people (techs) off-stage give them cues to help the performance, like the start of a lyric or when to end. So yes, they can also be used for 'cheating'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Happened to me the first time I sang with a micro. Couldn't hear myself and couldn't find out if I was tuned. Then the sound tech realized that he forgot to turn on our feedback speakers. Quickly realized why everyone was looking at me with a puzzled face. I was completely out of tune.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I took a trip to Vegas and went out into the desert, it was wild just how quite it was. And when talking to someone you had to face them otherwise they couldn’t really hear you because there was nothing for the sound to bounce back off of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I will add to that something cool, as a person who stutters, the reason why someone stutters is different from one person to another, however there is a common reason which is: </p>
<p>When we hear ourselves stutter it’s sometimes kinda embarrassing so we TRY HARD to reduce it and force ourselves to speak fluently but what it actually does it adds pressure and stress which makes us stutter even more so we get stuck in a loop <del>until we die cuz we ran out of breath</del></p>
<p>Stuttering is just in our brains there’s nothing physically wrong with our mouths? Or Vocal chords?? Nope thats why most of us speak very fluently when we’re alone it proves that we CAN ACTUALLY speak normally </p>
<p>But our mean brains doesn’t want us to,
So lets say i cant hear my voice?
Whats gonna happen? My brain doesn’t know that im actually speaking let alone stuttering which means no stress no pressure = no stutter.</p>
<p>( i know its kinda unrelated I thought its cool and wanted to throw it in )^ English is not my first language...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it does, talking in vc sometimes is worse than talking face to face with someone, because they don’t see my face, my lips or my body language,
They just hear and focus on what im saying which adds to the pressure.</p>
<p>In my experience noise canceling headphones or playing loud noises reduces my stuttering.
And about recording myself it is weird,, if im doing it to keep it ONLY for myself then its fine however if im recording a voice message to send it to someone it’s different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm one of those 'lucky' stutterers who still stutters when I'm alone or talking to a pet. I'm about 20% fluent on any given day. It's a tiny bit better when I'm alone, but I still can't hit certain consonants, so I can't fully relate to that.</p>
<p>But I once heard another stutterer explain the 'fluent when alone' thing like... </p>
<p>Say everyone has a cup full of energy for an interaction. When they're fluent, they're able to navigate both verbal and non-verbal (eye contact, emotions, posture, body language, etc) speech, and still have some energy left over. When a stutterer tries the same thing, they're expending all their energy much faster because so much energy is going into overcoming their disfluency, and using their non-verbal speech to help (overcoming tics, broadcasting words, etc). When we're alone, we don't need to put any energy into our non-verbal speech, therefor allowing us to use all our energy on overcoming the disfluency. </p>
<p>Anyway, I thought that was a pretty cool way of explaining it, and it stuck with me. It brings home the old SLP adage of &quot;stop trying to learn not to stutter, and start trying to learn to stutter better&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A good friend of mine was stuttering. We were in the same class at school since 5th grade. Slowly and unnoticed his stuttering became better but only when we were out of class and no teacher was close. During classes he would still stutter. Someday we noticed that, we don't know when he stopped stuttering when talking to us.</p></div>		</li>
