<p>Aside from the joke that has already been made, a lot of the movies from the 2000s have a nasty habit of being too dark to see from my home screen. Batman Begins is the first one that comes to mind. Until reading this, I thought this was a fad directors got hard for because everyone is doing it because it‚Äôs artsy fart-sy.</p>
<p>I am glad movies tend to avoid these scenes in recent years. It still happens, but at least it‚Äôs for shorter segments of time and less frequent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Movies that are too dark to view on traditional LCD TVs are absolutely stunning on a OLED TV.  Additionally, proper 4K HDR content can be mind blowing, but the popping highlights and vivid colors can cause eye strain and eye fatigue with extended viewing.   My wife and I have realized this only recently due to COVID-19 keeping us in the house pretty much all the time.</p>
<p>If you haven't experienced one yet first hand you absolutely should. I have a LG OLED C8  from 2018, which can be found for huge markdowns right now if you can find one or go with the latest gen, which have marginal improvements.</p>
<p>You can also tone down brightness and enable settings to lesson the popping highlights for easier viewing late at nights or during extended movie marathons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to more close ups. It's easier to cover a scene with more close ups. Easier to edit with more close ups. It's easier to hide bad performances with more close ups. It's easier to pay less BG with more close ups. Faster to light with more close ups. It's easier to do everything with more close ups. It's cheaper to do everything with more close ups. A lot of the things you say are because of money, not because the screen is smaller. Maybe before HDTV it was a major reason why TV movies were filmed differently. But now days, it's all about the lack of budget and talent.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This depends what the close up is, close ups of actors expose EVERY nuance, it certainly can't hide a bad performance and makes bad performances MUCH worse. </p>
<p>But if you mean cut aways, then I guess you could hide bad performances (visually at least) to a degree simply because you're not showing them</p></div>		</li>
