			<div class="markdown"><p>Try meditating for 5 minutes before before be and see the difference of how many times you wake up. I was never much of a believer until I saw after meditating before bed I was waking up 10-20 times less on my fitbit.</p>
<p>Of course I don't do this anymore but hey it was fun to try.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Weird.  Mine is pretty accurate from what I can tell. </p>
<p>It definitely nails around when I fall asleep to around when I wake up accurately.  I don't think I've ever had it tell me I was asleep when I was definitely awake.</p>
<p>I had a Garmin Fenix 3 (no HR monitor tho) and THAT had the worst sleep tracking I've seen.  I'd got to bed at midnight and probably fall asleep around 12:15-12:30am and wake up at 6:30 am and it'd tell me I got 12 hours of sleep since I was sleeping at 9pm and I woke up at 9am.  </p>
<p>I don't know how accurate the sleep cycles are, but yeah the start and end times for me are accurate.</p></div>		</li>
