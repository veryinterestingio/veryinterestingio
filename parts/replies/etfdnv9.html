			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. I will never forget me and my buddy playing Resident Evil 4 at 3am, everyone else is asleep and we're just sitting there dead quiet playing through the game. I walked by the merchant who says &quot;What are ya buying?&quot; and just turned and blasted him with the shotgun. For some reason, this just sent us into a fit of crying laughter. We woke up his sister and she came storming out fussing at us, but we couldn't stop laughing, which made her even more mad. Good times!</p></div>		</li>
