<blockquote>

<p>Yes, it is.  Though &quot;thermal energy&quot; is the preferrable term to &quot;heat,&quot; as heat is an <em>exchange</em> of thermal energy (like how displacement is a change of position), and &quot;light&quot; (photons) isn't considered part of the &quot;mass&quot; of galaxies since they are not gravitationally bound to galaxies, instead they are categorized separately into their own contribution and factored into cosmological models when it is appropriate.  Neither thermal energy nor light have any significant impact on the masses of galaxies or their gravitational dynamics.</p>

<p>No, they aren't, and we do have the ability to calculate precisely how trivial they are.</p>
<p>The very early universe -- which was extremely energy-dense and expanded from there -- went through a &quot;photon-dominated&quot; era, where radiation was the primary contributor to gravitational dynamics as radiation comprised most of the total energy density.  However, this only lasted for about 47,000 years after the big bang.  After that point, the primary contribution to the total energy density switched over to matter (both baryonic and dark), which loses energy density at a lesser rate as the universe expands.  For the next 10 billion years or so, the universe was in this matter-dominated era, until finally even matter's density decreased enough that dark energy became the primary contributor to the total energy density. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_factor_(cosmology\)#Chronology" target="_blank">[Source]</a></p>
<p>Today, about 68% of the universe's total energy density is calculated to be provided by dark energy.  Of the remainder, dark matter makes up about 27%, baryonic matter makes up about 5% (including thermal energy), and photons (light) barely make up even a tiny fraction of a percent.  Most photons are part of the cosmic microwave background (relics from the earliest era, the photon-dominated one, when photons were generated in tremendous numbers), and the CMB only makes up only about 0.006% of the total energy density (so about 3-4 orders of magnitude less than the energy density of matter in galaxies); non-CMB photons makes up far less.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background#Features" target="_blank">[Source]</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>Don't asteroids have their orbits altered due to impacting solar photons? Is there not a comparable effect at galactic scales?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While radiation does gravitate, its effect is negligible nowadays since almost all matter is non-relativistic (meaning it moves much slower than the speed of light and hence its energy is dominated by its rest mass).  That has not always been the case, however. Early in the Universe, matter was so hot that it was relativistic (that is, its rest mass was negligible compared to its kinetic energy) and behaved like radiation. A Universe filled with radiation behaves quite differently than one filled with non-relativistic matter.</p>
<p>As the Universe expanded, everything cooled down: massive particles became slower until they were non-relativistic and behaved like matter; massless particles were redshifted to lower frequencies. One thing to keep in mind is that there were are lot more photons in the Universe than baryons (&quot;normal matter&quot;, which then went on to form all the normal matter you see in the Universe). In fact, there's around a billion photons per baryon. Think a billion photons for every atom in the Universe. These photons are still around today and make up the cosmic microwave background. But even all the photons in the CMB only contribute 1/10'000 of the energy density in the Universe today, which just shows how much the Universe has expanded since those early times.</p>
<p>Compared to that, the couple photons that are produced today in stars or other astronomical processes are absolutely negligible.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wouldn't it be a billion photons for every subatomic particle? Baryons are electrons, protons, neutrons and antimatter equivalents, right? More than one per atom?</p></div>		</li>
