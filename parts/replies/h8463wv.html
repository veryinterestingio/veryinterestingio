			<div class="markdown"><p>Staring at a 2d plane for too long does, whether for reading or TV. It's called locking in and comes as a result of overfocus on near objects. It's no coincidence that people who read a lot tend to wear glasses.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tell that to every single study into the massive rise in nearsightedness over the last 100 years. Reading with artificial light destroys your vision over time. Countries like south Korea and china where studying late into the night is the norm have over 70% of children needing glasses and it gets worse every year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You've definitely never farmed. Having poor eyesight out in the field while you're working with draft horses who are pulling plows and carts over and through Rocky ground... This person is going to be injured a lot more frequently, and be much much slower than a farmer with good eyesight. </p>
<p>I'd say it would be a lot easier to be a weaver with poor eyesight. And even that would be incredibly hard</p></div>		</li>
