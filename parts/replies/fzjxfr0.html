			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually Brillo is enough.</p>
<p>I lived in a real dumpster of an apartment in Boston that had a mouse problem.</p>
<p>Every week or so they’d come by and stuff all the new holes with Brillo. It seemed to work for a few days and then there’d just be a new spot they crawled out of.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Their end state was “buy a cat” I got out of there ASAP</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like typical apartment complex pest control. Management can't really afford proper control, so they just pay the minimum amount to have paperwork that says &quot;eh, we tried&quot;, in case somebody brings the city into it.</p>
<p>But yeah, this is exactly why you don't just block the holes: they'll just chew their way in (or out) somewhere else. You have to trap them, first, <em>then</em> exclude to prevent the arrival of newcomers. But this is labor intensive, therefore expensive, therefore cheap apartment complexes won't pay for it.</p>
<p>Far better to trap them, yourself, <em>then</em> bring management in to perform the exclusion repairs. Assuming the apartment isn't falling apart so bad exclusion is actually impossible (another reason you might get bad pest control: it's hopeless anyway, everyone knows it, but management has to pretend to care, so pest control has to pretend to try).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly I think the biggest problem was the “trash room”. It was just a room on the ground floor of the building that had a door to the outside that you put your trash in.</p>
<p>You could hear them scurry every time you tossed a bag on the pile, easily hundreds of them.</p>
<p>At night we’d have 5+ active mice in our 700sqft apartment. I’m guessing the building was just infested. It was almost 100 years old and I feel like there’s not much they could do</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a similar situation with mice in that chewed a hole around the gas pipe to my stove and I ended up setting a baited mouse trap each day until we stopped catching mice then I plugged it up with some Great Stuff.</p></div>		</li>
