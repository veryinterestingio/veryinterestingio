			<div class="markdown"><p>The covid vaccine simply introduces the spike protein mRNA to the cell without the rest of the virus iirc. The antibodies produced can target multiple sites of the spike protein so effectively yes, the vaccine should still work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The current vaccines (Moderna, Pfizer, AstraZeneca) help your body target the virus' outer layer of spike proteins, the appearance of which give these viruses their &quot;corona&quot;. The spike proteins of this particular virus are very good at sticking or absorbing to some of our cells, owing in part to how infectious it is. As long as these spike proteins don't change or mutate too much, the vaccines should continue to work. That's a very general explanation for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my understanding, it's the shape of the spike proteins that make it so infectious in the first place. So if it did mutate to change those, it would probably make it less infectious/dangerous, anyway?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>viruses are constantly mutating. Especially RNA viruses. The RNA dependent RNA polymerase enzyme (what many RNA viruses use) have very poor proofreading mechanism, compared to our own host enzyme. if it’s a virus, you should 100% assume it’s mutating all the time, because that’s their job, we just don’t care because most 99% of the mutations are bad for the virus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Coronaviruses actually have a good proofreading exonuclease. So the mutation rate is kinda low for an RNA virus, but that's not saying much.</p></div>		</li>
