			<div class="markdown"><p>Aren’t they moving at different speeds though? Like you’d think the bullet would move faster and hit the ground faster because if I shoot my foot it penetrates but if I just drop a bullet on my foot it won’t do that because it’s not moving fast enough. Or do I just have the physics completely wrong?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you shot the bullet at the ground it would reach faster. This scenario is about the effects of gravity. If you shoot a bullet exactly horizontal as drop a bullet at the same time, gravity will pull the speeding bullet to the ground at the same rate as the dropping bullet. They reach the ground at the same time, but the shot bullet goes a far distance before it hits the ground due to the speed and direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to think velocity (speed + direction) in the direction of the ground. If you shoot a bullet directly parallel to the ground, it doesnt fall any faster than one you dripped and if released at the same time would reach the ground at the exact same time. </p>
<p>A bullet fired a degree off of parallel, in any direction, will add a component of velocity towards or away from the ground and would arrive at a different time.</p></div>		</li>
