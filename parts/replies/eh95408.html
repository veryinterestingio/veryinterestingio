			<div class="markdown"><p>This also explains why wind whistling and howling tends to be much more pronounced during the winter months. Without leaves to catch the wind, all those branches will have a lot more turbulent air rushing around and past them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great question for today, as I live in michigan and we just had crazy wind for like the past 24 hours (40-60mph gusts). It was non stop too.  I could hear every possible noise in my house. Every gap or crack was making a whistling sound. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It sounded like a hoard of barbarians was trying to break down my garage doors. Iâ€™ve never seen anything like this in 38 years here in Southwest MI. Wind, sure, but not for such a long period of time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a road side rest area in Idaho east of Craters of the Moon that has holes in the posts that display the signs of the town that was the first to harvest nuclear energy. The posts are generic so there is like 20 holes so signs can be adjusted. The wind whistles like a flute through these holes and it sounds beautiful.</p></div>		</li>
