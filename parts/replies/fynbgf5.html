			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to this, sometimes cells pass through the placenta. This can result in children being chimeric with their mothers' cells. (This is actually thought to be a major cause of type 1 diabetes as the immune system attacks the mothers' cells in the pancreas.) </p>
<p>Likewise, cells from the baby can get into the mother. To avoid an immune reaction that would kill the baby, mothers' bodies supress some immune actions during pregnancy. That's why women with MS go into remission during pregnancy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it could happen, but the donor list would be known, and the actual DNA source would be found.</p>
<p>No, chimera DNA won't stand out.  Detectives would need to do detecting to finish it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does this affect genetic offspring?  Say I have a bone marrow transplant (whether after total depletion or only local depletion), and then later have a child.  Will my sperm or egg be genetically &quot;mine&quot; or will it also be genetically tied to the marrow donor (or some mix there-of)?  If my child does a DNA test, would the results show me as the parent, and will it show my ancestry as theirs; or will it show the donor as parent and their ancestry?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It will show up as yours - gametogenesis (generation of the sperm/egg) occurs in the testes/ovaries, and haematopoeitic stem cells don’t give rise to the mature gametes. Unless the person is already a chimera (such as by absorbing a twin in utero), the ovaries/testes will be of their own genetic descent, although being a chimera is kind of trippy in its own right in the way genetic identity is established...</p>
<p>For a fun fact, in spermatogenesis, sperm are created throughout the human’s lifetime beginning at puberty, while in females oogenesis begins before or shortly after birth by the transformation of oogonia to primary oocytes, meaning that by the time of birth all the eggs a female will ever develop are already in existence! It isn’t the final product, though, because this process stalls at the first phase of meiosis (a form of cell division) called prophase I, and then restarts at the time of the first menstrual cycle, before stalling again at metaphase II until fertilization by a sperm occurs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but I remember reading about something like this. Female reproduction is basically the baseline asexual reproduction of our single-celled forebears and you don't get much genetic drift from female gametes. This is where sexual reproduction was such a boon for organisms that adopted it, the introduction of &quot;male&quot; gametes which were more affected by current environment was where you got a lot of genetic drift.</p></div>		</li>
