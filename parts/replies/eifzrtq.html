			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, definitely. The windows on the Boeing 787 already do this, though they use the 1st method where adding charge darkens the window, so in case of emergency power loss the windows will come back to full transparency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A little pedantry:</p>
<p>The windows revert to full transparency when regular power is lost, not when emergency power is lost as your comment may suggest.</p>
<p>I assume you intended &quot;emergency power loss&quot; to mean &quot;when there's a loss of regular power in an emergency&quot; but that phrasing is slightly unfortunate since it could suggest the loss of emergency power</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I just assumed these windows used polarization and adjusted the angle of the film to the window to produce different intensities of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Polarising is a more old school approach, and more mechanical. To filter with polarised screens, you need two polarised screens. It's basically that old school science thing - put two polarised lenses against each other. Rotate it one way, it lets light through basically perfectly. Rotate one of them 90 degrees and they go black. So to do it with a window, you'd need to physically rotate whatever medium was polarising the light.</p>
<p>These days, its mainly used for when you want a constant reduction in brightness like on glasses and, I think, some libraries use it to protect older books from UV.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's used on glasses because reflected light is polarized (from a lake it is horizontal, from a building window it is vertical). When you are driving most reflections are horizontal (car windscreens, lakes) and create horizontally polarized light. By making the glasses vertically polarized it filters out the reflections and makes it much easier on the eyes. </p>
<p>This is why photography also has rotatable polarizers - you can get a picture of a lake with either no reflections on it, or emphasize the reflected mountains behind it, just by rotating the filter. </p></div>		</li>
