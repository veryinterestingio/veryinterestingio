			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have ever eaten anything super spicy you've already experienced your tongue doing a bad job at just that. You feel pain and burning when you aren't being hurt or burned because capsicum has just hijacked your nerves that sense heat making them super sensitive to the point where your natural temperature feels like burning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I kinda understand that, but what exactly is making those nerves reacting ? For exemple, when you're burning yourself, it'll be painful, if pain nerves can't sense heat, what exactly is creating this pain ?</p></div>		</li>
