			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the things that struck me about basic training in the military was just how much it improved everyone's posture. Just standing in a military formation, with the posture that it demands, encourages people to hold their necks and shoulders back, and tightens up that whole posterior chain to have the strength to stand for a long time without too much fatigue.</p>
<p>So I think it's less about exercises as it is about shaping your environment to encourage sitting up and standing up straighter. One big thing that improved things for me was raising my monitor so that I'd be looking straight ahead at my computer rather than tilting my neck down (and subconsciously forward). Another is using a chair that discourages sitting back (e.g., a backless bench).</p></div>		</li>
