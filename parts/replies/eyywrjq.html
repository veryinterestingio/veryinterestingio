			<div class="markdown"><p>I notice that a lot of people tend to just match the speed of the vehicle next to them. I can’t tell you how many times I overtook a slower moving vehicle in front of me, only to have them start pacing me. People that don’t use cruise control on the highway are annoying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the worst is when you are coming up behind two cars. and those two cars have been the same distance from each other for miles. then when you get close enough to pass, the car that was following the other one moves over and s l o w l y passes the car next to them. its just , common dude, you have been following that guy for probably 20 miles, you couldnt wait another 30 seconds?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was on the interstate Friday in a 75mph zone. Cruise control was pegged just over 80mph. Big pickup truck in left lane, 18 wheeler in right lane. I pass truck on left moving substantially faster than him. Second I pass him, he hammers the gas and closes the somewhat large gap between him in the left lane and the big rig in the right lane, solely to prevent me from passing. Second he passed the big rig he pulled over into the right lane and I motored in past him. </p>
<p>Literally the only reason he sped up was to prevent me from getting in front of him. Really irritated me.</p></div>		</li>
