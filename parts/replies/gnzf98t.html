<p>Oh it’s simple, just do adderall and/or vyvanse every single day. You wont eat and you’ll hate yourself but you’ll sure like organizing your room again</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm on methylphenidate for PTSD.
I can go forever without eating. The other day I slow roasted pork butt for hours and hours and my vegetarian girlfriend was dying of hunger from the smell.
I'm just sitting there completely indifferent.</p>
<p>But, an eating disorder seems to help cancel that out. Binge/restrict is weird on this. It's like I'm not hungry, but I still need to eat my feelings after not eating much for a week.</p>
<p>Here's to destroying my organs slowly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, even “the stack,” which was ephedra and caffeine could work but it was killing people so it got banned. I should have been clearer: There’s no magic weight loss pill to make you feel full. </p>
<p>I did marketing on a product that was a little shot of liquid with encapsulated fat. It was designed to get through your stomach and then bombard the intestine with fat. So your body is tricked into thinking it had a huge fatty meal. </p>
<p>It worked to a degree but you had to take it earlier than every meal and it still had the delay I originally discussed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So serious question here:</p>
<p>i do keto because after I eat a meal, I am actually full, however on a regular standard american diet, I could pretty much eat until I throw up since I never *really&quot; get full</p>
<p>Why is the stomach signals so different on high carb vs high fat?</p>
<p>Im sure the answer is pretty long and complicated</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a shitton to it, and more educated folks than I can probably give way better details.</p>
<p>But from what I know from my own education and forays in health (in simple off the top of my head without a full readers digest type re-research to be 100% exact):</p>
<p>It's often about the Blood Sugar levels and insulin response, as well as Ghrelin and other hormones produced during digestion in your stomach, along with the stretch sensors.</p>
<p>Keto - i.e. high protein, is really good at triggering a good longer term blood sugar response, and quick generation of the &quot;Full proteins and hormones&quot;.</p>
<p>Ironically, so are complex carbohydrates. Apples, vegetables, beans, sweet potatoes, *whole grain* rice, etc. They do this because of the fiber in them, that causes their sugars to slow release and balance your body reaction so that it feels similar to protein in terms of long term fullness. Except, most carbs in the western diet, are super processed (Pasta, bread, bleached wheat, white rice, french fries, potato chips, etc) so they lose the fiber and other vitamins that helps with the long term &quot;Full&quot;. Fiber is the big thing here - it slows digestion so sugars absorb into your body more slowly as it takes longer for your stomach acid and enzymes to break things down. Ironically, fiber also helps to pass things through your body faster so I believe you don't absorb quite as much sugar overall too. Hence processed fiberless foods become tough on your gut. They stick around, and fuck with your blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>The big trick is that &quot;Carbs&quot; in our daily lives usually means &quot;Processed AF&quot;. Processed sugars cause a huge blood sugar spike, and don't trigger the ghrelin and such in your stomach (so the full feeling relies almost exclusively on the stomach stretch feeling), and then blood sugar crashes with an insulin response to try and quick balance it, which creates new cravings, which make you eat more processed carbs, and then crash again.</p>
<p>P.S. - beyond the light fyi on diet, do check out long term research into Keto. There's some new stuff that indicates it causes heart fibrosis (i.e. dead heart tissue). A high protein diet is a risky thing. But if you're able to lose weight on it, then I'm of the belief the benefits outweigh the risks. Do check with a dietician (not nutritionist) though for full thoughts and advice.</p>
<p>P.P.S - If you're into traditional western food like me (Meat, Veggie, and Carb [potato/rice]), check out replacing the carb with a mix of brown/wild rice and lentils. You can use a rice cooker (4x water to lentil(dry)/rice ratio) and get protein and meaningful fiber and energy as opposed to white potato or white rice and get more flavor. Add salt/cumin/oregano/etc while boiling for taste. You can up the bean portion size and cut down on your meat serving size for the same or greater fullness, with a similar protein ratio with a lower blood sugar spike and more vitamins, and fewer calories per gram of food eaten (\~110 Cal/100 g lentils &amp; brown rice vs 160 Cal/100g Chicken Breast vs 270 Cal/100g Steak).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was expecting this to be a TLDR and am pleasantly surprised. I've been digging into biological psychology and this is really fascinating. It all makes logical sense. </p>
<p>I was told I was insulin resistant in highschool. Being a teenager, I was very incredulous about it and didn't put the effort into reversing it as I should have. However, I did start swapping out simple carbs (potatoes, white rice) for complex carbs (sweet potatoes, brown/wild rice) when given the opportunity. Being gluten free, all of our bread options are simple carbs until you get to brown rice pasta. So that makes it more challenging, but it's doable.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Feeling full is complicated and one of the reasons there’s no magic pill for weight loss.</p>
<p>Because it takes time to get from your stomach to the end of your small intestine, you can often overeat before you feel full.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Taking a 10-20 minute break from eating is usually a good way to wait until you start feeling full.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My wife is very good at this. When we eat dinner and I say &quot;I think I'm still hungry, I'm going to get seconds&quot; because I'm somewhat full and no longer &quot;starving&quot; she'll say just wait a few minutes. Everytime she is right and I feel full after 5-10 minutes.</p>
<p>It's also a good thing to not keep the rule &quot;clear your plate&quot; especially when you have children. Instead we should practice portion control in the first place and if a kid says they are full, then they are full and shouldn't have to keep eating. My parents did this and I am thankful for it. I'll eat and at some point a switch will go off saying &quot;this has no taste and isn't interesting anymore&quot;, then I know I should definitely stop.</p></div>		</li>
