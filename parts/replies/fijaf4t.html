			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the &quot;fear&quot; thing is a bit of a misleading term to use, but people resort to it anyway for lack of a more fitting term that is also convenient.  Even the term &quot;taboo&quot; people might sort of gloss over or relate some vague personal definition...</p>
<p>So I'm going to sort of re-explain from maybe a different perspective...</p>
<p>Many advanced species, not only humans, tend to need some form of boundaries to know how to behave, to fit in.  We seek comfort and normalcy, but to establish this, we need to identify boundaries.</p>
<p>The urge to find such boundaries can over-rule the urge to fit in, meaning that when the boundary is found they don't back down, and instead keep exploring for new boundaries.  Maybe it's that the boundary isn't property defined or explained in a way that's understood subconsciously, eg spoiled children...or maybe it's a case of faulty wiring or a chemical imbalance.</p>
<p>What I mean is, it could be either.  It's not Nature vs Nurture debate, sometimes it's nature, sometimes it's nurture.  So your confusion on culture or psychology(as per the op) is actually very apt.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, some people find a thrill in seeking boundaries and pushing them.  Some people revel in oddities, maybe starting off mild but often advancing as they become acclimated, once those oddities become &quot;normal&quot; it's no longer a boundary.</p>
<p>It may not even necessarily be sexual, and even in people that don't revel in it there's a euphoria when it comes to the odd and the grotesque, humans love their euphoria, we often become addicted to some of the chemicals/sensations we produce within ourselves....such as adrenaline junkies(eg extreme things like skydiving), not to mention gambling addiction and other forms of risk/pleasure addiction(video games, porn, etc etc), and that's before we get into chemicals from the external world(eg &quot;drugs&quot;).</p>
<p>Be it an interest in abstract art, Gothic architecture, or the macabre in general...all the way to sexual attraction to monsters, for many, it's all various manifestations of boundary seeking.  Whatever inspires that euphoria that triggers exploration urges...One could even make the argument for things that are &quot;an acquired taste&quot; like beer, cigars, and of course, all manner of unconventional foods.</p>
<p>We're all a walking laboratory full of chemicals and chemical reactions and even for all the ways we're similar, there's a lot of chaos involved, minute differences can manifest in widely ranging different behaviors just as this chaotic soup yields different appearances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately with all things neurochemical the actual answer is almost certainly &quot;holy shit we dont know anything, the brain is so conplex we cant work out very basic stuff&quot;</p>
<p>Maybe one day we'll work some of the complex stuff out, but to be honest we're still stuck on very basic pathways.</p>
<p>We can make a lot of evolutionary/psychological hypotheses, which are likely to hold some weight, but if you want an actual mechanistic description im afraid you're probably many decades too early.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What is seeking new types of experience and especially with wildly differing power/control levels evolved because it is more likely to give the species more diverse offspring. Thus higher probability that some have a high fitness and thus higher survivability.</p>
<p>Maybe that's why humans want to fuck everything. It's a evolutionary algorithm going 'haywire'</p></div>		</li>
