			<div class="markdown"><p>Your number for speed is correct (I did not know this, I googled to confirm). The speed varies by impulse type, the signal to move a muscle is the fastest, at &quot;up 119m/s&quot; which is roughly 425kph.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I was curious about applying that speed to human scale. Let's call it 100m/s because it makes the math trivial, so the signal takes 0.01s to travel one meter. Head to foot on a 2m man would be 0.02s, or 20ms. A short person at 150cm would be 15ms.  A difference of 5ms.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The signals for pain travel slower, but they're like 70% as fast as the muscle impulse, so still in the tens of msrange for the impulse, and single digit ms for the difference between tall and short.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I think that the difference is measurable but negligible given the range of normal reaction times. From my work, I know that most people can't press a button faster than about every 250ms. The impulse might travel in 20ms, but performing the motion takes time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for doing the math. I wasn't expecting the difference to be as high as this.</p>
<p>Yeah, probably doesn't make a difference on things like button pressing. But I wonder if it makes a difference for musicians. Faster ear-to-hand time will definitely help, and 5ms is a number that's high enough to be interesting.</p>
<p>I've noticed that when I read about the height of musicians (and actors) they tend to be much shorter than average (of course there are tall ones, but they tend to be short to very short). I wonder if there's anything here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Musicians are predicting the beat, not reacting to it. Signal time shouldn't matter  at all in that context, unless it dramatically and suddenly changed for that person somehow (injury?). Furthermore, +/- 5ms would be difficult to notice, at 120bpm (relatively fast tempo) a 16th note is 125ms (120/60/16=0.125).</p></div>		</li>

<p>than about every 250ms</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>within</em> 250ms from moment of stimulus; 200ms is considered elite response, with the fastest being down around 170 for race car drivers reacting to a green light (iirc).</p>
<p>You can certainly press a button more than 4x a sec. The word &quot;every&quot; doesn't belong in your statement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, really - if you hand someone a button and time how quickly they can press it repeatedly, it will be about 4x a second.  It just takes a little time for them to press, lift, repeat.
I've done a good bit of testing because of my job - how fast can we change a channel on a settop box? How fast can a person press channel up on a remote control? This is assuming a physical button.  A tap on a screen is more like 150ms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do some fighting (Krav Maga) and my height is 151cm (4,9 ft). I heard some people tell me that my reflexes are sharper because I'm short I've always belived they were wrong. Would it really be that significant if my opponent is 170cm tall (5,5ft)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think the size could be important here.
However, some people just.. are quicker.  The one thing I had going for me in wrestling and martial arts was that I'm quick. You know how we'll describe someone as slow-witted, or quick-witted. I think of it as people's brains having a &quot;clock speed&quot; like a computer.  Some people's brains just respond quicker than others, and I think that's what was going on for me, and for you, in martial arts.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also i believe blue whales have a non-neglible time of travel for nerves in their tail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OP use of the phrase &quot;reaction speed&quot; leads me to believe they mean a voluntary muscle response to external stimuli, probably in the context of sports or competition.  </p></div>		</li>
