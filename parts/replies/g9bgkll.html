			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for saying this. I worked at GameXchange and there was always one employee who would regurgitate crap that she'd heard but always got the details wrong. She insisted to people that Duck Hunt didn't work on new TV's because &quot;New TV's don't have reflective enough screens, so when the light gun puts out a signal, it can't bounce back to the gun.&quot; I tried to explain to her several times why that was completely untrue, but she would always respond with &quot;Listen, I've worked in the game industry for a long time now, and I know you think that I don't know what I'm talking about just because I'm a girl.&quot; Well, she'd been there longer than I had, so who was I to argue? You can't fight stupidity like that, so I just watched as she explained the workings of Duck Hunt incorrectly to every customer that asked about it. She was always such a shit, I've got lots of stories about how terrible she was.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And that is why my friend who collects classic consoles still keeps a couple of old CRT TV sets around.  </p>
<p>Because what’s the point in owning an original NES that still works if you can’t play Drunk Hunt?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Strangely enough, I heard some scuttlebutt when plasma displays first came out that the zapper would &quot;burn a hole&quot; in the screen, which to me, didn't sound right. Good to know this is the reason why the tech doesn't function.</p>
<p>Any idea if higher hz displays fix this issue, or is the digital input lag compared to analog still cause this problem?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Still a problem. Problem is that the console cannot sync up with the display, which was a requirement to work with the old crts and built into the hardwire for it.  Without that, the display cannot sync up properly</p></div>		</li>
