			<div class="markdown"><p>Once in an emergency, (last lot of dishes, staying in accomodation to care for someone in hospital, last dishes before leaving for airport) </p>
<p>We ended up using a very plain shampoo. Had run out of dishwashing liquid detergent, some were worried, but I thought the shampoo might be less strong as a soap and have a lot more perfumes and byproducts, but I thought, in essence, chemically would basically be doing the same as detergent. </p>
<p>Surprisingly it seemed very effective and strong, and so afterwards, we just rinsed the dishes a few times in very hot water, to get any perfumes and residue off them. </p>
<p>Have always wondered... was this OK?</p></div>		</li>
