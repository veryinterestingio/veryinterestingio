<p>if you did selective breeding, probably.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That’s a lot more conclusive a statement than I’d make. Species evolve based on what propagates, larger size did not always propagate best. </p>
<p>So historically this really isn’t a truism. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a stable environment, bigger is better.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t know what your definition of a stable environment is, I don’t believe there truly is one. But setting that aside, There are plenty of examples were smaller beat out larger. It is more difficult for large animals to dissipate heat, for example. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bigger animals are more energy efficient and are harder to eat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is it harder to eat one deer or one mouse?  Can more mice or more deer survive in one acre of forest? </p>
<blockquote>
<p>So when you take away what limits the size of insects, boom, they evolve toward bigger.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Some</em> certainly did. But not all. Probably not even most.</p>
<p>Edit: I forgot to mention island dwarfism which is a phenomena where large animals become small when on an island for a long period.  It’s how pigmy elephants happened!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn’t speculation. It’s a fundamental principle of ecology and evolutionary pressure. In an environment with food scarcity, metabolic efficiency drives competing species to a size arms race:</p>

<p>Many things can constrain a species maximum size, but in the case those constraints are removed, they evolve to become larger because of the metabolic efficiency gains and anti-predation advantages.</p></div>		</li>
