			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked with an older gentleman that had nerve issues that would make his legs go numb and cause significant discomfort. One treatment option available to him was the installation of a device under the skin that was battery powered (and charged through the skin!) which would basically exert pressure on the nerve bundle so as to preoccupy those nerves and mitigate discomfort.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Seemed like super cool technology from an engineering perspective, but I don't envy the person who decides its the best option available.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now that seems interesting. I've been dealing with some sort of bad pain in my lower legs and knees since I was 16 and I'm 30 now. I'd straight up cut my legs off at this point if they had prosthetics that worked exactly like normal legs so something liek that seems promising.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>compression also helps hold ligaments where they are supposed to be throughout their range of motion, in cases where their tracking on a joint may stray and cause discomfort.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, u/TuskerMedic25 is spreading some bad info and I just want to clarify for your sake; the compression wrap does two things for your knee:</p>
<p>1: provides physical stability, taking the strain off the connective tissues (tendons and ligaments) in your knee and;
2: applies circumferential (all around) pressure to the knee where inflammation is occurring. This pressure moves the inflammation (swelling) away from the joint, which will allow the joint to move more freely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>but I also wonder if it increases the likelyhood for further injury. Was that pain helping to prevent you from doing things that might hurt it more?</p></div>		</li>
