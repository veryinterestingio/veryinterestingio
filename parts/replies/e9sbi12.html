			<div class="markdown"><p>Related to vapors, alcohol evaporates so fast that you'd need a lot of it to clean any sizeable area. Bleach does not evaporate readily when mixed with water, which means you only need a cup of bleach blended with water and you can clean all day.</p>
<p>Bleach is much cheaper as well. It's 4 times cheaper by volume at my local store, and you need far less of it to clean with.</p>
<p>Alcohol is commonly used in cleaning electronics because the alcohol and pure water solution does not readily conduct electricity, and it evaporates so well when finished that you don't need to dry off delicate components. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, alcohol is an excellent solvent and can dissolve most oils and residues you're likely to encounter in electronics situations.  Otherwise you'd need to use water with a surfactant... and soapy water is going to cause at least as many problems as it solves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With regard to electronics, you really don't care about sanitizing. Bleach won't act as a solvent for things like solder flux, electrolytes from leaky capacitors, or phenolics from transformers and coils. Alcohols will.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s also good to remember that alcohol kills skin-cells too. Don’t use it on a wound that’s healing. </p>
<p>Think of it as a nuclear bomb. It kills everything indiscriminately.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alcohol causes some minor superficial damage and inflammation, but I don't think it's been shown to have persistent negative effects. (It's still wholly unnecessary, though, and not a good substitute for washing.)</p>
<p>The real skin-cell-killing antiseptic is hydrogen peroxide. Treating wounds with peroxide can significantly worsen scarring.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had in ingrown toenail removed that I cleaned with soap and water. It eventually got infected, had to be burned and cut again, and took 2 months to heal.</p>
<p>The other toenail that got ingrown I would put a few drops of hydrogen peroxide in the morning, dry, a few drops of isopropyl alcohol, dry, and then wrap it in a bandage if I put on shoes or simply leave it exposed to air. This toe did not get infected. It doesn't even hurt a fraction of what the first toe did if at all. What I have noticed tho is that decently thick sheets of callused skin keep growing over it and flaking off. Doesn't hurt or bleed, just grows, turns grey brown and comes easily rubbed off.</p>
<p>Any explanation?</p></div>		</li>
