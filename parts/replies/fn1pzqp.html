			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe. The cutting system had cooling water (with an additive) spraying on the material. In the end, I finished with a hacksaw.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oxide by definition has oxygen in it. If there is no oxygen in the machining environment then there is no chance for oxides to form.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I maybe should've specified that I was asking that in the absence of an oxide layer, how well it machines. If it still work hardens like crazy there's no point in putting the effort of eliminating the oxygen. I mentioned inert atmospheres because working metal in a vacuum has challenges of its own.</p>
<p>Not sure why you felt the need to point out basic chemistry.</p></div>		</li>
