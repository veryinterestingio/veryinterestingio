			<div class="markdown"><p>The worry with this virus too is that while we have precedent for other viruses, there is a lot about Covid-19 that is still unknown. </p>
<p>Herd immunity being a prime example. I've read things that has said immunity drops off fairly quickly, whereas others tested shows potential immunity for 6 months or more. </p>
<p>Because it's still very early, we just don't know, so have to make sure we employ social distancing/hygiene measures to try and keep the transmission rate down long enough to hopefully allow it to die out on its own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here in FL. They opened too early, and we shoot up to over 9000 new cases in a day after Father's day weekend. Most counties are now making masks mandatory again, but meanwhile Universal is open, and Disney is planning on reopening. That couped with the RNC coming up, it doesn't bode well for curbing social gatherings.</p></div>		</li>
