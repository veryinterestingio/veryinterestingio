<p>Thank you for this question!</p>
<p>During these days of Covid-19 havoc social distancing and enhanced hygiene practices, I would say that designing protocols for contamination control, which can be easily done safely and in real-time in the field, or any other place other than a lab or a clean room.I believe that applying and these protocols would help everyone on the planet today.</p>
<p>When we engage in robotic or human assisted life detection simulation we want to avoid adding our own human microbiome, or the associated organics from cell shedding from our body, and we want to avoid releasing it to the pristine environment - in the case of Mars, or any other planet with potential life to be discovered.  For this purpose field contamination control involves  endlessly cleaning, microbial reduction, possibly complete sterilization and verification loops, operating with PPE,  as well &quot;social distancing&quot; from sample collection and handling hardware (drills, scoops, etc). This may sound a very complex set of task, but I believe that with appropriate training, it becomes easier. We can train everyone on this task. See a nice example  of this at:</p>

<p>In my everyday life I found very useful  applying Planetary Protection practices I use in the field to help protect now people around me and myself as well.   Everyone can become a Planetary Protection officer!</p></div>		</li>
