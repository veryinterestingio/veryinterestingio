			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember seeing the movie adaptation of this. The Naked Jungle, if memory serves. </p>
<p>The movie that I was watching was Bug (1975), based on Thomas Page's <strong><em> The Hephaestus Plague</em></strong>. </p>
<p>It got me thinking about insects working together on a biological weapon sort of footing. The army ants story hit some familiar vibes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1938 was just before the advent of modern, organophosphorus insecticides.  (Think 'nerve gas', but for insects.)    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insecticide" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insecticide" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insecticide</a></a>   Most of the insecticides available in 1938 aren't even listed in this article, as they are so old and today would be considered ineffective.  </p>
<p>I would imagine that if this event had occurred, in real life, during the 1960's or later, one then-modern crop-duster and a few hundred barrels of modern insecticde would have resulted in 20-square miles of...dead ants.   They simply didn't have that kind of weapon in 1938.  </p>
<p>BTW, finding chemicals that kill bugs is easy.  The main difficulty is finding chemicals that kill bugs, but generally DON'T kill humans.</p></div>		</li>
