			<div class="markdown"><p>Love these questions. #1 I love the work Sean Brady is doing at Rockefeller. He's looking in the soil to find new antibiotics. Turns out that bacteria beneath our feet are engaged in subterranean warfare. They're constantly pumping out chemicals to kill all of the other bacteria around them. If we can pluck those chemicals out, we've got an antibiotic! The problem is that it's hard to know where to look. Brady's method has simplified the process.</p>
<h1>2. The term &quot;superbug&quot; is really controversial. During my book tour, I got an email from a professor who said I should instead use the term &quot;difficult to treat infections.&quot; The irony is, not all superbugs are difficult to treat! Some are resistant to a bunch of antibiotics, but as long as they're killed by one drug, I can treat them. Among the many problems with superbugs is the branding issue. We still haven't adequately explained what they are.</h1></div>		</li>
