			<div class="markdown"><p>To answer your second paragraph, there hasn't been much of a change to my lifestyle tbh. Prior to stretching I've had a few episodes of insomnia due to academic stress and sleep anxiety, but my activities remained the same, I would watch non-exciting shows on Netflix mobile until i felt sleepy. I still do that after stretching, so the only difference is the introduction of stretches to my nightly routine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like you've identified an additional to your nightly ritual that is really helpful for sleeping through the night. School stress is a doozy. I completed my education in 2009 and I still have dreams that I'm not prepared for an exam/paper/oral. Usually in math.</p></div>		</li>
