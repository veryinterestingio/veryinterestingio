			<div class="markdown"><p>My husband’s toe nails curve inward, about 3/4 of the way to a full circle. He has a sort of permanent in-grown toenails on both feet. Aside from it being incredibly painful when stubbed or stepped on, he’s also self conscious about it. No flip flops or beach trips. I always wonder if he is in a constant state of pain on his toes and if this has conditioned him to accept the pain as normal. </p>
<p>He had surgery on one foot to “reset” the path about 20 years ago. It was painful and he couldn’t walk for months. To top it all off— the surgery did not work. The toenail grew in almost exactly the same. He won’t even bother considering the surgery again on the other foot. </p>
<p>Long post but, how common is this condition? What is it called and what other options are there?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't done it yet, but heavily considering having both of my large toenails permanently removed--they remove the nail and chemically cauterize the root/nail bed with acid to prevent it from regrowing at all. </p>
<p>You can have a lesser version of this done where they only remove and cauterize the sides, resulting in just the flat/top portion of the nail being allowed to continue growing. If he's self conscious about it now, this is probably the better option for him.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah the double sided procedure is done on an outpatient basis. They pop some lidocaine in your toe and then snip down the sides, killing the edge with a q tip covered in some goop. Highly recommend. Couldnt imagine my life now without the procedure and its so easy. There wasnt enough of the lidocaine in my system when they started, let me tell ya, that shit HURT </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My toes are naturally studded with a lot of soft tissues covering my nails like a big hat and my nails are genetically small so they have no choice but to grow into my toe cushions. </p>
<p>Thank you, genes!</p></div>		</li>
