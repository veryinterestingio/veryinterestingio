			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't just say something is wrong when you aren't sure. His explanation is 100% correct. In fact you are both are correct. </p>
<p>Squinting reduces the aperture of the lenses, thus tightening the image. BUT the shape of your eyes has A LOT to do with vision.  When your eyes try to change depth of focus, the muscles actually stretch and contract the lens, which helps focus the light. It also reduces the aperture, as you stated. Both of you are correct. As is often the case in biology, there are usually multiple driving factors behind any function. Don't dismiss him as being wrong just because you're right too.</p>
<p>Instead of squinting, try pulling away at the corners of your eyes with your fingers. It tightens the pressure of your lids on the front of sclera/cornea, and thus slightly changes the shape of the surface, similarly to what squinting would do, but without the use of those muscles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>^this is the correct response. Smaller area of focus changes the amount of light entering the eye which allows it to focus better. Changing the shape of the eye is not the reason. That’s why pinhole glasses work and squishing your eye down with your fingers(rather than squinting) doesn’t.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both are correct. Squinting alters the aperture AND shape of the eye. This is how you change focus from near to far, your muscles stretch and contract your lens. Squinting works in a similar way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can achieve the same effect by putting a pin hole in a piece of paper and looking through it. I learned this from Wilson on an episode of Home Improvement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah the pinhole is a little more nuanced than that, Aik2 is talking about changing the shape of the eye and focal length. Dissenting_Karma is talking about changing the aperture, where all parts of the image are in focus. Not sure which of them is why squiting works. Just thought it important  to highlight the differences.</p></div>		</li>
