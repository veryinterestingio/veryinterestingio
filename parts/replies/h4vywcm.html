			<div class="markdown"><p>Endorphins inhibit pain, reduce inflammation, and ease mental stress.</p>
<p>When we exercise, our body actually receives a bit of damage. This damage does not need to be avoided and it’s not inherently bad as long as you don’t overdo it. In fact, the damage is actually what stimulates our body to get stronger and more resilient so it should be seen as a good thing as long as it’s not being overdone. But the damage can be painful and causes inflammation, which in turn causes the brain to release endorphins. And the endorphins are what ends up making us feel good :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For example while training, our muscles are getting damaged, but then their repair and produce a bit more muscles cells everytime which makes us stronger, that's why when we workout too much muscles are too damaged and it's bad, but it happens after a really long training.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's also a good idea to mention that in the past, humans would be exercising all the time - catching, gathering, crafting, forging, and hauling - and our bodies weren't really evolved to sit around. Your brain is always choosing the option to conserve energy, but by doing so we are also depriving ourselves of our nature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you exercise, the brain produces neurotransmitters that make you feel good and euphoric, also known as runner's high. Those same neurotransmitters are also painkillers and help your body deal with stress. Studies show that runner's high can be as addicting as a drug high, which can cause exercise addiction. Other studies also show even a 15 minute walk has a big impact on impulse control and reduced anxiety.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Precisely this. </p>
<p>We evolved to crave macronutrients that were scarce in Pleistocene Africa (salt, sugar, and fat) and to conserve energy in case we need to wait out a drought, run from a lion, etc. </p>
<p>In my experience, the best way to combat this is an end run around the simple conserve-vs-fight/flight model. Convince yourself that it's <em>fun</em> to exercise. We don't like burning energy unless we have to, but we certainly enjoy playing sports we're good at or having sex. The brain is looking past the effort toward the expected reward, and you can teach it to expect that reward through directed conditioning. Cartoonist Matthew Inman (The Oatmeal) jokes about getting into running because it means he can eat cheeseburgers afterward. I save my favorite music for the gym, essentially starving myself for it the rest of the time :-) Whatever works.</p>
<p>Edit: tons of spelling. It's late.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually tricked my brain once I realized this was the case. The endorphin response for working out is in conjuction with successful predation. So when people work out, we're only giving half the input. </p>
<p>You need to follow up a workout routine with a fatty meal. It doesn't even need to be aninal-based, nor large in size. Just something super high in fat. This triggers the follow-up response and creates an intense desire to repeat whatever it was you just did. Once I started doing that, I found myself craving workouts.</p>
<p>To put it in other words, it was like discovering orgasm after a lifetime of edging.</p></div>		</li>
