			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great question! Often, we have to deal with accuracy problems in our *own* field! ForÂ example, there are many sources of error when we are observing exoplanets which manifest as uncertainties- we have to make sure that we accurately reflect these uncertainties in our final results. For our project, Exoplanet Watch, we are using statistical methods to make sure that any uncertainties are accurately reflected in our final data products. - Rob Zellem u/hd209458b <a href="https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exoplanet-watch/" target="_blank"><a href="https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exoplanet-watch/" target="_blank">https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exoplanet-watch/</a></a></p></div>		</li>
