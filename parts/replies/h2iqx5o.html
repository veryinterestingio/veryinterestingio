			<div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model" target="_blank">standard model</a> organises the fundamental particles, but it's not really an equivalent to the periodic table. The variation of behaviour in the elements on the periodic table is due to how the electrons on each atom interact with each other, that's Chemistry basically. The same kind of variation isn't really seen outside the elements, or at least we ourselves are made up of chemical elements and the vast majority of experience is too so it's not as well studied as Chemistry is.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I mean .... maybe? Certainly it isn't now, at least not quite.</p>
<p>But it is well known that the Periodic Table arises from the symmetries of 1/r potentials, such as that of a proton or, equivalently, of any singly ionized atom. Those include the O(3) rotational symmetry — actually, SU(2), because electrons are fermions — plus the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace–Runge–Lenz_vector#Quantum_mechanics_of_the_hydrogen_atom" target="_blank">Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector</a> symmetry (that allows for different angular momentum quantum numbers for the same energy levels of the purely orbital system).</p>
<p>Quark matter — mesons and baryons — are themselves arranged into something like a periodic table under broken SU(3) symmetry representing interchange of up, down, and strange quarks (and sometimes SU(4) or higher symmetries, including, for example, charm quarks, or spin, etc.) See: Various multiplet diagrams from the <a href="https://pdg.lbl.gov/2021/reviews/rpp2020-rev-quark-model.pdf" target="_blank">quark model section of the Particle Physics Databook</a>. So mesons and baryons actually do kind of have their own periodic table; it's just more complicated.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Standard Model is based on a somewhat different symmetry group — SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1) — so it's more complicated, but there are some hints of structure in it already, such as the three families of pairs of both leptons and quarks. How to fully describe all fundamental particles in terms of some overarching symmetry is not something that can yet be done, but is the goal of various unified theories, such as string theory. So even if it's not now equivalent to the periodic table, it might be equivalent to some of the early stabs at the periodic table before its full structure was identified, even with undiscovered elements like technetium.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My question is would this exist without the elemental periodic table or did we just line up subatomic particles with elements that have similar quantum shell symmetry notation of either the orbitals themselves or those of the simpler compounds they can form?  Does it have any potential predictive power?  If so… what would we look at since there’s nothing so easily equivalent to a Z value or even mass… is energy or another property valuable in this way and if so… is the table filled with blank spots we’ve never observed or measured but still named like an element we knew must exist but was rare or unstable and no samples existed though both larger (Z and MM) and smaller elements did?  Has the standard model table accurately predicted properties of any of these unknown subatomic particles if we later discovered them… or does it hold up when we’ve discovered something as conceptually huge as quantum shells and valence electrons the way the 1928 model of the periodic table was still fairly accurate after integrating orbitals into it, at least for the less complex S and P containing only elements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suspect that by non-baryonic matter you mean things that are not made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons (i.e., you're not excluding more exotic baryons).</p>
<p>The matter can be organized into structures, but nothing as all-encompassing and elegant as the periodic table. First off, you have the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Standard_Model_of_Elementary_Particles_Anti.svg/1920px-Standard_Model_of_Elementary_Particles_Anti.svg.png" target="_blank">standard model of elementary particles</a> which is kind of the expanded list of constituent particles beyond just protons, neutrons, and electrons. The analog of the periodic table would be a table that contained all the compound particles you could build out of all of these. Unfortunately there are hundreds of such particles with a lot of different charges that would need to be categorized, so there is no single table. Some of them can be put into smaller tables like baryon/meson <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Baryon-octet-small.svg/1024px-Baryon-octet-small.svg.png" target="_blank">octets</a>, <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Meson_nonet_-_spin_0.svg/1280px-Meson_nonet_-_spin_0.svg.png" target="_blank">nonets</a>, and <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Baryon-decuplet-small.svg/1024px-Baryon-decuplet-small.svg.png" target="_blank">decouplets</a> which is probaby as close as you'll get right now.</p>
<p>And then of course there's the problem that none of these particles account for dark matter/energy, so all of these combined account for only a very small minority of the &quot;stuff&quot; in the universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are any of these non-baryonic compound particles stable? at least in such a way that they do not decay or break down in a span of microseconds, as I know some of the highest elements on the periodic table do. Could we concievably create new 'metals' out of these stable matter pieces. or really any other state of mater as we conventionally know it. </p>
<p>even if it is something like, yeah here is a plasma without electrons that actually expels cold because it 'stabalizes' the surrounding electrons slowing them down, so it doesnt absorb the heat(particle momentum), it just stabilizes the nearby particles causing them to push the heat away from this plasma, so it makes a warm wave that is followed by cold. Or whatever weird properties these can have. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I have always been fascinated by the elements in that another proton and some electrons can have such varied properties. for example we have gold, Mercury, Thalium in that order. so in the middle of it, we go, yeah we got metal at 100C, liquid, then metal again. oh also technetium? that element, yeah screw that one, it isn't stable, but it is surrounded by dozens of other stable elements above and below it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypernucleus" target="_blank">There are also &quot;hypernuclei&quot;,</a> which would add another dimension to the periodic table.  These are nuclei that in addition to protons and neutrons have one or more &quot;hyperons&quot;, which are just like protons or neutrons but one or more of their quarks is a strange quark.  A few have been observed, but they decay very very fast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So hypothetically, if I could have a large enough amount of one of these to be able to see without instruments, and I took a snapshot before it decayed. Would it look normal? Let's say a lump of pure &quot;hypergold&quot; or some other recognizable element if that's possible?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For chemistry only the total electric charge of the nucleus matters (to a really good approximation outside of hydrogen). Replace a proton by a positively charged hyperon, add a neutral hyperon, or add a negative hyperon and a proton and you leave the chemistry a unchanged.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't. It's just the simplest explanation for now. If something is discovered that can explain a significant fraction, but not all, of dark matter, then we'll know it is more than one thing. So far there is no preponderance of data that requires more than one constituent of dark matter to explain.</p></div>		</li>
