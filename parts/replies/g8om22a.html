			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, our sampling mechanism is designed to pick up small particles (think of pebbles no larger than a quarter's diameter!). We hope to gather a <strong>minimum</strong> of 60 grams of sample (that's about a quarter-cup of packed brown sugar), but we expect to collect much more. Some of the sample analysis techniques we're using can examine materials at the atomic and molecular level, so at least 60 grams of sample is quite a lot of material from that perspective! - Dani D.</p></div>		</li>
