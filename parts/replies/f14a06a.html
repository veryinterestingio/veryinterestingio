<p>In vivo vs. In vitro makes a huge difference.</p>
<p>My husband collaborated on a study for a cancer treatment, still in early phases. Remission rates were great!  Unfortunately 100% of the test subjects later developed small cell lung cancer. Not so great. So that was scrapped, but the information was used to start another which is actually out of animal testing and into human trials. It uses a different material and actually looks promising.</p></div>		</li>
