			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone with genital Herpes the physical symptoms aren’t the problem the majority of the time its the stigma attached and the damage it can do to you mentally. It might be innocuous but trying telling someone you’re going to have to put them at risk of an “innocuous skin condition” yikes. Thankfully I’ve had no particularly bad reactions but I know others who have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah man. Herpes suck. It may be considered innocuous, but it’s incredibly frustrating to deal with, and very painful for some, including me. I’ve had to be placed on a treatment plan because of how often i broke out. Also, having it increases chances of getting HIV- not very innocuous in that case. Would really love and appreciate a vaccine</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Luckily there are medications available like Acyclovir to help reduce breakouts along with basic hygiene practices. But a cure for those infected would help more than people realize because of the stigma surrounding it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean yeah my symptoms aren’t that bad I get like 2/3 outbreaks a year and there uncomfortable but mild, so I’m fine. It’s just the stigma that gets to me. Thankfully there’s great support groups out there. I’m in 2 within the UK on Facebook and people are so friendly and supportive but there’s a lot of people it just kills there confidence, self esteem, hopes of finding a long term partner.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically. Even the THOUGHT that I might have contracted herpes (I'm a bit of a hypochondriac) was enough to make me catatonic. I was sure I'd never have sex again</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually worked on the Thailand trial trying to determine why the participants were more likely to get infected! It has a lot to do with with a non-neutralizing IgA response that would block the binding sites for neutralizing IgG</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the horizon for this study is kind of over. All that's being done with it is further analysis of samples to further understand antibody development for the inhibiting IgA so we make sure we don't make those antibodies in subsequent vaccine trials. That trial actually did show ~30% protection in the cohort which is a great start. </p>
<p>There are tons of vaccine candidates in development that show varying degrees of protection. I worked on about 20 studies that are in the pre-clinical phase which means primate subjects. </p>
<p>If you want to learn more look up the RV144 and RV305 trials which were both conducted by the Military HIV Research Program and the Human Vaccine Trials Network!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I took park in an HIV vaccine trial back around 2005, I think - I was part of the “low risk” human group, and they were super excited because the vaccine was looking super promising!</p>
<p>They they moved on to the “high risk” group, Russian and Ukrainian prostitutes, and it was dead in the water :-(</p></div>		</li>
