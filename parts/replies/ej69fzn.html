			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC There was a whistle that came with some cereal that if played while dialling you could get free calls because it registered as a police call or something.</p>
<p>Edit: it was from a captian crunch cereal prize thing. That's not the quite the one I was thinking of as I'm an australian and I swore there was some australian cereal that had a similar thing that was discovered after the captian crunch one. </p>
<p>(Wasn't it a plot point of the book version of ready player One?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The cereal in question is 'Captain Crunch'. There was a famous phone phreaker by the same name that could whistle the tone also. The tone it produces is at 2600 Hz and it tells the long-distance switch that the user is on-hook (hung up). Playing with this gives you free long-distance calls (nothing to do with the police). This later turned into the 'little blue box'.</p>
<p>None of the boxes (there different types that do different things) including the blue box work any more due to modern switching systems no longer using in-band signaling and opting for out-of-band signaling during the mid to late 90's.</p>
<p>Fun Fact: Woz (a founder of Apple) was into the phreaking scene and if it wasn't for that Apple inc would not exist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Man, I remember reading about phreaking in The Anarchist Cookbook a long time ago. Great stories. This one guy made a phone call from a pay phone to the pay phone next to him but he basically had it directed around the world. Fun stuff.</p></div>		</li>
