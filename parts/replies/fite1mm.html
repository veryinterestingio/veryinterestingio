			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you tell me if massages are suppose to be painful, because I certainly feel that they are. Perhaps... Is it that I’m not used to being touched, or am I just sensitive, kinda like how I’m ticklish when touched in some places.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Massages are great and well worth it. I go every month since my work health plan subsidizes them. </p>
<p>Also, don't be afraid to shop around. I've had several massage therapists until I settled on one that works for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My gf is in school for massage therapy. She knows every muscle. Every fiber every little digit of the body. It’s absolutely insane.
When I met her I couldn’t raise my left arm due to a stunt accident. Instead of surgery. She healed me. I have 70% motion now. I can hug my son again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea I hate when people call this stuff pseudoscience.  Our modern medicine is going to look barbaric in the future based on the amount of surgeries we choose over this kind of therapy.   </p>
<p>I was 32 and in posture pain everyday, and through massage therapy, stretching, and rolling my muscles out, I was able to restore my posture and strengthen myself back to a pain free state.  I'm sure if I continued down that road without the therapy, I would've ended up under the knife as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's chiropractic that's being called pseudoscience rather than plain old massage. The claims and explanations given by the chiropractic institution are just wildly absurd.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, massage does tend to intertwine itself in the pseudoscience world. Where I live at least, massage therapists tend to share office space with chiropractors, acupuncturists, and naturopaths. There is also no shortage of RMT's that believe and practice a fair number of pseudoscientific treatments.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, while I fully agree that many forms of massage have scientifically provable benefits ( FWIW my background is in exercise science, and I regularly go to massage), it is a field that is incredibly susceptible to pseudoscientific influence. </p>
<p>It's also only a 2-year program to become an RMT (in Canada anyway), and it's challenging to provide students with the proper framework to differentiate against the vast amounts of pseudoscience when you've got that limited timeframe.</p></div>		</li>
