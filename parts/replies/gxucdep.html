			<div class="markdown"><p>Another way to think about this is imagine a mutation or series of mutations where this actually did happen in an animal. Now the animal is more likely to die because it won't tend to its injuries and alter it's habits to allow healing. Thus such a trait has little or no advantages to propagate and dominate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. I have a good friend that had a brain tumor and had to have a series of brain surgeries. He now has very little feeling in his legs below the knees. He can still walk, but he always looks drunk. He went to a water park with his family and wound up with second degree burns on his feet because he couldn’t feel the hot pavement under the Texas summer sun. It was a bad deal for him.</p></div>		</li>
