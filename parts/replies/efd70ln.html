<p>Read this, and get an idea how powerful they are, it breaks down all forms of sonar.</p>

<p>You could be conservative and say they can be 200dB. Which is kind of louder that Krakatoa 1 back in the day, that was 172dB 100 kilometers from the volcano 300ish dB at the source, estimated. Low frequency sound travels through water about 4 or 5 times faster in water than air, although i have no idea the speed of the soundwave of a volcano.</p>
<p>I should preface this, saying sound above and below the water is measured differently though. It's confusing.</p>
<p>edit: \^ I postfaced that shit.</p>

<p>It's the same as any other sound wave in water. In seawater (presumably at room temperature), it's ~1.5km/s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't directly compare the dB levels of sounds in water vs air. </p>
<p>They are measured off of a difference reference level, 1 micropascal in water and 20 microPa in air, AND the higher sound speed and density in water results in less intensity. You have to subtract 61.5 dB from the water measurements. So that 230 dB 1 m away from a sonar airgun in water becomes the equivalent of 170 dB in air. Which is in the neighborhood of a .357 magnum or as you said Krakatoa from a distance.</p>
<p>Those numbers make more sense intuitively, if we were really talking about 60 db - 1000000 higher power than that you'd probably have people feeling the vibration of the airgun from every beach in that ocean.</p></div>		</li>
