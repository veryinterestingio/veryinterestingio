When you're down to nano-meter scale I just can't grasp how robots are that tiny and able to make these chips, but I don't know how they're made otherwise</p></div>		</li>

<p>They aren't made with robots. Its called &quot;photolithography&quot;. Basically you take turns applying a &quot;mask&quot; chemical, hardening it with a pattern of light, washing away the non-hardened parts, then applying a layer to the holes in the mask. And then repeat, until you build up the structure you want (in somewhat oversimplified terms)</p></div>		</li>
