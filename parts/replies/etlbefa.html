			<div class="markdown"><p>An important thing to note here is that this age of giant insects occurred long before the age of dinosaurs, which grew large for different reasons. Insects during the dinosaur age were a normal range of sizes. The idea that in past ages everything was bigger, sort of implicit in the OPs question, is a myth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, realistically when you look at all of the different eras in history, most of them featured organisms that were generally smaller than what we see today. And even during the age of the dinosaurs most organisms were still fairly small.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, that just begs the question of why organisms tended to be smaller than they are today then.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans have always lived in the time of megafauna. We just have a habit, as a species, of killing them off whenever we colonize new places. Either directly or by taking all of their resources.</p>
<p>If you haven't, you should read Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari. He has a fascinating section that outlines how every time humans moved into a new region after moving out of Africa, you can literally just see patterns where all of the megafauna in the region went extinct very soon after. No drastic changes in climate. No cataclysmic events. Just humans entering the region and killing them all off.</p>
<p>I think the Americas and Australia are the most interesting examples he used. It's really interesting stuff and only slightly depressing :)</p></div>		</li>
