			<div class="markdown"><p>some interesting tangents to this: </p>
<p>other primates don't hear anything special in music.  it's just noise to them.  </p>
<p>to birds, a tune played in a different octave is completely new to them.  they don't connect a tune they know with the same tune sang back at a different octave.  they would have to relearn it again as a completely new thing to them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, I'm profoundly deaf from birth, I've never heard sound until I was 14 when I got a cochlear implant. While it's a massive help for me in regards to lip reading, I still can't understand speech without lip reading. Music never meant anything to me, never made me feel anything and I can go a long time without music or sound without a problem. Music is just meaningless noise to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is absolutely fascinating. Can you perceive any order or structure at all in music or is it just chaotic noise?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have no idea whether this is viable, but look up Tokimonsta when you have a chance. She is a well known Dj/producer that lost the ability to &quot;understand&quot; music a few years ago, due to an issue with her brain. Speech was effected, and music generally just sounded like unstructured noises.  A surgeon figured out a way to reconnect the neurons from the top of her brain down, causing them to regenerate, and fully solve her issue. My description of this is horrible, but it was incredibly interesting to read. I'm wondering if this somehow directly correlates with your deafness for the first fourteen years of life. Quite possibly, the neurons never had a reason to generate in that area, which now means you do not understand music. It also makes me wonder if this sort of procedure could essentially &quot;fix&quot; this in people who spent most of their childhood with deafness.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's a personal story from a person who lost their hearing and received a cochlear implant. Aside from comparing natural vs prosthetic, he also goes through <em>upgrades.</em> And it touches upon how the implants work. Quite a bit of the neural coding is still not quite there.</p>
<p>You might not find meaning in music because the neural structures didn't develop during a critical period, or just because the implants take some shortcuts. Or you just don't find meaning in music. There are plenty of people with normal hearing who are tone deaf.</p>
<p>(Our senses are actually big fat bundles of reception, processing, and perception. It's pretty common for someone to be missing a component and possibly not even be aware. A large percentage of the population lacks some depth perception. Around 1 in 200 people, estimated, can't recognize or read faces and emotions, despite normal vision.)</p>
<p>Full disclosure: I'm a neuroscientist, and I've met the guy who ran that upgrade, he's a fascinating genius blend of neuroscientist and computer scientist. I also think that in a few decades, prosthetics will be superior to the original, and I'm caffeinated like hell right now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is essentially true, but the funny thing is that primates do actually have a response to music if its specifically made for them.  They prefer silence to Mozart, but if you give them a good monkey groove they're all about it. </p>
<p>The link below is pretty interesting. Basically a composer produced a &quot;song&quot; that models the same characteristics of monkey linguistics and they loved it. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you practicing? I lost my voice two years ago while teaching. I assumed my vocal chords was just overworked and waited for it to get back. It never did. I've seen a lot of specialists and had laryngoscopy done and everything came back normal. I was told it's very possibly just psychosomatic at this point. </p>
<p>Is that possible? I mean, I can produce sounds and can speak normally if I don't try to force my voice out, but when I'm trying to speak louder, no voice comes out. I can't shout and the barest minimum sound I can produce is just above a whisper. I can produce sounds, I just can't put force behind my voice so my voice can be heard as far as the back of the room. </p>
<p>I've given up trying to get my voice back and have quit teaching. For a year I fell into a depression before I started writing again. I'd really like some help or advice in where to go to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had this happen to me. Felt like it took immense effort to speak and couldn’t get any real volume behind my voice. I was also teaching and had to leave academia for an industry job where it wouldn’t be as much of a problem. </p>
<p>Finally diagnosed with partial nerve damage in one of the cranial nerves leading to one side of my vocal cords. Made it so that the other side had to overcompensate with great effort and never quite closed right. These nerves run down into your chest and back up to your neck, so it’s possible but rare for them to get damaged from respiratory infections or other infections in the upper body. If your symptoms are gradually getting worse though, a more common cause of this nerve damage is a tumor impinging on the nerve. </p>
<p>Good news is that my ENT was able to fix most of my problems with a minor surgery by putting an implant in the weakened side of my vocal cords, moving them closer to center and making it possible for them so close properly again. I’ll never get my singing voice back like it was before, but I can talk just fine and plenty loud again.</p>
<p>None of this may be the same as yours, but it was a pretty rare thing to happen without a tumor causing it so it’s something to at least read up on just in case you have the same thing.</p></div>		</li>
