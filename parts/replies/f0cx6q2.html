<p>Put your finger right in front your mouth when doing a &quot;hoo&quot; and you will sense that it's actually just as hot as a &quot;haa&quot;, but cools much faster a few cms away. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a lesser known Aesop fable about this principle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A man and a satyr once poured out libations together in token of a bond of alliance being formed between them. One very cold wintry day, as they talked together, the man put his fingers to his mouth and blew on them. On the satyr inquiring the reason of this, he told him that he did it to warm his hands, they were so cold. Later on in the day they sat down to eat, the food prepared being quite scalding. The man raised one of the dishes a little towards his mouth and blew in it. On the satyr again inquiring the reason of this, he said that he did it to cool the meat, it was so hot.
&quot;I can no longer consider you as a friend,&quot; said the Satyr, &quot;a fellow who with the same breath blows hot and cold.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>(“to blow hot and cold” was probably an already known expression to mean “to be duplicitous”)</em></p></div>		</li>
