			<div class="markdown"><p>are there more high res images? In the image in the page you posted, the arms are the thin dark regions?</p>
<p>*There are only 2 bright bluish spots - are those the arms?</p>

<p>&quot;migrate&quot; meaning the stars move relative to each other and the way the galaxy looks now will be different in 1,000 years or 100,000 years ? After how much time will there be noticeable difference to relative positions ? Does the speed and direction of a star change randomly?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there are more high res images! You can check at the end of <a href="https://sci.esa.int/web/gaia/-/60192-gaia-creates-richest-star-map-of-our-galaxy-and-beyond" target="_blank">the following link. </a></p>
<p>The two bright bluish spots are not the arms! Those are the small and large Magellanic clouds.</p>
<p>Migrate meaning that stars do not stay in the place of birth indefinitely. Tipically, stars may change their speed and direction due to interactions with other stars and star clusters but also they can be kicked by the spiral arms.</p>
<p>Because of the high precision in the measurement of the velocity of the Gaia mission, it is expected to be found some difference in velocity of the stars by the time the mission has ended (over 10 years), although this difference will be minimal. We can expect the change in velocity to change dramatically in a order of magnitude of millions of years.</p></div>		</li>
