			<div class="markdown"><p>To add onto this, if you had a runny nose or a lot of mucus, lying down causes it to instead go down the back of your throat. This typically causes a lot more coughing and in extreme cases affect your breathing.</p>
<p>The best thing I have found to avoid this is to prop yourself up with several pillows.  This works for both colds and allergies. It isn't going to stop it, but usually brings it down to a more manageable level so you can sleep.</p></div>		</li>
