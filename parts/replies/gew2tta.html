<p>&quot;I dare to assume you ignorant jackasses know that space is empty. Once you fire this hunk of metal, it keeps going till it hits something. That can be a ship, or the planet behind that ship. It might go off into deep space and hit somebody else in 10,000 years. If you pull the trigger on this, you are ruing somebody else's day, somewhere and sometime. <strong>THAT</strong> is why you check your damn targets. <strong>THAT</strong> is why you wait for the computer to give a damn firing solution. <strong>THAT</strong> is why, <strong>Serviceman Chung</strong>, we do not <strong>EYYYEEE-BALL-IT</strong>. This is a weapon of mass destruction. You are not a cowboy shooting from the hip.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s an event in the game stellaris where your science ship is nearly grazed by a missile fired hundreds of millions of years ago with the trajectory from a neighboring galaxy that probably outlasted the war, gunner, and civilization that made it. Flowing through the void between galaxies, only to nearly hit you and now become someone else’s future discovery.</p>
<p>It’s a great game.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I feel like there is a misconception that rockets are constantly always on while traveling. </p>
<p>In reality really, because there's no friction or opposing force to the space craft, any amount of speed you put into the spacecraft pretty much stays constant because yes, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLpgxry542M" target="_blank">Sir Isaac Newton is the deadliest son of a bitch in space</a>.</p>

<p>Maybe TIE fighters broadcast this intimidating sound on all frequencies to terrify? </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s generally true.  Particularly for older spacecraft, which used traditional chemical rocket fuel.  They would burn their engines for a couple minutes to change course, and then coast for months, or years.</p>
<p>But like many newer space probes, Hayabusa 2 has ion engines.  Instead of sudden, powerful thrust, ion engines provide a super gentle push, over weeks or months.  So these craft spend less time just “coasting.”</p>
<p>They’re more efficient, and allow a spacecraft to do more maneuvering before running out of fuel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They push against the engine nozzle to push the space craft forward. Newtons 3rd law states for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that if you combust 1kg propellant in a chamber (or launch ionized atoms) out the back that goes at 1km/s it means that your 1000kg satellite will accelerate 1m/s forward. The useful thrust/force coming from a rocket is from before exhaust comes from before the propellant leaves the nozzle because that is what propels the spacecraft. It doesn't matter if the propellant hits something in 1/1000th of a second or will keep going for 1000 years the force was already imparted to the object and nothing else will affect it.</p>
<p>Don't feel bad for getting this wrong, the New York Times did the same thing in the 1920s and didn't bother issuing a correction until July 1969,</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All rocket engines, ion engines or otherwise, they all “push against” their own exhaust gases.  Their burnt fuel.</p>
<p>If you sit in a wheeled chair, and throw a heavy object, like a bowling ball, you’ll roll in the opposite direction.  Same thing.  Rockets throw hot exhaust gases.</p>
<p>Rockets work perfectly well in a vacuum.  They don’t require air (they bring their own liquid oxygen to burn), and they don’t need friction.</p>
<p>The faster you throw or shoot the exhaust gas, the more thrust you get.  Which is why “exhaust velocity” is an important measure of a rocket’s fuel efficiency</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They’re “pushing” against the exhaust that they’re throwing backwards.</p>
<p>Ion engines work by essentially throwing super fast particles out the back of the engine. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction means the spacecraft will get a tiny push in the other direction.</p></div>		</li>
