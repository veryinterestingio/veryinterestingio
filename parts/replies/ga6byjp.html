			<div class="markdown"><p>I think he mentions something about how the physical space between particles at the end of the universe, where expansion is infinitely fast and the space is infinitely expanded between atoms (or at least just past the speed of light), the distance becomes irrelevant from the perspective of the particles. Its pretty interesting to think about</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've asked this before without luck, but this seems to be the right place:</p>
<p>According to Penrose's  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_cyclic_cosmology" target="_blank">conformal cyclic cosmology</a> model, once the Universe has no more mass (only energy), there is no   more clock, and so you lose &quot;scale.&quot; (which I vaguely understand as  being the size of universe vs speed of causality/light) Under CCC, how  does the Universe  regain scale? What, if anything, determines what &quot;scale&quot; the next aeon will have?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point there is that over arbitrary time and space scales,  the likelihood of interaction is the same. </p>
<p>ie if you have two photons one meter apart, it'll take some amount of time for them to likely interact. If you take those two photons a light years apart, then after some (far larger) time, they'll have the exact same likelihood of having interacted. The behavior is exactly the same, and the only way to distinguish the two cases is by the timescale. </p>
<p>The idea is that if there is no clock there is no timescale and, the behavior of the universe is scale invariant: There's no way to distinguish an infinitely large and  uniform universe from an infinitely small and uniform one. Presupposing that an infinitely  and  uniform small universe is the condition for a big bang to occur, the conditions at the end of an aeon are the exactly same as at the beginning of one. That process can then repeat and scale appears again the same way it did in our aeon.</p></div>		</li>
