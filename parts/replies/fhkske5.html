<p>In a nutshell, yes, consciousness is an entirely material phenomenon. Here is a short excerpt from the book:</p>
<p>&quot; My collaborators and I have elaborated a theory that we call the “global neuronal workspace.” We propose that consciousness is global information broadcasting within the cortex: it arises from a neuronal network whose raison d’être is the massive sharing of pertinent information throughout the brain.</p>
<p>The philosopher Daniel Dennett aptly calls this idea “fame in the brain.” Thanks to the global neuronal workspace, we can keep in our mind any idea that makes a strong imprint on us, for however long we choose, and make sure that it gets incorporated into our future plans, whatever they might be. Thus consciousness has a precise role to play in the computational economy of the brain—it selects, amplifies, and propagates relevant thoughts.</p>
<p>What circuit is responsible for this broadcasting function of consciousness? We believe that a special set of neurons diffuses conscious messages throughout the brain: giant cells whose long axons crisscross the cortex, interconnecting it into an integrated whole. Computer simulations of this architecture have reproduced our main experimental findings. When enough brain regions agree about the importance of incoming sensory information, they synchronize into a large-scale state of global communication. A broad network ignites into a burst of high-level activation—and the nature of this ignition explains our empirical signatures of consciousness.</p>
<p>Although unconscious processing can be deep, conscious access adds an additional layer of functionality. The broadcasting function of consciousness allows us to perform uniquely powerful operations. The global neuronal workspace opens up an internal space for thought experiments, purely mental operations that can be detached from the external world. Thanks to it, we can keep important data in mind for an arbitrarily long duration. We can pass it on to any other arbitrary mental process, thus granting our brains the kind of flexibility that Descartes was looking for. Once information is conscious, it can enter into a long series of arbitrary operations—it is no longer processed in a reflexive manner but can be pondered and reoriented at will. And thanks to a connection to language areas, we can report it to others.</p></div>		</li>
