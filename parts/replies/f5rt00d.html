			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The other 3 forces (gravity, strong force, weak force) don't come in to play, so it is purely electromagnetic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer is not very satisfying, but it generally is &quot;when enough is enough&quot;</p>
<p>As someone who does simulations this is actually a common problem that pops up is &quot;how do you define a group of molecules as being in a given state?&quot; It's actually not trivial. </p>
<p>Gas is pretty easy to define.  Is there a huge space between molecules?  It's a gas then. </p>
<p>When you have a giant box of 100,000+ molecules, it's pretty easy you can just look at it a lot of the time and say &quot;this is a liquid&quot;.   When you only have 20-30 it's hard because the thing is they don't act like their corresponding liquid/solid. I had to deal with this a lot in my PHD thesis because I worked on atmospheric nucleation processes.  Aka the transformation process where you go from a vapor to a liquid.   What you find is that in between things are better described as neither a liquid or a solid, but something stuck in the middle. </p>
<p>This was a plot I would typically get</p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/MbThEFz" target="_blank">https://imgur.com/a/MbThEFz</a></p>
<p>This is a plot of the Gibbs free energy of a set of clusters as a function of size. Note: Due to the way the math shakes out the bottom axis is a strange coordinate, but the actual sizes are listed on top.  On the bottom axis x=0 corresponds to a cluster of Infinite size (Aka a ideal liquid) and 1 corresponds to a single water molecule in the gas phase.</p>
<p>The dashed red line is the &quot;bulk line&quot; or basically how a droplet of say 5 water molecules SHOULD act if it acts like a liquid.  But what you see is that the real curve disagrees with ideal line because when you have 5 water molecules you don't actually have a liquid, but you don't quite have a gas either.   Eventually as you grow the size of the droplet it begins to act more and more like a liquid, but the thing is depending on what the type of molecule is, the rate this converges is different.    For water it can be as small as 25 water molecules, but for say liquid argon it can be as large as 5000.</p>
<p>It can really depend on how you define what a liquid/solid/etc. is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is probably the most illuminating answer here.</p>
<p>Where would a gas appear on the graphs? Another diagonal line above/below the liquid bulk line?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would think that a reasonable answer is that there should be enough molecules to account for interaction with each other which imparts energy, which imparts temperature perhaps. So if you start from a zero state or as close to it, and you excite a molecule and you can measure it, then you know that this one molecule is enough to know it's physical state perhaps?</p>
<p>by the way, what you do is very cool. I learned a lot from reading your transition from vapor to liquid. cool stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know. My guy feeling says it's probably pretty low, probably on the order of 10^2 - 10^4 molecules, but I can't imagine that the distinction between liquid and solid would be very clear below that.</p></div>		</li>
