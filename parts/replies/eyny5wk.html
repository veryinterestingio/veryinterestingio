			<div class="markdown"><p>I started running about a month and a half ago and the biggest difference is how much greater my lung capacity is now. When i started i was wheezing by a quarter mile. Now i can run two miles with a 20 pound weight vest on and keep the same breathing pattern the whole way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, as with lifting, if you practice you can improve your technique—how to hold your upper body, where to land on your feet, how big or little steps to take— and technique improves performance even if you are the same fitness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s right. You make great gains in lifting when you first get started. That’s less getting stronger and more getting better at lifting weight. As you become more experienced, your gains kind of level off, because then you’re relying completely on gains in strength.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first ~3 weeks of strength training you actually don’t really increase muscle. Your neurological system begins to function better by  recruiting more motor units and also doing the action in a more coordinated way. It’s pretty interesting but makes a lot of sense</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, to be clear... Lots, and lots, and lots of technique training can improve performance. If Joe Shmo goes on a run and is coached up to have &quot;perfect&quot; technique, he'll actually have a worse running economy because attaining that technique is neurologically demanding. The most economical way to run is to just go run.</p></div>		</li>
