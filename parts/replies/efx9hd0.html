			<div class="markdown"><p>Great writeup, and I especially like the annotated diagram you included at the end!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So we start at the [20°C, 101 kPa] point in the phase diagram for water, and move left.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This should be &quot;move down&quot; I believe.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>leaving us with a mix that's 63% Ice Ih and 37% Ice III.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Should be 37% Ice II.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Effectively one ends up moving down, even though one is &quot;trying&quot; to move left (left = temperature dropping). Or put another way, as soon as one starts moving left one drops down to the vapor pressure (at the top of the fridge).</p>

<p>Oh yeah, you're right. I was confused by a combination of misreading the chart and the arrow going down.</p></div>		</li>
