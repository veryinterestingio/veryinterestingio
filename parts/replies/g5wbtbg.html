			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because most of the stuff posted here is bullshit.</p>
<p>Even distilled water will burn in your eyes.</p>
<p>Your eyes are extremely sensitive to any liquid entering then with a different osmotic pressure and pH than that of your tear film.</p>
<p>Castile soap, like every soap is quite a basic, which is far off the eyes pH.</p>
<p>And regular shampoos are usually made to match the aciditiy if the skin biofilm to not harm that.</p>
<p>Since adults don't usually suffer that much when they accidentally get shampoo into their ears once a year, it makes much more sense to make a shampoo that does the least harm to the average human skin.</p>
<p>The detergents used in shampoos play a tiny role, because you can use longer carbon chain detergents (with sulfur containing or not) which act much more like an oil rather than  a hydrophilic liquid.
And oils don't really change the osmotic pressure much, so they'll be far less noticeable to your eyes.</p>
<p>Whether it's sulfur containing detergents, actual soaps or any of the other thousand detergents used really makes no difference on its own if the pH and osmotic pressure isn't correct.</p>
<p>The only thing were sulfated detergents are the causative agents is people prone to aphths on the inside of their mouth. those are directly made drastically worse by SLS. (Though specifically SLS, tridec sulfates for example don't cause the problem).</p>
<p>This hate for sulfur detergents stems from conflating one specific detergents problems with the oral mucosa and a marketing fetish for 'if it's natural it's good for me'. And <em>chemicals</em> are evil, even though Castile soap is made up of 100% chemicals like every other item in the world. Even an apple is 100% chemicals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd still agree that different chemicals do vastly different things, and consequently treat our body differently.  </p>
<p>Sulfates are problematic because they ruin your sebum equilibrium.  They're simply too effective as a surfactant.
As soon as you wash with it, you're very dry and &quot;clean,&quot; but after half a day or so, your body overcompensates to the point where you feel greasy again. When I switched to a castile soap, this no longer happened.  I was in a constant state of sebum equilibrium.  As an added bonus, I no longer have to use product in my hair to style it.  The small natural sebum my scalp produces is enough.  My hair still feels dry as well, not oily.  While castile soaps use lye to make it, it's used up in the saponification of the oils used and is no longer an issue.  The only mark against proper soaps would be the pH imbalance.</p>
<p>All things considered though, I think the hate for sulfates is deserved.</p></div>		</li>
