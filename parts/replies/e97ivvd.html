			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes exactly- they were designed to operate differently.</p>
<p>The requirement to invoke cloture (place a time limit on a debate over an issue in the senate) is typically 60 votes; this procedure allows the minority voice to be heard and can lengthen debates. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The requirement to invoke cloture is a senate rule rather than an actual constitutional directive. Thus it can be changed at any time by a simple majority vote in the Senate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep and it has, recently a few times. We saw it come into effect pretty publicly during kavanaugh’s confirmation.</p>
<p>I think the rules are the manifestation of the different attitudes and designs of the two chambers. I’m not well versed on rules in the House, though I doubt there are as many protections (in terms of debate time etc) for minority party as the senate, where filibustering can happen pretty easily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not in the Constitution, and was just made up a long time ago. It has since been routinely abused; they used to force people to actually physically filibuster but they almost never do these days.</p>
<p>It's why it has gradually been eroding. It's likely that it will be completely abolished within a relatively short period of time.</p></div>		</li>
