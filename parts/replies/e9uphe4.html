			<div class="markdown"><p>There's the concept with a 2 part craft with a tether connecting them too though, right? Sort of like craft + &quot;counterweight&quot; (or whatever you might call it?) That means you can have a huge radius without having a huge rigid craft.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Build two rings and connect them directly together - no gap or space between them.<br />
They drive their rotation by pushing on each other with a series of small motors between the rings which also helps guarantee the stay balanced.<br />
They don't need any connection to the center.<br />
Their rotation also stabilizes their orientation.<br />
Add small lateral thrusters and you can tip the ring.<br />
If you make the ring motors bidirectional now you can rotate the rings in opposition or together; a combination of lateral-thrusters and ring-rotation maneuvers can orient it in any direction (albeit with a loss of AG but if there were an emergency you could dodge stuff.)</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="https://www.artificial-gravity.com/sw/SpinCalc/" target="_blank">SpinCalc</a> is fun for this kind of theorizing.</p>
<p>If you want 1g, you need to get to a radius of about 225m to avoid disorienting the inhabitants. At this radius, the inner surface of your cylinder would be going at 105 MPH relative to an observer at the center of the cylinder, and the cylinder would be rotating about twice per minute.</p>
<p>If you're willing to settle for .4g then you can get under 100m radius without causing any discomfort.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ignoring air resistance, it’s Newton’s First Law Time. You end up moving at a constant velocity that’s the vector sum of your jump direction and the sideways velocity you had due to corotating with the spacecraft. But your new direction vector ends up intersecting the spacecraft floor sooner or later. Now it turns out that this looks and feels pretty much like having made the same jump under gravity! Except that in a rotating frame there’s actually an additional force affecting your trajectory, the Coriolis effect.It makes you not end up in exactly the same position you would in a non-rotating frame—from your point of view you drift a bit while in air.</p>
<p>From the viewpoint of a nonrotating observer watching you, there’s no such thing as a Coriolis force or indeed the centrifugal force you feel keeping you anchored on the floor. Both are just artifacts caused by your momentum in a rotating system. But to you the forces are real.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This can be looked at in two different reference frames.</p>
<p>In the rotating frame (i.e. the reference frame in which the station itself stands still) gravity simply exists in the form of the centrifugal acceleration - this is simply an intrinsic property of rotating reference frames. But you won't land in exactly the same spot as you come down. As you jump up, coriolis forces act on you (caused by the fact that as you get closer to the center of the station, the velocity required to remain in the same place gets less and less), which accelerate you forwards, causing you to land a little ahead of where you started.</p>
<p>In the inertial reference frame, where the station /is/ spinning, the result is still the same - you land ahead of where you started - but the reasoning behind it is different. In this frame, during the jump you move in a straight line slightly inclined to the tangent to the station at the point you jumped off, while the station continues to rotate underneath you, as illustrated <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nymK8.gif" target="_blank">here</a> - and, since you are moving at a faster velocity than the floor (vector sum of the floor velocity and your jump velocity), and have a shorter distance to travel (chord of the circular station vs arc along its circumference), you hit the ground ahead of your starting point.</p></div>		</li>
