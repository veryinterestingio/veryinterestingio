			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an excellent answer that puts it all very succinctly and has a couple of interesting references I‚Äôve not come across before (it‚Äôs so easy to get fatigued of reading through people‚Äôs arguments against the <em>other</em> cause than the one they‚Äôre researching, I think I kinda gave up on news about the K-Pg boundary). </p>
<p>Anyway, I just wanted to say that perhaps it‚Äôs worth mentioning how those other craters that we have found which are larger than the Chicxulub one are from before the Phanerozoic so I‚Äôm not sure if you could even have a mass extinction. Not one that we‚Äôd be able to pick out in the rather ropey fossil record from that far back anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a fair criticism to the &quot;there have been bigger impacts without mass extinctions&quot; point. You get sort of a similar issue with the Deccan Traps argument as well, i.e. &quot;We've had other continental flood basalts that didn't cause a mass extinction&quot;. The poster child for continental flood basalts causing a mass extinction is really the Siberian Traps and the end-Permian extinction, but here it seems that this was caused by the context of the eruption, i.e., the eruption of the basalts through a large stack of organic and evaporite rich stratigraphy and the resulting liberation of a variety of compounds which did unpleasant things to the atmosphere and oceans (e.g., <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/101/35/12952.short" target="_blank">Visscher et al., 2004</a>, <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsta.2007.2046" target="_blank">Beerling et al., 2007</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X08006389" target="_blank">Reichow et al., 2009</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X08007292" target="_blank">Svensen et al., 2009</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00083-9" target="_blank">Burgess et al., 2017</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-018-0261-y" target="_blank">Black et al., 2018</a>). Outside the context of the end-Permian, there is a general idea that these events could be related to mass extinctions, but there is a lot of nuance (e.g., <a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=dqFmBAAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=large+igneous+provinces+and+mass+extinctions&amp;ots=ba_j_cgbj2&amp;sig=Y7fPwmWhvrTtgQBRhYYlAzdV5Jo#v=onepage&amp;q=large%20igneous%20provinces%20and%20mass%20extinctions&amp;f=false" target="_blank">Bond &amp; Wignall, 2014</a>).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, I thought it was just fossil fuel deposits that the Siberian Traps erupted through, but it looks like there‚Äôs lots of evidence for other things that messed up the ozone layer too. Definitely not a fun time. </p>
<p>I guess both flood basalts and extraterrestrial impacts are context specific as to their implications for life. I know that there are some  flood basalts emplaced on the seafloor of the mid-Cretaceous which have been <a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/books/book/678/chapter/3808270/Environmental-consequences-of-Ontong-Java-Plateau" target="_blank">linked to oceanic anoxic events and the minor Aptian extinction</a>, but the terrestrial consequences don‚Äôt seem to have been all that much in the grand scheme of things. On the impact side, contrary to my original point on those huge Precambrian impacts there is a pretty big one (I think similar size to Chicxulub?) Near the end of the Triassic, but far enough from the Tr-J boundary that it had nothing to do with that mass extinction. </p>
<p>So yea, the devil is definitely in the details. I think it would be amazing to see a large impactor strike in an extremely remote area if it turns out that they can in fact hit the Earth and not really do much. That‚Äôs a big if though!</p></div>		</li>
