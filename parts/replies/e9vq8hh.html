			<div class="markdown"><p>In microgravity plants germinate in random directions and need to be trained towards a light. They have no sense of up or down, fluids don't drain so good. It's hydroponics and sealed bags, and that can be sickly.</p>
<p>One thing that'll be interesting to see is if these low gravities are enough to provide that sense of direction.  It might be that there's a straight-line in the intensity of effects; it might be that one or both are as bad as microgravity; it'd be <em>really</em> nice if everything worked at even lunar G. </p>
<p>And they may have a neat swirl from growing through a small simulated gravity field - coriolis veggies, curling antispinward as they get taller.</p>
<p>Edit to add: Great big spherical bobble-matoes would be fun. :)</p></div>		</li>
