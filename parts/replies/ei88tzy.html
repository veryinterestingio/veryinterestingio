<p>Usually VPs are directors of certain divisions</p>

<p>VPs can be tricky in larger organizations.  The large company I worked for had a President over  a division.  Then an Executive VP (EVP) over a specific part of each division.  EVPs then had SVPs (Senior Vice Presidents) and VPs reporting to them.</p>
<p>Oh and sales is totally different.  Just about every sales person is &quot;Vice President&quot;.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, any trading or finance organization has a crap ton of VPs with no reports and reporting to other VPs. It might be because the transactions they do require a DOA dollar amount that corporate policy only allows to go to senior officers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason for this is a sales trick: if you have a title of VP then potential buyers will think you are a very important person in that company. Little do they know that in banking and sales there are tons of VPs</p></div>		</li>

<p>And also because finance regulations mean that only &quot;an officer&quot; can authorize certain things. So relevant organizations make a ton of officers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re so right! When in college, I interned for a medium sized brokerage firm, where literally everyone was a VP. It had become such a joke in the office during my four years interning there, that they allowed me to order business cards with the title “Vice President of Intern Relations” as I had other younger interns “reporting” to me (they had senior level folks that were technically in charge, but I assisted in assigning tasks etc, as I’d been an intern there so long)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Last bank I worked for, everyone was an EVP. When I was hired, I thought I had an amazing title compared to my past positions - was a mistake made? That wasn't the job I interviewed for. I was worried until I saw everyone had that title.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In this biggest firms they report to a board of directors. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Minor nit that I'll pick here.  If a company has a formal list of C level officers then there is almost always a board of directors.  The size of the company is irrelevant (there are many worth only 7 figures that have a board of directors that the CEO reports to).</p>
<p>I'll also point out that quite often the CEO is also the chairman of the board.  This was the case for Elon Musk before the SEC settlement.  This can create odd circumstances.  I'm the CEO and also the chairman of the board so the person that does my review is a person that I manage (my reviews are always stellar :)</p></div>		</li>
