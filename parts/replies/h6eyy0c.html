			<div class="markdown"><p>I appreciate the answer, but as /u/FBreath notes, it doesn't really answer the question being asked.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, in the first example, your frame of reference made a difference in the speed of the oncoming train (this is consistent with Euclidean observations). <strong>But light speed is always the same, regardless of the frame of reference. And this is why it is non-Euclidean.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's the bolded that I actually wanted explained here, especially with regards to the spacetime interval. I understand it might be hard to build an intuition, but I'm totally fine seeing the <em>math</em> laid out -- i.e., velocities at low speeds are additive (as in the train example), but what definition of Euclidean space does that satisfy? (I've seen it stated that Euclidean distance is defined via Pythagorean theorem -- is that related here?)</p>
<p>And at high speeds, velocities no longer are additive because you can't ever cross the speed of light, and thus time dilation/ length contraction become more clearly observable -- presumably, this is what makes it non-Euclidean. But what part of Euclidean geometry is being violated here? And why does the distance formula of the spacetime interval end up being hyperbolic -- is that an inevitable result from the speed of light being constant, or could the SI formula have taken a different form?</p>
<p>(And as a follow up -- at what point should we be thinking about four-velocities instead of 3-d velocities through space?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're definitely heading in the right direction with your thought. What you end up having to do to really make sense of everything is thinking about the <em>transformations</em> you can apply to space while still preserving its &quot;structure&quot; (the meaning of which I hope will become clearer).</p>
<p>In Euclidean space, the (squared) distance between points (x1, x2, x3) and (y1, y2, y3) is (x1-y1)^2 + (x2-y2)^2 + (x3-y3)^2. The transformations which <em>preserve</em> this distance are exactly translations, rotations, reflections, and their combinations, and are the <em>symmetries</em> of Euclidean space: Euclidean space is still &quot;Euclidean&quot; after you apply one of these. This is really what <em>defines</em> Euclidean space (at least in this context): the combination of this notion of distance together with these transformations which preserve it.</p>
<p>If we want to consider time on equal footing with space, then we need to fold it in somehow. First, this is where the speed of light comes in: for a time t, c*t is a distance. So a notion of (squared) relativistic distance <em>might</em> be (c*s-c*t)^2 + (x1-y1)^2 + (x2-y2)^2 + (x3-y3)^2 where (s, x1, x2, x3) a point at time s and (t, y1, y2, y3) a point at time t. This distance, together with the transformations that preserve it, would be a 4D Euclidean space, and hence a &quot;Euclidean space-time&quot;.</p>
<p>But this it turns out this is <em>not</em> the correct notion of (squared) &quot;distance&quot; to define space time. Instead, it is -(c*s-c*t)^2 + (x1-y1)^2 + (x2-y2)^2 + (x3-y3)^2. Notice the minus sign on the time part!!!! This minus sign is exactly where all the special relativity stuff comes from, and this whole thing is the space-time interval. The transformations which preserve this are called Poincare transformations and are the symmetries of flat, empty space-time. We know this notion of space-time interval is correct because we've performed experiments which tell that Poincare transformations are indeed symmetries of space.</p>
<p>The <em>hyperbolic</em> part comes from the fact that the set of points that have a specific, constant space-time interval value form what's called a &quot;hyperboloid&quot;, and each one of these hyperboloids is a model for a 3D hyperbolic space! And since our Poincare transformations preserve space-time interval, they (excluding things like translations) move points on a given hyperboloid to points on the <em>same</em> hyperboloid; so they can actually be considered hyperbolic transformations as well! This is the sense in which space-time is &quot;hyperbolic&quot;.</p>
<p>To connect with special relativity a bit more, these Poincare transformations include what are called &quot;Lorentz boosts&quot;, which is how you reason about different frames of reference traveling at different velocities. Hence, these Lorentz transformations are how you model time dilation and length contraction in this framework.</p>
<p>In particular, for velocity addition, instead of thinking of &quot;adding&quot;, what's more proper is to think of consecutive boosts: &quot;adding velocities&quot; is the same thing as changing frame of reference by the first velocity, then again by the second velocity, and then comparing to your original frame of reference. So &quot;velocity addition&quot; is really about the particular way consecutive boosts in the same direction combine to form one boost.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Euclidian metric is:  ds^2 = dx^2 +dy^2 +... for any number of dimensions. It is just the sum of squares of the displacements along each axis. </p>
<p>The reason spacetime is <em>non</em>-euclidian is because it's of the form</p>
<p>ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2 +... -(cdt)^2</p>
<p>The temporal component is negative. That's a hyperbolic geometry. Now the question is why. Intuitively it's because we want to define a metric in which the velocity of light <em>c</em> remains constant for any observer. Mathematically this implies that the <em>length of the vector</em> specifying the speed of light must be a fixed quantity for <em>everyone</em> in four dimensions.</p>
<p>Essentially, we need a solution to the equation describing the length traveled by a ray of light over an infinitesimal time interval</p>
<p>(cdt)^2 = dx^2 + dy^2 </p>
<p>hold for any rescaling of the coordinates (corresponding to different observers). Well, we can just rearrange </p>
<p>0 = dx^2 + dy^2 - (cdt)^2 </p>
<p>and call the rightside the &quot;spacetime interval&quot; (ds^2 ) in general. Hence the path taken by a ray of light satisfies ds^2 = 0, and we define all other motion relative to it. This is why light moves along so-called &quot;null&quot; trajectories. This relationship is why <em>c</em> defines the asymptote of a hyperbola in the x-t plane; all motion which is not at <em>c</em> can only asymptotically approach it. </p>
<p>Ultimately there are much deeper mathematical motivations. Check out the mathpages &quot;reflections on relativity&quot; (and his other pages too). Excellent summary of many deeper intuitions and the math behind them.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you so much! This part is really close to making something in my head click: </p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>So a few quick clarification questions:</p>
<p>1) Ordinarily, I see &quot;dx, dy, dz, dt&quot; represented using deltas, which don't imply anything about infinitesimally small changes (whereas dx, dy, dz, dt invoke calculus). Your post also mentions the length traveled by a ray of light over an <strong>infinitesimal time interval</strong>. Does this only work on small scales? (My intuition tells me that in the SR world of flat spacetime, these distances can be arbitrarily big, but in the GR world of curved spacetime, we need to invoke calculus because patches of curved spacetime are flat only <em>locally</em>, is that right?)</p>
<p>2) I understand that we want an equation that preserves the length of the vector specifying the speed of light. What I don't understand is why the equation &quot;(cdt)^2 = dx^2 + dy^2 &quot; does that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question: Why is that a hyperbolic geometry? As far as I know, in a pure theoretical sense, non-euclidean isn't synonymous with hyperbolic. If you accept certain axioms, you can prove that, for example, parallel lines exist (this is true in hyperbolic and euclidean geometry, but not generally in spherical geometry. This doesn't mean spherical geometry doesn't exist, or that spheres don't exist. It just means spherical geometry doesn't satisfy every axiom that is used to prove that parallel lines exist)/ But do we have any reason to believe that the universe satisfies even the first few of Euclid's postulates? Or do we just assert them because they're nice to have? (No shade on that idea; mathematicians do it all the time)</p>
<p>To rephrase, do we even have a reason to conclude the universe is an incidence geometry? Or is it more a matter of &quot;It looks like it, and we have no reason to believe otherwise. Moreover, it's nice to have because it gives us at least something to work with. We could be wrong, though, but we'll cross that bridge if we get to it&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP but as a follow up to this, what is the explanation for this, given that two different observers would perceive the same beam of light at the same speed? If I'm travelling in the same direction of that beam of light at 0.5c, logic tells me that the light should be perceived by myself at that 0.5c as well. I know this is not the case, just can't wrap my head around on <em>why or how.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me, the key to grasping this is to understand that space and time are not separate, but actually interwoven into one combined fabric that everything is constantly moving through:  Space-time.  Everything in Space-time travels at c.  Even you right now.  It's easiest to think of this as a pendulum.  The faster you travel in space, the slower your time component becomes to compensate.  Travelling at c?  Pendulum stuck hard right.  Stopped perfectly still in space (something nothing ever truly achieves) and your traveling through time at max speed, the hard left swing of that same pendulum.</p>
<p>So the reason you see a beam of light pass you at c even when you're travelling at 0.5c (or 0.999999c) is because time had slowed down for you in order to get that fast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe this is why we say space-time is non-Euclidean. The entire concept of space-time warps and shifts itself to force you to perceive light travelling at c.</p>
<p>The distance between two fixed points is not a constant of the universe.
The constant passage of time is not a fixed constant of the universe.</p>
<p>Both of those will bend in order to preserve the real constant of the universe - the speed of light</p></div>		</li>
