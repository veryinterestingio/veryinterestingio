<p>As for the topic, yea what we traditionally call sound is not a unique effect. Air is a medium that things happen in, and can be pushed around accordingly. In space, there is no medium around the objects colliding so all the resulting forces balance out between them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A surrounding atmosphere or liquid does dampen vibrations by absorbing them and turning them into sound.</p>
<p>Or, imagine two pieces of chalk shot at each other at high speed turning into dust upon impact. In an atmosphere, the dust cloud spreads rapidly at first but quickly slows down as the motion is absorbed by the atmosphere and turned into a sound wave (and some heat). In space, the dust cloud just keeps spreading.</p></div>		</li>
