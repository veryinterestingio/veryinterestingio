			<div class="markdown"><p>While both refraction and reflection do take place, the primary role is that of reflection. The two sets of waves that interfere is due to reflection from two different membranes, the outer and inner. Actually it's not even reflection who's the MVP, it's Interference. The reflected and refracted waves need to interfere in order to give the colours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So its like a Moire (sp) pattern?  Is that the same as the effect of driving down a highway and looking at the vineyards or other orthogonal objects? (When viewed at a right angle as well.)  Oddly, I can't find such a thing when I search for it in Google.  Perhaps I'm losing my mind. </p>
<p>I have to admit I don't even understand how refraction works.  I know a little about the Young Slit experime.. hmm.  I understand how Young's experiment of 2 slits works with regard to the waves going through 1 slit interfere with those going through the other, generally I use the oft debunked &quot;pilot wave theory&quot; to understand that sort of thing, because its way easier to conceptualize than the Copenhagen approach or the &quot;many worlds&quot; model.  Even if its only &quot;mostly right&quot;.</p>
<p>From what I can tell using the diagrams on the subject, reflection and refraction happen at right angles to each other, and refraction photons are typically absorbed? Is this some sort of cumulative effect thing?  Because if the wave packet collapses, only the prior all-paths should be used to determine interference (as far as I know.)  Photons don't get half-absorbed or half-interact / get half-measured.  Unless they are weirdly split into particle antiparticle pairs by way of a black hole, maybe. </p>
<p>I can see the interference around a single (dispersed) wave-function here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_packet#Gaussian_wave_packets_in_quantum_mechanics" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave\_packet#Gaussian\_wave\_packets\_in\_quantum\_mechanics" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave\_packet#Gaussian\_wave\_packets\_in\_quantum\_mechanics</a></a>I guess all the blue waves add up the the red wave.  Does this have to do with the oily rainbow? :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Typically we don't really consider refraction, we just say that teh light has normal incidence, otherwise calculations get messy. </p>
<p>Its basically the interaction between the component of the light reflected from the top air/oil boundary and the component reflected from the bottom. Depending on the thickness of the film, the path difference of those two rays mean different wavelengths will interfere constructively and destructively.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is stretching my brain, can you explain it a little?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like the others who answered, refraction isn't necessary for the phenomena to arise (although technically it needs to be accounted for to get an accurate full description).</p>
<p>I will explain where the colors come from in a little bit more detail. Lets take the example of oil on top of water. Light that hits oil will first either pass from air to the oil or be reflected, and then if it passes through it will then pass through from oil into water. At each of those <em>interfaces</em> there is a probability of the light being reflected.</p>
<p>Now light is a (electromagnetic) wave. A wave has the property of something oscillating ('moving' back and forth). It also has the property of interfering additively (meaning if you have to light waves that encounter each other, the total light wave at any point that they meet is the sum of the two waves).  Now we should remember that the light that reaches us from the oil puddle is a combination (i) the light that is reflected from the top air/oil surface and (ii) the light that is reflected from the middle oil/water surface. Those two light waves are added together.</p>
<p>Waves oscillate back and forth, and if you have the light from one surface being 'back' and the light from the other surface being 'forth' then they cancel each other (partially) out. Whether the light wave from the second surface is 'back or forth' relative to the light wave from the first surface depends on the distance (and therefore time to oscillate) that it travels, i.e. the thickness of the oil layer. The thickness is not perfectly uniform, so slight variations in the thickness means that how much the light waves cancel each other varies across the puddle.</p>
<p>Now you might think non of this explains the <strong>colors</strong>, but there is just one missing puzzle piece. The rate/speed at which the light wave oscillates is precisely the same property that we perceive as color in light. Red oscillates the slowest, green oscillates faster and blue oscillates the fastest. So how much the light waves cancel each other depends not only on the thickness of the oil layer, but also on the color of the light (the frequency/wavelength). So in one spot red light might oscillate the precise number of times to be cancelled while blue light is preserved, and opposite in another point. The result is a strong variation in color across the oil surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So theoretically if the thickness of the thin film were uniform we’d only see one colour of light? This is because only one wavelength/colour of light can constructively interfere given that particular thickness.</p>
<p>But in reality the thickness isn’t uniform which is why we can see a rainbow of colours. The thickness determines which wavelengths will interfere constructively/destructively hence it determines what colours we can see</p>
<p>I’m learning interference in school please let me know if this is a valid interpretation!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh. So it’s sort of how flanging works with audio. The slight difference in phase causes destructive interference in some wavelengths and constructive interference in others. Cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sound and Light are both waves. So technically anything you can do by playing with the alignment of audio waves can also be done with light. And in fact, in live sound applications, the placement of speakers is very important because you can get dead spots if you’re not careful, and spots where the sound is too loud. Consider stereo speakers playing the exact same signal, it’s technically no different from the double slit experiment</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to clarify a little bit, the interference is constructive(makes the light you see more intense) but only for the wavelength that corresponds with the thickness in that area. Different areas of the film are different thicknesses so they form constructive interference for different wavelengths. This causes the variety of colors that you see</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Normally you get both - the closer your path length differential is to a multiple of a full wavelength (n) the &quot;more constructive&quot;, the closer to uneven multiples of half a wavelength ((2n+1)/2) the &quot;more destructive&quot;</p></div>		</li>
