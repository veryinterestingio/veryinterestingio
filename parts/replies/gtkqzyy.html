			<div class="markdown"><p>I once got a stomach bug after eating a burrito at Cheesecake Factory and haven't eaten there since. I believe blaming the LAST thing you ate is our body's way of avoiding things that might have made you sick in the future, just in case.  This trait probably evolved when meals weren't as closely spaced as they are now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With lactose intolerance I heard it’s not actually the milk you’re shitting out, your body has a reaction to the milk you drank and releases water into your bowels, liquifying the shit that was already developing. So it’s not that the milk goes right through you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worst food poisoning I ever got was this. Literally an entire night not sleeping, just puking and shitting. Drank water to rehydrate, that came out immediately too. </p>
<p>Soon as I knew someone was in the office that morning, I called in sick. DROVE to medical (because I'm fucking stupid). Stood at the front counter swaying back and forth until the guy noticed me like &quot;whoa, you okay?&quot; They let me rest on a bed in the back room, gave me two IV bags of saline, then gave me a bottle of water, and I still didn't have to pee until the day after. Never ever been that dehydrated before.</p></div>		</li>
