			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably the most underappreciated aspect of this current tech hellscape of a culture we're living in is the insane cultural impact of information over-saturation and the creation of a false sense of exigency, simply because we're now constantly subjected to every trivial event that happens anywhere on the globe, yet our brains aren't evolved enough to decouple this particular media from the psychological triggers we've developed to sense credible danger. </p>
<p>When people wiser than us, maybe 100 years from now, nail down the root cause of the spike in depression, nihilism, mass shootings and an overall decline in what used to make a civilization stable, it will be this. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We used to use leaded fuel in the UK as well - either &quot;two-star&quot; or &quot;four-star&quot; variety - resulting in the same issues, yet the murder rate has been fairly flat over the past 40 years, between about 1 and 2 per 100.000 persons (in the 1950s it reached a trough of about 0,6 per 100.000 - perhaps the war-weary populace had had it with violence at that time :) ).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The &quot;drug war&quot; would explain a lot of the gang violence in the US, but obviously does not explain why it's declined since 1990.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Changes in the popularity of particular drugs, notably crack, are another theory to explain falling crime levels since the 90’s. Crack wasn’t widely used till the mid 80’s, though, so it can’t explain the rise in crime rates before that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed, but then we have to ask why crack has become less popular.  </p>
<p>Education and awareness aren't really the answer, people in communities devastated by crackheads were aware as fuck of the situation, they still decided to try crack for some reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A history professor loved this topic and we spent lots of time on it.  However she made sure to drive home that the fact is Baby Boomers were for several decades the most violent and dangerous US generation ever.  This is simple fact.</p>
<p>What isn't known is why they were like that and why they stopped being that way.  All the theories are trying to answer the question of why Boomers were so terrible but tend to gloss over the simple fact that they were.  An entire generation in self denial pretending that society is worse today than it was 40 years ago when the exact opposite is true.</p></div>		</li>

If that’s not a sign of total depravity, I’m not sure what would be.</p></div>		</li>
