			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting! I was going off the logic that I’d heard that young kids whose parents try to keep them away from germs might be actually hurting them by not giving them germ exposure. But it sounds like that might be more of an issue for children, not adults. Does this create risk for children who have had little bacterial exposure the last year? Or is it a short enough period of time not to matter?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is correct that exposure while young will help build your initial immune capability and that building phase is finite. You reach a point where your immune system has a pretty good database to work off of after a few years of encountering infectious or inflammatory stuff. </p>
<p>What people don’t consider is that on a daily basis, our bodies are launching an immune response to literally millions of attacks that we don’t even know are going on because not every immune response causes symptoms. (Fun side fact, the symptoms of an illness are not caused by the pathogen, they are the result of your body’s immune response. Fever for example is your body raising its own temperature in an attempt to kill foreign bacteria or viruses). Even with lower socialization in quarantine, our bodies are still inundated with countless immune triggering pathogens, bacteria, spores, allergens, even our own cell mutations. Just because you haven’t gotten a head cold in a year or dodged the flu doesn’t mean your immune system isn’t still being put to the test. The world is a filthy place. </p>
<p>That being said, unless kids have been in hyperbaric chambers all 2020, they’re probably still being exposed to enough immune triggers to keep developing healthy and normal immune responses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally agree, (though would note that some classic symptoms are caused by the immune system rather than the pathogen, but there are still plenty of symptoms and illnesses caused directly by pathogens)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a false premise because no one is really keeping germs away from their kids. Remember when it comes to things we can see/hear/feel, you can't use 'common sense' style heuristics. </p>
<p>The idea that the immune system won't develope because you are 'indoors' makes sense to the ignorant (myself included), but to an expert is utterly laughable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd be interested in knowing more in depth stuff about this. I've always intuited that it was a common myth that being too clean &quot;weakens&quot; our immune system. It just doesn't make sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Makes sense for a developing immune system, such as in children.</p>
<p>It's called the hygiene hypothesis, but it's not about personal hygiene:</p>

<p>The term &quot;hygiene hypothesis&quot; has been described as a misnomer because people incorrectly interpret it as referring to personal cleanliness.</p>

<p>Rather, our immune system maintains &quot;the plans&quot; for those antibodies so if we are re-exposed to a pathogen or encounter one that's similar to one we've had in the past, our bodies can quickly and efficiently drum up the antibodies necessary to kick it to the curb.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are the &quot;plans&quot; mRNA? And would that mean we might not need a covid vaccine every year?</p></div>		</li>
