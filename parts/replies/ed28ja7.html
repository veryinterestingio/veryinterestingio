			<div class="markdown"><p>It's because all 'physical' explanations of memory are not literal. In the history of psychology you'll find unpopular papers that searched explicitly for physical memories in the brain and failed (like the hypothetical concept 'engram'). Mainly that's because there is a huge gap between common people's knowledge of psychology to the science of psychology. The reason the best answer so far says a literal physical structure is wrong, in conjunction with talking about waveforms being a better answer, is that most people think that things like memory must be represented in a structural manner, the brain cells, physically as storage. However, the best answer is that this type of ontology (an explanation about what things exist in what way) isn't corroborated by the evidence, it is ultimately only a metafor (like another commenter mentioned). Instead, it seems for memory that we need a 'process ontology', which very broadly means that you'll never find structures that correspond to &quot;a memory&quot; (and you should be cautious to use this language as &quot;a memory&quot; is a horribly underdefined thing), instead you will need to look at the time-evolving sequence of recalling -what complex web of activities are co-implicated as the <em>action</em> of recalling is performed? As of yet, we do not know (in the literal sense) what (what you are calling) memories are (or perhaps, how they are instantiated).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer. Thanks. It is a struggle conceptually to understand, but so is the Big Bang and other such phenomena. I can accept the wave form and non-material and process concepts (even if I do not understand them). But perhaps there is still a perceptual nut to crack for me on the memory aspect. Even if it is not a physical memory, there is a repetitive process that is triggered and a set of actions remembered somehow. And if we forget about humans, and just consider nature, how many ways are there in nature to store a process sequence and are there any examples of non-physical means?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Giving any kind of hypothetical answer will be unsatisfsctory. I'd rather let you think on this:</p>
<p>We assume that the experience we have of the world is created by the brain. 'Percepts' are creations in your brain: you do not see the world you are currently seeing, you are seeing Percepts. In response to criticism to that, they say Percepts need the support of crystallized Percepts (memory). Because we can think of things that do not happen now, we need a storage to explain that we can. Our continuous perception of the world is only ever of the immediate now, before it the past, in front the future. But these are all just assumptions that are not necessarily true. What if perception didn't rely on Percepts? What if we actually saw the world in front of us, unmediated? What if perception was indistinguishable from actions? What if perception continues even after you close your eyes?</p>
<p>Most of psychology relies on the representational approach (things in brains, stored or otherwise, in one form or another -wave or structure). But you'll find there are non-representational alternatives that at least casts some well earned doubt on the status quo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The waveform metaphor of/u/Codebender is just that - a metaphor. Memories are not at all stored as waveforms in the brain.</p>
<p>The spiderweb metaphor of /u/pentaxlx is closer to the truth - making new paths with time (new associations, new memories) and pruning unused ones with time. </p></div>		</li>
