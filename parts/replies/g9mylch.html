He then sits on this money for years, and this is then the retirement fund of said congress member.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The STOCK Act prohibits members of Congress or their staffs from using insider information to trade (this only recently passed, by the way). Of course, they still have to get caught, meaning it probably happens all the time undetected. However, if they are greedy and use out-of-the-money options, it triggers warnings at the SEC. A former member of Congress was just convicted of this. Chris Collins, a Republican from New York, who passed on information to his relatives, who dumped their stock when he told them bad news about a company they all invested in, news that wasn;t yet public. He got a two-year prison sentence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You mean can they take something that would be legal for themselves to do, and restructure it in a way that would be a felony and that also involves trusting all their money to another person?</p>
<p>Yes, but it would be stupid.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And I don't think Bill Barr is too keen on prosecuting politicians for insider trading.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In terms of the OP's post I would say the stock market is more akin to a black jack table where the better players are good at counting cards.</p>
<p>The legally known information that can be acted upon by everyone is technically known and available for anyone paying attention to it. But even for those in the know there is an amount of guess work and luck (for example, all the known information analysis in the world would not have given you the date of the second Boeing 737-MAX crash). So everyone to a degree is still reactive to chance but some know a lot more about the current contents of the &quot;deck&quot; than others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would differentiate traders and investors. If you have enough capital, you can invest in certain companies and pretty safely live off of dividends.</p>
<p>If you're actively trading, I would agree with your point comparing it to blackjack.</p>
<p>There is a big difference between those who trade off of charts vs those who trade off of fundamentals and news. Chart traders use technical analysis to look for trends and market behavior, but it falls short in long term trades unless you look at fundamentals as well. </p>
<p>I've been a broker for 15 years, but rarely seen day traders survive in the long run .</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're basically playing poker. You versus the rest of the traders in who can better evaluate various stocks.</p>
<p>Everybody has the same info and tools. So what edge do you have? Probably close to zero most likely.</p>
<p>However, factor in that 1 in 100 or 1 in 50 traders has inside information. That gives them a sizeable edge. This makes everyone without inside info (AKA you) a huge sucker with a sizeable disadvantage and negative expected value in the long run.</p>
<p>The only way to win is not to play. Investing in the S&amp;P500 (placing a bet on the market versus various stocks), is fine. Trying to pick a stock like Disney / Google / Apple, and you're just a sucker. And much of the financial industry (advisors, brokers, Robinhood) exists for no other reason than to wrangle suckers like you into the game, where they can take a small rake.</p>
<p>Push away from the table. Stand up. Walk out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Traders use that information, plus available information from other sources, to make decisions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Specifically, they are making predictions about the value of the company's future income stream.  This is basically how all nearly all stocks are valued - they cost multiples of this year's earnings because you expect them to make more money in the future.</p>
<p>This means that investing is not gambling - if you invest in companies that make more money in the future, you will generally come out ahead - it isn't just a coin flip.  However, you have to be good at predicting the future, years out, which almost nobody is any good at.</p>
<p>What sometimes confuses people is the fact that there are also small fluctuations in the future value on a day-to-day basis, which cause the price to bob up and down like a cork on the water.  These fluctuations are random, based on how millions of people think about the value at any one minute.  Even the strongest companies will go down a few percent all the time on a daily or weekly basis, but eventually if the company makes enough money the stock will slowly move in the upward direction.</p>
<p>Betting on these short term daily or weekly fluctuations <em>is</em> definitely gambling.  So you can gamble and invest in the same market, depending on how you put your money in and how you take it out.  Short term buying based on no theory about company future is flipping a coin.  Buying based on analysis of the company's future is investment.  And there are plenty of positions in between these two - partly investment and partly gambling.</p></div>		</li>
