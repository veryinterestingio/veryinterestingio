			<div class="markdown"><p>For my Compost, I get the concept if I am keeping it at home for myself. On Wednesdays I send Compost to wherever the city is taking it. How do they know what I have or haven't put in there, if it has already started to decompose and become one big lump of messy Compost?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They sort it before adding it to the big pile.  If it's decomposing, then it's compostable.  If it's not, then they pull it out.  If you added something that leaked, like battery acid, then they might have to toss the whole batch if they can't separate it.</p></div>		</li>
