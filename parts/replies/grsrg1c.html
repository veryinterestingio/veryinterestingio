			<div class="markdown"><p>First of all, the vaccines are effective enough against all of the currently described variants to turn a potentially deadly illness into a cold.  That’s definitely good enough to make me feel comfortable receiving any of the vaccines.  </p>
<p>Secondly, the AZ vaccine does not seem to be associated with more blood clotting events than are seen in people regularly.  Blood clots happen every day unfortunately but, so far, there is no evidence that AZ vaccine recipients get them any more than the average person.  It’s wise to check carefully when anything comes up so they will continue the analysis.  In short, if you don’t have any known risk for blood clotting, you shouldn’t hesitate to get the AZ vaccine.  If you do, talk to your doc but I would probably advise most people to get whatever vaccine is available.  </p>
<p>Vaccine passports are an interesting topic.  Israel has embraced them and we are all learning a lot from their experience.  For some things, they may be reasonable but probably not a great idea for everything.  Either way, I would take a good digital photo of your vaccine card in case you ever need it.  - EL</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the AMA. Have you seen that two teams in Europe think that they found what it is causing the rare blood clots after getting the AZ vaccine? <a href="https://www.ibtimes.com/scientists-discover-cause-blood-clots-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-3166638" target="_blank">https://www.ibtimes.com/scientists-discover-cause-blood-clots-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-3166638</a></p></div>		</li>
