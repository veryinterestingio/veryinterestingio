			<div class="markdown"><p>While this may be true regarding efficiency, it's not (at least solely) the reason why robots have such legs. Robot designers aren't often concerned with efficiency until it restricts the capabilities of the robot - instead, they are concerned with stability, responsiveness, flexibility, and weight. With regards to these aspects, reverse knees are generally superior. In fact, you can actually reduce some processing required for locomotion if you design a bio-inspired backwards facing knee, like in Fastrunner: <a href="http://robots.ihmc.us/fastrunner" target="_blank">http://robots.ihmc.us/fastrunner</a></p>
<p>Stability - A human knee requires an articulated foot to push off of a surface to move forward. Keeping the body stable also requires sensors in the feet to recognize center of mass, which then need to tell the foot how to redistribute weight. As /u/PM_ME_UR_Definitions stated below, you can make a backwards facing knee without an articulated foot. This makes walking easier to compute, and properly designed, a backwards knee can be more effective in responding to disturbances or unplanned deviations in the surface that the robot puts its foot down onto.</p>
<p>Responsiveness - With only two joints, computations regarding walking are much faster, leading to better responsiveness. Also, there are fewer adjustments to balance to make once there is an issue with the center of weight. That's why you'll see robots like Little Dog not actually having feet, and instead their balance is mainly handled at the body and knee level.</p>
<p>Flexibility - Probably only a small point in favor of backwards knees, but consider that if you're trying to walk up to something and then bend down to interact with it, you don't want your knees in the way. Consider all of the ways we have to redistribute our weight to interact with things on the ground - positioning our knees, changing our back angle, hip angle, etc.</p>
<p>Weight - Requiring a foot requires additional servos, motors, etc., all increasing weight.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Fastrunner has a forwards facing knee, a long shin, and a long foot with a backwards facing ankle just like a lot of running animals do.. See 2:44.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, you're right anatomically, but even though what looks like a knee in an ostrich and FastRunner is the ankle, the knee is also permanently flexed in an ostrich (and the corresponding joint in FastRunner moves very little as you can see in the prototype video) - so it doesn't serve the same function.</p></div>		</li>

<p>why did evolution get it wrong for us and a lot of other species?</p>

<p>It didn't, really. Many fast running animals, whether they be mammals or birds, (though, unlike us - we aren't fast), have very short femurs and use the ankle joint, tibia/fibia, and foot as if it was a reverse facing knee. <a href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/parody/images/3/3b/1374_1amug_071d.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20151127160331" target="_blank">Look at how the back legs are designed.</a> The ankle joint in the hind legs is at the same level as the knee joint in the front legs.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>As for why the front legs also don't have ankle joints that act like knees - there are probably other factors involved like being able to push to a stop or change direction quickly by locking the front legs.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Boston Dynamics may arrive at the same design if they ever invent robot predators to chase and try to eat their other robots.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are other factors that likely influence what direction the knees face, but not only that, evolution does not <em>always</em> select for what's best. If it works good enough, it works good enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To keep it simple: why humans evolved, and why robots &quot;evolved&quot; are not for the same purposes. </p>
<p>We are naturally good at the things we evolved to do, e.g. run and climb. </p>
<p>We in turn, created robots to do things we are <strong>not</strong> naturally good at. Say, lifting and moving heavy boxes. </p>
<p>In that way, they shouldn't really resemble us much at all.</p></div>		</li>

If i remember correctly from my lessons normal knee has some positions in which kinematic calculations can be like &quot;get fucked&quot;, while reversed knee doesn't</p></div>		</li>

So many posts in this subreddit aren’t asking for simplified explanations, they’re just using it to ask things they could easily google or look up on Wikipedia or they’re karma-farming.</p>
<p>This is the kind of post that I really wish there were more of in this sub. It’s refreshing to see good questions like this.</p></div>		</li>
