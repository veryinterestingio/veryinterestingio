			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not how it works. The Earth doesn't spin around under its oceans and created waves. Waves are simply water movement due to winds, temperature changes, and tidal forces from the moon. If we were in a vacuum, with no moon and no sun, then Earth's water would remain pretty motionless. There would still be some movement due to volcanic activity, and various forces that both life and chemistry impart on the water, but that would be it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the depth of the ocean in between the coasts makes waves with greater kinetic energy have much smaller peak-to-trough height. So waves in deep water don’t indicate their strength at the surface.</p></div>		</li>
