<p>And yet there's people glorifying this behavior. It's really confusing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That 45% of Americans might as well be living on a different planet than the rest of us. Itâ€™s difficult to comprehend how out of touch with the consensus reality they are, except for of course the small group of powerful people who stand to profit even from this dumpster fire, at the expense of the country and the planet as a whole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, not to make this into &quot;well other countries do it too&quot; but there is a lot of shit around the world that doesn't make sense from the outside, but people raised there think it's normal. Like 2 countries fighting over some rocks in the ocean, or refusing to acknowledge that there even are 2 separate countries.</p>
<p>Sadly not enough people travel, or interact with people from other countries, with an open mind. They'll defend what they know because of some primitive monkey brain nonsense.</p>
<p>And as you add more and more people to the mix, it gets crazier. Cults, Flat Earthers, nationalism... they truly are organized insanity.</p>
<p>A psychologist could probably explain what is happening pretty well. Unfortunately no one has come up with an easy way to break this behavior.</p></div>		</li>
