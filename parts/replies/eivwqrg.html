			<div class="markdown"><p>Thereâ€™s mixed science on that too. On the one hand, swelling tends to increase blood flow to an area and in some cases restrict movement to reduce the risk of further injury. On the other, too much swelling can put pressure on joints or other areas and cause more damage. </p>
<p>If in doubt, consult a doctor. </p></div>		</li>

Allergies are probably good thing if they make my nose get rid of harmful dust particles after I clean out my basement. They probably aren't good in the case that I'm allergic to peanuts, and while digesting the peanuts is actually harmless, the allergic reaction could be lethal. The body doesn't <em>always</em> know what's best.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The swelling isn't what causes damage, it's the inflammation. I'm not trying to be pedantic, but there is a difference. Inflammation includes macrophages coming and &quot;gobbling up&quot; the damaged tissue to help clean up the area. Sometimes there is too much inflammation leading to the macrophages chewing up healthy tissue as well, which causes damage. Cold reduces swelling, but also reduces the chemical (cytokine) inflammatory response.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In some cases, the swelling might impede healing. If you have a sinus infection, reducing the swelling can open up the openings to the paranasal cavities (sinuses) and therefore help with drawing the mucus and better ventilate the sinuses. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Basically, inflammation is the first step in our bodies' healing process. You don't want to stop it or reduce it or slow it down. The human body is designed to self heal, not self destruct. Don't put ice on damaged tissue. Don't take Ibuprofen to reduce swelling.</p>
<p>Instead, use active motion to push white blood cells and other dead cells into your lymphatic system once they've done their thing. You can start active motion literally as soon as you are injured.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have had a few accidents over the years involving various ligaments and tendons. The first one was in my hand and I did the usual - ice, NSAIDs, immobilize (hand surgeon splinted it with a cast molded to my hand) - and it took forever and tons of occupational therapy to heal. And even two years later, I still have occasional pain.
During that time, I read up on various research on ligament injuries to see if I could have done things differently. I decided that although inconclusive, more research points to anti-inflammatories and ice either being not efficacious or may potentially cause more harm. Incidentally, traditional eastern medicine (both Chinese and Ayurvedic) is also against icing injuries.
A couple of years later, I ruptured a couple of tendons in my ankle and I decided to skip NSAIDs, skip ice. I compressed it for the first 12 hours straight, then started mobilizing it as much as can be tolerated a few times a day and kept compression in between sessions. I went to physical therapy as soon as I could and it healed in no time at all. This is obviously anedoctal, but next time I get a ligamentous or tendinous injury, I'm definitely following the same protocol.
I do occasionally take NSAIDs for a bad headache that cannot be relieved with other means. In general I do try to avoid NSAIDs because they do have side effects.
By the way, I started pilates last year and it's really helped with all joint pain and injury prevention. </p></div>		</li>
