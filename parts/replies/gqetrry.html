			<div class="markdown"><p>Small addendum to an otherwise great summation:</p>
<p>Salt is better at ice removal from roads than dirt because it disrupts the hydrogen bonding of water molecules in the ice lattice. This means that the ice will melt at much lower temperatures than it would otherwise, will naturally melt into more easily scraped up chunks once melting begins, and just generally make road clean up easier.</p>
<p>Sand just makes the road temporarily less slippery. </p>
<p>Like most modern conveniences, a replacement in kind would be hard to find at a fraction of the cost.</p></div>		</li>
