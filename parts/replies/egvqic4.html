			<div class="markdown"><p>Some day there's gonna be a sly ad campaign like: &quot;Brand X says it kills 99% of bacteria? Well Brand Y kills <em>100%</em> of bacteria it comes into contact with! Buy Brand Y!&quot; And then today's 99% wording will disappear from all brands forever. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a common type of advertising.</p>
<p>In the early 20th century a new kind of salmon came on the market: canned white salmon. Consumers didn't buy it because they were used to salmon being pink, so the manufacturer used the slogan &quot;Doesn't turn pink in the can!&quot;</p>
<p>Of course, it <em>doesn't</em> turn pink in the can, but neither does pink tuna. It's deceptive while being totally honest. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reminds me of during the y2k scare people were afraid of computers going haywire. One manufacturer added stickers to them that said &quot;Y2K compliant.&quot; All the computers already were, but the ones that had the stickers sold more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always thought it was more to do with not being able to say 100% because they could be held liable if someone used it and then still had bacteria in their mouth because they did it wrong? You never see &quot;kills 100% of germs!&quot; and I'm pretty sure that's not because they haven't thought of it.. ;) </p></div>		</li>
