			<div class="markdown"><p>When I studied Japanese, I at first thought it was silly that other students were learning to say &quot;etto&quot; and &quot;ano&quot; because it usually came out as &quot;watashi wa umm... I mean etto... um...,&quot; and so on. But then I heard a French person dropping the <em>euuuuuuuh</em> in the middle of English (and also the middle of Japanese) and I realized just how jarring the wrong kind of &quot;um&quot; is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you learn Finnish, they teach that <code>totta</code> means true, and it's used often as an affirmative response: <code>totta, on</code> &quot;Yes, that's true&quot; , <code>totta kai</code> &quot;Of course&quot;. </p>
<p>However they don't teach you that the word for &quot;um&quot; is <code>tota</code>, which sounds very similar. So you hear people saying, &quot;So, true... what were you thinking?&quot; or &quot;This is like, truly... a big problem&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>(The turkish version is &quot;eee&quot;, pronounced like &quot;ehhhhh&quot;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One time I was at a grocery store checking out and in one of the checkout lanes was a lady and a much older lady (I think her mother) having some sort of issue with their transaction. They were trying to talk to the cashier about it; and the older lady was pointing out something on check out monitor. They were talking to each other in Chinese, which I speak. The younger lady was trying to figure out exactly what the older lady was trying to point out. The older lady obviously didn't know the English word for the item, and so she kept saying ni ga, ni ga, ni ga (which could also translate into &quot;that one&quot;). The cashier, who was black, whipped his head around so fast and gave her the most WTF look ever.</p></div>		</li>
