			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, yes, and yes.  Less regulation of climate generally means more unpredictable and extreme events.</p>
<p>E.g. It may become very turbulent and difficult to travel by plane.  Global connection between communities will look very different... expect to see more at-home and community sustainability to overcome the problems created by today's societies.  The highway from Vancouver to Calgary used to be viable without snow tires 4 months of the year as of 1 year ago.  This is no longer true as the highway was snowed in on June 2.  Edmonton and Calgary have been seeing summer snow for the last 5 years.</p>
<p>Dependent and connected ecosystems may break down and change... which is usually fine over millions of years, but not 20.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There previously weren't a lot of tropical storms in the southern hemisphere. However they've recently become more common, including the only reliable record of a hurricane.</p>
<p>Yay, global warming in effect.</p>
