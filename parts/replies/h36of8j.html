			<div class="markdown"><p>I too am <em>just</em> old enough to recollect the national rollout of 911, and a large part of the public campaign was the show “Rescue 911”, hosted by William Shatner, that dramatized situations where people called emergency rescue services to save people.</p>
<p>Kind of a stupid premise in retrospect but I know a lot of people who went into EMS because of the show, it really heightened the awareness of rescue services as an exciting way to help your community for people who didn’t come from police families.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mom (and by default I) watched that show religiously. I think it is also the reason I have an extremely difficult time listening to 911 audio released for whatever reason. Hearing the chaos, people screaming, terrified, I just can't do it. I'm too sensitive to the suffering of others.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When you bought a new phone you were supposed to fill these things out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Minor nit: Until the 70's, you couldn't buy a phone. They all belonged to AT&amp;T, and you merely rented them. If you wanted more phones in your house, you paid more. If somehow you obtained a black market (or stolen) phone, they had ways of testing to see how many phones were detected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Phones got their power from the phone company, you used to have to do math to make sure you didn't have too many phones for the amount of power supplied to your house.  That's one way they knew how many phones you had.  Cordless phones helped because they had their own power.  I am sure there is somebody that knows this part better than me!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Landline phones had a REN (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringer_equivalence_number" target="_blank">Ringer Equivalence Number</a>) that represented the amount of load they put on the system. Older analog phones had a higher number then electronic ones as REN was just an intrinsic characteristic of the phone's design.</p>
<p>While I don't doubt Bell/AT&amp;T would charge more for more devices, it was also an engineering necessity to make sure the system remained balanced and operated within specs.</p>
<p>I don't know (I was never in the industry) but I suspect that the proliferation of newer electronic phones with more variety in REN would have made it more difficult to track the count and this might have led to the abandoning of any per-device fees.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems like I remember hearing a few years back that there were STILL people renting landline phones from AT&amp;T. That scheme went on much longer than anyone would think because many people were either too lazy or too scared of technology to go out and purchase a $20 phone and hook it up. Hell for all I know there's some older folks that are still paying phone rental fees to AT&amp;T even as they try to abandon POTS lines as fast as possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And adding onto this.... calling from a cell phone still isn't perfect, especially near borders. I witnessed an accident right st the border of a town and county, called 911 and was told I call the wrong center and was hung up on since I was technically still in county &quot;A&quot; but it was routed to &quot;B&quot; -- had to google the direct numbers, which took forever to figure out. Luckily the injuries weren't life threatening. Firefighters/ambulance showed up and didn't make a stink about if they were the right ones to call, but the police took over an hour to get there because they weren't sure, then another hour for the other precinct to come so he can not help make a decision. Shit was ridiculous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Glad that EMS got out quickly. Police can sometimes take a longer time as they have to assign the correct department. Local police officers that cover a town only have jurisdiction up to 100 feet outside their border. So if they cover a town it’s really only that town. EMS are usually credentialed to work on the county level as Advanced Life Support providers or the state as Basic Life Support providers. The agency is often the most limiting factor on where they can go according to their “Certificate of Need.” All of the information above is true for New York State.</p></div>		</li>

I've seen it happen several times when I live there. But they always just transferred you to the right place. But there was often some confusion in the beginning as you tried to explain that you were not in Port Angeles and are in fact in Canada lol</p></div>		</li>
