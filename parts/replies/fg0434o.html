			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best answer, OP. I was looking for someone to mention this model.</p>
<p>Pure exponential growth is only valid when the disease first begins spreading. For most diseases people who have recovered from the disease are no longer susceptible (at least for a while). The SIR model takes this into account.</p>
<p>Importantly, the SIR model predicts that even for diseases with a very high R0 and no external barriers to disease spreads, there will always be a population of people who never get the disease purely through chance.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.public.asu.edu/~hnesse/classes/sir.html?Alpha=3&amp;Beta=1&amp;initialS=100&amp;initialI=1&amp;initialR=0&amp;iters=10" target="_blank">Here</a> is a webpage that lets you calculate a simple SIR model. On this website, R0 = (beta / gamma). If you use the parameters beta=3, gamma = 1 you will find the model predicts \~5% of people are never infected.</p>
<p>Of course, external factors such as quarantines can also affect the effective R0.</p></div>		</li>
