<p>As a surgeon in a high-risk field, a significant amount of my day is making judgements on risk and patient selection. One of the most critical things I do happens BEFORE i get in the operating room...Deciding who gets an operation and who doesnâ€™t. That is the difference between life and death for these patients in many circumstances. </p></div>		</li>
