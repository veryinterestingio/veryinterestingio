			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the real answer here.  It's just an artifact of the older services they are taking over for, which in turn came form two very different forms of production and distribution.  There's no reason for it now, but we humans are creatures of tradition and habit, so these odd artifacts are all over the place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Phish turned copyright stuff on its head with their instant release of their shows in 2003. When they played a cover they had to get the rights to release those songs immediately because the shows were being released the night of the performance. It led to a kind of gentleman's agreement at first where Phish could release their shows with covers and get the copyright stuff straightened out later.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In the US, 17 USC 115 is a compulsory license for performances of musical compositions.  Radio broadcast is a public performance of a composition.  Having a few friends over to listen to a record at your house would not be a public performance.  At the point where you start letting a lot of people listen, it becomes public performance.  </p>
<p>Section 115 was later modified to add digital delivery.</p>
<p>For historical reasons, the law gives two copyrights to a song - the musical composition (i.e., notes and lyrics) and the sound recording of the performance of that song.  Sound recordings were not subject to (federal) copyright before 1972.</p>
<p>Sections 112 and 114 are about sound recordings, and they expressly address streaming.</p>
<p>The whole point of this is that it is a combination of longstanding practice AND the law that results in the current state of streaming services, where music (e.g., spotify, pandora, iTMS) are much different than Netflix, HBO, Amazon Prime Video, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually pre-radio.  It used to be that the <em>only</em> way to listen to music was live performance, so it was necessary for people to be able to use copyrighted music without asking for permission first.  So copyright laws have mechanisms that allow people to automatically obtain a license for the content - which means it can't be exclusive.</p></div>		</li>
