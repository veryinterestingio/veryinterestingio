Then add to a larger quantity of hot liquid and it will mix just fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cocoa mixes into liquids just fine, but it doesn't dissolve. After 20 min or so, it's all just settled to the bottom of the cup. So you gotta mix the cup again</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, unless you use some emulsifiers. Personally, I prefer a traditional cocoa recipe -- dark cocoa powder, some sugar &amp; salt.  Mix with a small amount of hot water in a hot pan and make a &quot;roux&quot; with a whisk.  Then once it's well-mixed &amp; steaming, add milk.  Then heat til your preferred temperature.  If you let it sit for 20 minutes it might settle some, but you certainly shouldn't let a proper hot cocoa sit for that long cause it'll be both cold and precipitated.</p></div>		</li>
