			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in manual labour (bricklayer, very physically demanding and of course super sweaty work boots everyday). I've been applying solution with a brush for months and months now and it just seems to be getting worse. Would you have any tips besides wool socks for this situation? Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your feet need to be dry. Wear thick wool socks and if you overwhelm them, change them. Having dry feet all the time is key. Be very sure to dry them thoroughly after washing them. </p>
<p>If your work boots don’t breathe at all that may be a problem. They are probably moist with sweat. Leather holds water for ages. Get a pair to swap or boot warmers to completely dry them out overnight.</p></div>		</li>
