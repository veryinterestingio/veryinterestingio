			<div class="markdown"><p>Paleo-DNA studies piece together fragments, we don't get to see a full karyotype, that is, the full set of chromosomes. Also, even if we could, we'd have not remotely enough samples. And, lastly, as has been said in other comments, trisomies are not hereditary, so there is no reason to assume so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand, Down Syndrome is sporadic; not hereditary (my OB told me this when I was pregnant, but she also told me having my water broken didn’t hurt and that sex was supposed to, so I’m not 100% on this)</p>
<p>If it were the other way around, it likely would’ve died out thousands of years ago. Down syndrome often causes heart defects which can be fatal in the first few days of life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't been able to find a single source claiming trisomy 21 in great apes. The closest I've found is <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-4246286/amp/Meet-Kanako-24-year-old-chimp-syndrome.html" target="_blank">trisomy 22 in chimps</a> which would place them squarely in that first category of &quot;similar to downs syndrome&quot; that you mentioned in your first sentence. The &quot;except for great apes&quot; bit seems to be false</p>
<p>Edit: Dude edited his post after I posted my link. Prior claim was that apes could also have trisomy 21...</p></div>		</li>
