			<div class="markdown"><p>Even the words &quot;workplace safety&quot; and &quot;table saw&quot; in the same comment give me the heebie jeebies.</p>
<p>Then again, at least there are some regulations that apply in the workplace - half an hour on &quot;maker&quot; youtube channels is enough to put anyone off even being in the same room as a table saw: some of the stupid things you see are beyond belief</p>
<p>My personal favourites are people leaning over running, un-guarded blades to &quot;flick&quot; small work pieces away from the blade so that they can pick them up. Almost invariably after pushing a 2&quot; wide work piece through without a push stick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>May i ask a follow-up question? How is pain, ache and itchyness sensed differently? What is different in their mechanisms so that we feel them, well, <em>that</em> way?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's two parts to that. One, they activate different parts of the brain and are therefore interpreted differently. Two, we as humans developed our own system for defining pain in human terms that sort of muddles the process. </p>
<p>The ELI5 is that we have two types of nerve fibers that carry those signals to our brain- one high speed (Type A) and one low speed (Type C). This is why sudden injuries like stubbing your toe results in an initial sharp pain and then a wave of much greater pain after a second or two- that's the two signals hitting your brain one after the other. </p>
<p>When the signal gets to your brain, it's analyzed and interpreted within the cerebral cortex, and from there it might go on to activate other areas associated with pain, or be interpreted as something else, like a harmless itch.</p>
<p>Itching is the nerve firing off little impulses that aren't indicating an injury or threat, so we feel that itchiness but not the unpleasantness of pain. </p>
<p>Pain tells us there has been an injury to the body, and we respond accordingly depending on the injury. </p>
<p>Aching is just long term chronic pain, where the body actually blunts the pain signals coming in along that nerve track, as well as some other changes within the brain that are still being researched.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One factor to consider is that one purpose of itching is to compel scratching which in turn induced vasodilation. Since the surface of skin, the epidermal layers, has an insufficient blood supply to move enough blood and lymphatic flow on its own quickly, scratching speeds up vasodilation. Improved blood flow brings in white cells to attack toxins and pathogens to speed up healing. This is why your skin turns red when you scratch....the intended physiological result</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answers! Thank you. I have a question. Why do people that get hurt, mostly guys, get up and run around in circles like they are 'running it off'?  This has always amused me.  I prefer the method of just sitting there silently cussing, and holding the injured limb.</p></div>		</li>
