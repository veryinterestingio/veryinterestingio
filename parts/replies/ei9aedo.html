			<div class="markdown"><p>There's the theory that New York City does have as many rats as it has citizens (8.5 million). But nobody actually knows how many rats there are exactly. One statistician proposed to take 10.000 rats, color them with a certain dye and release them into the city. After some time has passed you catch a certain number of wild rats again. At this point it's possible to calculate how many rats there are in total from the difference of colored/uncolored rats you've catched. </p>
<p>Theoretically it would have worked. However there was a problem. &quot;The city of New York wouldn't allow releasing 10.000 rats into the city&quot; said the statistician. &quot;I know because I asked them.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the only way you could get an accurate count would be if you caught the 10000 rats in the city before you marked them—otherwise their survival rate would be dramatically lower and you wouldn’t get an accurate count. So you wouldn’t really be adding rats per se.</p>
<p>But I don’t know how you go about catching 10,000 live rats, even in NYC.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That could also introduce additional bias, particularly if the rats were caught again the same way. Those first rats could be either more of less likely to be caught again because either a) they are more predisposed to be caught due to friendliness, food focus or stupidity or b) less likely to be caught because they have seen the trap before.</p>
<p>If your just counting them afterwards then that is also an issue as the colour would need to be immediately obvious, and you are more likely to spot a pink or red rat than a brown one</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lots of people eat lots of rabbits. Americans don't eat many rabbits but I've seen it on menus across mainland Europe. It isn't the tastiest animal though so if beef is affordable you may as well eat beef. But in areas with less beef on the table rabbit makes a lot of sense. It's super common in Sub-Saharan Africa.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's what I never understood about Australia. Instead of eating rabbits and selling their hides and stuff, they messed up the ecosystem worse by infecting them with diseases. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember about 10 years ago people  proposed it should be national kill a rat day.  It was the day the rat population overtook the human population and if everyone killed 1 rat on that day it would be our last chance to get them all.  Theres no way there are billion rats in the UK, but I imagine there's a lot because of all the takeaway-droppings drunks.  </p></div>		</li>
