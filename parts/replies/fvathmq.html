			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. Have been doing choir for 11 years and your body gets used to standing with good posture. Slouching feels weird now. I also have debilitating back problems for unknown reasons though so idk how that relates but ¯_(ツ)_/¯</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on how you view posture. Most people will only look at the shoulders and the back/spinal alignment. But the positioning of the hips also play a role, often people will &quot;tilt&quot; their hips in, which can &quot;switch off&quot; stabilization muscles. Not saying this is whats happening, but it's a possibility.</p></div>		</li>
