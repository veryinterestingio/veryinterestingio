			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah right. CPAP and APAP are expensive as fuck. I need an APAP for my sleep apnea and my insurance essentially laughed at me and said to fuck off that they wouldn't pay for it. Then I called to check pricing with the place the doc sent my prescription and that call essentially shot all hopes of me pursuing one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same! I think the op hasn’t heard of sleep apnea. I can’t sleep without my CPAP because I’ll wake myself up with snoring</p></div>		</li>
