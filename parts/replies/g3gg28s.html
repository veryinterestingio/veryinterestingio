			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also one of the reasons ships have several anchors! Though they also have them in case of rough seas and one isn't enough to keep them still.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>US Navy ships usually have 2 anchor systems, the chain will be over 1000 feet, each link weighs about 136 pounds.</p>
<p>Each &quot;shot&quot; of chain is 60 feet and a few links between them are painted white in different numbers so the operator can count how much chain is let out.</p>
<p>The second to last shot is completely painted yellow, the last shot is painted red.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to regulations sea ships need at least 2 anchors, on port and starboard side. Most river ships also have a anchor on the aft of the ship.</p>
<p>Also the chain of the anchor weighs a lot more than the anchor itself.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but only as a last resort. They will maneuver a ship around and try different angles when pulling up anchor to jostle it loose, and only if it is well and truly stuck or likely to cause the vessel to become a hazard/pose a hazard to the vessel itself will they cut the anchor.</p>
<p>Retrieving it is a logistical challenge and an expense; the ship's insurers will have to be involved, they need to send down a diver and call in a salvage ship to return the anchor to its ship.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And sometimes they can't find it easily.  there's that big US military ship that had a capstan brake failure during anchor raising and lost the whole anchor and chain in a harbour.  The chain was so heavy it sank into the muck, and while I'm sure they could probably find it with magnetic anomaly gear, that muck could make just finding the end so it can be recovered a logistical nightmare.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>capstan brake failure.  Funny as hell to hear about, terrifying in person.  Ever play 'crack the whip'?  the end of that chain was going hellaciously fast and could have sheared off parts as it came through.  That's why all those sailors at the end were running for cover.  Anyone in the chain locker was gone even faster--an anchor chain can cut you in half without slowing down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You missed an important aspect. An anchor by itself is awful and will displace as currents or wind conditions change. Anchor chain does much of the work. This is why you have to lay out more chain in strong currents or windy conditions than in moderate situations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always pictured the chain as only helping to orient the anchor so it can dig in.  If the wind or current is strong isn't the chain going to be displaced and turn as well?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you lay out enough, no. I’m not sure for large ships, but for small boats (40 feet) you lay out 3-4 times the depth in mild conditions and 7-10 times the depth in bad conditions. That’s a lot of chain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Youre %100 right.</p>
<p>Youre just putting more chain to get better leverage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct. If the boat swivels 180 degrees the force can pull out the anchor and then it will reseat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it really the chain making all the work, or is it that simply using more chain means the angle at which the boat pulls on the anchor is shallower, therefore ensuring the anchor offers the maximum resistance ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Beyond 4 to 1 (chain length to depth), there should pretty much always be some chain laying on the bottom. So, the angle is the same after that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding was the primary reason to the anchor was to hold the chain in place when they start laying down chain to prevent it from moving too much. Then when enough chain hits the floor, that is the primary force holding the ship.</p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RusstyDog" target="_blank">RusstyDog</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a mix. The angle helps with drag like you said, then the weight of the chain helps keep the boat still once it stops.</p></div>		</li>
