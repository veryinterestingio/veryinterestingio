			<div class="markdown"><p>Now we can do things like send a probe and time the signal transmission, or use a radio burst and measure the reflection, but parallax is a good tool for things farther than we can send probes or radio transmissions, especially with modern telescopes, gps, and error calculations.  The problem they had back then was that the accuracy of the input measurements was limited, so their estimates had larger error.  Over time we’ve refined measurement of all the intermediate steps and made the whole process a lot more accurate </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a good way of measuring distances that are not too far away (ESA's Gaia telescope can measure up to tens of thousands of light years using it). If you want to go to bigger distances, then you need to use other methods, usually based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift" target="_blank">redshift</a> of stars of which we know their expected color and intensity (these are called &quot;standard candle&quot;). You have a full overview of these things <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_distance_ladder" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Standard candles aren't just stars either.  Standard Candles are a class of objects including Type 1a supernovae and Cepheid variable stars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. An interesting article from the LCO <a href="https://lco.global/spacebook/parallax-and-distance-measurement/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>We even use the <a href="https://www.windows2universe.org/earth/Atmosphere/tornado/doppler_effect.html&amp;edu=high" target="_blank">Doppler effect</a> from 1842 (all emitted waves from sources coming towards us tend to get squished, and waves from sources moving away from us tend to get stretched) to look at the red and blue shifting of light to work out roughly how fast objects are moving towards and away from us. <a href="https://wwwee.ee.bgu.ac.il/~censor/RadioScience/Radio-Science-fact-fiction-approximation.pdf" target="_blank">Interesting article about the generalized application of the doppler effect (warning old formatting)</a>. </p>
<p>My follow up question for people who know more about the topic - does the inflation of space affect red shift and how can we prove/disprove it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Expansion of space is <em>why</em> we can use redshift to measure distance to far away objects.</p>
<p>The farther away they are, the faster they are moving away from us due to expansion, and thus the more red-shifted they appear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you look at something 2 inches from your face your eyes are not looking in the same direction. The left eye is looking right and the right eye is looking left.</p>
<p>As you move an object farther from your face the direction your eyes are pointing gets closer to parallel.</p>
<p>But the tiny degree that they are still <em>not</em> parallel can be measured, and is called parallax.</p>
<p>And if you know how far apart your eyes are, and how much <em>not</em> parallel they are, you can calculate how far away things are.</p>
<p>This is why predators have two eyes on the front of their heads. Your brain uses the slightly different image from each eye to estimate the parallax angle, giving you depth perception.</p>
<p>Replace your eyes with giant telescopes in different countries and now the earth has depth perception when looking at stars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While looking at something far away, hold your index finger in front of your nose. Now close your left eye, then open it and close your right eye. Your index finger appears to be in a very different place depending on which eye you have open.</p>
<p>Now, again keeping a distant object in focus, extend your arm so your index finger is at arm's length, and do the same thing. Your finger still appears to be in different positions, but the difference is much less.</p>
<p>Take some measurements of how far apart your eyes are and the change in apparent position of your finger with each eye open, and you can use some <a href="http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/t/trigonometric+parallax" target="_blank">simple trigonometry</a> to calculate how far away your finger is.</p>
<p>When measuring the distance of a star from us, your left eye is a telescope in June, your right eye is a telescope in December, your finger is the target star, and the distant object is the &quot;fixed stars&quot;, stars that are so far away that they don't appear to change position, just as a distant mountain appears to be in the same place no matter which eye you look at it through. (The mountain and the fixed stars do change position, just by a very tiny amount.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Parallax can be thought of as the measure of difference/displacement in the apparent possition of an object as viewed from two  different points in space, imagine sitting in a car/train and observing a tree close to the moving object and a distant hill behind the tree, the observation of how much one moves &quot;faster&quot; than the other  encodes the information about  the relative distances the two objects are from the observer. </p></div>		</li>
