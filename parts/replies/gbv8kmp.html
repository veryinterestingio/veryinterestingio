			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting. I might have to try wine again in my 30s then... I have heard that when introducing babies to baby food, you should start with the vegetable ones before introducing the fruit. Getting them used to the flavor of it early on helps them not reject it after having the sweeter fruit flavors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is how I went from despising olives as a kid to adoring them now. Tried wine again recently and while I still diddnt enjoy it, it wasn't just immediately burning bitter disgusting like it was, and I could actually taste the flavour through it, so I expect I'll like it in time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true, I believe - but what is also true is western culture specifically <em>creates</em> this as well. </p>
<p>Look at other cultures, so many children eat vegetables, slightly spicy foods and not so many sweets. It's our food culture teaching our children to &quot;hate&quot; broccoli and love sugar. </p>
<p>Indian children (curry), Korean (kimchi), Chinese (tofu) and others all give their children a much healthier array of vegetables, legumes, fruits and grains than we do in America.
Unsurprisingly.</p>
<p>Look here for a fun example: <a href="https://time.com/what-kids-eat-around-the-world-in-one-week/" target="_blank">https://time.com/what-kids-eat-around-the-world-in-one-week/</a>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m really glad to see someone touched on bitterness here! </p>
<p>Many green leafy vegetables (and some vegetables in general) have a bitter aspect to their flavor. Bitterness is strongly associated with poisonous / toxic compounds that can be found in what we may view as food. Our tendency to avoid bitter foods (like vegetables) is associated with our natural instinct to not consume food that may be poisonous / toxic. </p>
<p>It’s admittedly opinion, but I feel strongly that (at least in small part) what makes it difficult for some adults to stomach eating green vegetables is their not having consumed them consistently as children. Their brains simply weren’t wired from a young age to understand that broccoli = safe food. Other aspects of diet VERY clearly play into this, but I’m confident this is at the root of the issue as well.</p></div>		</li>
