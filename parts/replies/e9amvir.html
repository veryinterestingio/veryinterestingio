			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi there – this is Kristen Leppert, certified genetic counselor at the Johns Hopkins Hospital.  I provide prenatal and preconception genetic counseling, and have joined the team to try and answer your question.  You are right - we can see mental health and psychiatric conditions clustering in families and know that there is a genetic component.  However, psychiatric conditions are very complex - there are many contributory genes, as well as other factors (such as environmental influences), which are known to have an impact on whether or not a person will develop a psychiatric condition.  While potential susceptibility genes for psychiatric disorders have been identified, it is often difficult to identify a single gene for most families with these conditions. The large majority of these conditions are thought of as being <em>multifactorial</em> – that is, due to multiple factors, including genetics, environment, and random chance.  We do recognize that, similar to other genetic conditions such as hereditary cancer syndromes, a small number of families may have a single gene cause.  As you probably know, there are currently many researchers who study these conditions, and as we learn more about the genes associated with them, we may be able to offer more patients clinical diagnostic testing for mental illnesses after pretest genetic counseling.  </p>
<p>If someone has a strong family history of mental health concerns, his or her risk to develop a psychiatric condition may be higher than general population due to the shared genetic and environmental factors within the family; however, DNA is not destiny in most cases!  The number of neuropsychiatric conditions is numerous and broad (ADHD, Parkinson’s, depression, schizophrenia).  If there are people in a family with one or more of these diagnoses, seeing a genetic counselor may help determine if your family could have a single gene cause or a multifactorial cause.  Hopefully in the future, we will have a better understanding of the biological mechanisms that underlie mental illness. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was an interesting question.  I look forward to the day when psychiatry and genetics merge under a broader scope.  With the rise of AI, I imagine we will be able to help heal and shape people in a much more holistic approach.  I hope we, as a people, are able to use such information wisely.</p></div>		</li>
