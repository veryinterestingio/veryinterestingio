			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you explain what you mean by ‘measure a distance’ since at this scale we’re presumably not talking about measurement in the same way the word is normally used. (we’re not putting a 10-Planck-length ruler against it and counting off 7 Planck-lengths)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to clarify a little, light/photons would be used to measure size/position. The smaller the wavelength of light, the higher the energy of the photon. The exact equation is L=h<em>c/E where L is wavelength, h is planks constant, c is the speed of light, and E is the energy. Additionally the energy that needs to be concentrated in a radius r required to create a black hole is E=(r</em>c^4)  /(2G)  where G is the gravitational constant. When the wavelength is the plank length, the energy is sufficient to form a black hole. Adding more energy then doesn't make a smaller wavelength photon, but instead a larger black hole, so you wouldn't be able to measure smaller sizes. There's some 2*pis in there as well but that's the general speculation, we've never made photons anywhere near that energy but that's the thought.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We're still talking about SI scales, as you always need a reference to <em>something</em> when making measurements. Planck Length is about believed to be 1.616255(18)×10^−35 m</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand that we still use SI units, but when you said ‘to measure a length of distance precisely’ what are scientist actually doing in order to measure that length that requires pushing a lot of energy into the measured space?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting that the Planck Length is the same order of magnitude to a hydrogen atom (approx 1x10^-10m) as a hydrogen atom is to a light year (approx 1x10^15).  </p>
<p>In other words, as many Plancks fit into a hydrogen atom as hydrogen atoms fit into a light year.  Approximately.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is definitely true, but it's only part of the explanation and one that I found particularly difficult to understand back in my undergrad years. I will add my explanation below, not saying that it's better than yours!!</p>
<p>The Planck length actually comes from a set of units called the Planck units. They are formed by getting all the upper and lower limits of the universe (speed of light, gravitational constant, etc) and jumbling these up to get a new set of units which are the smallest <em>useful</em> measures to get.</p>
<p>So basically the speed of light is about 300 000 000 meters per second, but it's 1 &quot;planck length&quot; per &quot;planck time&quot;.
Going a shorter distance than a planck length would be of no use at all, since even light would need less than a planck time to travel that far and  therefore it's impossible to measure.</p>
<p>The ELI15 is that the universe exists of a few fundamental constants, namely c, G, h(bar), k_b.
The Planck units are a set of units of length, time (actually frequency, but that's 1/time), energy etc. that normalize the fundamental constants to 1. The Planck length is one of these, but it's not the only one and kind of useless to discuss it without another one like the Planck time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is a bit of a circular argument. Planck time is defined based on Planck lengths and c. You can't explain the Plank length by saying &quot; light would need less than a planck time to travel that [short of a distance]&quot; , because the plank time is literally derived from plank length. If the plank length were smaller, then plank time would also be smaller. So the size of the plank length is dependent on other factors, which is what OP needs to be explained.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But it <strong>is</strong> a circular argument. Planck length is defined as the distance light travels in 1 planck time. That's why I said that one is meaningless without the other. It basically uses 4 physical constants to find 4 equations for the Planck units.</p></div>		</li>
