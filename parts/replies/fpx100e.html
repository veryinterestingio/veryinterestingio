			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to ask how much toxin it takes before you should be concerned. I can find nothing through Google search because it is obfuscated with irrelevant articles about preserving food. I've eaten day old pizza before many times. And how do I know how long is too long? Does it require lab testing of the specific sample due to variation or is it mostly the same for similar specimens?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The pizza is probably because pizza usually tends to dry out as it sits. Mold and bacteria need a certain amount of moisture in order to reproduce and thrive, so drier foods are safer. This is why foods like jerky, honey and rice can last so long, there's not enough moisture for the fungi/bacteria to grow. Pizza tends to be a dry brick after lying out, so bacteria can't do much to it.</p></div>		</li>
