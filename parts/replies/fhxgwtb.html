			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yeah, that's a good point. I forgot to consider entropy/enthalpy of mixing. <em>In general</em>, though, this does work so long as you have enough other information to construct &amp; solve a full ΔG inequality, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ya. Sorry if I caused any confusion, looking back I see this conversation is more about gaseous and liquid interactions ( edit: or things like combustion and electrolytic). Also your right with your previous comment on <em>spontaneous</em>. </p>
<p>Edit: If it’s spontaneous what you said is a general rule. </p>
<p>I work with solids where you can have two phases mixing even if the enthalpy is unfavorable; in these cases you get a (solid) phase separation. Unlike general liquids and gases though, the solid might not visibly separate. What happens is with the ‘solid object’ (picture a hunk of metal) you would have two distinct phases (e.g. alpha and beta microstructures). </p>
<p>Didn’t mean to confuse anyone. It’s just an interesting difference of solids and gases/liquids. Really interesting in metals if you’re interested is if you do get liquid and liquid separation and continue to solidify.</p></div>		</li>
