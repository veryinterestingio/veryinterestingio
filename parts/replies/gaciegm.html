			<div class="markdown"><p>While the 100% efficiency of matter-anti matter can't be beat there are processes that allows 40% mass to energy conversion compared to the &quot;tiny&quot; amount of 0.7% of H-H fusion. Dropping mass into the accretion disk of a black hole causes it to heat up to massive temperatures due to friction with other particles which gets radiated away as light. [All of this (pdf)] (<a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~wilkinsd/docs/posters/BlackHolesPoster.pdf" target="_blank">http://web.stanford.edu/~wilkinsd/docs/posters/BlackHolesPoster.pdf</a>) with only regular matter and nothing that would explode if there is an accident like anti-matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A Black Hole engine would also be more efficient than fusion (and is as infeasible as having access to larger amounts of antimatter).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The energy per reaction isn't the issue, its getting the fuel to fuse in any meaningful quantity. The sun gets around this by being big, we have to come up with an alternative if we want to harness fusion on a smaller scale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's cheered me up! So are we - as a ratio of power to weight - more powerful than the sun?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I was comparing volumetric power not per mass, but the Sun's core has a density of about 150g/cm^3 compared to ~1 for us (being mostly water). So that 1m^3 of the Sun weighs about 150 times more than if it was people so we have about 900x the power to weight ratio of the solar core. Of course the Sun has enough fuel to last billions of years compared to us having to eat and breath so its energy to weight ratio is much much great than us.</p></div>		</li>
