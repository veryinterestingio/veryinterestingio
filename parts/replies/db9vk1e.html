			<div class="markdown"><p>I find the descriptions of &quot;playing with matches&quot; to be deceptive. I believe these articles would not use that description if the arsonists were not related to an employee at the Sheriff's department. The &quot;playing with matches&quot; line is being laid down to convince the public it's no big deal to get off with a light sentence.</p>
<p>They were lighting matches and throwing them on the ground while walking in a very dry forest area that was under a publicized no-burn order. As they were doing this, small fires were starting as they walked along. That's intentional and it's absolutely arson. It's not playing with matches at all. Playing with matches is when a child is curious about matches and is lighting them to see what happens. Playing with matches does not extend to intentionally starting forest fires which these teenagers did.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think they'll be getting a light sentence.  14 people died and the damage is estimated at $500 million. Being related to someone at a sheriffs office doesn't get you off the hook when you almost burned down one of the most popular tourist towns in the region. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Polygraphs are pseudo-science bullshit. The police use them to scare people into confessing, but they &quot;catch&quot; a lot of people who just happen to be nervous about the possibility of being falsely convicted.</p>
<p>Fortunately, polygraph results are inadmissible in court, but they should be banned as an investigation tool, because they are useful only for coercion and harassment of suspects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That music video wasn't the arsonists . It was a film students school  project that took a month to shoot. The students contacted authorities  as soon as they realized people were pointing the arson finger at them. They  were cleared  as suspects by the authorities </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm on a local FB crime page and the video was discussed at length. Investigators were forwarded the video and were contacted by the students and cleared. </p>
<p>Emotions were running very high and initially it was thought the video was proof of arson and it got ugly. YouTube stepped in and removed the video. It kept getting reposted, and finally, someone recorded it on their phone before YouTube could bounce it again.  </p>
<p>Those film students were probably scared to death..it's ironic that a stray photo by a hiker captured what is to be believed to be the real culprits. It was my understanding, however, that accelerants were thought to be used?  Someone posted that particular  info on r/knoxville. I'm sure all the facts will come out in due time, though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw the video and do not understand how it took a month to shoot. It was short and looked like key shots from the same day hike. The beginning of the video had the date of the fires in it as well. ? </p>
<p>*not saying it's incriminating, just saying the story you stated doesn't add up</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here is a screenshot of a message I sent to my fianc√© the Sunday after the fire started on Chimney Tops. I can no longer find the video. It has Ben Rosenbush &amp; The Brighton - This Fire song in it, so it keeps getting taken down every time it's uploaded due to copyrights. </p>
