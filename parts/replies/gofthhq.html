			<div class="markdown"><p>Aren’t people who have had transplants always put on immunosuppressants or the transplant will be killed by the immune system? White blood cells are produced in bone marrow, so majority of them would be foreign to the head, thus the head would be the foreign body to reject.</p>
<p>That would be my guess for why it’s a head transplant and not a body transplant</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess it makes sense to the surgeons, because from their point of view, they are cutting off the head, transporting it to different location, and reattaching it to the new one.</p>
<p>I imagine performing body transplant - remove the body from the head, toss it to the side while leaving only the head in place, and then carrying the new body to the right position - would prove to be much more cumbersome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless they do it like that Russian guy 80 years ago. Leave the original head, add a new head. Survived for 4 days. Definitely a head transplant in that case. Those were dogs, but the concept should hold true.</p>
<p>Actually imagine if they put your head on a dog. Would probably not work at all due to biological incompatibility (like blood type) but it could be an altered dog, like the mice that grow human ears. Then it could work. Or imagine if they just did the brain, into a big dog with a skull that could fit it. Would you still get human rights? Could you even prove it was you, if you were stuck in a dog's body, and then dropped off by the mad surgeon at a shelter?</p>
<p>I can imagine some countries making this a punishment for criminals. Death penalty? No no no, that's barbaric. You're a dog now. Here's your shock collar. Time for training.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I will add, that the neurons growing into the limb will end up in a different spot than before, even if the macroscopics nerves were connected correctly. So a sensory neuron from one finger might end up responsible for a new finger, and the brain/patient has to relearn this.</p>
<p>Same with muscle control.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It’d be like taking apart your keyboard, rewiring where each key go’s, then reassembling the keys in the normal place, and having to learn that everything is labeled wrong now.  Everything looks the same to you/your brain, but works differently anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The surgical nerve repair will be done by stitches. </p>
<p>A nerve, in simple terms, is composed of the axon/nerve fiber (which transports nerve signals) and the myelin sheath (which protects the axon).</p>
<p>When reconnecting nerves it's only possible to stitch the sheaths together and not the nerve fibers itself. However, stitching the sheaths together creates a pathway for the new nerve fiber to grow along.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know that this is probably science-fiction now, but would it be possible with the right tools (nano-bots or something?) to actually connect the nerve fiber, or is it impossible anyway and will be necessarily replaced by the host's nerves cells?</p>
<p>And would this work like &quot;instantly&quot; connecting the nerves so the recovery process of taking control of your own new limb wouldn't be needed?</p></div>		</li>
