			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was a kid we had a rabbit.  Rabbit would get fleas.  We'd try to get rid of them, didn't work well.  Carpets would get fleas despite doing many things to keep fleas out of carpet and to get the fleas out of the carpet once they were in it.  My siblings and I would get flea bites.  We got older, rabbit died, new rabbit was gotten, more fleas, more flea bites.</p>
<p>Eventually we got a dog.  Dog got flea medicine once a month (I think his got just a couple drips on the back of neck).  All the bunny fleas and carpet fleas died.  My siblings and I stopped getting flea bites.  The rabbit didn't need the flea medicine because the dog having it was apparently enough to get rid of all the fleas in the house.</p>
<p>I found that absolutely amazing.  The dog barely spent any time in the room the rabbit stayed in, but the dogs medication helped the rabbit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's great, delighted to hear that. Breaking the flea life cycle is so important, glad it worked! (Short version: your dog is &quot;tastier&quot; to fleas than you or your bunnies, so they would be attracted to your dog, climb on your dog, and die.)</p>
<p>(Yes, that's an eli5 version, sorry)</p></div>		</li>

<p>So did the fleas find me and the rabbit equally yummy?</p>
<p>And I'm glad it worked too!  It wasn't something we were trying, it was just a happy accident.  At some point we realized we weren't getting bitten by fleas anymore, and we looked all over the rabbit and she didn't have any, and there weren't any in any of the carpets, and we realized the only recent change was getting a dog (who received flea medicine).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm concerned about the ticks, not the fleas. They are extremely bad where I live and each year they just keep getting worse. Lyme disease is common in people and pets. My neighbor almost died last year because of it.. I have 5 kids and a dog that I absolutely consider my 6th child. A medication that would give me a little peace of mind about their well-being would be a godsend.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The tests simply haven't been done in <em>human</em> safety. It's probably perfectly safe, but the dose for dogs and the dose for people are going to be different. There's no doctor in the world that's going to recommend an un-tested-in-humans medicine, malpractice lawyers would have a field day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, I know that. I'm just wondering why, since lyme disease is such a large concern in a much of the US, they haven't done more testing to determine whether these drugs are safe or not for human consumption.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, many dogs have a routine annual blood screening at their annual health check. It wouldn't be a week after their last oral flea med, but it would be after getting monthly oral flea meds for the previous several months. </p>
<p>If there were significant changes, certainly we would investigate to see if there was an underlying health condition, and if there was no immediate, obvious illness and the blood results were still abnormal, certainly we might consider other, unlikely causes, such as a flea medication.</p>
<p>I mean, we want your pets to live a looooooong time. Last thing i want to do is give them stuff that would hurt them. :)</p></div>		</li>
