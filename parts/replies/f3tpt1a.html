			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a great question, and exactly what we have collectively dedicated years to figuring out! We study zebra finches specifically, and they learn when they are young by forming a memory of the song of their father, then practicing their song until it matches the memory of the father. They have dedicated circuits in their brains to calculate how close or different their song is to the example in their minds. Other songbirds share similar learning systems, but they aren't all exactly the same. Hummingbirds and parrots are other classes of birds that also learn their songs/sounds, but their strategies can be very different from songbirds'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes each species has their own set of calls, songs, noises. Here's just one song: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZXLHNFkJxw" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZXLHNFkJxw</a></p>
<p>Some sing song less often than other species. Some make calls and noises using their own body feathers. Only recently has this kind of noise-making been detailed and filmed. Some species also do this more or less often depending on their mating rituals and other behavior. Some just make short repeated movements[1] others dive in a large loops almost daredevil style [2].  </p>
<p>1.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a male black-chinned hummingbird displaying to a female in a cage. This display is one of two types that this species has, and it is called a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIDX5G1Nh7w#targetText=This%20is%20a%20male%20black,mechanical%20sounds%20with%20his%20wings." target="_blank">shuttle display</a>, where the male flies back and forth in front of the female displaying his colorful throat plumage-patch and making mechanical sounds with his wings</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Male Anna's hummingbirds zoom down at 50 miles per hour from high in the air in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQUkdp9YCpU#targetText=Male%20Anna's%20hummingbirds%20zoom%20down,displays%20in%20suburban%20Portland%2C%20Oregon." target="_blank">dive display</a> to woo females. At the bottom of their dive there's a loud chirp. The sound comes from their tail feathers, not their throats. These are highlights from 30 minutes of dive displays in suburban Portland, Oregon</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fascinating. How does it calculate the distance between its own song and the memory? Since the memory must be encoded in some sort of neural representation, a) does it compute a distance between two representations, and b) are the distance functions the same between different birds?</p>
<p>If not, does the divergence in distance functions follow evolutionary distance?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is an excellent question and a very hot area of research right now! It is hard for us to calculate the distance between two songs, which makes it hard to figure out how the birds are doing this. We know that there are parts of the brain that fire more when the songs are very similar or very different, but we don't know where in the brain or how these 'error signals' are calculated yet. People are looking at what brain areas send information to the areas with 'error signals' to try to work backwards and find this sight of comparison, but that is very much a work in progress.</p></div>		</li>
