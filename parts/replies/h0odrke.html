			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to add as someone who works in construction, at least in Canada if they sit too long as just a wood structure they will mold without any of the outside membranes. I have seen a few builders tear down townhomes due to that. Very rare but it happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We had a disaster when our neighbours discovered our builder’s apprentice had put the measuring tape on the wrong site peg during set out. As a result, our wooden frames and top storey board sat out in the weather for 6 months while we organised what to do. The board was a little mouldy by then, so we clove oiled the whole lot and all the mould died. Everything went ahead after that, as we purchased and subdivided a small bit of the neighbour’s land and kept going rather than ripping it all down. We were very lucky.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OTOH, in slighty  drier climates, there are cases of partially constructed buildings sitting for years without significant damage. I worked for a company that finished a stick frame hotel that sat for five years as a stick frame with a papered roof, in PA.  It was mostly usable. The electricians did say rhat some of the studs were hard as rock and tough to drill.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just want to add, in places without basements the underfloor insulation does go in before you are dried in. We timed it around the weather, which was pretty easy around here. We have about 7 or 8 months where you can count on virtually no rain.</p>
<p>There were a couple where we were caught off guard and had to drape the entire subfloor with plastic sheeting so it didnt seep through and ruin the insulation.</p></div>		</li>
