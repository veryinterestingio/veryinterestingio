			<div class="markdown"><p>An interesting question, in that plants don't have an immune system comparable to that of animals. Probably the best way plants have to stave off invaders is to allow tissues to die in order to prevent spread.</p>
<p>However, there's one oddball parasite known as Pilostyles thurberi. Long ago, it was placed in the Rafflesiaceae due to some similarities in flower, although Pilostyles is much, much smaller than raffles. Anyway- P. thurberi is a real oddball, a <a href="https://www2.palomar.edu/users/warmstrong/plnov99.htm" target="_blank">stem parasite</a> (check about halfway down) that just... pops out of the stem, flowers, and goes away. <a href="https://www2.palomar.edu/users/warmstrong/ploct98.htm" target="_blank">See also.</a></p>
<p>I don't see it in the Palomar web pages, but I seem to recall the parasite is not persistent: individual plants may be parasitized for perhaps 2-3 years, and then individual parasites die. The seeds are tiny and the plants fecund, so whether they can be re-infected or infected from seeds on other plants... I don't know. What I mainly recall is that the host seems to manage to evict the parasite after 2-3 years.</p>
<p>EDIT: There's also striga (witchweed) which is fascinating in its own right. But cotton kills striga: it tricks the seed into germinating, and then somehow the haustorium fails to attach to the root. So in fields infested with striga seed (they are particularly fecund), they rotate through cotton to kill dormant seeds upon germination.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are partially correct in that plants do not have adaptive immune system. However, they have innate immune systems which are similar in many ways to the innate immune systems of animals.
In addition to allowing parts if the plant to die (hypersensitive response), plants can also synthesize a variety of compounds to damage parasitic organisms.
The plant immune system is also not even close to fully understood. There have been huge advances in the field of plant-parasite interaction in just the past 5-10 years. I wouldn't write off the possibility that plants have some kind of adaptive immune system that has not yet been discovered.</p>
<p>Innate immunity plays a role in plant defence against pathogens, insects and parasitic plants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plants can utilize a lot of different defense mechanisms upon infection. They have anti-microbial proteins like defensines and chitinases, can strengthen their cell walls, and destroy their own cells as you said (only if the pathogen is not necrotrophic). In fact, the plant immune system works so well that many pre-treated/primed plants are completely immune to most pathogens. Pathogens almost never try to fight the immune system, but try to evade it altogether. The immune system is usually &quot;off&quot; in plants, as it costs a lot of energy, which is why recognition of the pathogen is so important and is so effective for the pathogen to not be recognized.</p>
<p>Plants recognize pathogens not much different than the innate immune system of animals. They even utilize most of the same pathways (like mapk pathways). They recognize microbial patterns (PAMPs) with pattern-recognition receptors (in plants these include RLPs, RLKs, lectin receptors, etc which have a similar function as TLRs in animals) on the pathogens to activate their immune response.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm assuming that unlike carnivorous plants, parasitic plants won't actually 'consume' or destroy the host (unless the host is already weakened by disease or nutritional deficit, of course)? I mean, plants seem to be engineered for individual survival, rather than genetic propogation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is hard to understand precisely why the interaction between plant parasites and their hosts is not more detrimental. There are examples of desert plants that are heavily parasitized- grossly disproportionate quantities of parasites- which lack roots, and yet the host seems to be trucking along just fine.</p>
<p>Why the host does not suffer from this even though the roots of the desert plant are already providing ALL the water, nutrients, and energy for the host AND the parasites... that is a great mystery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know the strangler figs may actually kill their host, but since it apparently doesn't happen every time,  I'm guessing the host is already weakened as you suggested.</p></div>		</li>
