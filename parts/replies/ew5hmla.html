			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m sure my dr will give me a consultation...luckily it’s the VA, so they don’t have to worry about insurance or anything, they order tests just for anything. Like “oh your wrist is sore? Better get an MRI, X-ray and CT just to be safe..” and it’s nice to have every specialty in one place. I’d just walk down the hall to the pee pee doc</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A catheter can definitely cause a UTI. If you had it for any length of time, you would need bladder training to teach the bladder to hold more before removing the catheter</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It sounds like urine infection, or maybe kidney stones (when they are as small as grains of salt, it gives the sensation of having to pee really bad). Happened to me before. Definetely worth checking with your doctor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We are in the same predicament, dude. I have a massive, 3cm stone in my right kidney that is too big and is positioned too bad to be removed with the usual methods (i.e Lithotripsy). I'm 34 and it could be removed by open surgery, but my doctor says I'm too young to face such risk right now. He says that one day, the stone will move and that I'll have to rush to the hospital. It may happen tomorrow, It may happen in 30 years, It may never happen...</p></div>		</li>
