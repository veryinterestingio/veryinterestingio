			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to stroke your ego, your use of terminology is correct. Just to split hairs and be pedantic, the Founder Effect refers to the decreased genetic diversity that occurs from a colonizing event like the one described above. I'm sure you meant that and therefore this explanation is moot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I take AP bio and we use the terms genetic bottleneck and adaptive radiation interchangeably- do they actually mean the same thing or are we wrong </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are not the same thing; genetic bottleneck means the loss of genetic diversity from population loss, like cheetahs, mountain gorillas, ect; adaptive radiation is where one species becomes many new species by adapting to exploit new niches, like Darwin's finches that all evolved from one ancestral Finch.</p>
<p>Feel free to ask anything else, as I have a degree in Ecology and Evolutionary biology. I remember how stressful AP testing was the first time around. If it makes you feel better IMHO college was much much easier than junior year of high school because you get less busy work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As the other dude replied, yeah they’re different. A lot of the vocabulary in bio is very nuanced in how they differ. Wait till you find out that a lot of genes have ten different names and people use them interchangeably! Or the fact that, for example, Cytotoxic T Cells are also called: CD8+ T Cell, Killer T Cells, Cytolytic T Cells, Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes. </p>
<p>But remember that Natural Killer T Cells are not the same as Killer T Cells or Natural Killer Cells!!! It becomes a nightmare haha but of course it all comes down to what field you go into and most have a most commonly used name (usually in this case people just say CD8+ T Cells because it’s the most clear) </p></div>		</li>
