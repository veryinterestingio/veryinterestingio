			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm working on a Master's in mental health counseling and this is actually something we talk about a lot in my studies. There is a pathogenic approach to health, which is essentially a binary of &quot;sick v. not sick&quot;. By contrast, there is a salutogenic approach to health, which views health/wellness on a continuum, on which there is always room for movement toward greater wellness. I do notice that professionals who deal with physical health are often pathogenically oriented in their work, relative to professionals who deal with mental/emotional health and wellness, who tend to be more salutogenically oriented. (I acknowledge that this is a generalization, based on my own limited sphere of experience!)</p>
<p>I think both approaches have their place, and a good medical practitioner can and should employ both of them. For instance, if someone has a specific malady or issue that they'd like resolved, we often use a pathogenic approach when treating it. Eczema? Apply this steroid cream. Don't want to get pregnant? Fill this script for BC. Cancer? We'll radiate it until there's none. The salutogenic approach applies to anyone, whether or not they have a &quot;malady&quot; or &quot;issue&quot;, and aims to move them to a greater state of wellness. What &quot;greater wellness&quot; looks like also differs from person to person, whereas being positive versus negative for an illness tends to be more standard from person to person.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the excellent summary. Can you explain how the graft can survive for up to two weeks without being connected to blood supply and thus oxygen?
I assume enough O2 diffuses into the tissue?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Grafts cannot survive for two weeks without blood supply, they may survive the first few days without blood supply by a mechanism of diffusion, but afterwards the graft is sustained by the formation of new blood vessels. That is why thin grafts are ideal, otherwise diffusion and revascularization won't occur properly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Surgeon here - have some knowledge but I don't do these surgeries so some of this terminology will be, uh, loosely applied. </p>
<p>What you're describing depends heavily on the thickness of tissue transfer you're doing. A split thickness skin graft is very thin (like hundredths of an inch) and it survives by having nutrients diffuse through it. There are specific conditions that allow for this to happen and care is taken to ensure perfect contact to the recipient wound bed. Any gap can result in graft loss. There have been many studies on how far oxygen actually diffuses through tissue in the absence of functional blood vessels. If the graft survives long enough, it will signal a need for blood supply to surrounding tissues and new blood vessels will grow into the area. </p>
<p>In contrast, a &quot;free flap&quot; will include an actual blood vessel which must be attached to a blood vessel at the recipient site. That means that the surgeon must actually connect the blood vessels by hand. There are also flaps that involve keeping the donor tissue attached to the original blood supply, using clever techniques to move the flap to the recipient spot without damaging the main blood vessel. In these cases, there is no loss of blood supply.  Examples of this are seen in breast reconstruction - look up TRAM flaps or DIEP flaps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We can deal with loosely applied terminology as the complex stuff is usually mind baffling. Now have this vision of someone with a (sterilised) rolling pin from the kitchen pressing down on the graft to ensure its all attached. </p>
<p>As a side note, since we have surgeons on Reddit we can now say we're in high-brow company and look down on those Facebookers. :)</p></div>		</li>
