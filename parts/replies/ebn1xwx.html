<p>A rebreather is related to the chlorate candles above, providing O2 and functions in a narrow range of the water column. Kinda spooky due to O2 toxicity hazards, nothing like seizing at depth.</p>

<p>No, not at all... Rebreathers have an integrated CO2 scrubber, and a metering system to inject gaseous O2 into the air mix. They also typically have a small inert gas cylinder to keep the pressure balanced with ambient. If anything, the more sophisticated units will help keep oxygen toxicity at bay, as they maintain a specific ppO2, rather than maintain the same ratio.</p></div>		</li>
