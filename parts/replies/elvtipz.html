			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading that the proteins mosquitoes inject into a bite to keep it from clotting are also what makes the bite itch, but said proteins also break down under moderate heat.</p>
<p>I don't know enough about mosquitoes to know whether or not that's BS though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every time someone says this somebody else comes along and says &quot;The temperature water needs to get to in order to denature the proteins is hotter than boiling water!&quot; which might be true but every time I get a mosquito bite I put a spoon under hot water for a bit and press it against the bite. Always makes the bite shrink in size and not itch until it's completely gone. Downside to this is I have two bites that actually scarred from doing this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is totally true. For that reason I got a &quot;bite away&quot; electronic device that heats up for a short time and &quot;destroys&quot; the protein of the stings. The itching immediately stops after usage. It is really a lifesaver here in South America at the moment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, I have found the quickest solution for itchy mosquito bites is to rub an ice cube directly on the bite as soon as possible. If possible, I then follow up with an After-Bite product, preferably the stick not a cream, if I can. </p>
<p>I get mosquito bites so bad. I pretty much can’t go outside in the summer without bug spray on or I will get multiple bites in less than 10 minutes. When I get bitten, without touching the bite at all, it will swell up to larger than a US quarter. </p>
<p>FWIW Off Smooth and Dry is my favorite bug spray. It does a decent job (probably not strong enough for deep woods), and it doesn’t leave your skin gross and greasy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in the tropics and have 2 pro tips for you if you’d like. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Scalding water is good at breaking down mosquito bite proteins but a hairdryer is better and simpler.</p>
</li>
<li>Garlic oil works really well as an area repellent. You can mist a whole yard or tent and the smell will not be noticeable to humans after about 10 minutes, but will repel mosquitos for days.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dude I've been saying this since I was a kid who's body was constantly ravaged by mosquitos in the summer. Super hot water on a mosquito bite is borderline orgasmic. Like weak in the knees, addictive, heavy breathing, incredible feeling. Literally better than masturbation, to be honest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like to rip my whole digestive tract out of my body (one smooth motion to avoid any damage).</p>
<p>30 minutes in the oven on high (fan forced is essential) let it cool for a few hours and then just pop it back in. </p>
<p>Oh and I almost forgot, make sure to grease your baking tray. It can be a nightmare to clean afterwards if you don’t</p></div>		</li>
