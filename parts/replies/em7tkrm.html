			<div class="markdown"><p>If you don’t wear your seat belt, it doesn’t really matter what the airbag does, the seatbelt is there to slow you down until the airbag deploys. It also keeps you from being ejected from your seat/vehicle. So whatever the airbag could do to you when it deploys is trivial compared to the injuries you’ll sustain from being decelerated by steering column/windshield/asphalt/etc</p>
<p>Tldr: wear your seatbelt</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is important.  I know someone who worked as a coroner.  One interesting case:  pickup truck ran into a ditch, throwing driver through windshield.  Cause of death:  Pickup then rolled forward and ran over the driver.</p>
<p>Yup.  They ran over themselves with their own pickup truck.</p>
<p>Seatbelts matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally speaking, airbags are really simple, and they deploy the same no matter what so long as the sensor that triggers them triggers them, because they are just a little explosive charge that creates enough exhaust gas to inflate the airbag.</p>
<p>That said, it's certainly possible to create some feature that better times the deployment based on when it would do the most good or better controls the rate of deflation once fully deployed (airbags are designed to deflate as you hit them so the force of you moving forward is spent pressing air out of the bag rather than smashing your face against the steering column- but that also means that if it deploys too early, it could start to deflate before you hit it, and if it deploys too late, it won't be fully inflated yet)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I worked in automotive R&amp;D most driver and passenger front  airbags were 2 stage.  Based on the characteristics of the crash they could deploy one or both charges to account for timing and needed force.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The airbag should automatically take into account the weight of the person as well, and track the head so when you crash it's like getting a sudden hug by a cloud as the little airbags conform exactly to how your body is being thrown in the crash.</p></div>		</li>
