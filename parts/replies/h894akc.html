			<div class="markdown"><p>Japanese uses a mixture of syllabary and Chinese ideograms (kanji). Yes, you <em>can</em> read the syllabary easily as it represents sounds, but no, that doesn’t necessarily help you decipher the kanji. For instance, 読む consists of the kanji 読 and the hiragana syllable む <em>mu</em>. The latter is straight forward to read, the former is not. In fact, the kanji alone has several different readings, and you need to know that in this word it’s <em>yomu</em>. </p>
<p>The hiragana can provide context clues to read the kanji though; e.g. in this case you know the word ends in <em>mu</em>, and based on the sentence you may know it’s probably supposed to be the word “read”, and the kanji contains components about speech (言), so it’s probably the word “to read”, <em>yomu</em>. </p>
<p>Korean Hangul are a straight up phonetic alphabet, with the twist that individual components are put together into compound glyphs. They’re nonetheless entirely phonetic.</p></div>		</li>
