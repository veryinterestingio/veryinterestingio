			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it is truly random. The alternative hypothesis you proposed is party of a family of hypotheses called <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_hidden-variable_theory" target="_blank">local hidden variable theories.</a> </p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell's_theorem" target="_blank">Bell's theorem</a> essentially sets up a situation where it would be impossible for there to be a local, predictable variable and still be consistent with the measured observation/outcome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't generate a truly random number. You have to sample the randomnesses from somewhere. So yeah I'd say there's a difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To answer this, how <em>do</em> we 'generate' numbers? They're not something harvestable, they're not real as such. we have to observe and record a phenomena of some kind to generate the number, whether it be the roll of a die or the decay of an atom. </p>
<p>No, there isn't a distinction between generating and recording a random number.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No it's not. At least not in the sense that the term is usually used. (1)</p>
<p>Bell's theorem shows that no deterministic theory of physics can explain the experimental results of quantum mechanics while also obeying the light speed limit. And we're pretty sure that physics obeys the light speed limit.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>(1) In the many worlds interpretation, the state of the universal wave function in the future follows deterministically from its state in the past. But that doesn't make it any less impossible to predict with certainty whether you will observe a radioactive decay in the next second or not. Because you're constantly splitting into multiple versions of &quot;you&quot;,  and some of these versions will observe a decay in their world, while others won't. You have no way of telling in advance which version you'll end up &quot;being&quot;, if that's even a question that makes any sense, so you can't predict in advance what &quot;you&quot; will observe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That depends on your interpretation of quantum mechanics. Some posit that nature is random in a fundamental sense, some claim the opposite, while others are agnostic about it. Either way, we cannot claim that radioactive decay is &quot;true randomness&quot; until we have some compelling reason to choose the first type of interpretation over the others.</p></div>		</li>
