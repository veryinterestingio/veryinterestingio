			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting questions here!  Before I started my PhD in Statistics at Berkeley, I think I would have agreed with this sentiment -- I suspected that I didn't know enough with only a Bachelor's degree in Statistics + CS to do &quot;sophisticated enough&quot; analyses and that I needed a deeper theoretical understanding to know how to &quot;do the right thing&quot;.</p>
<p>My mindset has shifted a bit, though. The thing about theoretical statistics is that it is basically the treatment of statistics from a purely mathematical point of view, and therefore a lot of theoretical statistics starts off from pretty strong assumptions such as every unit being well-behaved according to a certain distribution and not interfering with each other.  Unfortunately a lot of these assumptions are untestable so even if you do know the theoretical underpinnings of the models, you can't test that the preconditions hold.</p>
<p>That isn't to say that having theoretical knowledge isn't important, though. One important concept I've learned in grad school is that of sensitivity analyses that allow you to test how much the conclusions of your model would change <em>if the assumptions didn't hold</em>, and Peng Ding who I've worked with at Berkeley has done a ton of very impactful work on sensitivity analyses within causal inference. See <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4820664/" target="_blank">here</a> for one of his most impactful publications. Knowing about approaches like this that allow you to test the robustness of your models is part of being a good user of data.</p>
<p>But I would agree that Machine Learning engineers (as opposed to data scientists) benefit more from theoretical understanding, as a lot of their decisions that revolve around what model to use, what features to make, how to tune the model, etc. <em>are</em> very tightly coupled with the theoretical behavior of the model.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm interested in this too. My interest in data science lies more in the mathematical theory of it all, but you don't see this theory brought to the forefront very often. Perhaps because most data scientists don't have math degrees? I'm not sure, really. </p>
<p>Out of curiosity, what research are you doing for your PhD? I'm an undergrad doing research in stochastic topology, and my work involves a fair amount of probability theory.</p></div>		</li>
