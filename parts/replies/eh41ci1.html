			<div class="markdown"><p>Mental health practitioner here, this is actually a very good and accurate description :-)</p>
<p>Edit: some more interesting information because I'm procrastinating work. We don't 100% know how anti depressants actually work. We know they increase certain brain chemicals, and that seems to make people happier, but we don't really know WHY. </p>
<p>Current thoughts is that it's less of a 'putting it back to normal' and more of a 'creating a whole new brain state where its easier to feel happier'. Think of it less like taking insulin in diabetes to replace the insulin that isn't there, and more like getting drunk to change your actual brain state to care less about certain things so you feel better.</p>
<p>Thats why, if you don't look at the source of the problem (with therapy, or just by yourself, like challenging those mean thoughts you have about yourself), once you come off the medication you'll more than likely go back to feeling down again. However, if you do address it, you probably won't. (if it was solely due to 'an imbalance of chemicals' nobody would ever feel OK after coming off medication, since the imbalance would come back). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm trying to decide if I should go back to therapy. I stopped because I felt like I was just whining about something that is no big deal. However I was struck by what you said about coming back down after stopping medication.... I'd stopped medication a couple times, and let's say I crashed back into major depression each time. I'm afraid to try stopping again for fear of the same thing happening, but should I go back to therapy if I can't think of anything to say? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If its a big deal to you, then it's a big deal. Yeah, blah blah blah people have it worse - but that doesn't stop the fact that this is a big deal for YOU and its impacting YOUR life. You should never feel bad for wanting to feel a little better, and therapy can be a step towards that. </p>
<p>However, there's as many different types of therapies and therapists as there are people, and if you feel like you're talking aimlessly and it's not helping, it might actually be time to swap therapy or therapist. Some therapies are a lot less directive and can let people talk and talk and talk without direction (like psychoanalytical therapy) whereas some are much more goal driven and purposeful (cognitive behavioural therapy). Some are more about how you relate to others (cognitive analytical), and some are just about learning to accept your lot in life (acceptance and commitment therapy - commonly used when people have things they cant change like a health problem, or compassion focused therapy). It's all about finding the right fit for you. </p>
<p>A good therapist will help to find out what might help best, although they might not be trained in all types. Also, it doesn't help that different types are popular in different countries, so Americans might have an easier time finding a psychoanalyst compared to a ACT or CFT therapist.</p>
<p>I know you didn't ask for a list of therapies, but sometimes I think it can help to know that just because it didn't work once or twice, doesn't mean there aren't other options. Just, if you've learnt that something doesn't work (or, for example, you struggle to know what to say) remember to mention it to the new therapist so they know where to go! </p></div>		</li>
