<p>Exactly this. Try to predict where a football (American) will bounce when you throw it into the ground. Even with practice it's almost impossible to do so because the shape makes in unpredicatable unless you can consistently throw it with the same force, angle, etc. Do it with a regular ball and it's pretty easy to quickly learn/predict the trajectory.  </p>
<p>Same thing applies for throwing stuff, using the weight you feel from the object and the angle and power you put into the throw, you can predict where it will go. Change it to something that's not aerodynamic (in a way that distorts a normal, expected, trajectory) and it becomes much harder to predict it's path.  </p>
<p>For example, throw a rock, knowing it's weight (how it feels in your hand) and how you throw it, you can fairly accurately predict it's trajectory. Now throw a sheet of paper (not folded in any particular way), you know it won't &quot;fly&quot; like a rock, but good luck predicting exactly where it lands.  </p>
<p>tl;dr - You have lots of practice throwing things which makes it easy to predict where they will go when you throw them (or are trying to catch them). Your brain learns <em>how</em> something will behave when thrown (or when flying through the air). Do it with something that doesn't have a predictable path and you aren't able to predict where it goes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We evolved to do this. Humans have very unusual shoulder architecture compared to the other apes that gives us a unique leverage to throw things with great force and accuracy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The really amazing thing is we're able to do this with pretty much arbitrary objects, so long as we can easily lift it with one hand. Like, literally set someone in a field with misshapen and irregular rocks and branches and stuff and have them pick them up at random and attempt to hit a target. The fact that most people will even get <em>close</em> to the target is unbelievable, but people who throw things more with greater regularity (e.g. athletes in ball-related sports) will probably hit the target more often than they miss.</p>
<p>This is incredible and it's truly unique to our species. Not just the hand-eye coordination required, but the instantaneous measurement of weight and assumptions about aerodynamics which happen as you pick up an object and prepare to throw it, the vision and depth perception to accurately size and position the target in space, and of course the muscular control to exert the requisite forces with millisecond precision. It's unreal that we can do this, but we don't even think it's all that odd since people toss odd bits of crumbled paper into waste baskets all the time.</p>
<p>No other species can do this. No other species even comes close.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I can curve a frisbee pretty good, like throw 10' to the right and it curls back on target. But I get all confused when I throw a baseball 10' away from a friend and wonder why didn't it curve back. </p>
<p>Freaking aerodynamics...</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not exactly. We only measure weight. With the things we typically throw (stones, sticks), aerodynamics don't matter enough to be important. On the other hand, if we throw things were aerodynamics matter (leaves, stalks), we find their flight path unpredictable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You pick up a stick and naturally throw it narrow end first. If it’s a forked stick you’ll often turn it around so the fork points to the back. Of course, this is a bit more center of mass than aerodynamics, but it definitely comes into play.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>None of them pick up random objects and fling them. At all. All of the ones you listed are considerably more accurate than we are within their <em>very</em> specific domain (spit, tongue, and water droplets in respective order, if memory serves), but that's all they can do. The archer fish cannot shoot a bow or even throw an arrow. A chameleon would sooner sit on a rock than fling it. Frogs cannot play baseball no matter how hard they try.</p>
<p>There are only a few animals which even <em>attempt</em> to fling random objects with intent. Chimpanzees (and actually, most primates) are among them. Corvids will often <em>drop</em> random objects with specific tool-like intent (this isn't the same as throwing, just including it because it's cool). Other types of birds (such as parrots) will often throw small debris short distances, sometimes with reasonable accuracy.</p>
<p>The thing is though that most of those creatures are generally inaccurate and impotent compared to what we can do. Anyone who has ever watched a monkey fling its poo can identify with this sentence. It usually looks very very awkward, and honestly they seldom get it anywhere near where they seem to be <em>trying</em> to get it.</p>
<p>So all in all, we are both stronger and better throwers than all but the most specialized in the animal kingdom, and we're also able to apply that skill to just about any object we're physically capable of lifting. That combination went a very long way towards raising our species above the rest.</p>

<p>It's also worth to bear in mind that the human brain isn't exactly doing calculus like a computer. For instance, if you are going to catch a ball you don't need to predict much of the trajectory, you only have to position yourself in relationship with the ball in such a way that it stops moving in your subjective pov. Then you just position yourself in such a way as to make it easiest to catch, and use visual parallax to judge the ball's distance from your hand. You might, for instance, have to run forward for it to appear still in your POV. With this method, calculating objective trajectory can be completely unnecessary and you can redirect your cognitive resources to something else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can see this greatly when someone throws something a long distance and is slightly off target. The person trying to catch said object will be moving a lot, usually in all directions and in the end stand pretty much exactly where he/she needs to stand to succesfully catch the object.
You don‘t really notice it while doing it yourself, but usually it‘s a lot of small steps back, forth and to the sides until your brain decides here is the right position.</p></div>		</li>
