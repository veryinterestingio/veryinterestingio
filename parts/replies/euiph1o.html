			<div class="markdown"><p>I might just be obtuse but can you explain how the skin cells on ‚Äútop‚Äù (i.e. the ones that end up as the outer layer of skin) know that the empty space (air) above them is supposed to be there so they don‚Äôt need to add another layer of skin? Why don‚Äôt they just keep adding layers and dividing that way? Do they sense when the wound is filled to the proper depth so to speak, and if so, do they get this info from other cells? I imagine the cells in the middle of a wound would just be dividing based on room next to them, but there would always be room on top of them if they‚Äôre the outermost layer, so why don‚Äôt they just keep going and going to fill that empty space above them? And how do they know to keep adding layers but then stop when the layers reach the proper depth?</p>
<p>Apologies for the kindergarten-level sentence composition lol. I know nada about this kind of stuff so I had to dumb it down for my brain so I could figure out how to say what I was thinking üòÇ</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is all in the DNA which says only a certain amount of growth is allowed. The reason the growth stays in check is because otherwise the kind of DNA that allowed that wouldn't be passed on because you would die from not being able to control growth. Those set of rules were created before humans obviously dating all the way back to the start of evolution itself. The DNA is the line of code that makes up an operating system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't answer your question but I can offer something to add understanding on how skin works sometimes. There's a condition or two where your body thinks you need some more skin grown when you don't. It doesn't increase the area of the skin and make you wrinkly, it just keeps pushing up like you mentioned. It can leave you with several layers of dead skin very quickly.
Extrapolating from that I'd say there's some extra checklists for skin cells to look at so they don't keep growing skin that is wasted by going up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it‚Äôs dead how did the wound fill in? The layers underneath pushing up? How do they know when to stop pushing? Like literally your body makes enough cells to fill it back in and then stops. How does it know enough is enough?</p></div>		</li>
