It’s mind-boggling how we can understand the chemistry to the molecular level, but then when you zoom out, it seems qualitative.

<p>I wasn't trying to refer to anything in particular with &quot;complex matters&quot;.
I just noticed that, given the right situation, even if I am really tired I can fight through the mists of my clouded mind and be at least somewhat focused.
The last time I observed this, was when the manager at my new job asked me to attend a meeting with him. First I could barely think straight because I had a rough night, but as the meeting proceeded I got more and more focused.
So I asked myself, what happens in my brain?</p>
<p>I read in a book, that when you don't sleep enough or not at all, a substance called Adenosine builds up in the brain.
My understanding is that this is the chemical, that impairs the ability to focus.
What happens with it, when I manage to force myself to focus? Is it cast in another region of the brain, which I don't use for this particular task?</p>
<p>I would love to hear about ADD!</p></div>		</li>
