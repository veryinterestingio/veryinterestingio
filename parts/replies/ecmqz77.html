			<div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_real_number_line" target="_blank">extended real line</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_line" target="_blank">real projective line</a> are two.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754" target="_blank">floating point numbers</a> that computers use to do non-integer arithmetic are also another one. They introduce three new elements: +infinity, -infinity, and NaN (not a number). +infinity and -infinity behave like the extended real line. NaN is used to represent the result of operations like 0/0 and infinity - infinity. Any operation containing a NaN also results in NaN. The thing is that these new elements break a lot of what you expect to be true about ordinary arithmetic: x - x = 0, and x * 0 = 0, right? Nope, because x could be infinity, -infinity, or NaN, then the answer would be NaN. NaN is especially troublesome, as all comparisons with it are defined to be false. You would think that surely x=x would always be true, right? Nope. NaN = NaN is false by definition, even if the NaNs arose in the exact same way (so 0/0 = 0/0 is false).</p></div>		</li>
