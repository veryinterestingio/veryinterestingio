			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s a pretty unusual crime and motives and methods vary.  Typically I think that high ranking criminals solicit specific art thefts.  Secondarily individuals try and do a smash and grab and find a buyer after.  This doesn’t always work and in once incident led to the incineration of millions and millions of dollars of art being destroyed by the thieves mother after he failed to find a buyer.  <a href="https://www.google.ca/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/jul/17/dutch-art-heist-paintings-burned" target="_blank">link</a> </p>
<p>John Tilman was (is?) a Canadian art thief and white nationalist who stole something like 10,000pieces of art with his lady friend.  I read about him too long ago to recall his modus operandi but I think he has a massive cache of millions of dollars of art and antiquities when he was caught.</p>
<p>Sadly many thefts remain unsolved.  Either the thief stole it for themselves, successfully found a buyer or the work was destroyed.   A very famous case is the Isabella Gardener Heist in Boston.  A high ranking Boston mobster was suspected of hiring two men to carry it out but they got away with it.  Oddly more valuable pieces were not stolen which seemed strange.<br />
Also a beautiful art gallery and well worth a visit if you’re in Boston.  They have one of my favourite Sargent paintings in the world El Jaleo. The way it’s displayed is genius.</p>
<p>Finally war is a big part of art theft.  The Nazis were by far the most prolific art thieves of the 20th century with many pieces still wrongfully possessed and backed up in court cases.  The famous case being the Klimt painting of Adele Bloch Bauer that was returned to a relative or descendent of Bauer in Vienna in 2006.  She kindly donated it thought it was valued around $145 million.</p></div>		</li>
