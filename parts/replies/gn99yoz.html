			<div class="markdown"><p>There are many reasons why hydrogen is unsuitable. The short of it is that hydrogen is not a metal and doesn't behave as a metal. It has none of the properties of the group it is listed in and, to be honest, doesn't fit any group well. It should be off by itself like Hawaii on a map. </p>
<p>Lithium is effectively at the top of Group 1.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most tables have H as a different color.  It's always explained in basic Chem why H is out there as an ear.  That's basically the start of the periodic table discussion in the 3 basic Chem courses I've taken over decades.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hydrogen is a bit too reactive for one.  Any spark around hydrogen is gonna end in a bad day and thing that use electricity make lots of sparks.  Also, hydrogen is a gas at room temp, and also it's such a small molecule that it's hard to contain without special containers (which you could certainly do, but drives up cost.</p>
<p>However using hydrogen in fuel cells?  Now that is a concept being put into use.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Looking up on the periodic table, there is nothing above lithium</p>

<p>What about Hydrogen and Helium?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Helium has no active electrons, and doesn’t form ions, so it’s useless in a battery. Hydrogen is an explosive gas and there are numerous practical issues making an electrode from it. It really becomes a different technology at that point: fuel cells.</p></div>		</li>
