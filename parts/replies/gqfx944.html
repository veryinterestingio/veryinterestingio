			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation. Also worth pointing out that current effectiveness figures can not be compared between vaccines. The Pfizer/Moderna’s vaunted 95% effectiveness was tested under very different conditions than the AstraZenica vaccine for example, which was tested with new variants in broad circulation. It’s speculated that if Pfizer were to test again today they may get lower figures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, /u/CalibanDrive described a trial that would be needed to compare effectiveness rates. No such trial has been performed however. </p>
<p>All we can say when comparing Vaccine X and Vaccine Y's effectiveness rates is that when Vaccine X's trial was performed, the vaccinated group were that x% less likely to get COVID than that unvaccinated group, and when Vaccine Y's trial was performed, <em>that</em> vaccinated group were that y% less likely to get COVID than <em>that</em> unvaccinated group. The key point is that Pfizer/Moderna trials were done at a different time than J&amp;J trials, and J&amp;J trials had more variants and more surrounding cases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is extremely important and should be emphasized more by the media.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, and it's roughly 2 weeks after the <em>first</em> injection for both Pfizer and Moderna.  I can see why they wouldn't want to muddy the waters and risk people not getting the second injection (which may be important for long-term immunity), but at 14 days, both Pfizer and Moderna are roughly 92-93% effective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For how long? It looks like most if not all the studies end a few weeks after that final dose. It's also worth noting that due to the small numbers of people who have severe illness and or die, the margin of error is significantly higher for predictions in these catagories, such that tbh such statements are misleading. We are much more confident about reduction in symptomatic infection, just due to it being more prevalent. For example the study in Israel had 8 deaths vs 0 in the last week, for &quot;100%&quot; efficacy. But the former wasn't reported at all in the media.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is correct. And they also significantly reduce the level of notable illness (i.e. not sick enough to go to the hospital, but really feeling crappy at home in bed.)<br />
And this has been true while the variants were widely in circulation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great point.  Here is a great <a href="https://twitter.com/DiseaseEcology/status/1359213735424872450" target="_blank">Twitter Thread</a> about the Moderna Vaccine efficacy in blocking infection &amp; transmission.  </p>
<p>It's a lot of info so a little tl:dr takeaway from one <a href="https://twitter.com/jere7my/status/1359221226967826434?s=20" target="_blank">poster</a> is &quot;You’re 95% less likely to get symptomatic COVID and 91% less likely to transmit COVID, more or less. The idea is that the 95% who don’t get symptoms aren’t secret superspreaders, though a few might still pass it on.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>Exactly, all the vaccines have shown <del>total</del> near total (edit: near total; as large scale numbers come in some studies are showing some hospitalizations occurring among vaccinated cohorts, although still not in large numbers) effectiveness against hospitalization (let alone death) and good effectiveness against even strong illness endured  while in bed at home.</p>
<p>UCSF epidemiologist Dr. Monica Gandhi:&quot;The best way to think about it is that all the vaccines down the line will offer 100% protection against hospitalization from COVID-19. During the trials, anyone who got hospitalized received the placebo in their arms. The Johnson &amp; Johnson trial was conducted at a time the variants were circulating in both the U.S. and Latin America.</p>
<p>We can also quantify that 95% of the virus in South Africa when the trials were going on was the B.1.351 variant and despite that, the Johnson &amp; Johnson single dose still offered 100% protection against hospitalization and 85% protection against severe disease, which is where you're at home but not feeling well.</p>
<p>It was the same across the board whether it was South Africa, the U.K. or Latin America. The difference in the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine is in mild disease; it had less efficacy against mild disease when dealing with the South African variant.</p>
<p>This kind of incredible efficacy is done by T cell responses, which are long-lasting and prevent the scariest thing about COVID-19, which is severe illness. I’ve been surprised by all the doom and gloom messaging about the variants and the vaccines, and I’m concerned it will lead to vaccine hesitancy. We should be pushing more optimism about the vaccines.&quot;<a href="https://www.sfgate.com/news/editorspicks/article/COVID-19-variants-vaccines-effective-San-Francisco-15961073.php" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.sfgate.com/news/editorspicks/article/COVID-19-variants-vaccines-effective-San-Francisco-15961073.php" target="_blank">https://www.sfgate.com/news/editorspicks/article/COVID-19-variants-vaccines-effective-San-Francisco-15961073.php</a></a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is all basically right, but the nuance is in how free vaccinated people are to live their lives while there are people waiting for a vaccine</p>
<p>In a world without the SA variant, vaccinated people could live their lives without worry—they’re protected from death and can’t pass on the virus </p>
<p>The SA variant means that even if vaccinated people are protected from death, they can still contract what feels like sniffles, hang out with an unvaccinated person, and then the unvaccinated person dies of Covid</p>
<p>In a world where vaccines fully prevent severe illness but only partially prevent spread, society can’t reopen until everyone who wants to be vaccinated is vaccinated</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, this Atlantic article seems to reference real-world (post-phase 3 trial) studies that suggest that it's naive and bad messaging to communicate that they're 100% effective at preventing hospitalization.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In one, researchers compared about 600,000 people who had had a full course of the Pfizer vaccine in Israel with 600,000 people matched in age and other demographics who had not been vaccinated. The shots’ effectiveness at preventing hospitalization was measured at 87 percent. (“This vaccine is fabulous in a real world setting,” Jha tweeted in response.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/03/pfizer-moderna-and-johnson-johnson-vaccines-compared/618226/" target="_blank">https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/03/pfizer-moderna-and-johnson-johnson-vaccines-compared/618226/</a></p>
<p>87% is still a great number, but it's very different from 100%.  That seems like important information for decision making, particularly if you're a high risk individual, or you're deciding whether it's safe to spend a lot of time in high-risk situations (maybe 9-5 indoors in a close quarters maskless office). It also has implications, as the Atlantic points out, on whether or not or how soon a company would/should mandate that they're going back to in-office mask-optional work, knowing that it may mean that X coworkers statistically may end up hospitalization, vs zero.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the mRNA vaccines (pfizer, moderna) appear to create a stronger immune response to the target proteins than modified adenovirus vaccines like the AstraZenica and J&amp;J/Janssen vaccines. This makes sense based on the mechanism of action and explains why so many countries are favoring the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines for use in the elderly and immune compromised.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's difficult to draw conclusions about relative effectiveness of different vaccines.</p>
<p>When they do the test to measure effectiveness, they randomize the administration of vaccine and placebo. So, you know the two populations are the same.</p>
<p>But the populations that received the pfizer vaccine/control and the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine/control were completely different. So, you can't really say that one was better than the other without doing a randomized test incorporating them.</p>
<p>There's good reason to believe that the mRNA vaccines would not be as effective, if tested in the same population as the Johnson and Johnson vaccine.</p></div>		</li>
