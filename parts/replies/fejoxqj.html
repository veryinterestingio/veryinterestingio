<p>For example:  1) Do radioactive elements decay at different rates on land v. underwater?  2)  Does temperature affect it?  3)  Can sun/UV exposure affect it (e.g., ozone depletion, intense cloud/debris cover [e.g., nuclear winter], etc.)?  If so, in what ways and how severely?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer, no.  As a result of fundamental forces, radioactive decay is constant and immutable.  Unaffected by pressure, temperature, UV, etc.</p>
<p>Long answer, maybe.  Some very odd nuclei may demonstrate minute, barely detectable variations under very special conditions.  Work has been ongoing trying to suss out such variations for decades.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly right. And in this case &quot;very special conditions&quot; doesn't mean &quot;exposed to direct sunlight,&quot; or &quot;underwater.&quot; It's more like, &quot;being blasted with specific types of subatomic particles at levels higher than the sun emits.&quot; In other words, it may be possible on paper and in some cases we can do it artificially, but it would be completely reasonable to assume that it has never naturally occurred in Earth's history.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not at all. As was mentioned earlier, decay rates are based on fundamental physical forces only internal to the nucleus of the atom. As a side note though, if there was sufficient high energy radiation (think gamma rays or cosmic rays) that can force different reactions in the nucleus. This is how we get C14. Cosmic rays hit nitrogen atoms in the atmosphere and essentially knock off a proton, turning it into C14. </p>
<p>This process continually generates C14, which then blows around the atmosphere. So in this case, the rate of production of C14 is controlled by the environment, but the rate of decay is not. So when you're doing radioisotope dating, you need to take into account both the decay process (which doesn't change based on environment) with other different processes that do vary based on the environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is interesting, I hadn't realized that C14 is a product of Nitrogen bombardment, I just knew it was continually produced in the air.</p>
<p>If this is the case, wouldn't we expect some external factors in the 'baseline' amount of C14 in the atmosphere? I.e. if there more or less nitrogen in the atmosphere, wouldn't we also see proportionally more or less C14? Also, if there's a particularly active cosmological age with lots of supernovas, wouldn't we also see more C14?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, but yes in the way that you're probably asking. Dating methods for really old stuff is done by measuring the ratios of one isotope to another. As others have mentioned there are no natural forces that could speed up or slow down the decay process however there are natural forces that can affect the ratios of isotopes.</p>
<p>For instance, U-Pb dating is typically done by measuring the ratio of lead to Uranium in zircon. Zircon is very tough and chemically resistant and is known to form from magma. When the mineral is being formed it will incorporate Uranium but not lead so the initial ratio of Pb-U is 0. From measuring the amount of lead to Uranium you can then figure out the age of the rock. But if you melted the zircon to lava again and reformed it. You would have no lead again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Related to this, any carbon dating for objects from the industrial era onwards will be heavily skewed due to the excess carbon dioxide being pumped into the atmosphere. Nuclear testing also skewed the ratio of carbon 12 to carbon 14 the other way due to c14 release.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would also point out that we can see very distant stars, and we seem them as they were a long long time ago.   We do not see any change in the nuclear reactions of a star 10 million light years away (i.e. ~10 million years ago) and the nuclear reactions of stars now.</p></div>		</li>
