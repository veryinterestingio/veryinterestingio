<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So modern physics has a problem: gravity is weird. The way we look at gravity is by treating it as a consequence of the curvature of spacetime - you've probably seen the analogy of taking a sheet and putting a football in it to represent the sun. The steeper the gradient of the fabric, the stronger the gravity at that point. If you roll something along the sheet, it will get caught in the slope and change trajectory. This idea is known as general relativity. The problem is that this is not a <em>quantum</em> theory, meaning it doesn't exactly play nicely with the other 3 fundamental forces: the strong, weak and electromagnetic forces.</p>
<p>The other three forces interact through quantum field theory - a mathematical construct that describes particles as excitations of a underlying, more fundamental 'field'. This is very well understood and is a very well accepted theory at this point. We can even see (indirectly) the 'force carriers' - particles that 'carry' these three forces - in our particle accelerators.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these two theories are incompatible. Gravity doesn't have a force carrier particle and as such isn't a quantum theory. Additionally, all attempts to accurately describe such a particle (known as a 'graviton') using the mathematics of quantum field theory have been unsuccessful. This is due to a problem in the process called 'renormalization' - a way of describing how things interact differently at different scales - that exists between quantum field theory and general relativity.</p>
<p>If we were able to unify these two concepts, we would (hopefully) be able to describe all of physics using the same mathematical framework. Which would be awesome. However, we're quite a way off yet and there doesn't seem to be a solution on the horizon to this problem either. Theories like supersymmetry and string theory have attempted to solve this problem, but so far have been unsuccessful, and we have little-to-no evidence for their own existence either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the Higgs field is another example of a quantum field - with the Higgs boson being the particle that arises when you excite it. And yes its has certainly answered many questions, but if anything even more have come about as a result. For example the Higgs boson we found is of a very different size to what was expected - we still don't really know why 7 years later. It could be due to undiscovered particles - potentially including supersymmetry or dark matter. We simply don't know.</p>
<p>There was a lot of hype around the Higgs boson when it was discovered, all the 'god particle' crap etc. In actuality, the Higgs is merely a small part in a far bigger machine: the standard model. And despite all the hype in 2012, the Higgs was theoretically proven back in the 60s. We've known about it for quite a while. It was only in 2012 that we had the equipment available to us to actually test and verify that theory. </p>
<p>So yes the Higgs boson is definitely important, but overall its just another piece in the puzzle that is a Theory of Everything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Total amateur question here.   </p>
<p>Is it possible that gravity, and the forces what we'd describe as 'quantum theory' are just 2 completely different systems? Like 2 structures in the universe that happened to form and operate in different ways?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For practical purposes this is already the case because gravity is normally so weak compared to the other forces, as to be to insignificant at atomic distances. Conversely, at cosmic distances gravity dominates. The result is two types of physics separated by <del>thousands</del> (<em>Correction:</em> tens) of orders of magnitude in scale. </p>
<p>The incompatibility between them occurs in extreme cases such as at the centre of Black Hole (known as a Singularity) or at the hypothesised origin of the universe which some theories assume was also a Singularity.</p>
<p>When large amounts of matter are concentrated into quantum sized volumes gravity is no longer insignificant and cannot be ignored. To understand the physics of these conditions physicists need a way to describe how gravity interacts with the other forces, aka a &quot;Unified Theory of Quantum Gravity.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An amateur with an interest here, yes, afaik they could be arising from different systems. A lot of work is being done in the field of Dark Matter / Dark Energy and alternate gravity theories. I believe one of the problems is that gravity as a force on the quantum scale is very very weak.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m afraid (if that’s the right word) that the “solution” to combing the theories and “proving” them might be forever out of outreach due to our inherent “macro” view of the universe. Like, no information can leave a black hole’s event horizon, or we can’t know what is “outside” our universe or “before” the Big Bang began (if it can even be expressed in such a way). In a similar fashion maybe those answers are forever locked behind some kind of information barrier we can’t ever invent tools to measure or infer. String theorists have tried to infer some proof for strings but looking at remnants of the Big Bang in cosmic background radiation to see if early events may have been magnified across the cosmos in some recognizable way but have been unsuccessful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s quite a mind-bending thought. I was thinking about something similar the other day. </p>
<p>Do you mean in a sense that video game characters can never really infer the true mechanical nature of their environmental physics? Their “Gravity” exist and they could even describe and understand it mathematically, but there may be axiomatic principles that they don’t understand incidentally (because they didn’t create the game) as apposed to a perceptive lack of intelligence.</p></div>		</li>
