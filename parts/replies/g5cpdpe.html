<p>I take more of a &quot;Yes, And...&quot; approach akin to improvisation. The story is going to happen with or without me, so my role is to find ways to tweak it to be plausible, interesting, and internally consistent. My job isn't to tell directors or writers (or game designers, or authors, or...) what they can or can't do with their story. My job  is to find a way to help them tell it!  </p>
<p>So no, I don't get much pushback, but given I'm coming at it from an angle of enthusiastic &quot;So we can do this or this or this or this, or thiiissss would be really neat!!&quot; it'd be a bit like kicking a puppy to shut me down!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In science fiction and fantasy there is sometimes what is called hard fantasy or soft fantasy, hard fantasy is where everything makes sense and the writer tries to make everything work, a hard fantasy novel would include delay, maybe loss of communication due to things happening in the atmosphere etc... A soft fantasy writer would just roll with it and be like &quot;magic!&quot; don't ask why, just keep reading &quot;</p>
<p>One example could be Harry Potter, it's soft fantasy, that's why many people argue why they didn't do this thing when that thing happened or why wizards don't use shotgunds
Another example would be the Lord of the rings, where the writer worked a lot into making sure everything worked together</p>
<p>Some an√®cdotes in regards to this are the lampost of Narnia or writers refusing to use the word &quot;ok&quot; in their books or a writer making a list of words that appear in a 18th century book and only using those so the book would sound like someone from 18th wrote it...</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Much larger than magic wands, difficult to conceal, and unlike a magic wand they have no peaceful uses so if you come to a meeting with a shotgun your intentions are clear. Plus, wizards have not needed them so it would be a hassle to figure out how they work, and the logistics, ammunition etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on optical relay, mag relay, etc.  Orbits affect transmission as well as particulates and those are affected by types of craft and run frequency.  I find it amusing the effectiveness some think certain types of ground observatories have.  Much signal has pass through or booster systems just like ground relay.  Depending of factors they say delay free but less than two to give minutes in conversation pauses once was considered delay free.  As we even got ground delay of optical and other.</p></div>		</li>
