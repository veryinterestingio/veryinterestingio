			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that you're confusing Peer Review and Replication. Peer review is the process in which a potential publication for a scientific journal is sent to a few people with relevant knowledge to review. These reviewers then make recommendations for the journal to accept, accept with minor or major revisions, or reject the article. Once a paper is published, others will attempt to replicate the findings, but the term peer review always refers to the pre-publication process.</p>
<p>Other than that, you're completely correct about Andrew Wakefield and the damage that he's done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was under the impression he never got that paper peer reviewed.</p>
<p>I've had discussions with many anti-vaxxers, and have seen them use Wakefield as a way to &quot;Silence the truth&quot;...</p>
<p>I'm sure Wakefield is still making plenty of money as well...</p></div>		</li>
