			<div class="markdown"><p>I answered a question simply like that on here once and someone went off that I didn't answer it well enough and they wanted gene expression explained as it applied to the subject at hand. I agree that it was done right but there's those that dont.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but sometimes that's the best response. I'll never forget how nuclear reactors work because someone on this sub said, &quot;Hot rock, boil water, make steam.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer at the top of this chain isn't something I would expect a literal 5-year-old to understand. They don't typically have much experience operating a motor vehicle, much less an understanding of how their failure modes might play out over time.</p>
<p>That said, the answer is a great example of something that's friendly, simplified, and layperson-accessible.</p>
<p>So yes, it's a proper ELI5 answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Calling it done right seems silly because it's all personal preference.  I found this answer completely useless to me because it doesn't tell me anything I don't already know.  This answer could be replaced with &quot;Not instantly&quot; and reveal just as much information.</p>
<p>To me interesting aspects of an answer to this would be how long it takes, how a person might feel during it, etc.  The kind of stuff that isn't obvious just from basic knowledge of biology.</p></div>		</li>
