			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, okay, lots of questions to get to, so I'll start a bit early, I guess. </p>
<p>Sometimes debating someone individually just isn’t a good use of time. I think a lot of biologists ran into this about 10-20 years ago with creationists demanding to debate them in public. It ended up elevating the position of the creationists, and didn’t change the science at all. </p>
<p>Moreover presenting people with information that conflicts with deeply held beliefs doesn’t usually convince them to change their minds. Sometimes it might even backfire, making people more entrenched (this is still being worked out in the literature). </p>
<p>Individually what you can do is model good behavior. Wear a mask if you must go out. Have two way conversations with relatives about the importance of being a good community member and getting vaccinated.</p>
<p>People don’t respond well to being told they’re wrong, and treating people like they aren’t educated enough doesn’t help. Most people who are anti-vaccine have done research-- they just haven’t been selective about sources. Many have also become part of online friend groups who are like-minded. The stories I’ve read of people who changed their minds usually involve someone coming across a better source, and gradually changing their minds through reading.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But how do you do this when the response to &quot;I got my flu shot, it was no big deal&quot; is &quot;Bill Gates now controls you with nano machines&quot;? How do you have a two way conversation with someone who stonewalls you with conspiracy theories?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't say you got the flu shot in the first place. <em>If you're not required by your employer to get a flu shot then why on earth would anyone get one?</em> This is their mentality, and you ain't changin' it with any debate you have with them. Find a better subject and have a conversation instead</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think its likely to die out in the short term. As you say, some people are just really hard to reach. </p>
<p>You can however make good information easier to reach than bad information, and make it hard for people to run into fringe beliefs and communities. </p>
<p>Convincing every single person isn't a realistic goal. Keeping vaccination rates high enough to ensure herd immunity is a realistic goal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's the best way to handle this online, where many of the posters with opposing viewpoints exhibit &quot;sea-lion&quot; type personalities? Post a rebuttal of primary literature, then block the user and move on?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ok, I googled “sea lion personality” and got this “These charming pinnipeds are agile, sleek and energetic with an eagerness of spirit that's irresistibly compelling.” What does it mean in this context? (Honestly, I would rather hang out with an actual sea lion than an anti-vaxxer)</p></div>		</li>
