			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. However, by using surveys and some math, the estimates are good enough to be used for critical business decisions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. The standard surveys that are done are good enough on state or national scale. However on a regional or even local scale the estimates most of the time arenâ€™t accurate enough. They often have to do another survey with more people in their area to get more accurate decisions.</p>
<p>Source: I work at a tv/radio station and work with those numbers on a daily basis.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Any Apps that require an internet connection to give you radio/music access can definitely just track it though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's the margin of error and it's just about as good as a hired marketing statistics company can get. It means they've run their statistical model 10 times, and 9 of those times the results were within 3% of each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I can shed some light on this one since my GF used to work for a TV and radio research company. I'm not sure if they were more focused on the content (researching what a station should play) vs just how many viewers a station had. </p>
<p>They would be approached by or would reach out to radio stations that need research. As far as I know there are several methods for collecting data. One would be creating surveys, these could be online or in person (used to be scantrons and now on tablets). They would listen to clips of songs and respond by telling how they felt about the song, usually how much did you like it. (Like it a little, really like it, didn't care etc)</p>
<p>Another method is focus groups. As with the surveys, potential respondents would be screened by a survey to make sure they fit the demographic that the station is looking/if they listen. They would then be invited to the company's office or a third party location to do the same thing the online surveys ask on tablets, or should it be a radio show, they could ask questions about the host/s.</p>
<p>They didn't do the personal people meters (PPMs) but she said they are more effective at learning how <em>many</em> listeners a station has. This isn't without some shortcomings, however. They are only active when the person is moving. So if they are still and listening to music,  no data will be collected. Also if you're with somebody else, you're technically collecting their data. Sure you could have selected the same music if you were alone, but I think it's not 100% genuine. </p>
<p>And a cheaper (and I think is older, but smaller companies still use) method is diaries. Which is just what it sounds like, you would listen to the radio and write down in a diary songs you listened to and if you liked them.</p>
<p>This is mostly going off of memory, so if you care to know any other specifics I can ask my GF!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iâ€™m actually taking a diary survey now of what radio channels I listen to! It didnâ€™t start like that right away though. First they send little surveys to see if Iâ€™ll fill them out and to ask how many people live in our house.</p>
<p>It took a while before they sent a letter saying theyâ€™re sending a diary soon. Also, each time Iâ€™ve received a letter, theyâ€™ve sent money with it. For the diary, they sent each participant $10 and will send $10 more to each person when we return them.</p></div>		</li>
