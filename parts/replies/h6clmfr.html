			<div class="markdown"><p>Even in the absence of wind, separation of gases by density doesn't really occur in most cases. If it did you could just enclose air in a space and CO2 would settle on the bottom, which doesn't really happen. The reason is the thermal effect of gases - because on earth, they are at much higher temperature than absolute zero. As a result of this, they have high energy and their 'particles' move too fast. The force created by the difference in gas density is not enough to overcome the 'wiggling around' of the particles due to their energy, so they stay mixed around regardless. If you lower the temperature enough, separation would occur, but this temperature will be extremely low, probably around liquid nitrogen temperatures. </p>
<p>This is the same reason why oxygen can't be concentrated using a magnet, despite being the only gas in the air that is attracted to a magnet. The attraction force of a practically attainable magnetic field is far weaker than the thermal energy of the gas. Maybe someone can explain all of this in a more ELI5 way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, they don't disperse evenly, but there, is broadly, every type of gas at every level of elevation. But you can increase the concentration of certain gasses and because they don't disperse evenly, the concentration change will have a stronger effect at different elevation levels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would think the only way you get a mixture purely sorted by density is when gravity (or acceleration in a constant direction) is the only/dominant force acting on the mixture. Any other forces acting against gravity will disturb the gradient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even then, unless it's all supercooled to near zero (and hypothetically still a gas), they'll mix a little due to diffusion. If I had to guess, they might mix quite a lot, to the point that you won't get discrete bands of gasses at 0C.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You cannot get discrete bands. Gases don't stop other gases from being there. In an ideal setup with no wind, same temperature everywhere, ideal gases and so on the different gases don't influence each other. You can find the concentration of nitrogen independently of oxygen, argon and so on. Each gas will have the highest density at the ground, decreasing as you go up. For heavier gases the density will decrease quicker, but you don't get layers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish I had time to work through the math, but basically you're right that systems tend to arrange themselves in the lowest energy configurations possible, which in the case of a chamber of gas under the effect of gravity would be sorting by density. But the other factor is temperature, which fundamentally describes how much the system tends to smear itself out from that minimum energy configuration into other, slightly higher energy configurations, sacrificing energy at the cost of increased randomness.</p>
<p>There's a constant in nature called Boltzmann's Constant, and boltzmann's constant * temperature has units of energy.  It describes, simplistically, the characteristic energy of random fluctuations. Without going through any of the rather complicated math, we can estimate: imagine either a CO2 molecule at the bottom of the chamber and an O2 molecule at the top, or the reverse. Let the difference in energy between those two configurations be E. If E &gt;&gt; k_B * T, we'd expect that the effect of minimizing energy dominates, and the system will roughly sort itself. If k_B*T &gt;&gt; E, the randomness of temperature dominates and the system will be effectively unsorted.</p>
<p>Now 1 meter * acceleration due to gravity * (mass of CO2 molecule - mass of O2 molecule) \~\~ 1.2*10\^(-6) eV. That's an astoundingly small amount of energy, equivalent to approximately boltzmann's constant * 0.01K. We'd then expect CO2 and O2 in a 1m container to sort only at temperatures well below that, and of course neither would be gaseous (or even liquid) then. </p>
<p>As an incredibly crude approximation, then adjusting our math, we'd expect some degree of separation to begin at 20km scales or so. I have no clue how accurate that approximation is, probably not very.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It being windy doesn’t change how much nitrogen and oxygen are in the air, it just changes how evenly distributed they are. When you stir your coffee after adding milk, the act of stirring doesn’t add more milk to the coffee, it just distributes the milk that’s already there more evenly. Eventually it reaches a point where it’s fully mixed and stirring it more isn’t going to change anything.</p>
<p>Liquids and gases don’t like to clump up in spots, they always want to be evenly distributed, so even if you didn’t stir your coffee the milk would eventually spread out to the whole cup on its own. Similarly, if you take an air sample from anywhere (as long as it’s not near a source of concentrated gases like a volcano vent) it will always be ~21% oxygen and ~78% nitrogen</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work in air separation, and you had to wear an O2 monitor whenever you were on site, because that creates situations of high and low oxygen atmospheres. But even with that, if you're outside you would have to be right up on a nitrogen vent to get an alarm, the volume of the surrounding atmosphere is so vast that the pure gas is assimilated virtually immediately. The real worry was a leak into an enclosed space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nitpicking a little, but in liquids the density has a significant effect.</p>
<p>Sure, it’s still evenly distributed (on a horizontal plane) but heavily stratified. Oil and water will naturally separate with time, coffee and milk has nearly identical densities, so there are other effects that overcome the boyant forces.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The (main) gasses don't really separate in an enclosure either. It's more to do with the fact the molecules are in motion because of heat. Their heat energy is enough to keep them agitated. There is probably a <em>very</em> low temperature where they will separate.</p></div>		</li>
