<p>In the case of the heart it'll mean that changes in heart rate will come with some delay since the brain has to rely on hormones in the blood stream to communicate with the donor heart.</p>

<p>So, does that mean response to certain situations such as stress, flight or flight etc that warrant a rise in heart rate is delayed? </p>

<p>They do try to suture major nerve bundles when doing limb transplants, but that's still kind of experimental stuff</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wonder what kind of sutures do they employ to sew nerve fibres? I'm guessing the self dissolving kind that dissolve after a while. I also can't imagine the level of dexterity (assuming manual suturing) one needs to have to sew such incredibly delicate structures.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for the expansive and detailed answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is delayed and ignored some cases. Our body communicate with our heart with hormones (Adrenaline, noradrenalin etc) and with nerves (like n.vagus). So any response that caused by nerves are ignored, but since our body usually send some hormones to order same thing, it will effectively delayed only.</p>
<p>As for the nerve sewing, its extremely hard and developing side of the medicine. Since any needle you use to sew a nerve will also cause trauma on the nerve. Also there is an issue that most major nerves are bundled, meaning that it includes many different branches that need to be bring together appropriately in order the work. Just imagine you cut your neighborhood main cable connection, in order the work properly you need to bring together them by colors, red to red, blue to blue etc, now imagine they are all same color (shit?) and the needle you are using is 5 6 sub cable thick...So you are pretty much screwed. Most of the time you dont connect the individual sub cables together, you just sew the outer layer and wait for each individual nerve reach for its appropriate ending. There are some studies that it works albeit after a long time, suggesting nerves know their endings.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Just for anyone who’s interested, it isn’t that the individual nerve knows what it should be connected too. Rather, your brain will learn over time what a signal from this neuron means or what sending a signal down this nerve will do. </p>
<p>For an even more functionalist viewpoint, the brain is a very plastic organ and will strengthen connections that get used frequently. So if an impulse through one neuron frequently results in a signal to that neuron, the connections will be strengthened. Over time those connections get so strong that that exact signal across one (or, more likely multiple) neuron(s) will pass along very specific information about a finger tip, for example. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For future surgical techniques, would it be too far fetched to introduce stem cells to the ends of the nerve clusters that need to be repaired and then closing the system with some sort of wrap that will dissolve after a determined need? So putting them stem cells and whatever else would be needed to have them stem cells turn into nerves and then wrap it in a sleeve. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neurosurgeon here. We actually use non-dissolving sutures, usually very small ones like 8-0 or 9-0 prolene/nylon. Dissolving sutures require the body to send inflammatory cells to break down the material, and we don’t really want inflammation at the site of a nerve splice as it could interfere with the graft. You try to only sew the exterior sheath of the nerve, the epineurium, to avoid axonal damage. For really small nerves we use little conduit tunnels - you put the two nerve ends together, wrap them with a conduit, and use tissue glue to hold them in place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>General Surgeon in training (going into cardio) here: just for clarification and interest, the naming convention for sutures: number dash zero (e.g. 8-0 or 9-0) designates something small. The big number is the number of zeroes. 8-0 = 00000000. The more zeroes the smaller the suture. Cardiac surgeons will usually only go down to 7-0 for blood vessels. Transplant surgeons (pediatric transplant surgeons at least) and neurosurgeons (especially those who deal in nerve repair) probably use the smallest sutures, and powerful optics, to visualize the work. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In heart transplants, the denervated heart has a higher resting heart rate due to the loss of vagal (parasympathetic) tone. Basically, at rest a normal heart rate is constantly suppressed.</p>
<p>They also have much slower heart rate responses due to loss of sympathetic tone.</p>
<p>A big issue is that they cannot feel pain or angina. Therefore, cardiac allograft vasculopathy, one of the biggest causes of morbidity and mortality, is often asymptomatic.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, vessels will leak if the ends don't seal perfectly. That's why surgeons must take great care while stitching them together and generally spent a lot of time training these things. </p>
<p>I'm not a surgeon though so I can't really tell you much more details, but there are entire books written about the different ways to suture and stitch blood vessels and other types of tissue together, and all sorts of specialized tools to help with the task. Although most of it still is just a needle, a fine thread and a steady hand really. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep and we check :) believe it or not, it’s simpler than you think; there’s no secret technique other than taking good even bites a good distance apart. Just cinching tight will pull the tissue together nicely - remember it’s not fabric, it’s squishy. I’m not training to be a vascular surgeon but we do rotate with them during residency. After the vessel is stitched up, we unclamp it (needs to be clamped during the sewing of course) and see if it leaks. If it does the spot is sewn over to close it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>General surgeon in training here (going into cardio): the technical term is “anastomosis”, or grafting two tubes together. Same term applies to hooking up bowel, or any other two hollow organs together.</p>
<p>Basic visual depiction: <a href="https://img.tfd.com/MosbyMD/thumb/anastamosis.jpg" target="_blank">https://img.tfd.com/MosbyMD/thumb/anastamosis.jpg</a></p>
<p>As others have mentioned elsewhere, there are entire books written about how blood vessels should be reconnected. But in basic terms, they are usually reconnected with sutures in a “running” or continuous fashion. It lashes the two vessels together with a sort of connective ring, supporting the tissue until the two cut ends can heal with new connective tissue. </p>
<p>Believe it or not, once the connecting suture is in place, it’s water tight (or should be). As long as blood doesn’t leak with much force, it’s considered technically sufficient. The body is truly amazing in that we surgeons just approximate two unrelated structures, and the body figures out the rest. </p>
<p>A quote attributed Ambrose Parre (one of the forefathers in trauma and thoracic surgery) is: “I bandaged him, and god healed him.” I like this quote because it reminds me that what we’re doing is really just a tiny part of the whole solution, and our medicine pales in comparison to the adaptations nature/biology has developed over millions of years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kidney transplant recipient here - after 4 days, the ureter ruptured so the docs had to go in on a reconstructive to make room by attaching the renal pelvis to the top of the bladder.  In doing so, I had some pretty severe post-operative complications - DVT and some nerve damage.</p>
<p>DVT cleared up in about 9 months.  The nerve damage and numbness I felt in the surgical area and lower left abdominal/pelvic region has improved quite a bit after 4 years.</p>
<p>To wit: sometimes kidneys don't automagically work right after tranplantation.  Some patients may need to receive dialysis for a period of time post-surgery in order for the organ to 'wake up'.</p></div>		</li>
