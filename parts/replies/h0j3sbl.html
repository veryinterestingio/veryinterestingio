			<div class="markdown"><p>This.  Medicines such as Alfoxolaner (next guard) have some controversy relating to neurological symptoms in animals after being exposed to either too much of the compound or being exposed for a long time. </p>
<p>This makes sense because affecting the central nervous system is exactly how that compound kills fleas and ticks after they’ve bitten the dog. </p>
<p>Realistically, dogs that get neurological symptoms are probably those that are more susceptible and we’d see it in a lot more dogs if their average life span was 20years+. Since that isn’t the average life expectancy and the average dog doesn’t have that heightened susceptibility, then the medication is relatively safe.</p>
<p>However: A) humans on average live a lot longer than 15 years and B) there really isn’t an ethical way to test human susceptibility given the known neurodegenerative risks. </p>
<p>Source: I am a biologist who has looked this up many many times after doing fieldwork in the Midwest. Permethrin is the best I’ve come up with and it has its own risks. </p>
<p>Also a close friend works in the call center for one of the big companies that develops and distributes several of these compounds, and she answers questions about these very medications on a daily basis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course! For what it’s worth, my friend is an extreme lover of animals, wants to be a vet, knows all the gritty details and controversies about the medication, and she still uses it on her animals and recommends it to others.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As a dog person, it always blows my mind how physiologically different cats are in response to compounds that are relatively harmless to dogs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just curious, did you stop for prevention or because of observed symptoms? </p>
<p>Unfortunately, however rare, some pets do get neurological symptoms and it’s very unfortunate. It’s a real risk. Just have to decide what is best for each individuals situations.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Agreed; if we're gonna eat people, best make sure we know what they've got in their system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sad truth is our pets live maybe 15 years. A pet medication is &quot;safe&quot; if it doesn't kill animals before then. For a medication to be safe on humans, it just perform safely for much longer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it's more complicated than that.  As with most things, a risk/reward analysis must be done,  and if there is a clear statistical advantage to the entire population (of pets) then it would be performed.   It's not this simplistic picture that it has zero effect,  and it is not as if death is the only side effect that can occur.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorta. The medicines probably keep the animals alive longer than their wild counterparts. Could they have negative effects? Sure. I don't think it's quite as simple as you stated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it is. There are things that you can give a dog because although the medication may cause cancer or other complications in 30 years, the dog will be long dead so it doesn’t matter. It’s one of the reasons, not the only reason but still a good point.</p></div>		</li>
