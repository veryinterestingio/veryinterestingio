			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to add to this that it's important to stress that they can fill the same role in our body, not just that they are similar.</p>
<p>There are for example phytoestrogens which are structurally very similar to human estrogen but don't work the same way in our bodies.<br />
Because of the name similarity many people started to believe/worry that soy products (which contain phytoestrogens) might be unhealthy, which is untrue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not everyone in Sudan is malnourished. There are critical stages in a human's life where growth occurs, such as the growth spurt of childhood and puberty. Getting through calories, vitamins and minerals needed for bone growth helps you reach your full potential. Genetics also plays a part. Your genetics potential might be 6'2&quot; but because of poor diet, hygiene, medicine and fitness you only reach 5'11&quot; you'd still be considered tall just not at your full potential.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Low income communities in the US may not have textbook &quot;good&quot; diets but it's not through lack of nutrients. They are definitely getting plenty of macros and the basic building blocks to grow to their full potential. You can have a poor diet without being malnourished, and in fact malnutrition in the context we're talking about essentially doesn't exist in the developed world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Variety in diet is more important than amount. Americans eat so many fortified foods (eg. breakfast cereal with vitamins and minerals added) that stunted growth would be relatively rare. But in the past, even now, there have been places that ate the same three or four foods because of famine, drought, poor resource distribution, whatever.  If your diet is mostly potatoes, or corn, or rice with just a few other things, you can stay alive, but your body may not have consistent access to a wide variety of nutrients that would enhance your growth as a child. Add to that childhood illnesses that went untreated, lack of vaccinations, poor dental hygiene, chronic diarrhea and other things, and a lot of times just making it to adulthood at all was an accomplishment.</p>
<p>ETA: I'm not familiar with the Sudanese diet.</p></div>		</li>
