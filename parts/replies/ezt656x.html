			<div class="markdown"><p>What if &quot;about the same&quot; is not perfect focus, should I mention it? (eg: the &quot;b&quot; on the bottom row looks a little blurry on both)</p>
<p>I didn't at my last checkup and now I'm wondering if my prescription isn't as good as it could've been.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My last eye check up had one or two that were not just &quot;about&quot; the same, they <em>were</em> the same. The Doc was a family friend and we had a few extra minutes so he humored me. And the perscription changed on that visit as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally speaking, they're waiting for you to have difficulty deciding and selecting the lower correction based on the theory of &quot;Optical Creep&quot; (TL:DR, if you use too strong glasses, you'll adapt to them with &quot;worse&quot; eyesight.)</p>
<p>Just be honest: if you can't tell the difference, you're already hitting the closest correction they've got on tap.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like your profession and your username is a missed opportunity for 'nuclear_cataracts'.  </p>
<p>I've found that a lot of optometrists have very differing opinions on lasik and I'm super curious what your take on it is, and risk vs. reward threshold for your opinion.  </p>
<p>In the mean time, I'm going to sign up as 'cheater_readers'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A nuclear cataract is a common type of cataract. A lot of patients call cataracts “Cadillacs” by mistake. So the username is a play on that.</p>
<p>Lasik just depends on the person in question. There’s a lot of factors at play: Rx, biometrics, expectations, age, pre-existing conditions, etc.</p></div>		</li>
