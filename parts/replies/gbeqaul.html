			<div class="markdown"><p>An excellent response.  I have only one minor nit to pick:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>several high-pressure fuel explosions a second</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;several&quot;??</p>
<p>My car does 3000 RPM at freeway speed, or <strong>50</strong> rotations per <strong>second</strong>.  (The explosion only happens every other rev.)</p>
<p>Suppose you hold the thumb and forefinger on your left hand about 1Â½ inches apart.  Can you shake your right finger back and forth between them at 50 cycles/second?  How about 10?</p>
<p>The speed at which pistons move in a regular engine is, to me, almost beyond comprehension.  And I've heard (not observed personally) that motorcycle engine speeds are crazy higher.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You're right!</p>
<p>Just like cars, different motorcycles are different. A big Harley will only run 2500-3000 rpm on the highway. (Typically, that is - Harley has a couple of newer bikes with 8,000 or 9,000 RPM redlines that aren't big lumbering dinosaurs) Something like a 250cc Kawasaki Ninja will run 8,000 RPM at 65, and happily do it all day long. </p>
<p>The difference has to do with piston speed. That Kawasaki Ninja 250 buzzing along at 8k RPM has a stroke of about 41mm - which means at that speed, the pistons are moving at very nearly 11 meters per second. The Milwaukee 8 engine used in the softail motorcycles made by H-D have a stroke of 111mm, which is longer than pretty much any car. (The engine displaces 1750 cc, which makes it bigger than some car engines, even though it just has two cylinders.) Because of this, if the engine is turning 2500 RPM on the highway (I've never ridden one of them, so I'm guessing at the speed, but I know I'm close) we get a piston speed close to that of the Ninja - 9.26 m/s.</p>
<p>A typical car engine, I'll use for example the Toyota 1ZZ-FE engine used in the Corolla. It's a 1,794 cc engine (A little bigger than our Harley mentioned above) but it has four cylinders, which means each one can be smaller. It has a stroke of 91.5 mm, and at 2600 RPM (What I remember my corolla doing on the highway) the pistons are moving at 7.93 m/s. This is why car engines tend to last longer than motorcycle engines - they're not working as hard. That Ninja mentioned above has about 30 hp, and it's a 250cc. The Corolla engine has 130 horsepower, and it's a 1794cc. If the Corolla had the same amount of horsepower per unit of displacement as the Ninja, it would have 215 hp.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer. Really puts it in perspective how complex ICEs are and how much abuse they take on the inside compared to electric motors. This actually answered a lot of my curiosities. Thanks for taking the time to write it out.</p></div>		</li>
