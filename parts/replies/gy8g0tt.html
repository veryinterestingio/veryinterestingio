			<div class="markdown"><p>I can think of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Contractions with &quot;not&quot; (I tried to open the door but couldn't&quot;)</p>
</li>
<li>Contractions with &quot;have&quot; (I didn't try to open the door, but I should've&quot;)</li>
</ul>
<p>Contractions with &quot;had&quot;, &quot;is&quot;, &quot;would&quot;, and &quot;will&quot; all sound strange to me, though. Alongside OP's example using &quot;is&quot;, phrases like &quot;he hasn't arrived yet but he'll&quot; or &quot;he didn't arrive when he said he'd&quot; both sound weird.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But then saying something like &quot;I'm short&quot; sounds fine.</p>
<p>Followup question - why did this get downvoted it was a genuine question</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because you're placing the emphasis on the 'am', not the 'too'. Contractions only work when there is no emphasis on the word we're trying to contract.</p></div>		</li>
