			<div class="markdown"><p>Remember old cartoons where a person would touch a live wire or outlet and after a few seconds of being electrocuted they'd fly backwards and land on the ground sizzling with their hair sticking straight out?</p>
<p>This is a phenomenon that sometime happens. Depending on the path the electricity passes through your arms and whether your gripping or simply touch a live current the contraction in your arm muscles may cause them to straighten out with such speed and force that it literally launches you from the electric source a good couple of feet as if you had done a mighty push.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>old cartoons is reality? When you get shocked you generally clamp down on the source. You do not get blown back. This is taught on day one of any electrical training.</p>
<p>Edit: You could be blown back from the explosion caused by the arc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In order to move a muscle your brain sends an electric signal to the muscles and they contract. It's naturally limited for safety and muscle elasticity, but if you have an outside source of electricity it'll force the muscles to contract quickly and you'll get movements you wouldn't think are possible like leaping into the air or lurching away from a socket.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the position the person is in when they get shocked, but imagine every muscle in your body contracts with as much force as possible at the same time. Your calves flex your feet all the way down, your legs straighten, your core engages, your back muscles (which are stronger than your core) arch, and you fly/fall back at great speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think the electricity part is always ture. When the muscles contract you grip on to whatever is shocking you. You will find many vieos online that show this effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Scientists believe when you are electrocuted by very high voltage your bodies muscles contract/release and throw you back with extreme force.</p>
<p>Other times with lower voltages your arm muscles will simply grip what you are holding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm, I was gripping a metal bar from which I was electrocuted. I tried to let it go, but couldn't, something like, my hand was stuck to it. Eventually someone cut the power supply and I was saved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This likely depends on whether the source is AC or DC - alternating current or direct current.  With direct current, the electrons are moving in a single direction along the circuit - like from a car battery.  With alternating current, like from a household outlet, the electrons are basically vibrating back and forth instead.  If you become part of a DC circuit, the electrical 'instructions' to your muscles would be a steady &quot;contract!&quot;, causing your hand to stay closed on the item shocking you.  If the circuit is AC, the instructions would be &quot;contractreleasecontractreleasecontractrelease!&quot;, leading to the floppy-chicken effect.</p></div>		</li>
