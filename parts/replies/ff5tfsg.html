Awesome, you know exactly where it is when it hits the racquet! Unfortunately, you've also launched it off into the room and you have <em>no</em> idea which direction it was coming from and consequently, no clue which direction it went. </p>
<p>A similar thing happens when you try to measure where it's going. You can get a very good idea where it's headed, but as a result, you can't possibly know where it <em>is</em>. The more precisely you measure a particle's position the less precisely you can measure its momentum, and vice versa. If you know absolutely one of the two, you absolutely can't know anything about the other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s actually crazier than that. Your explanation helps, but it creates the idea that an electron is just flying around the atom and that if there were someway to measure it without affecting it, then we could watch it fly around.</p>
<p>The electron has a probability of showing at different locations up as if it were flying around, but the double slit experiments show that a single electron wave function will interfere with itself, which isn’t possible if the electron is just a single ball flying around</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And, it gets weirder...
Electrons are indistinguishable from one another. So, when we measure an electron's state multiple times, there's no way to be sure it's even the same electron.
When we measure its state (position and energy), here at one time, there another time, somewhere else a third time, it 'looks' like a 'path.' But, it's not. We don't know what it was doing between times.
All we really 'know' is that there was an electron here, at one time, an electron there, another time, and an electron somewhere else, some other time.
The current model of quantum mechanics treats the probably 'map' of energy states of the electron AS the electron.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everyone is answering you with the observer effect, which, while it exists, isn't the same as the uncertainty principle.  In fact, the ISS analogy is not the greatest because it misrepresents what an electron is doing.</p>
<p>Many people are suggesting that an attempt to &quot;observe&quot; an electron would knock it off its course and affect its trajectory. But this doesn't explain why you can't account for the observation and re-calculate its trajectory to locate it again. If I bounce a pool ball into another pool ball, it will affect that first pool ball, but with physics and math, I can still calculate where that pool ball ends up even though its original trajectory was affected.</p>
<p>There's not really an analogous real world example because electrons are bound by quantum physics, which is really really weird and unintuitive.</p>
<p>Basically, the electron doesn't really even exist until it needs to. It is merely a wave function....like a mathematical equation that says where it most likely is at any given time.  In fact, there is a slight non-zero probability that the electron of a given hydrogen atom is across the universe at any given time. That probability however is extremely low that it is unlikely to ever happen in real timescales.  Still the probability is non-zero and is a good example of why the ISS analogy falls apart.</p>
<p>I don't know where the ISS exactly is at any given time, but I can guarantee with 100% certainty that it's not on mars right now or in the orbit of Pluto.  I can't do that with electrons even if I don't measure them and affect them with the observer effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good comment, I would just add one thing. Uncertainty isnt something that just applies to subatomic particles. That same wave function that exists for a single electron also exists for the international space station. There is a chance that every particle of that space station could be found on mars or in the orbit of Pluto. Much less realistic, but that's where quantum conversations tend to lead.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Let's say the electron is closer to another hydrogen ion. How can it be said that it belongs to the original hydrogen ion?</p>
<p>Doesn't the ubiquity of hydrogen ions constrain the range of the electron?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the explanation for that is a little bit more involved. But if you were a highly intelligent scientist in the 1920s, several experiments you did would prove that the electron did not have any specific location. One simple fact is to take the model of an electron as a layperson would know it - a small particle revolving around a nucleus. When you do the calculations, it turns out that the electron would eventually fall into the nucleus due to dissipating energy. But, as we knew it, atoms were stable whether or not you supplied energy to them.</p>
<p>There are several other such anomalies that the old models had. Now pair that with the fact that if you did the famous double slit experiment with an electron, it'll suddenly behave like something prescient (it'll behave like a particle if one slit is open and as a wave if both slits are open as though it knew whether the slits were open or not).</p>
<p>To get around this, we came up with quantum mechanics which gave us a probabilistic view of nature (instead of a deterministic view). We came up with broad rules using math that worked so well to fit what we were observing that we started making other predictions. So far, all of those predictions have turned out to be true.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>So the answer to this is, &quot;we know it because we've done many many experiments that prove the fact&quot;.</p>
<p>The second part of your question is based on confusing jargon. &quot;spin&quot; doesn't mean an actual spin. It is simply a quantum property of a particle that tells you how it interacts with magnetic fields.</p>
<p>So if an electron was blown up to be visible to the human eye, we have no conception of what it'd look like. As far as we know, nothing of any appreciable macro size (in the micrometer range and upwards) shows quantum properties because it all cancels out (except for a black hole, but that's a separate topic). If an electron were to be made bigger, it'd lose its quantum properties. If we magically had it retain these properties, we'd have an absolutely insane physical thing because for the first time, we'd have a macroscopic object that cannot have a definite location and velocity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to this, the concept of &quot;size&quot; when talking about elementary particles doesnt reaaaally make sense. Size of what? Its electric field? As far as we know an electron is a point charge, so making it &quot;larger&quot; would have no effect. Even when we talk about the &quot;radius&quot; of a proton its difficult to convey to the layman exactly what that means. We tend to picture spheres of... Stuff? What exactly is that stuff? Is it a like a piece of hard candy? The answer is things we associate with space and interaction are due to electric fields. So the radius of a proton isnt easy at all to define. Most of people like to give analogies for quantum mechanics but those dont describe whats going on. They just help us understand the mathenatics - which is the only way to understand the effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Subatomic particles like an electron are bound by the laws of quantum mechanics and they don't interact with other matter and forces the same way large objects like the ISS do. That's why the comparison to the ISS is troublesome. As for whether we would see an electron spin if it was gigantic, it's really hard to say. We are still figuring this stuff out. I suspect that it would no longer be a subatomic particle and not behave the same way if it was huge. So it would cease being an electron basically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More specifically, it's the model of the electron shell that is most useful for learning Chemistry. For all intents and purposes, electrons &quot;act like&quot; how we expect them to in a simple shell and orbital shape model, which just so happens to make it easy to understand bonding at a baseline enough level to focus on the parts of chemistry which are practical or useful. There is, of course, a much more complicated model that is equally as theoretical, but has a lot more weight on specific mechanics and properties of the electron that are of basically no use in conventional chemistry unless you intend to work on things with &quot;quantum&quot; in the name, which most chemists do not.</p>
<p>Essentially, at the current time, if you are a student of chemistry and nothing more, learning anything deeper would almost be superfluous for a functional understanding of orbitals and bonding. Of course, actual students of chemistry typically take statistical mechanics and quantum chemistry courses, which both heavily touch upon the more complicated and fundamental properties of chemistry, but it probably doesn't go as deep into it as if you were taking a course with a physics focus. I wouldn't know, though, as I only took the courses on quantum offered by the chemistry department, and have no idea how physicists learn it. We did learn all the wave function stuff and I cried after I took my final, so I like to think I got most of the important stuff in.</p></div>		</li>
