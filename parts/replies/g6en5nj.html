			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to this, the brain creates the least heat as it is the least &quot;muscular&quot; part of the body and if I remember correctly there is something to be said about warm and cold blood has different amounts of platelets and the circulation of blood goes to different parts of the body immediately after the heart.
-please take this with a grain of salt, I'm referencing a video I watched a few years ago</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The main things are slower metabolism and lack of a isolation like fur and feathers.
Also some &quot;cold-blooded&quot; animals raise their body temperature on occasion, pythons essentially shiver while incubating their eggs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cold blooded is a bit inaccurate in the description. It just means they don't regulate their heat the same way. In warm blooded animals, dropping our temperature much below optimum can be very detrimental. In a cold blooded animal, their temperature can drop much lower with little damage. They just get slower. Also they do not have the same mechanisms to try and keep their blood at a certain temp range.  But like us, they will have an optimum temperature where they will be at there peak performance. </p>
<p>Also like us, getting too hot would be detrimental.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is why it's been banned by the FDA since the 1930s. The amount you need to take to loose weight effectively and the amount that will kill you are too close together. Too many people died by accidentally taking too much of it.</p>
<p>Taking too much of it will result in your body overheating and dying from excessively high temperatures: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2,4-Dinitrophenol" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2,4-Dinitrophenol" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2,4-Dinitrophenol</a></a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s a rare reaction to anesthesia called malignant hyperthermia where all of your muscles begin spasming due to continued activation of your calcium ion channels. This produces so much heat that you can die within a few minutes (not the only way it causes death though). Luckily there’s an antidote called dantrolene. </p>
<p>Read about it <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4027921/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/malignant-hyperthermia" target="_blank">here </a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3139779/" target="_blank">By mass, the kidneys and the heart are the most power hungry, at 440 kcal/kg/day</a>. Taking into account that some organs are larger than others, it probably depends on how muscular you are. In the study, the men had an average of 32 kg of skeletal muscle, which at 13 kcal/kg/day burns about 416 kcal/day, more than their brains. In the women however, their relative lack of muscles makes their brain the largest consumer of energy.</p></div>		</li>
