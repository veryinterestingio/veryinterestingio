			<div class="markdown"><p>In short nothing, I work on a transplant unit and starting to work with Syncardia, a total heart replacement (TAH), and the pulse rate is set to what the body needs. Everyone is different in what they need to sustain their body. </p>
<p>Total hearts are still in the early stages therefore outside of the hospital they are essentially anchored to a machine with wheels that’s about the size of travel luggage. It’s essentially used as a bridge for people waiting to get a heart but they do have long term cases where it’s more of a destination therapy (meaning your going to live the rest of your life with this). </p>

<p>There are a lot of moral and ethical dilemmas surrounding this still and there’s a lot to be learned. Since the heart is a machine it can essentially go on forever even as the rest of the body whithers away around it.  So you have questions like at what point do we literally pull the plug which at this point is a huge grey area outside of brain death and even then it’s not an easy decision. Turning off the machine means stopping the heart which isn’t the same as stopping medications and even ventilators (machines to help you breathe) and allow the person to pass (die) on their own.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I never considered this aspect of mechanical hearts. That sounds like a really bad dilemma.
Thank you for your perspective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't see how it's really any different than someone on bypass or ventilator, assuming they're non-responsive in a hospital. Whether its lungs or heart, it's still the oxygen deprivation to the brain that kills you; halting breathing I assume would take longer to be fatal though. Why does the machine being internal or extarnal make that much of a difference morally? When artificial lungs are eventually released on the market, would that have the same moral grey area? </p>
<p>Not trying to argue, just genuinely curious why it is viewed so differently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, heart rate speeds up due to increased demand for oxygen. If you can't get enough oxygen, your muscles give out, and you feel faint. If it continues, you'll pass out due to lack of oxygen to the brain.</p>
<p>Might have further knock-on effects on other organs, but I'm not a doctor or anything.</p>
<p>I'd expect that if you have an artifical heart, you're told in no uncertain terms that you should not under any circumstances strain yourself for extended periods. You'd probably get real weak and dizzy and sit down until it passes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine that you’re so out of breath, it feels like you’re going to pass out...now imagine that no matter how hard you breathe, you’re not able to catch your breath.</p>
<p>It’s probably a lot like that.</p></div>		</li>
