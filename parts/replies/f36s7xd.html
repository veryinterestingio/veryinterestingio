			<div class="markdown"><p>This is similar to when folks get new tires installed after 50k miles on their car. The new tires are always &quot;so much better&quot; than the old ones. Yet, they're comparing the old tires after 50k miles of wear to brand new tires, with zero miles of wear. A real comparison would be comparing the old tire model, while brand new, to the new tire model.</p>
<p>While science can be used to explain this, I 110% agree with your logic.</p></div>		</li>
