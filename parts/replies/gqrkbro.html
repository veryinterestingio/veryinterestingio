			<div class="markdown"><p>In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletics_at_the_1904_Summer_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_marathon" target="_blank">1904 Olympic marathon</a>, only 14 of 32 runners finished, due in large part to there being exactly <em>one</em> stop for water on the entire course in 90 degree heat. </p>
<p>The gold medal winner spent the last ten miles drinking strychnine mixed with brandy and was <em>carried over the finish line by his support team</em>. I haven't read every last page of the Olympic rules but I'm fairly certain none of what I just said would be allowed today. But nothing better exemplifies the ridiculous chaos than the Cuban entrant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not having eaten in 40 hours, he stopped off in an orchard en route to have a snack on some apples, which turned out to be rotten. The rotten apples caused him to have strong stomach cramps and to have to lie down and take a nap. Despite falling ill from the apples and taking a nap, he finished in fourth place</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I agree that today's marathon is much more in line with what it should be I can't help but think that the survival aspect of old-timey Marathons provide more opportunity for outstanding performances.</p>
<p>Like a mix of modern day marathon Parkour with added opportunistic looting to survive, could be interesting.</p>
<p>As long as you don't own any food or water along the route of thousands of hungry and thirsty athletes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back then (late 19th century) it was also a common belief that training for an event would deplete their energy for the event.  So people would lead super relaxed lifestyles with minimal physical activity for months to save up their energy for the event.  That sort of &quot;preparation&quot; was really only possible for rich folks.</p>
<p>There is a grain of truth to this approach, most modern athletes will taper (reduce the length and intensity of) their workouts in the days or maybe a few weeks leading up to important competitions.  However those old rich folks were not training like modern athletes do everyday.  So rather than preparing their bodies for competition, they were probably just getting themselves even more out of shape and increasing the probability of injuries during their competition.</p></div>		</li>
