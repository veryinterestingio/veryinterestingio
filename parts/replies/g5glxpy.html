			<div class="markdown"><p>We do not really have the technology. The problem is not merely scooping up a sample of Venusian cloud (80%+ concentrated sulfuric acid), which is hard enough, it is then keeping it intact and preserving the microirganisms that <em>might</em> be in it on the slooow trip back to Earth. I am sure it can be done, but it will need a lot of testing. My guess is that a mission there to see what there is will happen as a preliminary, like the Mars rover programme. So â€“ time? 2035? Wild guess!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Does this mean keeping them alive, dead but intact, or from completely disintegrating leaving no trace of life? I would have assumed that at the very least traces of cellular components could be left behind?</p></div>		</li>

Is that even safe?</p></div>		</li>
