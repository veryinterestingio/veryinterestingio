<p>It's just coincidental timing.</p>
<p>Say it takes an hour for a pint to go through you, you have a pint at 6pm 6.20 amd 6.40. You'll be ready to pee the first one at 7 but you can probably hold that, so at 7.20 you'll pee the first 1 and a bit. Then at 7.40 you'll the rest of the second and the third.</p>
<p>So you started at 6 and then peed at 7.20 and 7.40. Feels like you broke the seal but actually it's just the delay in liquid going through you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what I said.  Breaking the seal is simply the moment when the none-stop cycle of your bladder being filled by your kidneys constantly because it's not reserving any liquids for your bloodstream. And since you keep drinking then it seems like some seal is broken and you have to pee all the time after not having to go for a long while. </p>
<p>So it's a myth in that there is no magic seal to be broken. But the concept of you did not have to pee a ton before but once it starts it's constant is a real thing.</p></div>		</li>
