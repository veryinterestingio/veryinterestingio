			<div class="markdown"><p>It's about rotating coordinate systems. I wanted to say kind of like, you've got a map with north/east, and another grid that points north-east and east-south a bit. In both grids the distances between points remains constant, even if the &quot;units&quot; of measurement change a bit. I guess that was a bit I skipped over (it's been a minute since I engaged with this on reddit, if you can't tell from the linked posts).</p>
<p>In spacetime we think of &quot;events&quot; like points are in just space. An event is a point in space at a particular moment in time. If we were to &quot;rotate&quot; our spacetime &quot;grid&quot; (by moving relative to one another) we would disagree on where events in space are or what time they happen at. <em>But</em> we would always agree on the total separation between them.</p>
<p>The distances in space are &quot;circular&quot; d^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 . The separations in spacetime are s^2 = -(ct)^2 +x^2 + y^2 + z^2 (in the case where we have separate units for space and time directions)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a graph with two directions, up/down and left/right, first is time in seconds the other is space in meters (that's not an analogy, btw, that's how dimensions work). Now imagine an arrow of some length with one end at 0. That arrow is your speed through space AND time (again, not an analogy, literally how this works) and stays the same length, always. You can rotate it around the centre 0 like a clock hand. The more left it points (faster through space), the less up it points (slower through time) and vice versa.</p></div>		</li>
