Our research also draws on fundamental discoveries we’ve made through our research in the Office of Science’s separations program.  </p>
<p>And people way above our pay grades in other parts of the Federal government have been working on <a href="https://www.natlawreview.com/article/treasury-department-finalizes-regulations-to-govern-45q-tax-credits-carbon-capture" target="_blank">crafting tax incentives</a> to spur commercial deployment of these technologies in the U.S. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you very much. For a lay person like myself, the assumption is that CC is being funded by private companies and organizations, but seeing some of the large amounts of money DOE-FE is committing to the problem is re-assuring.</p>
<p>45Q regulation is very interesting as well, operating solely on a carrot system (with no stick.) I tried to read the regs and... they are very complicated.</p>
<p>Thank you again for the answer and your great work!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi! I can’t believe I missed this AMA. But just wanted to add in - there’s strong bipartisan agreement (and action!) in Congress that the best way to move technologies like CCUS forward is by increasing funding for DOE and the National Labs (including PNNL). They do the groundbreaking early-stage research that private companies simply can’t afford to do—it’s too high-risk, they lack the resources and the facilities, etc. But working from discoveries made by PNNL and other federal facilities, private industry can put that knowledge to use, implement and adapt it to their purposes, and then commercialize it. The Energy Act of 2020 includes provisions on this. And the Securing American Leadership in Science and Technology Act (full disclosure: introduced by my boss) would double research funding at DOE and focus on clean energy tech like CCUS.</p></div>		</li>
