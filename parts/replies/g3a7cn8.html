			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. I think it’s wrong to categorise it as painful. I’ve had two compulsory tests - the first did however seem to irritate my wisdom teeth and I had a couple days of manageable pain but the second test was completely fine which I’m sure is the experience for 99% of people. I wouldn’t want someone who hasn’t had the test to be scared of it by reading this thread. I’m a wuss when it comes to this stuff and honestly it is over so quickly it’s fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I'm afraid of. I get migraines if light hits my eyes the wrong way, I can't imagine how miserable I'd be after something like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've gotten frequent blood tests, and donated gallons of blood.</p>
<p>I'd much rather do that than the COVID brain tickler.  Really annoying/irritating for at least a day, had to park my car near the testing site and rub my nose afterwards, eyes tearing.  Not completely normal-feeling for a week.</p>
<p>As you mention, reactions may differ.  I tend to get nasal allergies/irritation, for instance.</p>
<p>Though there's other tests now that are close to the accuracy.  The Rutgers spit test is pretty close, apparently.</p></div>		</li>
