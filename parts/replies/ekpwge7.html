<p>You don't grab a Permanent Marker or Dry Erase too often so a lot of times when you do need them it has a good chance of being dry.</p>

<p>Joking aside, do you have a lot of experience with how long does it takes for a marker to dry out? I have a whiteboard and like 20 colored markers (not sure if these counts as permanent or non-permanent markers). I've had them for close to 2,5 years and they're not dried out yet, but do most markers use 1-Propanol as solvent?</p></div>		</li>
