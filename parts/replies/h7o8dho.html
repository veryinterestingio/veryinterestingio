			<div class="markdown"><p>300 fps is the first framerate that's a multiple of both 50 and 60. Little harder to achieve, but not impossible.</p>
<p>Though frankly, dynamic refresh rates are more practical at that point (G-sync, Freesync, VRR).</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's also legacy there. The original frame rate of 30/60 (30 frames, 60 fields) was required due to the 60Hz frequency of power in the US and elsewhere. In Europe, their power was 50Hz so their frame rate was 25 (with 50 fields).</p>
<p>That was for black and white. When color TV came along, in order to sneak the signal in there, they tweaked it to 29.97 frames per second. That stayed in the US and other NTSC countries, <em>even when HD was standardized</em>. So we still have ridiculous frame rates for TV, 29.97/59.94. If you watch sports on ABC or FOX you're seeing 59.94 frames per second.</p>
<p>Scaling 24 (for film) to 25 (for Europe) was a mess, and often led to movies being faster and higher-pitched. Scaling 24 to 29.97 was &quot;easy&quot; but first we tweak it to 23.976 and then add fields (so pushing 23.976 into 59.94 interlaced). This is pretty perfectly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-two_pull_down#/media/File:3-2-Pulldown.svg" target="_blank">3:2</a>.</p>
<p>TL;DR -- we're still dealing with wacky video math from the 1940s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hexadecimal is base 16, not 12.  And fractions work exactly the same.</p>
<p>5/10 = 0x5/0xA</p>
<p>Base 12 is duodecimal.</p>
<p>In base twelve the same fraction would use the same symbols.  5/A</p>
<p>As A=10, B=11, and 10=12.</p>
<p>10/12 = A/10</p>
<p>Is that easier? Only if you learned base 12 numbers to start with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I wrote that poorly. I meant that I had a basic understanding of Hex, so I'd assume a base 12 would work similarly.</p>
<p>But yeah, my brain understands the world in base 10, so I mentally switch back and forth whenever I have to do something with hex. I feel it will be the same for a base 12 system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What problem? The infinite precision problem? What I mean by that is to increase precision means adding more numbers behind the period, which is why each symbol needs to be unique. Minutes aren't actually in base 60 but it works because we never need to extend the number in our current format. If you have more than 60 minutes we count that as hours which is actually in decimal. I see now how my prior wording could be confusing, not differentiating between hours on the clock and hours as a measurement of time. Hm. Also hexadecimal is base 16, not 12.</p>
<p>It's a lot easier to think about smaller bases. Let's break down how decimal works first though. Counting up from 1 you get to 9. &quot;Base 10&quot; means 10 unique numeric symbols (including 0), so you need to figure something else out to keep counting. So we say that 9+1 leaves you with &quot;one 10&quot; and &quot;zero 1s&quot;, or 10.</p>
<p>473 is &quot;four 100s, seven 10s, three 1s.&quot; Note that each number's position heading left is in multiples of the base, we'll come back to that. Think of it as &quot;four 10^2 , seven 10^1 , three 10^0 &quot;</p>
<p>Binary is base 2. You only have 0s and 1s. This is 0 through 8 in binary: 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111, 1000</p>
<p>Same idea. Let's look at 5 more closely: 101. That's &quot;one 4, no 2, one 1&quot; or more accurately &quot;one 2^2 , no 2^1 , one 2^0 &quot;</p>
<p>Hexadecimal just needs 6 extra symbols, so 11 would be &quot;B&quot; and 15 is &quot;F&quot;. 473 is &quot;1D9&quot; or &quot;one 256 (16^2 ), thirteen 16s, nine 1s&quot;. Try it on a calculator, 16^2 + (13×16) + 9 = 473.</p>
<p>Anyway, that was probably more long winded than necessary. Numbers behind the period (would that be called heximals in base 16?) are still subject to division rules so anything that applies to integer division applies there. So yes, a more divisible base is helpful even behind the period.</p>
<p>Here's the brain-melting part. You know how I keep harping on the multiples of base thing? Well it works backwards too. The decimal 0.43 is &quot;zero 1s, four 1/10s, three 1/100s&quot; or in scientific terms &quot;zero 10^0 , four 10^-1 , three 10^-2 &quot;. So .5 in decimal (half of 1) is .1 in binary (literally one 1/2)!</p>
<p>Fractions work exactly as expected and surprisingly long division, long multiplication, all those hand written classic methods work perfectly fine in other bases. Try it out! Anything that divides evenly simplifies to an integer and anything that doesn't extends beyond the period. ie decimal 7/16 is .4375 but in hexadecimal it's simply .7</p>
<p>In many cases infinitely repeating decimals disappear, which is rather the point frankly. 1/3 decimal is .3333, 1/3 in base 12 is simply .4. Remember the trick is to get the base you want to be the denominator. That whole &quot;4 1/10s&quot; thing is back again. 1/3 decimal is (times 10) 10/30 and (divide 3) 3.33/10 or &quot;three 1/10s&quot; and change, hence .3333. 1/3 in base 12 is (times 12) 12/36 and (divide 3) 4/12 or &quot;four 1/12s&quot;, hence .4</p>
<p>It's normal if these screw with your head! Try writing them out by hand in long format.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the detailed explanation. :)
The part about how it's all based on exponents of the base number should be more obvious, but I never thought about it that way until you typed it out.
Now base 12 and other bases make much more sense, and I have never seen or thought about fractions in other bases before, except fractions of an hour etc.</p></div>		</li>
