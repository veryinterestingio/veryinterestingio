<p>His main fear with development of a vaccine is that the SARS/MERS vaccine efforts mostly failed due to vaccine induced enhacement, and he cites other instances of this like with dengue and HIV and others.</p>
<p>Heck the Wikipedia article on this has coronavirus as the first section:</p>

<p>As Osterholm says in the podcast (I'll paraphrase): &quot;Making a vaccine is trivially easy.  Making a vaccine that is safe and effective is very very difficult.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of the massive, long-lasting damage to public health in general if a vaccine with even 1/10,000 severe side effects got pushed through.</p>
<p>Think of what the anti-vax movement would turn into for decades (if we were <em>lucky</em>) afterwards. </p>
<p>I want a vaccine as bad as anyone. I want kids back in school and people back at work and businesses functioning as normal.</p>
<p>I'm not sure I'm willing to trade public trust in vaccinations to achieve that goal and the devastating effects that would last generations as a result if it goes wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Granted it's hard to see the mortality rate of this current disease unless we do widespread antibody testing, but if it were really one or two percent then that's very likely a one in ten thousand risk of serious side effect is perfectly acceptable.  Kind of like even if vaccines caused autism they'd still be worth taking.  I've yet to see an anti-vaxxer stance that even if you were crazy enough like them to accept at face value would actually warrant halting vaccinations as a whole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a legit concern of mine as well. In my opinion even 18 months are not enough. Companies are jumping into phase 1 trials without doing preclinical re-challenge studies in animals first.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We are also going to be running the very real chance that multiple vaccines being developed with such a large spotlight is going to cause the public to question vaccines as there will obviously be failures and changes needed which occur during initial development. Usually these would be behind closed doors in labs but so many people are paying attention to unproven trials undoubtedly something will be disappointing which will hit the news hard.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is there a reason why they couldn't concurrently run phase 1 trials while doing these re-challenge studies elsewhere? This is a global pandemic, after all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Luckily SARS-COV-2 does not seem to be mutating that much. </p>
<p>At nextstrain (GISAID) there are 3000+ sequences (more than flu) and the mutations do not go beyond 20-30 distance yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another point on the importance of good testing of a vaccine.</p>
<p>Public trust.  If we were to ram thru a vaccine in 8 months, and 3 years later it turns out it makes fifty percent of us sterile, how would public trust view vaccines?</p>
<p>How would all the stupid anti vaccination Facebook morons capitalize on this?  </p>
<p>18 months is a short span to create and test a vaccine, regardless of the risks of the disease, especially when you consider the potential harm to people and the system if we get it wrong.</p></div>		</li>
