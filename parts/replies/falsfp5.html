			<div class="markdown"><p>I have the issue of having dry skin on my face after I shower even though I don’t use any facial scrubs or soaps. Could it be that I produce less oil on my face than average or is it more so due to the temperature of the water as it contacts my face, genetic reasons, etc.?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're like me, the water is too hot and you have naturally dry skin. Make sure to exfoliate every once in a while and use a toner then a moisturizer after showering. It makes a difference. The toner helps add water to your skin that you seal in with the moisturizer. If you don't use the toner it's like oiling one side of leather, it's glossy, but still dry and might still crack. </p>
<p>If your face skin is dry the rest of you is probably more dry, so don't neglect the rest of your skin. Dry skin heals slowly and is more likely to crack and get infected. Healthy skin isn't vanity! It's preventative healthcare! Take care of your organs!!</p></div>		</li>

<p>I use a <a href="https://www.ulta.com/luna-3-normal-skin?productId=pimprod2007241" target="_blank">Foreo Device</a> daily along with a <a href="https://www.ulta.com/goat-milk-moisturizing-cleanser?productId=pimprod2003141&amp;sku=2538071&amp;cmpid=PS_Non!google!Product_Listing_Ads&amp;cagpspn=pla&amp;CATCI=pla-295703662999&amp;CAAGID=58530948953&amp;CAWELAID=330000200001682459&amp;CATARGETID=330000200001478984&amp;cadevice=m&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA58fvBRAzEiwAQW-hzRI8USS4sx7HJlCxDqidNuu_I3rh1clfXJY9t3e_Pjk0_cagtUQHcxoCVcoQAvD_BwE" target="_blank">Goat Milk Moisturizer Cleanser</a>. It is a powerful clean and this face wash provides amazing results. Fancy hoo-ha’s aside I swear by this cleanser. Anyone with sensitive <em>dry</em> skin should give it a try! Preferably when you can get it on sale. Pro tip: save up Ulta points and purchase these to treat your self!!!
I can’t wait to add in your recommendation about toner, thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of what you’re saying is right but a body wash usually contains sulfates that will destroy your face skin’s natural moisture barrier. In this case a body wash is the extreme harsh cleanser and using it on your face will cause more oil production in the long run as your skin desperately tries to rehydrate itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Amen! Unless your body wash is 100% sulfate free, you should not be using it on your face—especially if it’s dry and oily!</p></div>		</li>
