			<div class="markdown"><p>But isn't there also a lot more uncertainty because of non-linearities that could change like El Ni√±o, the Jet Stream, ocean conveyor belt, polar vortex, etc. I understand how rising sea levels are easier to predict, and on average the temperate regions suitable for various plants and animals will shift away from equator, and some places might have more confident predictions, but 50 years from now, it seems like a lot of the local predictions other than sea level rise could be way off. No?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer, I'd just add that, depending on where you want to model, an RCM might be overkill for simple temperature projections.  The prairies, for example, can be modeled pretty well at GCM resolutions.  Areas with lakes, ocean coastlines or mountains won't model this way at all well.</p></div>		</li>
