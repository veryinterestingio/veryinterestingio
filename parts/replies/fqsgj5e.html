			<div class="markdown"><p>The focal length of the human eye is approximately 22mm. But that is also a gross understatement, because the human eye is curved, so it simultaneously has a field of view approximating a fisheye lens at about 130 degrees. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the human eye is 35 mm then why do many photographers say that 50 mm is &quot;comfortable&quot; to look at because it's what our eyes see all the time.</p>
<p>The website <a href="https://www.colesclassroom.com/5-top-reasons-why-you-need-a-50mm-lens/" target="_blank">Cole's classroom</a> said that &quot;The 50mm yields a 'normal' perspective and field of view similar to what we see from our very own eyes&quot;</p>
<p>I'm not doubting you, I've heard both 35 and 50mm are closest to the human eye but I've never really looked at them side by side.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A lot of that may be because that completely depends on more than just the focal length of the lens. Film format/sensor size matters. 35mm lens w/film or full frame is equivalent to 52mm on a APSC format sensor.</p>
