			<div class="markdown"><p>What if you sleep for like 15 hours the day after an all nighter? I’ve heard various answers in regards to if you can catch up on sleep over the weekend- but that’s usually in regards to not getting enough sleep, as opposed to getting no sleep. </p>
<p>Also why are doctors still expected to do these crazy long shifts and be on call for ridiculous lengths of time? It seems like doctors, of all people, would want healthy working conditions- for their own sake and the sake of their patients.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look, before I say anything else, I'm no expert. Anyway, I've heard it helps a bit to sleep more the night after an all nighter, but it won't get you back to a level where you function 100% optimally. You'll probably need more nights for that.</p>
<p>I believe the idea is that doctors are expected to work long shifts so they can better monitor the care of patients who have to stay at the hospital for a longer time. When transferring patients between doctors vital information might be forgotten to be communicated to the next doctor or something like that. I'm not sure.</p>
<p>I do know that according to some studies people's productivity starts to drop really bad after working for 10 hours. Therefor I believe that no one should ever have shifts longer than 10 hours. It is bad for your health and bad for productivity. No one gains anything from working longer than 10 hours.</p>
<p>Also, take breaks frequently if you can (about 10 minutes every hour), it also improves your health and productivity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Relating to doctors, I believe there are studies that show mistakes in patient care actually increases more when the doctor switches than the doctor that’s been awake for 24 hours. So basically just taking the lesser of two evils relative to patient care. Source, my friend who is a doctor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC, it doesn't really matter how much nights you didn't sleep as much as you should before the two weeks of recovering. After two weeks of sleeping according to a healthy schedule your body is likely fully recovered from your 4 years of bad sleep hygiene.</p></div>		</li>
