Iâ€™ve heard all plastic bottles and containers have to be squeaky clean before going into the bin. But I always wonder how they could inspect each item on a conveyor belt for that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of that stuff ends up in landfills.  We essentially only want clean paper + water bottles in the recycle bin; most of the stuff people toss in the recycle bins is contaminated. To add, recycling now costs 2x more than just dumping to landfills so the only reason some places still recycle is to meet county mandated diversion requirements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if they are recyclable or not.  If they aren't, then they end up as trash even if you toss them with recyclables. Lots of stuff, even when supposedly recyclable, isn't recycled at many facilities.  They can't deal with it.</p></div>		</li>
