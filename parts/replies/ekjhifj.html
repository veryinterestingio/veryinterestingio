			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, we are currently exploring the possibility and hardware requirements for orbiting radio telescopes to expand the EHT's UV coverage. There are many technical difficulties associated with this, from the need to know a precise location relative to other telescopes--difficult to do when you're whipping around at 20,000 km/hr--all the way to transferring the huge amounts of data collected during a campaign back to Earth. Daniel Palumbo (a CfA grad student) recently wrote a <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AAS...23134721P" target="_blank">terrific paper</a> describing the benefits and imaging applications of space VLBI.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since greater distances between telescopes give us higher resolution, it sounds reasonable to think BIG and think about having telescopes on different planets. There are however a few fundamental difficulties with this idea.</p>
<p>The first difficulty is that, because a long telescope-to-telescope distance (what we call a 'baseline') is only sensitive to very fine detail in the structure of the source that you look at, you miss almost all of the radiation coming from the source when you correlate the signals. You only catch the tiny bit of power that correlates well over such a long baseline, associated with the finest details. This means that the telescopes you use on that baseline need to be EXTREMELY sensitive - if I were to guess, they would need to be kilometers in size each if they were situated on Earth and on Mars. For a short baseline, say a few hundred meters apart, your baseline catches basically all of the power coming from the source (everything correlates nicely) so the telescopes don't need to be that sensitive.</p>
<p>The second difficulty is that in order to perform interferometry successfully you need to have very precise knowledge of the relative locations of your telescopes. This is why in EHT the positions of the telescopes on Earth need to be known to within a fraction of a millimeter, so that we know how to shift the signals against each other in time so that they correlate. Even so, we need to search around for the correct delays when we correlate as the Earth's atmosphere makes this delay wiggle around all the time. Knowing the relative position of a telescope on Mars with respect to a telescope on Earth to within a millimeter sounds like an incredibly difficult thing. I'm not saying it is impossible, but it is unlikely to be done for the foreseeable future I think.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Besides the Moon and Mars, which have hostile environments (higher UV radiation, very sharp regolith dust, higher temperature extremes in day/night cycles...  Mars with its dust storms)...</p>
<p>There's also very stable points in orbit around the sun called Lagrange Points.  The gravity interactions between the Earth and Sun give 5 locations where staying in place relative to the Earth takes very little fuel.  The most stable of these are L4 and L5.  (Every 2 body orbital system has a set of Lagrange Points...  Moon/Earth, Saturn/Sun, etc.)</p>
<p>The greatest challenge for Very Long Baseline Interferometer (VLBI) telescopes like the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is that they need to know the locations of each component's aperture relative to every other aperture down to very precise dimensions.  The tides on the Earth will move a specific telescope by several inches throughout the day...  The data shared between the stations have to include this motion down to sub-millimeter changes over time.</p>
<p>With space-based radio astronomy, each station will have direct line of sight with every other station.  They'll be able to shine a laser at every other station in its constellation and know their precise location relative to every other station.</p>
<p>This also gives a secondary opportunity, beyond the constellation's primary mission of radio interferometry measuring light from distant object... laser interferometry measuring distances between craft can detect gravity waves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would be concerned with doing that with how the environment of Mars is. How do you protect against those dust storms? How do you protect the snow which is finer than sand here? You'd have to create alot of protection for the telescopes which might make it too expensive compared to putting the telescopes on the Moon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Using the Moon's surface alone would most likely not be better in terms of resolution because that depends on the size of the array and the Moon is smaller than Earth, but there would be no atmospheric interference to deal with.  A combination of Earth and Moon might be a good next step, though. (I'm not a researcher, just know a few things)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would transmitting a large volume of data from one satellite to another be easier than transmitting it to Earth?  With Earth, you have to worry about interference with various Earth based devices and the atmosphere restricts which frequencies you can use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the atmosphere does influence the observation. That's why all the telescopes are located in the remote mountain areas where the influence of the atmosphere is minimized. Also, this is also the reason why we chose this specific wavelength. For the second part of the question, there are thoughts of sending satellite telescopes to the earth orbit, the benefit of doing which being to extend the coverage of longer baselines and also minimize the influence of atmosphere. But it is in the future.</p></div>		</li>
