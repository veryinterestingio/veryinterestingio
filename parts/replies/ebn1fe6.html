			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of the re-breather technologies out there involve chemistry that doesn't like water. That....can be an issue, for obvious reasons. There's also just simply more failure points than for traditional supplied air. Compressed gas and a valve is about as simple as it gets</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm completely speculating but I would imagine that you use a rebreather for dives that require being underwater for a significantly longer amount of time. Either super deep stuff or exploring caves. This increases the risk significantly compared to regular dives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are several ways to die on a rebreather, and many subtle variations on those ways. The two most dangerous are lack of 02, which will cause you to pass out and drown, and you won't have any warning signs of it. And excess C02, which causes uncontrollable panic. Both can be avoided with rigorous equipment checks and maintenance....but some extremely competent and skilled divers have died this way. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the re-breather malfunctions you will be breathing in increasing levels of CO2 that can be very hard to notice until it's too late and you lose consciousness. This is dangerous enough at shallow depths but re-breathers are commonly used by technical divers that go to 50m+ where any small mistake/malfunction is life threatening</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You forget to breathe because there is no CO2 triggering the sensors in your lung.</p>
<p>Edit:Removed inapplicable information</p>
<p>After doing some research I've found out there could be problems with the loop that add too much or too little oxygen resulting in oxygen toxicity or hypoxia respectively, this can also be caused by overworking the scrubber resulting in CO2 being let through.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Since you only use 25% of the oxygen per breath, you can re-breath that air, plus a little oxygen to bring it back up to 20% concentration</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This only means that oxygen concentration is not that critical. You still need quite a lot of oxygen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but you lower the amount by 3/4, theoretically, because you aren't wasting 75% of the oxygen per breath. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>O2 concentration is extremely critical. If O2 concentration falls to .10 ATA or less, you will black out. If it becomes too concentrated, 1.6 ATA, it becomes toxic. That is why rebreathers that function on pure O2 are not intended for deep dives. US Navy Dive Tables allow 240 minutes on pure O2 in a 24 hour period, but only at a depth of 20 feet of sea water. Any time you go deeper it is called an excursion. From 21-40 FSW, you can only spend 15 minutes and from 41-50 FSW, you can only spend 5 minutes before you have to return to 20 feet.</p></div>		</li>
