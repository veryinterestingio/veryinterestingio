			<div class="markdown"><p>I think of it as the basic computing software of our brain. Our brain makes thousands of calculations a second even when we are just walking, analyzing the ground and objects around us to make sure we don't misstep or run into something. In a sense our brain is creating a 3D map subconsciously so as to not mess up and hurt ourselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good comment. Think about how much your brain does automatically, you know how to get to the store, to your mothers/fathers house almost instantaneously, your brain stores that information because it knows you need it on a regular basis, it has neurons dedicated to doing that, it seems instantaneous to you, but your brain is just running the pattern.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More like our brain is naturally really good at seeing patterns. So when on a specific psychoactive substance that interacts heavily with our visual cortex, we see a lot more of these geometric patterns.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's incorrect, MRI scans show that rather than increased brain activity, there is actually reduced activity in other regions. So your brain is always doing this, it's just that these substances remove the barriers that are constantly being put in place</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You know what I wanna know? Why when I'm on a heavy dose of LSD, why do I see fractals moving in a counter clockwise direction at a uniform interval like a ticking clock? Almost every time I am on the drug I see this and it has always perplexed me. I'm guessing it might have something to do with my heartbeat, but I'm not sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>LSD vision is definitely an interesting one. I was intrigued by this post because I did DMT once and kept my eyes open for a bit, and it literally turned the towel on the floor I was looking at into a geometric block of whatever, and then whatever else I looked at, but the towel had me fucked up fr.</p></div>		</li>

<p>However, there always seems to be a differentiation between open eyed visuals and closed eyed visuals.</p></div>		</li>
