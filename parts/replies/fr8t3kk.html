			<div class="markdown"><p>To further your point, the confidence in the market(air in the ballon) is what sets the estimated value of stocks and houses. This is the unrealized gains of a stock, it becomes realized gain/loss once it is sold.  So it is slightly misleading to say the money was lost overnight without ever selling the asset as the values are estimated.  They still have the assets they are just at a lower estimated value. If they sold the assets they would have lost all of that value.</p></div>		</li>
