			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the question! It comes up often. Women with a specific variant of the MTHFR (the 9C677T variant) are less efficient at using folate. Women with this and certain other genotypes (or set of genes or arrangement of nucleic acids in a gene) have difficulties metabolizing folic acid into the bioactive form of folate. For women with MTHFR C677T, folic acid supplementation was associated with even greater protection against ASD in the child in our study. This has yet to be replicated in other studies of ASD, but is in line with evidence from studies of neural tube defects where mothers/children with MTHFR C677T genotypes needed higher levels of folic acid. So while they are not as efficient at using folate, increasing the supply of folate (with folic acid) is helpful. </p>
<p>Supplements and fortified foods typically contain folic acid (pteroylmonoglutamic acid) because it is stable and inexpensive to produce. Folate from folic acid supplements has been shown to be more bioavailable than the natural form of folate in foods. </p>
<p>For women with gene variants in a different gene (i.e. DHFR) that limit their ability to use folic acid specifically, they might want to use folinic acid or methylfolate (5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF)) to circumvent that metabolic step. There is little research on these other forms of folate for pregnancy outcomes (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26630680?dopt=Abstract" target="_blank">here is one</a>), but some work has shown they might treat deficiencies more efficiently (see <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5059208/,%20https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24494987" target="_blank">here</a>). -RJS</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Drs. Schmidt and Lawler, thank you so much for this Q&amp;A session!  I have a question:  Dr. Schmidt mentions that taking folic acid whilst pregnant reduces the chances of the autism in the infant.  But women with the mthfr gene mutation have trouble processing the folic acid. That mutation and the folic acid consumption is known for an increased number of autism cases.  Women with the mthfr mutation are encouraged to use folinic acid instead of folic acid.  So my question is:  shouldn't all women be encouraged to use folinic acid - and NOT folic acid - because the majority of women do not know if they carry the mthfr mutation?</p></div>		</li>
