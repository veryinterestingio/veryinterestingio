			<div class="markdown"><p>The continental crust is different in composition (more felsic) and formed from more evolved silicic magmas, which resulted in less dense crust. The more mafic in composition oceanic crust is denser than that continental crust, and subducts beneath it and is therefore more frequently recycled.</p>
<p>Early Earth probably experienced a more significant amount of silicic volcanism (both intrusive and extrusive), which resulted in building much of the present day continental crust.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for some new concepts, but im still stuck on trying to visualize the continents originally forming. Did they form as a cluster, sort of like pangea? Or isolated islands (doesnt seem likely). So why did did one big continent form on just one third of an ocean planet? And then it broke apart and all of that old oceanic crust just subducted?  I think i am just asking questions that no one knows the answers to? Why is that?</p></div>		</li>
