			<div class="markdown"><p>We can infer the velocity of objects from the Doppler shift of their emission spectra. If we look at distant galaxies we see that their velocities are all away from us and proportional to their distance from us. I.e either everything in the universe is expanding away from specifically us (unlikely) or everything is expanding away from everything else. The second option is better supported and means that space time itself is what is expanding.</p></div>		</li>
