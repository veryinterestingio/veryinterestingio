			<div class="markdown"><p>As a dentist what are your feelings on non alcohol mouthwashes? I use one and find it to work well, but is there something I’m missing without the alcohol? I usually do a normal floss, then waterpik, then mouthwash, then brushing. Is that enough to keep my mouth healthy? I’ve noticed a severe change in how much plaque and tartar is building up with this new system, but would I be better off getting an alcohol based mouthwash instead?</p></div>		</li>
