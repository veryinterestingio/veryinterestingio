			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, thank you.  I think it's also important to mention in this time of anti-vaxers that contracting many illnesses can leave you with long-term or chronic problems permanently.  Many people use what you said to justify a &quot;it's better to build immunity the NATURAL way&quot; attitude.   Both my in-laws (asthma and post-polio, among others) and my daughter (fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and autoimmune) were left with chronic illnesses that have drastically impacted their quality and length of life as a result of diseases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And this virus appears to have a lot of at least long term after effects.</p>
<p>Many people are experiencing malaise months after their infection. Similar to some of those that get Mononucleosis. Yet to be seen if it is chronic however like some cases of Mono can be.</p>
<p>Also some people are experiencing ED and impotency, which should be enough to get 99% of men on board with getting a vaccine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Long term effects are critical to study, but it hasn't been done on a large scale in an ethical way that I've been able to find (The Lancet study into chronic fatigue was withdrawn for shoddy science and unethical methods).  There's been active avoidance, I'm assuming because of potential treatment costs, but it could be that medicine, like any other human endeavor, resists change - change of approach, change of assumptions, change of treatments.  So many people who have fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome have a connection to an earlier illness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's certainly not life a servere change, compared to alternatives, but as a healthy 30 year old male having gotten covid - 19 2 months ago, my sense of taste and smell are still not back to what they were, and don't seem to be getting any better. Definitely better to avoid contacting an illness, rather than risk death or a permanent change in one's faculties.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed!  So sorry to hear of your challenges.  I sincerely hope you get better over time.  My daughter is in the hospital again right now due to her chronic conditions caused by a childhood illness (still not sure what it was - could have been Cat Scratch, a Gillian-Barre varient or a novel virus).  Atm, it's affected her digestive system to the point that she's not absorbing nutrients and the blood she's making is breaking down almost immediately.  Every time I get the opportunity, I talk about the consequences of &quot;living&quot; through an illness.  Vaccinations are the biggest triumph of medicine!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A vaccine is like your body getting insider information to defeat the enemy before invasion. If your country was under attack you'd prefer to know how to win the war before it even started then try to figure it out during. </p>
<p>I'm still mad though that Covid canceled me getting the HPV vaccine.</p></div>		</li>
