			<div class="markdown"><p>Sagan talked a bit about this, too.  A simple concept usually is categorised by a number of facts, and categorically linked to other facts that share the same data.  So if someone or something refreshes another category in your mind that just so happens to contain the original memory you were looking for, you often can remember the original thing.</p>
<p>What we teach in lower level psychology these days is that one of the strongest ways to memorise information is to associate it with humour -- if they try to remember a funny concept at each stage of memorising terms, people can memorise upwards of thirty precise instructions in less than a half-hour (which several of the students demonstrated).  It never worked for me, though, so either my sense of humour is too specific or my most-likely-low-level Asperger's is too cynical and skeptical. ;-)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aren't younger brains more &quot;trainable&quot; too? Perhaps if you tried the technique when you were at school you'd have more success.</p>
<p>Is the &quot;room&quot; technique still used? When I was desperate for study tips I remember coming across this one - Use a familiar room in your house or your whole house and associate that which is to be memorised with a peculiar story related to objects around the house. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is why many exceptionally creative and intelligent recommend constantly exposing yourself (no, not that way) to new things by reading, talking to people, or visiting new places. Every new thing you learn gives you something new to connect to the millions of things already in your brain and helps with your own creativity and understanding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to add that the letter/syllable you imagine is correct often is not.</p>
<p>And then there's something else OP can try: Whenever I can't find the word I want to say, the concept is still there in my brain, and I can quickly find a synonym or a translation.</p>
<p>That means somewhere your mind does indeed know what you are wanting to say, but you simply can't form the word.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I am trying to remember stuff that’s on the TOMT, I usually use the phrase, “Not [___], but...” and put a synonym for the thing I’m trying to remember in the blank. Oftentimes, my brain will just complete the phrase with the word I was trying to remember.  Not foolproof, but it works more often than it doesn’t. </p></div>		</li>
