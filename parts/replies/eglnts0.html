Tragically, we used to not bother fixing them, because they didn’t live long/weren’t thought to be able to live meaningful lives. Now, by treating their medical conditions like everyone else, many people with DS live full lives into their 50s-60s. </p></div>		</li>

She lived a happy life, and died at 33. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a special education teacher and this is a big component. Also, a lot of this is due to the unpopular No Child Left Behind legislation of the Bush era. One of the positive benefits was that it forced schools to actually educate <em>all</em> students and create plans that challenged each individual student based on their needs. The downside is that this is extremely expensive for schools. The upside is we have made society a better place for a significant portion of the population (and I'd argue for us all). </p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;You are about to be told one more time that you are America's most valuable natural resource. </p>
<p>Have you seen what they do to valuable natural resources?! </p>
<p>Have you seen a strip mine? </p>
<p>Have you seen a clear cut in the forest? </p>
<p>Have you seen a polluted river? </p>
<p>Don't ever let them call you a valuable natural resource! </p>
<p>They're going to strip mine your soul. </p>
<p>They're going to clear cut your best thoughts for the sake of profit unless you learn to resist, because the profit system follows the path of least resistance and following the path of least resistance is what makes the river crooked!&quot; - Utah Phillips</p></div>		</li>

<p>Because anyone with half a brain realizes that the wall isn’t going to do shit and that Trump spews lies about it. Is the most recent trial for El Chapo it was straight up admitted that the vast majority of smuggling comes through the ports that already exist. They factor in the loss when shipping, they know they’ll lose some, but it’s a hell of a lot better than trying to go through the desert. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish our schools encouraged kids to find other opportunities and solutions than just schooling. Too many kids are just dragged through a broken system because the expectation is for them to follow one path. Those that fall behind still get pushed through because giving individualized attention isn’t feasible on a broad scale.</p>
<p>Trade schools exist and are absolutely terrific, but get stigmatized because people think they need schooling when the entrance gap for jobs on that route becomes smaller and more expensive. Kids get by without learning proper time management or study skills, or even countless other life skills they need. And nobody sits down and helps them figure out what they’re actually interested in, they’re just given a slew of classes they have to accomplish and they don’t experience a whole multitude of educational and occupational opportunity.</p>
<p>If schools weren’t just shoving as many kids as they could through the pipeline and actually set kids up for success by laying out different paths and helping them find their niche, everyone would benefit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;All&quot; and we put dangerous special needs kids in classes with normal kids. I've had books thrown at me by the math &quot;savant&quot; but he was heavily autistic (I was asked to be a special needs assistant as a HS kid due to my ability to treat them like normal) and my mother has been injured by being forced to teach special needs kids. Some of these kids get locked up in padded rooms when they freak out. These kids are often not fit to be taught in our normal schools and need a separate service so kids who aren't in need of special treatment aren't threatened or lose their access to education just so the special needs kids can feel normal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My wife is an early intervention teacher, and one of the things they do is integrated preschool classrooms. The special needs kids are in the same environment as the &quot;typical&quot; kids and benefit from the early socialization. This also has the added benefit of acclimating their peers to those with special needs, helping foster empathy towards those they will grow up with.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was in High School, I felt that somehow my not being normal was somehow because us SPEDs were just all put together and we didn't need how to learn how not to be weird because we were all weird and it was okay.  I might be an aspie exacerbated by educational abuse.  Some people I could probably identify &quot;aspie&quot; or &quot;trauma&quot; but I'm not sure of anyone's diagnosis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ugh, that empathy piece is essential. I work with children from four different schools, one of which serves a lower income community, two of which are average and one that is a ritzy Spanish immersion school that parents have to apply to to get their child accepted. The Spanish immersion school has no special needs program, and the number of times I've had to pull OLDER KIDS that go there out of gym to explain to them why one of our students with fetal alcohol can't do what they do is astounding.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I usually start with the question, &quot;do you know what it means to have special needs?&quot; and one of them just straight up said no in a proud way. When I started explaining things to him, you could just see his face go blank as he realized how serious this shit is. I've also tried, &quot;have you ever known anyone with special needs?&quot; and gotten a &quot;no&quot; out of two older boys separately, even though they've been enrolled full time in afterschool care with multiple other kids with special needs. Without an awareness of special needs these kids just go around calling other kids names and not understanding anything. I'm constantly tasked with being an empathy coach for kids from that school.</p></div>		</li>

I've seen kids with DS helping their mom clean houses and plenty of others selling things in traffic in the sun.
