			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly it.  Where I live (in Canada) there was a big news story about grocery stores price-fixing bread a few years back.  They offered $25 gift cards to anyone <em>who came in</em> and claimed they had bought <em>unspecified name brand</em> bread from a given list of locations before some time in 2015.  I don't know it there was any other penalty, but here's the thing:</p>
<p>They admited they had been involved in this price-fixing scheme with their competitors for <em>fourteen years</em>.  I don't know how many gift cards they ended up giving away, but I'm sure it was a slap on the wrist compared to how much money they made over the course of those 14 years.  Plus, they were gift cards, so even if it's technically losing them money, people still have to come shop at their store to get anything out of it.</p>
<p>There wasn't much in the way of outrage, either.  They still operated normally, selling everything else.  I don't even think anyone got fired over it (although I may be forgetting.)</p>
<p>So yeah, whatever the laws may be, the enforcement is a joke.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is just another example of Amazon being able to excercise monopoly power. They are a not just a seller of goods, they own the major market that all those goods are sold on.  The market power they are able to wield using the data they collect + the network effect of the Amazon marketplace is insane. On top of that US anti trust law enforcement is specifically not designed to be effective in these kinds of situations. All goes back to the Robert's court and their interpretation of antitrust. Basically anything that causes the direct to consumer price of a good to go down,remain, or only go up for explainable non monopoly related reasons is a-ok. This is an oversimplification of the Roberts Court rulings that are used as precedent in almost every antitrust case today, but helps to explain that it is not prepared to deal with the market makers we see today such as Amazon and Google</p>
<p>Edit: Refering to Justice Robert Bork here during his time in the Federal Court system not the Supreme Court, luckily he was rejected for that seat. Also how the saying all Borked up was created</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You didnâ€™t even have to go to a store. I filled out a form online with my address, checked a box that pinky swore I had bought bread in the past 5 years and got a 25$ card in the mail a week or two later.</p>
<p>Funny part is that card is still siting in my wallet unused (and probably expired) because I forgot all about it until you just mentioned it now.</p></div>		</li>
