<p>If mushrooms have cell walls made of chitin, the same substance that makes bugs crunchy, why do mushrooms have a &quot;meaty&quot; texture? What makes them meaty?</p>
</li>
<li>Most animals normally eat their food (mouth, chew, swallow) for nutrients and what not. How does fungi do this if they don't have a mouth to eat?</li>

<p>For your second question, they secrete <a href="https://www.csus.edu/indiv/r/reihmanm/kingdom_fungi.htm" target="_blank">enzymes and digest it externally</a>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not pure chitin in either case, just a shared main component. To my knowledge the structure and fillers are different between the two. And mushroom cell walls are microscopic, whereas bug shells are intentionally bulked up and reinforced.</p>

<p>You don't really need a mouth to eat, our digestive system is just the animal approach to breaking down huge amounts of food at once. Your teeth tenderize hard things, your stomach holds the food and secretes strong acids to break it down even further, and you have special cells in your gut that absorb as much of the broken-down nutrients as they can. </p>
<p>Most living things follow that same pattern of a) Secrete out some sort of chemical to help break things down, then b) absorb the nutrients into their cells. Just with different bells and whistles to add efficiency. In the case of fungi they use their &quot;roots&quot; to slowly break apart and absorb nutrients from whatever they're growing on (trees, soil, etc).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the first question, this excerpt from wikipedia seems to explain:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In its pure, unmodified form, chitin is translucent, pliable, resilient, and quite tough. In most arthropods, however, it is often modified, occurring largely as a component of composite materials, such as in sclerotin (...) This composite material is much harder and stiffer than pure chitin, and is tougher and less brittle than pure calcium carbonate.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitin#Chemistry,_physical_properties_and_biological_function" target="_blank">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So basically, chitin on its own isn't &quot;crunchy&quot; on a macro level unless it's mixed with added composite materials. Although it still is protective enough to provide a functional cell wall on a microscopic level.</p></div>		</li>
