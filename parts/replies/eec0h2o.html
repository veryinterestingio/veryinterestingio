			<div class="markdown"><p>Some chemicals have a property known as polarity, which means that the electrons are unevenly distributed in the molecule. This is because the molecules consist of a variety of elements, and some elements are better at holding on to electron density that others.</p>
<p>When this is the case, areas of high electron density have a relative partial negative charge, and areas of low electron density have a relative partial positive charge. There is attraction between the partial charges between the molecules.</p>
<p>Water has polarity. The oxygen is good at holding electron density, and the hydrogens are not so good, so electrons in the O-H bond spend more time around the oxygen, leaving the hydrogens electron deficient. This means that the partially negative oxygen end of a water molecule attracts the partially positive end of another water molecule.</p>
<p>Fats do not have polarity. They essentially have similar electron distributions in all directions, which cancel out.</p>
<p>Water and fats do not mix because the polar water would prefer to attract another polar water where there is strong affinity, rather than a non-polar fat where there is no affinity. Polar and polar is good, non polar and non polar is good, but polar and non polar is not good. </p>
<p>Lecithins have some parts of the molecule which are polar and can attract water, and other parts which are non polar and can attract fats, so they can attract both water and fats and allow them to mix together. Soaps work in a similar way. We call them surfactants because they interrupt the attraction between the molecules and therefore interfere with their surface tensions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're welcome. Simple experiment you can do to demonstrate that water has polarity: take a plastic ruler, rub it with a cloth duster to give it a bit or static, and hold it next to a running tap. You'll see the water bend towards the ruler.</p>
<p>This is because, depending on the material, you are either adding or removing electrons from the ruler. This is what static is: an excess or deficit of electrons which electrically charges the material (the static shock is caused by electrons moving from one material to another to balance out again).</p>
<p>The electrically charged rod will then attract the water because of the uneven charge distribution in the molecules.</p>
<p>It's important for chemistry students to recognise (and a very common mistake) that polarity is just a charge distribution, and not a formal charge. A formal charge occurs when an electron is fully removed or added to the atom, such as in an ionic bond.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what is interesting is that when I went vegan, I thought baking would be a no go without eggs. There are different substitutes that work the same, but my personal favorite is ground flaxseed mixed with water. There’s a specific amount for each but it’s really cool because eggs were the one thing I thought you couldn’t sub </p></div>		</li>
