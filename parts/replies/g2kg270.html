			<div class="markdown"><p>Serious coffee drinker here. Never understood this about some people, as I've never once had coffee affect my bowel movements. I can drink coffee all day and my bowel movements remain regular. They're more affected by changes in the actual food I eat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So that one I can answer. Part is that everyone is different, part is the coffee you drink. Instant has no effect on me. Ground coffee in a paper filter sometimes helps things along. Ground coffee with a metal filter is guaranteed  to get me moving. </p>
<p>Different preparations take out some of the oils that trigger the effect.</p></div>		</li>
