			<div class="markdown"><p>The protections from the National Radio Quiet Zone (NRQZ) have done a great job at keeping most RFI away, or at least manageable. The NRQZ only regulates terrestrial commercial transmitters, though (cell towers, TV broadcasts), so it doesn't protect us from satellite interference or things like microwaves, and WiFi. The West Virginia Instrument Zone is a state law that was passed around the same time as the NRQZ came into existence, and it helps protect against local interference (WiFi, microwaves, etc.) within 10 miles of the observatory.  </p>
<p>In practice, I don't deal with much interference in my work, because the kind of science I do is usually at higher frequencies. The GBT can operate from \~150 MHz to 115 GHz, and most of the RFI is at the lower end of that range, up to a couple GHz. That's where cell phones, walkie-talkies, and WiFi operate. That said, we're starting to see more and more RFI at higher frequencies from things like car radar and new satellite constellations (Elon Musk's Starlink, for example). Most times, organizations are willing to work with us to prevent interference, but when they don't or can't, we usually just have to ignore that part of the radio spectrum (basically throw away the data).</p>
<p>We have a few filters on the GBT that block out chunks of the spectrum where there is always RFI, but mostly, that RFI is taken out by the astronomer who took the data. We're starting to get some &quot;real time RFI excision&quot; code working that will identify RFI in real time and automatically take it out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's a shame the FCC pretty much doesn't care about interference, anymore (unintentional or not) unless it's to commercial TV/Radio/Air traffic. We have to deal with that in Amateur Radio all the time. :(</p>

<p>That's actually pretty cool!</p></div>		</li>
