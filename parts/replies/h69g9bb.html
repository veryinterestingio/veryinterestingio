			<div class="markdown"><p>But why don't they ever enter the home even accidentally, as other insects do? Bees and wasps have no reason to be indoors but leave all your doors and windows open on a sunny day and you'll probably have at least one find their way there. Butterflies never do this though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They also are also keeping an eye out for a nice place to nest.  I used to get plenty of wayward wasps and borer bees (and flies and stinkbugs but that's another story) aggregating at my windows trying to get out.  Had my windows replaced, no more bugs.  My conclusion: they were creeping in the cracks in my crappy old windows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most butterflies like sunny but sheltered areas, like woodland openings. They wont even fly into the wooded areas because they like the sunlight and spend a fair amount of time basking. Your garden is a fairly appealing place for a butterflies whereas the interior of your home typically isn't.</p>
<p>That said, I have personally had butterflies inside my home, they struggle to get out just the same.</p>
<p>The numbers game is also important as mentioned above. Assuming you are in the US there are about 25 times as many species of fly as there are butterfly and in terms of individuals it will be many, many times more than that. Butterflies are a lot less common than flies.</p></div>		</li>
