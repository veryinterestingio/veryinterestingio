<p>The predictions of big bang nucleosynthesis, for example the ratio of H1 to He4, are also consistent with observations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aha. So it's just an optical wall, clever phycisists can actually probe deeper into it by  measuring its fluctations and comparing that against theory and simulations. Makes sense that any 2 points on the wall got history, but it baffles me that we are able to read backwards from it. Really speaks for how good the theory actually is. Have to admit that I don't quite understand those slides, but I'll read more into it.  Thanks for the answer. </p>
<p>This also made me more stoked about the possibilities from measuring gravitational waves. Wouldn't we have to develop much, much more sensitive equipment for that, or should there be some powerful sources from behind the wall? Really interesting topic! I'm somewhat of a layman, but I got to read more into this so I can follow it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The term &quot;wall&quot; is misleading, and it's not just optical.</p>
<p>The early universe was hot enough that stable atoms could not form- a hydrogen atom, for example, is a proton and an electron. In the early universe the electrons were so energetic that they couldn't be captured by the protons, and the result is that almost all the matter in the early universe was ionized (it had a magnetic charge). The result was that it was very difficult for anything- photons, electrons, protons, etc. to move in a straight line for very long.</p>
<p>Then, at some point the universe cooled down to the critical level, and all those electrons and protons nearly instantaneously combined to form stable neutral atoms rather than the ionized soup before. This allowed photons to propagate freely for the first time. The result is that the universe went from being &quot;opaque&quot; to &quot;transparent&quot; everywhere and at nearly the same time to not just light, but all electromagnetic radiation: light, radio waves, cosmic rays, etc. </p>
<p>The existing photons at this moment in time suddenly found themselves travelling freely through the universe without anything to stop them, and they continued travelling like this until the present day, slowly cooling down. This is in fact the Cosmic Microwave Background that we talk about. </p>
<p>Thus, the current day patterns (or lack thereof) observed in the CMB are a clue as to what the universe looked like at the moment when it became transparent. We can't see past the CMB, but we can look for patterns in the CMB that inform us as to what its initial state was like.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that inflation and then the singularity itself form a &quot;wall&quot; that so far nothing suggests we'll be able to &quot;see beyond&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Incredibly well described bravo. OP you should totally read this comment!</p>
<p>I’ll add that for novices the detail of how fast the universe expanded during inflation and thereafter can be confusing bc they think that the universe can’t expand faster than the speed of light, but it can and does (or at least has). For instance based on your explanation without knowing that the universe expands faster than the speed of light it would only make sense that we had 300,000 years worth of CMB light (technically 600,000 if we were on the outer edge of the universe).</p>
<p>So to anyone reading this that doesn’t already know, the universe expanded faster than the speed of light for at least part of that 300,000 year period and so the light from the CMB started over billions of light years away from us despite the universe being only 300,000 years old. This is one of the ways we know something “inflation” occurred!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you were standing in space next to the spot where the big bang happened, and it happened, would you be affected?</p>
<p>I expect one answer will space was contained within the big bang and so the question doesn’t make sense, but I am still curious</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He does mean sound. They somehow calculate, after measuring light from one place on the &quot;wall&quot;, where this light originally came from shortly after the big bang. This cause and reaction didn't travel as light within the medium, but as a fluctuation at the speed of sound in that medium. (they have to talk about some integrated speed of sound between the wall and closely after big bang here... some sort of average?). From that speed they get the density of the early opaque universe.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>At least this is how I understood it. But speed of sound is in any case correct :)</p></div>		</li>
