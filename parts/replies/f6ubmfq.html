			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, don't rely on any smartwatch to give you even halfway decent sleep data. That's just not something these companies have actually bothered to do rigorous testing on, so they throw in some app that proclaims to track your sleep, but is actually just making wild guesses off unreliable and contexless information. Do not buy into the marketing hype. These are professional salespeople trying to convince you that their device is helping you, when in reality it's basically just spitting out random results loosely based on the physiological data (heartrate and movement) that it is capable of taking in.</p>
<p>As far as I know, literally no medical professionals have actually studied and supported the science and efficacy of these smart watch devices. But I'm not a medical professional, and I'm no longer in tech support for these garbage things, so maybe it's changed and I'm wrong, but I'll need to see some actual studies before I change my opinion</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We still do not know a whole lot about sleep in general. In scientific studies you get hooked up to lots of sensores and even then it probabely is most reliable to ask subjects how rested they are rather than trying to calculate it from measures. So i highly doubt any smartwatch or - phone can accurately record the time and quality of your sleep</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wore my Fitbit during a polysomnogram (sleep study) and it was way off. I slept for 2.5 hours according to my Fitbit, 7 hours according to the sleep study.</p>
<p>The sensors I had for the sleep study included multiple on my head, eyes, jaw, legs, heart, arms etc.  Sleep is way more complicated than &quot;not moving heaps&quot; which is what Fitbit seems to track</p></div>		</li>
