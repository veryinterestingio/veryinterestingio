			<div class="markdown"><p>No, film does not have that kind of resolution. Sure, you can scan it at that resolution, but at that point no detail is resolved anymore because of the grain. In controlled tests super 35 film, which most movies were shot on, comes in at a lower resolution than 4K (or 8 megapixels). 35mm (so 1.5x larger than super 35) scans at roughly 10-24 megapixels depending on the resolution, and that's slide-film (note that movies are shot on negative film), which has a higher resolution.</p>

<p>EDIT: Here's a cinematographer comparing super 35 scanned at 6k to a 3k and 6k digital video.<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah makes sense, thanks. Do they have to re-do all of the special effects if any were done digitally? I remember watching a documentary about how BTTF was filmed and if memory serves they were all practical effects, but say a movie shot on film with digital VFX's added before release, if that movie was to be re-released at a later date in higher resolution, would the digital VFX have to be re-done?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There would be a master print in 35mm of the edited film with effects.  That's the one which would be used to make copies and ship to theaters across the country.</p>
<p>You should be able to make a digital copy of the old analog master without having to redo the effects and re-edit the film.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an example, consider <em>Babylon 5</em>, whose CGI scenes were revolutionary at the time ... but the render process was done at broadcast resolution and not future-proofed. The live scenes, in contrast, were shot on actual film, and framed for eventual widescreen release.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They often do have to redo VFX, yes. Someone made quite an interesting rant about the <em>Buffy</em> HD remaster <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZWNGq70Oyo" target="_blank">here</a> which touches on a lot of this stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh... boy. I've seen so many things regarding the Buffy HD remasters and... it's so disappointing that they cut so many corners. I only ended up watching a few episodes a while back and I remember going back and forth from happy to horrified at what I was seeing.</p>
<p>It sounds like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEWykz-c6Qk" target="_blank">the Baywatch remasters are just about as bad, even without the need to redo lots of VFX.</a></p></div>		</li>
