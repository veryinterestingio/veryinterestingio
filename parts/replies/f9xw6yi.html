			<div class="markdown"><p>Very important point as well - many of those photons from the fire that hit surrounding materials are ABSORBED by those materials. If you have a campfire that's surrounded by big black rocks, for example, only a small percentage of the photons hitting those rocks are reflected at all, many are just absorbed with their energy converted to a tiny bit of additional heat added to the thermal energy given off by the fire. </p>
<p>You'd see the surrounding area of that fire a lot more clearly from a distance if the rocks around it were, say, a limestone white rather than a basalt black.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sun can heat the Earth hot enough to literally cook things from millions of miles away. Your stove can’t cook food that’s not directly on the burner. I would’ve figured that was all the perspective anyone needed on how powerful the sun is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your camp SITE brighter, yes, in terms of the local area. </p>
<p>But the best way for it to be seen from a distance is to place the campfire at a high point, where people can directly see the flickering flame. That pinpoint of slightly moving light will instantly draw peoples' attention.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great point that is being largely left out of this discussion. A camp fire does in fact illuminate the surrounding area pretty well, but good luck appreciating any on the illumination after you light blind yourself.</p></div>		</li>
