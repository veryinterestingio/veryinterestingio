			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your question! To be honest, I am very concerned about the state of the oceans, which is why I am pursuing a career in marine conservation! As you mentioned, there are many threats facing our oceans, and each of them requires massive, global efforts to solve. </p>
<p>The biggest challenge we face, in my opinion, is global climate change (causing ocean warming and acidification), which will require a global solution and coordination from governments around the world to address in a timely fashion. </p>
<p>What makes me optimistic is the huge number of professionals and concerned citizens who care and are working towards solutions. Science and innovation can help &quot;buy us time&quot; - for example, we are working to restore coral cover that has been lost and help corals adapt more quickly to warming oceans. Also, lots of everyday people are working to reduce their plastic consumption, eat more sustainable seafood (or not eat meat at all), and advocate for changes to ocean policy. </p>
<p>It seems like momentum is building for a global movement to prioritize environmental issues, so I am hopeful for the future! </p>
