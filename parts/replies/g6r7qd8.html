			<div class="markdown"><p>Yesssss! The top comment answered why they do it, and this episode delves into why the ad is different than the game (in short,there’s data that suggests the type of people who click on that ad are more likely to get hooked on the actual game). </p>
<p>EDIT: added in a “not” at the end. I have no idea why</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ALEX GOLDMAN: And when I told Jess about the fake ads that you got  and that I got, she was like “Oh, yeah. That’s a thing that companies  have been doing for a while.” </p>
<p><em>JESS JOHO: Yeah, so  that is absolutely not a new strategy. They’re basically using it as  targeted advertising for a specific type of player who they've  identified as their power players. The people who spend the most time,  spend the most money on in-app purchases. And so they just throw in  whatever they know will appeal to that specific type of player.</em></p>
<p>ALEX  GOLDMAN: And what these companies have realized is that these power  players are way more interested in the fake game that they’ve advertised  in these ads than the one that they’ve actually made, and I was like,  “Ok, well, why don’t they just make that game then?”</p>
<p><em>JESS:  Well, because that would be a lot more money, right? Like that would  cost, that  would actually cost money to make a whole new game with a  whole new game system and a whole new game loop that, you know, works.  That takes years and years and years of development.</em></p>
<p>PJ VOGT: Ohhhhh.</p>
<p>ALEX  GOLDMAN: But it’s pretty simple to just make like an animation that  just looks like a new game, get people to download it, and then like,  mopes like me, by the time they hit level 25, they’re like hooked. And  on top of that, I kept playing well past the point at which I should  have stopped. Cause I was like, “Well maybe I just haven’t unlocked that  level yet.”</p>
<p>PJ VOGT: That’s so infuriating.</p>
<p>ALEX GOLDMAN: (Laughs)</p></div>		</li>
