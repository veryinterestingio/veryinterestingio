			<div class="markdown"><p>It would take way, way longer than a month of perfect quarantine for all human viruses that don't infect any other animals to go extinct. Not only is perfect quarantine for that long impossible (most people aren't equipped to grow their own food, never mind all the other essential services that still involve either people coming in contact with other people or stuff being passed from one person to the next), but <em>a lot</em> of viruses can live for a very long time in either surfaces or hosts. </p>
<p>Think of HIV. People with it can be asymptomatic for decades, while still being able to spread it. There are also loads of viruses that can remain infective after years of being outside a host. There is also a massive amount of viruses that are in other animals, such as monkeys, mosquitoes, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well active ones, yes, but in places where viruses are being studied or are buried in permafrost, it's still possible for them to make a resurgence. Or, additionally, any other disease that incubates longer than a month or x amount of time.</p>
<p>That's not even mentioning zoonotic diseases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, colds spread easier in the winter time because of less humidity. Humidity causes resistance against the air you exhale. So when you sneeze or cough it doesn’t travel as far of a distance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the other way around. Humid air is less dense than dry air. Warm air is also less dense than cold air, too, and that means less air resistance in warm or humid air. The physics of it is well studied, and it's called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_gas_law" target="_blank">ideal gas law</a>.</p>
<p>So we can basically rule out the idea that the cold slows in summer because humidity reduces sneeze velocity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. You're likely to interact with more people, but the contact isn't as close. If you sneeze in a park the droplets might hit the friends you're walking with. If you sneeze in a pub they could reach the people at the next table. There are also a lot more common surfaces indoors, viruses land on tables and the like, then get picked up by other people.</p></div>		</li>
