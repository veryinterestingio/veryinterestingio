			<div class="markdown"><p>Umm... Basically, the cross section is the main thing that matters, as long as the copper/aluminum is of standardized grade and not porous etc.</p>
<p>However, there is a factor that comes into play with AC power - skin effect. This is a phenomenon where AC current generally tends to get conducted near the surface of conductor, in some cases leaving the middle unused. This is not a big factor in residential 120/240V, but it is something taken into account when dealing with power distribution. Strictly speaking, larger surface is less prone to not using the entire conductor as a transfer medium, but it's just not a factor in residential (and industrial) installation - it gets to be a serious factor when we start talking hundreds of thousands of volts. </p>
<p>Strands, generally, do not reduce skin effect as individual wires are not insulated from one another. They are viewed as a solid conductor with some holes inside by AC current.</p></div>		</li>
