<p>it would be super difficult to ever actually charge someone who was recently president, because resignation and pardon from your vice president is really easy and completely legal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It also seems to be historically difficult for recent presidents to actually be held accountable for crimes committed as they are always pardoned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, presidential pardons are a topic that I am not nearly educated enough on to properly have an opinion on, but given that, that amount of power is terrifying. And it's not just presidents that aren't held accountable, it's a lot of their underlings too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. I hate the level of division we've reached as a country but I really feel like we need to stop letting these things go &quot;so the country can heal&quot;. It stops us from pointing back in time and saying — &quot;see him, he was a terrible terrible man, and a traitor to this country, don't ever find yourself in a position where you are compared to him&quot;.</p>
<p>Similar to how the civil war is still glorified in certain corners of american culture. </p>
<p>Prioritize your compassion for the victims and he innocence, not for the guilty.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;The pardon powers of the President are based on Article Two of the United States Constitution (Section 2, Clause 1), which provides: The President ... shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States, except in Cases of impeachment.&quot;  - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_pardons_in_the_United_States" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal\_pardons\_in\_the\_United\_States" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal\_pardons\_in\_the\_United\_States</a></a></p>
