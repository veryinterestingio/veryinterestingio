			<div class="markdown"><p>Breaking our current understanding of physics and nature isn't as scary as it sounds because it already happened one century ago. </p>
<p>There were consistent and accurate theories with Newton's laws of motion, gravity, Maxwell equations, etc. Some people thought that we were on the verge of understanding everything. There were only two small experiments that didn't have a suitable explanation.</p>
<p>The Michelson-Morley experiment ended up with the conclusion that the speed of light is a natural constant independent from the frame of reference, and suddenly we had to accept that time is not an absolute, simultaneity is relative, distances can shrink, spacetime can bend, and the Universe had a beginning. General Relativity.</p>
<p>The black body spectrum measurement ended up destroying so many of our ideas back then. We found out that nature can exhibit different phenomena depending on how we observe it, that particles and waves are the same thing, that nature is so random that an object exists in different states all at the same time, and so many other things. Quantum Mechanics.</p>
<p>We could be at a similar moment than the late 1800s. We have very solid theory that predicted a lot of phenomena, considerably changed our lives and have proven very robust. Yet here and there are a couple experiments and observations that doesn't quite match, that look weird and that we cannot explain.  If that is the case, then brace yourself because we're ahead of some very exciting times!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this:</p>
<p>The two theories that so far predict the universe so well make contradictory predictions in their only known shared domain. At least one of them MUST be fundamentally wrong. It'll be a very exciting time to be a scientist when the roof comes crumbling down.</p></div>		</li>
