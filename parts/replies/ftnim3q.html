<p>Continuing on to the other hand you have 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512. So with all ten fingers it is possible to count to 1023, aka a gigabit of information in your hands...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>1023 is FAR, FAR, FAR from a gigabit.  What you think you're describing is only a kilobit, and it's not even that.  It is just ten bits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You still only have 10 bits as the poster you're replying to has mentioned.  You're giving each bit a value, but that value isn't actually encoded in the storage mechanism (your fingers).  Instead its stored in your operating system (your brain).  10 bits gives you 2^(10) potential finger positions, which happily is a total of 1024.  You then assign a value to each position which gives you a number between 0-1023.  </p>
<p>However you're not getting the same number of potential values in a kilobit (2^(1024)) which is massively large if all you're doing with that many bits is counting.  (not Tree(3) large, but its a pretty big finite number I don't feel like trying to write out).  You can see how much different 10 bits (2^(10)) is from 1 kilobit (2^(1024)).  What you can do counting in base2 on your fingers is record the value of the number of bits you need to make a kilobit.</p>
<p>I used to tweak my old DOS games to try and squeeze out enough KB to get graphics <em>and sound!</em>  Plus I was a storage admin for a few years (my rebel phase).  Don't mean to be annoying, just wanted to explain the terms you were using a bit better in case you want to use them in a technical environment at some point.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Kibibit.   </p>
<p>Kilo means thousand, so a kilobit is one thousand bits.  Because computers like to work with powers of two, there's a name for the power of two closest to one thousand: kibi.</p></div>		</li>
