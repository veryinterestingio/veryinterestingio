			<div class="markdown"><p>Down Syndrome is the most common trisomy (triplication of a chromosome). Many other genetic disorders which result in unique facial features also result in short life-span, while infants with DS are likely to live into adulthood even with the common heart defects. </p>
<p>Looking at frequency rates, it does seem like DS is fairly common to occur. I'm finding stats between 1 in 700 to 1 in 1,000 births.</p>
<p>So, short answer: Yes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Risk goes way up with maternal age, it's more like 1 in 100 if the mother is 40. For a young mother it is far lower.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are other trisomys (three of a chromosome, when there should be two), but most of them are fatal (the fetus just doesn't develop-- you probably wouldn't even notice you're pregnant). There are a few reasons why between a sperm and an egg you can get three of a chromosome, but none of them are particularly interesting and it would take a while to type.</p>
<p>Bananas and other seedless fruit are a good example of how we can take advantage of trisomy. Breed a diploid (2 chromosomes) with a tetraploid (4 chromosomes) strain of banana, you'll end up with a triploid banana (3 chromosomes). It's not an even number, so it struggles to make seeds (normally you'd pack up half your chromosomes to make a seed, just like people). Seeds get aborted, and you're left with a plant that can't reproduce, but is easier to eat. Wild bananas are chock-full of seeds and not really edible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Patau (trisomy 13) and Edwards (trisomy 18) are generally not compatible with longevity and if the pregnancy doesn’t spontaneously miscarry then approx 90-95% will die within first years of life. Downs, whilst causing health problems can go on to live a long, albeit slightly reduced lifespan. It’s for this reason it’s most commonly known also taking into account its relative frequency of occurrence</p>
<p>Edit: Ive paraphrased a little for simplicity.  There are other trisomies involving both autosomes and allosomes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pateau, Edwards and Down syndromes relate to different chromosomes (13, 18 and 21). Since those chromosomes contain different genes, why is there such a strong overlap in symptoms (e.g. nuchal translucency, tricuspid insufficiency, PAPP-A and hCG both being down in Edwards and Pateau etc)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't be specific but often these syndromes disrupt developmental pathways. It's a different reason for the disruption, but the same pathway is harmed. Embryos don't have that many of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this also a case of survivorship bias? The symptoms listed are the ones compatible with life, where maybe trisomy 16 (to pick a random chromosome) would look different but is fatal for other reasons, so we never know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would disagree that there's a strong overlap of symptoms. prenatally, there's only so much we can get without doing amniocentesis or chorionic villus testing, and none of those non-invasive tests are diagnostic, just signs that something could be wrong with the fetus. I do clinical genetic testing, and see far more chromosomally normal results from patients with an increased NT and other such non-diagnostic testing than an abnormal result</p></div>		</li>
