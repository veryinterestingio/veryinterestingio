			<div class="markdown"><p>From second hand knowledge I know that natural African hair breaks off easily. So prior to moving out of Africa and farther North there may not have been as much need for cutting hair. I think I read that the way the hair curls tightly and stands up higher helped protect the scalp from sun while allowing perspiration to evaporate. Once early humans moved North toward Europe straighter/flatter longer hair may have been better for warmth on the head and face. This is all very basic recalled information, and human memory is extremely fallible. If anyone has more insight please add on or correct me!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once heard from Arsuaga (Spanish paleoanthropologist) that  the reason why humans are the only animal that have to trim the hair is unknown, but he hypothesizes that societies develop a complex and bigger evolutionary pressure, and for humans hair is a communication symbol that could had favored the continuity of who were able to modify and shape it. This is not not that alien for other species as peafowl developed a complex (beautiful?) plumage for apparently the same reason as Darwing hypothesized.</p>
<p>Although that responses are likely be using the evolution as the the wildcard for explaining it all, so it doesn't really solve much as they all have unsolved questions too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Presumably humans living in their natural environment would have their hair pulled out before it got that long. No? </p>
<p>Just basing this on how the hair on a horses tail grows and gets pulled out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hair follicles have a life cycle. There are periods of growth, followed by periods of little growth, and eventually the hair is released and falls out. This is why different hairs have different lengths without any grooming.</p>
<p>Hair length would be more likely regulated by follicles than any kind of activity making it get pulled out more often.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps, but to my knowledge no other apes are capable of growing long hair. I wonder why we evolved that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Artifacts dating back nearly 10k years in the US SW include straps to hold bags, arrow cases, gourds &amp; similar made from braided human hair.  Female mummies in the US SW are usually found with shanks of hair cut off, making it clear that the culture saw hair as a valued source of fiber and making women with longer/fuller hair highly valued, therefore passing  on those genes.  It can be reasonably inferred that this culture was also common in paleolithic Eurasia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a very interesting point, I wonder if our natural &quot;wild&quot; length was much shorter then. When my hair was long enough to reach my belt loops, it never really seemed to grow much longer b.c of normal wear and tear (and I was babying it hardcote haha).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Wear and tear&quot; isn't really why your hair won't grow past your back. Each hair follicle has a certain amount of time it makes hair for, then the hair falls out and it makes a new one. So your hair doesn't grow past that because that's the natural upper limit of your hair. Even if you took perfect care of your hair and didn't have any wear and tear, it would never grow past that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the main reason our hair today grows so long is first of all we’re careful with it, and secondly the products we use improve hair health and strength drastically. We all still lose tons of hair per day but the health improvements outweigh that. My hair actually starts falling out at a pretty rapid pace by the time it’s six inches long - I would probably never be able to grow a man bun or shoulder-length hair if I tried.</p></div>		</li>
