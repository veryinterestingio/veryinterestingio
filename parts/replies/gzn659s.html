			<div class="markdown"><p>The risk of zoonotic diseases in humans can be mitigated, but not entirely eliminated, since zoonotic pathogens persist in animals irrespective of whether humans are part of the picture. I can’t think of a single zoonotic pathogen that has been ‘eradicated’ in human populations.   </p>
<p>The historic low in influenza cases this year was brought about because of global dampening in human to human transmission. But reducing a pathogen’s spread once it has already spilled over into humans is different from reducing initial spillover risk, which originates from contact with animal reservoirs. Reducing human to human transmission will keep spillover events from turning into epidemics, but it will not eradicate the spillover events themselves from occurring from the animal reservoirs.  </p>
<p>There are many effective strategies for reducing this risk of spillover transmission, for avian influenza and other pathogens, many of them targeting the nature of human contact with potential animal reservoirs.   </p>
<p>Here are two great papers about this:  </p>
