<p>It's not really cooked per se, it's warmed up during a part of the aging process to simulate aging in tropical climates.</p>
<p>Cheaper Madeiras might be warmed up to higher temperatures (in the 40ºC or 50ºC range) during shorter time periods, a few months at least. While the more expensive and higher quality Madeiras will be warmed up in greenhouses or sunrooms, where they'll be warmed only by the sun throughout their aging process that can last for no less than two years up to many decades.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>original Madeiras were cooked on ships as they went from spain to the new world that would take months in sail boats. There are still madieras that are produced this way. also its fortified meaning they add alcohol to increase the percentage as anything over 20% can be opened and not oxidize as fast. Hence you can open a madiera and a port and drink it months later while a regular wine might be good for 24 hours.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Again, not cooked per se. They were aged in the warm tropical temperatures of the trip.</p>

<p>And why would the wines go to Spain?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My future father in law had a bottle of vintage 1906 Madeira we drank a year or two ago. Not great but not bad at all for being 113 at the time! Then he tossed the bottle in the trash. &quot;Umm, you mind if I fish that out and keep it please?&quot; I said. Can't let something that old and cool get tossed.  Pretty sure most bottles of non fortified wine would be pretty rough at that age.  <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/hKIqgjI" target="_blank">1906 Madeira</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most bottles before the 1920's I believe were hand blown meaning someone would have to make each one the way glassblowers make other items. That bottle should not have any two lines going down the bottle like new bottles all have from machine casting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I bought my fiancée a <a href="https://imgur.com/a/gJFKJlX" target="_blank">1912 bottle</a> for Christmas last year.  Just over $1000 for the bottle.  It is wonderful.</p>
<p>Madeira is shelf stable, doesn't need to be chilled, and can last a damn long time after opening without worrying about recorking.</p></div>		</li>
