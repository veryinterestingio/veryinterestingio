			<div class="markdown"><p>There are helicopters with counterrotating rotors, but I haven't heard the noise issue as part of the rationale (doesn't mean it's not the case, of course).</p>
<p>I was just reading about the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamov_Ka-50" target="_blank">Ka-50/52</a>, an attack helo from the Russian design bureau Kamov, who characteristically use this design. The article I was reading claimed that the purpose was improved handling characteristics. In particular, the aircraft is supposed to be able to yaw flat very well, climb fast, and have roll characteristics similar to fixed wing planes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good answer except that this: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>P.S: Jet engines work entirely differently, even if they do have fans at the front they're for compressing air into the engine, not generating thrust.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Isn't true for most turbofans anymore. Big, high bypass engines get more thrust from the fan (which is sortof like a prop in a tube) than the core engine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, but instead of using a ducted tube of a fan, it uses a propellor.</p>
<p>It's cheaper than a turbofan, because instead of using hundreds of high speed ultra precise blades to the fan, it uses a few old school propellor blades.  But it's not as efficient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All of these &quot;turbo-&quot; engines have gas turbine engines. These engines take air in from the front, run it through a multistage compressor in the front, a combustion chamber in the middle, and a turbine in the back. The compressor and turbine are on the same axle, running down the middle of the engine.</p>
<p>In a turbo-jet, the engine pumps a lot of air through the engine, and spits it out the back at high speed. This jet of exhaust provides the thrust.</p>
<p>In a turbo-prop, the engine drives a conventional propeller, which provides the thrust.</p>
<p>In a turbo-fan, the first stage of the compressor has an oversized input fan, and this blows most of the air around the engine, not through it, through the engine cowl. Since it does not have to compress the &quot;bypass&quot; air, it can pump a lot more through the cowl than through the engine. The thrust comes mostly from the bypass air.</p>
<p>Turboprops and turbofans both generate thrust by moving large masses of cold air, but the way they do it are different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR: Turboprop is a propeller powered by a (turbo)jet engine. </p>
<p>Long version: There's a lot of nomenclature. </p>
<p>First of all, the family of &quot;jet engines&quot; derive their power by expanding combustion air through a nozzle.</p>
<p>There are some which use <em>only</em> this jet to provide thrust. There are two common variants of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is the &quot;turbojet&quot; which people are most familiar with.</li>
<li>there is also the &quot;pulse jet&quot; (no longer really used outside of models except maybe some missiles? Not sure on that). </li>
</ul>
<p>There are also engines which use a turbojet core to power a ducted fan (turbofan) or an unducted propeller (turboprops).</p>
<p>Turbofans as a whole system are very efficient <em>at their design point</em> which for civil aircraft is around 38000ft and mach 0.87.</p>
<p>Turboprops <em>have less of an efficiency penalty</em> outside of their design envelope. They aren't as efficient as a turbofan even in ideal conditions, but are <em>less inefficient</em> at low speed and low altitude. They are also better at putting down raw power at very low airspeed (e.g. takeoff) which makes them better for short runways).</p>
<p>This is why newer tactical airlift planes are <em>often</em> propeller driven (see the A400M), as their mission profiles need low level flying, short take-off etc. wheras aircraft with very predictable mission profiles (e.g. civilian airliners, strategic airlift etc.) use turbofans and aim to spend most of their time in cruise.</p>
<p>Caveats all the way down, of course.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but the fan is still designed to create pressure as it is shrouded (as opposed to a <del>turbofan</del>  turboprop for instance), pressure that is converted into thrust via the shape of the air chamber.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it has a fan, it is a turbofan. If it doesn't have a fan it will be either a turboshaft/turbo prop or a turbo jet.</p>
<p>Turbo jet is the only turbine engine relying on the output exhaust to provide the trust completely. The others may rely on it partially, but they will be mostly getting thrust from a fan or propeller. </p>
<p>Turbojet does not have a fan, the air goes straight into the compressor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can try! Couple of reasons</p>
<p>Engine specific: In an ideal world, a prop draws air front to back, but in reality some of the air &quot;slips&quot; off the sides and goes off at an angle. The energy used to push the air sideways is wasted, which costs efficiency, thus fuel, thus range and/or money. A pair of propellers going in opposite directions helps by reversing this sideways motion and forcing more air back.</p>
<p>There may also be blade loading considerations (8 blades are pushing the same amount of air as 4 blades need only be half as strong) but I'm not 100% on that.</p>
<p>Airplane-as-a-system perspective: Engines induce a turning force (torque) on the wing. On small planes, the single prop at the front often makes it easier to roll in one direction than the other due to this torque. Having two counter rotating props basically eliminates this torque. In the examples above they have 2 pairs of engines so you could potentially eliminate this by having each pair rotate in opposite directions, but this imposes a maintenance penalty (have to keep track of the clock and counter-clock engines/gearboxes and can't just swap them around as easily) and induces some interesting aero effects on the wings (depending on configuration).</p>
<p>Airplane aerodynamics consideration: The swirly air from a single prop flowing over the wings and control surfaces can make them harder to control, or less efficient at generating lift; air is moving &quot;up&quot; on one side of the engine and &quot;down&quot; on the others. Contra-rotating props eliminate this &quot;corkscrew&quot; effect.</p>
<p>Downsides: They are so very loud. And much more complex at the prop end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't see where anyone else mentioned this, but for ceiling fans, room size is one of your main concerns. Sure, you could have a fan that was as big as the footprint of the room (minus 6&quot; on the blades so you're not hitting the walls), but you'd notice it didn't move nearly as much air. There needs to be adequate space around the fan for air to reach the inlet (just above the ceiling fan, assuming you're pushing air down). Too big a fan blocks its own inlet, because your bedroom is more or less a closed system. It's kind of like a water pump with a 4&quot; discharge line and a ½&quot; suction line, no matter how hard you run that pump, you can only get so much to come out the other side.</p>
<p>I know this isn't about number of blades, but the more you know and all that.</p></div>		</li>
