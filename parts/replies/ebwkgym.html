			<div class="markdown"><p>The group numbers are an imprecise numbering system that is wonderful for quickly referring to a series of elements with similar outer electron shells. However, it is just a reference system that doesn't include the f-block because you would then have to add 14 extra groups and there are not enough f-block elements with the same outer electron configuration to warrant it. </p>
<p>The group numbering system used to be more complex with groups 2 and 12 being group IIA and IIB respectively due to only have s-block valence electrons involved in most chemistry. As higher oxidation states were found for the heavier elements and for ease of understanding between Europe and the US this A/B system was replaced.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm from EU and IIRC when I did chemistry few years ago, we had both numbers and roman numbers with A/B (EDIT: and it wasn't like they just were on the periodic table, the teacher referred to them too)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally, they aren't considered part of any group, but a transition between the s-block and the d-block.</p>
<p>They are somewhat similar to Lanthanum and Actinium which <em>are</em> group 3 elements, but because of their weirdness being f-block elements, they're considered somewhat separate from the rest of the periodic table.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: This is what I remember from basic elemental chemistry, I am not a chemist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Close. They aren’t considered separate. The whole f orbital series would be inserted there, and everything to the right would be put far to the right. The only issue is that that would make the periodic table ridiculously long. It would just be impractical. Instead we just put them at the bottom</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting that the periodic table can be hypothetically extended.  While most of these elements are not known, if they were to hypothetically be created, we already know where they would fall on the chart due to complex math reasons.  </p>

<p>Though most of these will likely never exist due to extraordinary instability, scientists might be able to create most of them in a lab for like, 1/10,000th of a second before they break down into simpler atoms.

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the columns are there as a handy guide for talking about the similarities between atoms with the same number of valence electrons due to similar electron configuration.  In the d and f block metals, electron configuration is often non-standard and for the f block, we've only got two anyway, so seperating similarity from coincidence is  more difficult than it's worth.</p>
<p>Numbering the f block would also make existing literature on the d and p blocks (i.e. nearly all of the elements where the system has utility) out of date and potentially confusing.</p></div>		</li>
