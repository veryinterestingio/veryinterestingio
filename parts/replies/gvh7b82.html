			<div class="markdown"><p>Also (not an expert either) dogs, lions and other predators generally show their teeth (weapons) as a form of intimidation or to assert dominance. But most primates show their teeth (in a similar manner to smiling) to show submission or that they aren’t a threat. Watch some videos of monkeys interacting and generally they will show teeth while playing in totally non-confrontational ways, but predators will only show them when they need to prove their strength/are getting ready to attack, or while yawning.</p>
<p>Also read something a while back about how smiling (unnatural/forced smiling) became a common thing between passing strangers to show they are friendly as international travel became more popular (1800s) since there were so many people who didn’t speak the same language and needed to portray themselves as friendly but couldn’t verbally do it. (Think it’s called a New York Smile or New York Grin or something like that).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well there is a language barrier between humans and apes including body language.
When an ape sees a lion show its teeth it sees it as a threat even though apes do it as a social response. So potentially (again not an expert, I just research random things) an ape seeing a human bare their teeth may be seen as aggression in which the ape would respond accordingly.</p>
<p>Don’t go smiling at apes, or do.. I honestly don’t know!</p></div>		</li>
