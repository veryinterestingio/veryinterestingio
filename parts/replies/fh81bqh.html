			<div class="markdown"><p>The event horizon gets smaller as the spin increases. You would eventually reach a speed where the singularity was exposed - the event horizon gets smaller than the black hole itself.</p>
<p>In fact, at the &quot;speed limit,&quot; the formula for the size of the event horizon results in zero, and above that limit it returns complex numbers, which means... who knows? Generally complex values for physical scalars like radius means you're calculating something that does not exist in reality.</p>
<p>The speed limit is high, though. We have identified supermassive black holes with a spin rate of 0.84c [edit: as tangential velocity of the event horizon; others have correctly pointed out that the spin of the actual singularity is unitless]</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does the event horizon deform into an &quot;oblate spheroid&quot; due to spin, in the same way that Earth is slightly distended at the equatorial regions due to its spin?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe a quibble, but the spin parameter is unitless, it is not a speed. There are also published claims of spins as high as .985 for black holes in our galaxy, but these measures are very model dependent and the exact numbers should be taken with a grain of salt beyond what the statistical errors might suggest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's believed that angular momentum of a black hole cannot exceed the speed of light. Black holes might break conventional physics inside the event horizon though, and there is no way for us to tell right now.</p>
<p>Conventional physics estimates that if a black hole were to reach a light-speed spin, the event horizon would would become non-existent (specifically, it would be the size of the singularity itself), causing a &quot;naked singularity&quot;, that would be, theoretically, directly observable. Faster-than-light spins would, under this frame of understanding, require the event horizon to be entirely enclosed within the singularity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a black hole's angular momentum increases, it's event horizon thins, or shrinks. Were it's angular momentum to exceed it's mass the event horizon would cease to exist, allowing light to escape. Such a naked singularity is thought to be impossible, and thus defines the limit of a black hole's speed.</p>
<p>As I understand it, that sets the limit under the next absolute limit, the speed of light. But not by much. Scientists have reported detecting black holes rotating near the limit defined by angular momentum; approximately 84% the speed of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is one of the bigger plot holes. Much is made of the problem that Earth's people face in not being able to launch everyone out of Earth's gravity well, but they apparently already have the technology to lift themselves easily out of a much, <em>much</em> deeper gravity well.</p></div>		</li>
