			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the explication! </p>
<p>Although I didn't said '30x' for the meaning of 30 times. The &quot;30x ultra-hard stainless steel&quot; is the name of the metal (or the whole package, idk).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, good point, I didn't pick that up. We're generally agreeing though, there shouldn't be any major different in crash characteristics as a result of the steel's increased hardness. SAE did some analysis of Tesla's claims and they're pretty sure it's a 300-series stainless steel, very similar to what was used on the DeLorean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Weird choice based on cost and weight. Musk seems to love 300 series stainless, he touted it for SpaceX rockets as well.</p>
<p>Wonder what reason he has for a car. It’s probably corrosion— but you never know Musk likes to your things way earlier (for better or worse. Wonder if he uses it as a necessary step to induction charging?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't the DeLorean a deathtrap in terms of crash safety? I thought I remember reading that somewhere (and it certainly felt like one when I sat in my friend's dad's DeLorean back in the day. Wasn't even moving and it was terrifyingly claustrophobic in there)</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's a huge deal for fatigue-critical structure (stuff that goes through a lot of stress cycles) but that's also not usually a big deal for body panels, they're mostly decorative and not carrying nearly as much load as the chassis.</p>

<p>Perhaps I'm mistaken, but one of the things about the Cybertruck is that the panels <strong>are</strong> structural. That's the frame.</p>
<p>They're ridiculously thick for body panels.</p>
<p>Supposedly the whole thing is that SpaceX's rocket program produces stainless that's superstrong, but it can't be stamp-formed like most panels, you're pretty much limited to simple bends. So, they designed a vehicle around using that material that has a sunk research and production setup cost anyway.</p>
<p>The resulting frame is where the body skin <strong>is</strong> the frame.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They’re load carrying, yes. I didn’t say they weren’t structural. All modern unibody vehicles carry load in the body panels. But it’s way less than the chassis load. The main load path is between the wheels, suspension, floor, and drivetrain. That’s all down low. The body panels are only generally handling torsion and bumps.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why? What for? How is that remotely more efficient than a spaceframe?</p></div>		</li>
