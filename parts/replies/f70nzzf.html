			<div class="markdown"><p>No, this is exactly the answer I was looking for! Thank you so much!</p>
<p>It’s weird, but the science of color really fascinates me. Usually I stick to pigment history and stuff, but I’m doing research for a writing project with a blue-skinned alien species, so I’ve been looking at sources of blue in animals and microorganisms.</p>
<p>Yeah, though, that makes a lot of sense. Really explains why cyanosis mainly effects the lips and fingertips, because having cut both, they’re vascular as heck. Thanks again!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I’m aware. Even outside of this project, I’m a bit of a blue nerd, as specific as such an interest is. I’m currently juggling scattering effects vs. pigment and how hemoglobin-based blood would affect their skintone with various pigments, scattering effects, and cardiovascular system concepts. My space elves are gonna be plausible, damn it, even if nobody else cares!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Blue pigments are more common than Purple pigments, for a long time the only source was Tyrian purple, from a species of venomous marine snail, Murex. Blue could be made from Wode (Isatis tinctoria).</p>
<p>Blue pigments in paintings, frescos and books were also made from azurite and ultramarine (lapis Lazuli), and in Spain and Italy the rare mineral Aerinite. The identity of the Blue pigment, Aerinite, used in medieval art, was discovered in the 1990s.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would the scattering effects change based on the gas/medium it's in? For example, if you take a blue morpho butterfly and put it in a box of gas other than air, could its color change?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are looking for background for blue-skinned species for your story, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemocyanin" target="_blank">hemocyanin</a> is also a starting point. It gives the oxygenated blood of some invertebrates a distinctly blue colour. In this case, it's because they use bound copper instead of the iron in haemoglobin, and many copper complexes are blue. So, copper-containing biomolecules could also work for your aliens, and they could realistically serve a lot of functions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This subject is interesting to me as I’m a doctor and I regularly see the difference in colour of arterial and venous blood. The former is a bright cherry red, the latter is a much darker red. I’ve never seen a good explanation of why peripheral veins appear blue though, until now, so thanks for that, and thanks for the linked article.</p>
<p>So I understand that as haemoglobin deoxygenates, it absorbs more red light (which is why it appears darker, I assume). I’m betraying my hazy grasp of the physics here, but why, then does it appear red (outside of the vein) at all then, as opposed to say blue, or any other colour. I thought that somethings colour depended on the wavelength of the light it reflects not what it absorbs. Does deoxygenated haemoglobin both absorb and reflect red light? And I don’t really understand how if red light penetrates tissue better than blue why deeper veins appear more blue that superficial ones. Surely the deeper you go the redder things should appear as the blue light is gone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the body, the light we see isn't only the result of its interactions with blood but also with adjacent tissue. Think of it as a single unit (tissue+blood): When the blood absorbs most of the red, the tissue has less of it to scatter and thus appears blueish. The more red it absorbs the more pronounced the effect.</p>
<p>A darker red doesn't mean the blood reflects more red, but rather less. It doesn't appear blue because it absorbs other colors too and ends up closer to appearing completely black.</p></div>		</li>

<p>more red light can reach the blood where it will be absorbed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wait, I thought blood looked red because it reflects more red light, not absorbs it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>he elaborates elsewhere that since it's a darker red, that means more red is absorbed. He's not saying all red is absorbed, just more red is absorbed. I agree how he originally phrased it is a bit confusing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It absorbs red the least of all colors, therefore it's red. But it's quite dark as you can see from the pictures, so there is actually quite some red absorbed as well. The blood on the right approaches black so it absorbs the most red.</p></div>		</li>
