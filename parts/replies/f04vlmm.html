			<div class="markdown"><p>You're definitely correct here. I have to shit when I make tea multiple times a week (before drinking any). At least once or twice a week I feel the need to shit while I'm still heating up the water, before I've even started steeping the leaves. So it's even more than just the smell, the actual act of making tea can cause the pavlovian response for me.</p>
<p>Also, I almost never shit if I'm not making tea. I do make tea ~3 times a day, so I have plenty of opportunities, but my body has been trained that tea = poop.</p></div>		</li>
