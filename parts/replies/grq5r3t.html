			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a lot easier to sterilize things than people think - AND a ton of people have been mislead via marketing on what works and doesn't, and why.  </p>
<p>Honestly, modern sanitization, cleanliness, and vector spread prevention should be core educational requirements just like the basics of reading and math.  It is just as, if not, more important.  </p>
<p>Here's some good stuff on sterilization of surfaces:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a scientist and really only know enough to write the ELI5, but from what I understand there's a level of molecular bonding that happens at that layer of plastic that touches grease. The fear is not sterility because nothing is actually &quot;living&quot; there, but certain plastics can break down over time and then be ingested which could be harmful, although there has been a move to replace the most toxic chemicals in food grade plastics to mediate the problem.</p>
<p>My guess is the small particles that you would ingest that way don't meaningfully contribute to worse health, but it's also not as good of an option as the alternative which is less plastic. Personally I toss plastic containers that are getting like that because they are pretty cheap. I also do my best to not reheat in plastic because it seems to make them break down faster, but I have no idea if that helps or not.</p>
<p>Best advice is to spend the extra money upfront and get glass containers with rubber lids. Someone who knows better might be able to come along and suggest how to shop for safer/better kinds of plastic ones though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, you could read any of the other posts that are here that explain it differently, or you could Google it and see what other people have said. This is my ELI5 answer which simplifies a lot. So far no one has refuted the general idea. If you can explain it better I'm happy to hear it.</p></div>		</li>
