			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the beautiful answer, that's pretty much what I was wondering about. I have a risk factor, and tested very highly with regards to the reference. Putting variants aside, it seemed weird to me that amount of antibodies won't simply correlate with protection. Indeed, I understand that's likely the case. Thus, I assume the instruction is not to see it as a proxy of protection mainly due to the intricacy of the topics you've mentioned?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you’re asking is a good question. But vaccines are usually contemplated as community level interventions, not individualistic ones, so you may not get an answer anytime soon - it’s just not something that is rigorously studied, with population level efficacy being emphasized in research.</p>
<p>The antibody level also doesn’t account for the benefits of cell mediated immunity which is an important part, and particularly may be a differentiating effect of the viral vector vaccines (J&amp;J, AZ among others worldwide).</p>
<p>There are examples of clinical immunity being conferred even where the antibody levels are lower than the established threshold after a vaccine series (rubella and hepatitis come to mind) and these antibody thresholds are not always as rigorously established as one might anticipate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because your protection level isn't just about how many anti-bodies you have knocking about, but your ability to recognise the infection early and produce more as well.</p>
<p>The latter is something that is harder to measure.</p>
<p>We still don't know if COVID protection relies on having a strong anti-body presence ready or if that presence can drop significantly and your body can rely on the ability to produce anti-bodies from memory in response to the infection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to the excellent answers you already got:</p>
<p>It's not just any antibody that binds to the virus, you need neutralizing antibodies. This is a much more complex and time consuming test to perform.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>there's also the issue that not all serologies measure the same thing.  Most but not all commercial assays are measuring anti-spike (S) IgG.  Some measure anti-nucleocapsid (N) IgG.  This is an issue because while natural infection will provoke a response to both antigens vaccines may not, depending on their design. mRNA vaccines, for instance, provoke a response only to anti-spike protein so if you were to check an anti-N IgG after getting the pfizer or moderna vaccine it would be negative unless you'd also had natural infection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But this is easy to fix; if this was the issue, it'd be easy to tell people &quot;when checking protection, make sure you take these tests if you had these vaccines&quot;. This is a much more restricted statement than &quot;do not deduce anything about your protection from the amount of antibodies you have&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point still stands that we don't know where the proper cutoff value should be in order to say &quot;Above this value, you will properly be able to fend off COVID-19.&quot; It just hasn't been studied (yet?). All a positive IgG spike antibody test can tell you right now is &quot;You had <em>a</em> response, but we don't know whether or not it's an <em>effective</em> response.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also the serology tests look for different proteins, the covid tests generally don't look for spike anti-bodies they look to see about anti body evidence to the body of the virus for the most part. </p>
<p>The ones to check your vaccine anti-bodies look only for spike anti-bodies.  One test on its own may not be the whole story and could skew data.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point. I am part of a large prevalence study. Got nucleocapsid and spike protein tests in October which were highly positive. Just had follow-up testing done two weeks ago, I'm now negative for nucleocapsid but positive for spike proteins.</p>
<p>Trouble is, those are clinically meaningless at the moment without knowing which ones confer protection, at what levels, and for how long.</p></div>		</li>
