			<div class="markdown"><p>I was the same, and in some ways I still am. I don't cry frequently, but if I get very happy, very angry or very sad, it's almost impossible to restrain tears. I think some people are just sensitive in that way, and it's not necessarily a bad thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was little I thought intense feelings were bad. I think it's because my dad was a preacher, he strongly believed in the messages he talked about. His strong feeling would often result in him crying at the pulpit and my brothers would make mean jokes about my dad always crying. </p>
<p>When I became an adult I realized that it is okay to have emotions. Now I break down into tears whenever I experience a intense emotion. </p>
<p>In some ways I wish I had been taught a way to respond to strong emotions in a different way, but I think there is something about crying that draws people in. It gives people a chance to connect with you. </p></div>		</li>
