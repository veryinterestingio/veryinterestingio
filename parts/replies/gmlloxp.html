			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, the receptors themselves are not the whole picture. Even when the receptor number returns to normal, there are additional brain pathways that are downstream of those receptors that do not fully recover. This is why people are at very high risk of relapse even once they get past the initial ‚Äúdetox‚Äù phase.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>YES. I was diagnosed with ADHD at Fifty, before I started law school. I started on Ritalin, and what a difference it made. I knew though that I did not wanted to be medicated indefinitely, so I modified by behaviors - not drinking coffee and eating sweets round the clock, pacing myself, learning to say &quot;NO&quot;, and maintaining regular hours.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Over time the body adapts, recalibrating those receptors once again for a new baseline, and bringing the system back to normal function.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe, maybe not. The extent to which the system returns to &quot;normal&quot; is still largely unknown, with plenty of evidence to suggest that many people remain permanently altered in this regard.</p>
<p>This may be why opioid addicts often claim that they &quot;never really get over it&quot; even many years after being clean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Solid explanation. Do you know if this can be applied to any relationship between a chemical &amp; it's receptors in the body, or are there limits/complications for certain things?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on how the chemical works. For example, caffeine blocks a receptor that makes you tired (as opposed to firing a receptor that makes you alert), and over time the body makes more receptors to compensate for the ones that are blocked, so you need more and more caffeine to get the same effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I came off a benzo over five years ago and I still feel like my system is messed up. I used prescription Klonopin for 5 years, constantly increasing the dosage. If I ingest anything that (what I assume) works on my GABA receptors, from chamomille tea to valerian to alcohol, I get strange symptoms like when I was in withdrawal.  </p>
<p>How long should I expect this to last?</p></div>		</li>
