<p>Very hard to give involuntary ECT in the United States</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this really true?  I have a brother-in-law who has court-ordered ECT at least weekly. It’s sad because previously for he was doing OK but tardive dyskinesia started happening so they switched his meds and started giving him shock treatments all the time.  It seems like ECT isn’t really doing more than sedating him temporarily and then he’s too paranoid to take his meds until the next ECT. Overall it’s like watching a knife get duller and duller. I’m in MN if that matters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I did not know ECT could be mandated by a court, since it is a treatment that causes significant memory function issues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The memory loss is only temporary, although I have had clients claim it lasted longer than the typical few weeks to return after treatment. During the ECT treatments, the brain isn't* laying down new memories that same as it was before. It is not permanent.</p>
<p>Edit: a word</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This varies state to state.  In many, ECT can ONLY be given involuntarily by court order. This is to prevent single clinicians from having too much power.  The process of getting a court order can be long and difficult, such that in states like mine, it is very rarely pursued.  IMO, it is underutilized as a result.  I once worked with a patient who was at our state hospital for severe and prolonged catatonia.  Not eating, not talking, completely withdrawn, not responsive to medication. Couldn't consent to treatment because couldn't communicate.  She was married, but in our state, family members cannot provide consent for this particular thing (even though they could consent to surgery if the patient themselves were incapacitated.)</p>
<p>After almost two months, was able to get a court order for ECT.  Seeing her 'wake up' after her second treatment was pretty astounding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I went through ECT I could see where someone is deeply mentally disturbed and deemed unable to care for themselves it being court-mandated but that would be a hefty decision to make that I hope was deeply considered by the individuals PCP. ECT has come a long way sure still has it's issues but alot of the the stigmas I've seen from it while going through were caused from the birth and early stages of it more than the current state of the procedure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s pretty well accepted now that whatever perceived positive effects insulin shock therapy had on patients was down to patient selection (they only used this on patients who already had a relatively good prognosis) and the fact that the process requires intensive personalized care for each patient to keep them from, well, dying, so they were more likely to have a positive therapeutic relationship with their care team and were allowed to participate in more recreational activities than patients who were not receiving insulin treatments. It’s otherwise basically completely discredited as a therapy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent reply.  To add, from promazine in the 50's, then it's derivatives chlorpromazine and thioradazine (although promazine was still used in the elderly because of its lower side-effects), these revolutionised treatment which was, basically non-existent at the time.  Haloperidol came later, as well as variants and especially novel delivery systems like depot injections which allowed  people to live in the community.  Barbiturates of course were used from 1930's onwards as sedatives,  superceeded by benzodiazepines like chlordiazepoxide (librium) and diazepam (valium) as they were much safer. Some older sedatives were still around eg choral hydrate and its variants. Anti-depressants like imipramine would also have been widely prescribed. I remember in the mid-seventies, in a long-stay hospital, seeing patients who had been there over 60 years, since before WWI (UK ex-pharmacist here)</p></div>		</li>
