<p>&quot;Just because they said so&quot; isn't really an answer</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard that this was a $ decision for newspapers and magazines. All space in a newspaper is real estate that can be used for either content, advertising, or white space (for aesthetics/readability). If you could avoid using serial commas, you could save space. Not a lot individually, but it would add up. Avoiding one comma is not big deal, but avoiding all serial commas in every publication until its closure is... profit? I don't know how negligible the saving would be, though, and I'm sure there are better approaches to create space in a publication.</p>
<p>That being said, for clarity, I support serial commas all the way.</p></div>		</li>
