			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also a great way to explain the fundamental of economy. People value money for money and forget that it is essentially a way of «storing» the gods and services that you can demand back from whoever and whenever who is willingly to provide it so they in return can do the same.
This is why stopping one «link» directly affects the next one and so on. Eventually if enough links are stoppesd, economy haults.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honest question: why don't they just close the stock market for 2 months?</p>
<p>Edit: I mean, the slips of paper are still there. They just can't be exchanged for 2 months.</p>
<p>Edit 2: I really appreciate all the responses. I'm learning a lot. Stay safe out there!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Some companies might go under in 2 months leaving people stuck holding the bag.  If the markets are open, people could sell (lower) as the company goes under.  Some people still get stuck with worthless stocks at the end, but they likely paid less for them in the first place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People might need access to that money within 2 months.  Retired people will be cashing out, which they can't do if the market is closed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you close the official market for that long and people <em>really</em> want to sell / buy, then secondary markets might crop up, effectively selling futures on the stock.  That would really screw up the market when it re-opens.</p>
</li>
<li>Investors aren't going to stop either.  If you close the stock market, other markets will be impacted more - housing, commodities, etc.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is really fascinating, and thank you for the response. Can you elaborate a bit more on 3 and 4? What does it mean to create a secondary market? Like saying hey, when it opens back up, I agree to sell you my stock in Acme, Inc if you pay me $100 now? How will housing and commodities be impacted?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Closing the stock market would be the equivalent of closing the banks. Imagine people that have  part of their savings in stock or bond, if tu ey can't sell them they can't have the money.</p>
<p>Furthermore you can't just close the stock market because you don't like the results and claim everything in fine. It would be like claiming you are fine because you never measure your fever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, but if there was a run on the banks, wouldn't it make sense to close the bank's doors until the panic subsides and the government enacts policies to help calm people down, like increasing FDIC insurance or something?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They could. It's been done before, several times. But it's disruptive - if you have stock in Company X and they close the market, and then Company X begins to tank tomorrow, the value of the stock will still decrease even if the market is closed. It just means that you, the stockholder, would be helpless to take out your money before all of it was gone and you sank into debt.</p></div>		</li>
