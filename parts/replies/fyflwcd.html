			<div class="markdown"><p>Tetrachloroethylene (brake clean) is toxic. It was also widely used in dry cleaning. It can cause tumors on your kidneys or liver, is thought to increase the risk of Parkinsons by nine times, and California classified it as a carcinogen. You shouldn't breathe it or get it on your skin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly, it is because California's Proposition 65.  The warning language is treated as little more than a magical incantation that wards off lawsuits.  Print the incantation on your product's packaging, and you're safe.  Fail to print it, and you can get sued into oblivion.  Manufacturers tend to include it even when their products contain none of the listed chemicals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Acetone, methanol, xylene, toluene ethylbenzene and benzene are all extremely hazardous to your health. </p>
<p>Each one individually is bad for you, but together it's literally a cocktail of death. The methanol alone will cause permanent nervous system issues, blindness, and even death when absorbed or ingested in small amounts.</p>
<p>And if yours has hexane in it, hexane is a petroleum product. According to the MSDS: Chronic exposure can cause more severe damage to the nervous system. If swallowed, it may cause severe abdominal pain and impact the respiratory system, resulting in shortness of breath, coughing, burning of the mouth, throat or chest, and even chemical pneumonitis. Personal protective equipment is recommended whenever handling hexane.</p>
<p>None of those chemicals should be handled without a chemical respirator, full eye protection, chemically resistant aprons and gloves. If you're just using that shit without PPE gear you're going to have a bad time as time wears on. Short-term inhalation and moderate skin contact will eventually lead to respiratory issues and or organ failure.</p></div>		</li>
