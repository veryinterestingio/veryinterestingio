			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer.</p>
<p>Tutankhaten is properly known as the king's <strong>birth name</strong> (later changed to Tutankhamun when the worship of the Aten was effectively ended in Year 3 of his reign). </p>
<p>But he has other names which were used for other religious purposes.</p>
<p>The most important was his so-called <strong>throne name</strong>, (the prenomen), <em>Nebkheperu Ra  (Lord of the forms of Ra)</em>. The throne name is always the first name written inside a cartouche and which is accompanied by the symbols of a sedge plant and a bee to establish to any doubters that he was the genuine King of Upper and Lower Egypt.</p>
<p>Other names he would have used are:</p>
<p><strong>The Horus Name.</strong> - <em>Ka nakht tut mesut (</em> <em>The strong bull, pleasing of birth)</em>. This is the original way of naming pharaohs and goes back into the Predynastic Era. It was usually (but not always) accompanied by a falcon symbol of the god Horus. The purpose of this name isn't clear, but it is possibly showing a link between the king and the god Horus.</p>
<p><strong>The Golden Horus Name.</strong> which is always accompanied either by the hieroglyph for the god Horus or the symbol for gold. In this case it was the jawbreaker <em>Wetjes khau sehotep netjeru (Elevated of appearances who satisfied the gods)</em>. The purpose of this name is not known today, but because of its connection to gold, which does not tarnish or corrode, is thought to be the king's eternal name.</p>
<p><strong>The Nebty Name</strong>. Nebty means 'two ladies' and refers to the goddess Nekhbet and Wadjet who protect Upper and Lower Egypt respectively. This name places the pharaoh under their protection. In the case of Tutankhamun it is <em>Nefer hepu segereh tawy (He of perfect laws who pacifies the Two Lands).</em></p>
<p>The five names are together called a titulary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find it interesting the names rulers come to be known by in history books are different than the ones they would have been referred to at the time (I believe this is the case for a lot of Roman emperors at least). Would Tutankhamun have been generally referred to by his throne name during his rule?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We sometimes use a different name in history books because multiple rulers have similar names so historians end up using a nickname in order to more clearly differentiate between rulers.</p>
<p>Romans are notorious for using the same/similar names over and over again within the same dynastic clan. For instance the given name of emperor Caligula was Gaius Julius Caesar, just like his famous ancestor Gaius Julius Caesar. So we use his childhood nickname Caligula when referring to him so as to not get confused between the two.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, even Roman names are wierd and most of the western world is still fairly romanized in language.</p>
<p>Marcus and Lucius are the few standard ones that are still common enough as first names</p>
<p>Other random praenomen from the 40 or so names:
Gaius, Quintus (not unheard of), Agrippa, Nonus, Octavius, septimus, decemus, vibius, opiter, vopiscus, publius. Theres a lot of names regarding numbers... Even then they all sound fairly forign, especially the non-numerical names that aren't around anymore. Would you seriously accept someone telling you their name was Vopiscus (wo-piss-kuss) in 2019 without asking questions</p>
<p>I - X in lingua Latina:
(Unus, duo, tres, quattor, <em>quin</em>que, sex, <em>Sept</em>em, <em>oct</em>o, <em>nov</em>em, <em>dece</em>m)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, we have Ovidiu, Tiberiu, Augustin, Adrian, Marcel, Iulian, Marian, Valentin, Valeriu, Antonio, Aurel, Cezar, Cornel etc. We basically dropped the s (or ius) at the end. And we also have the female variants like Adriana, Iuliana, Mariana, Valentina, Valeria, Antonia, Aurelia etc.</p></div>		</li>
