			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, the cables are only buried close to shore and/or within a certain depth.  In the deep open ocean, it is just laid on the floor.

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what was always bothering me.</p>
<p>How for gods sake can a ship carry 2000km cable, and a plow couple km long to achieve all of this?</p>
<p>How that plow fit on ship?</p>
<p>How that long cable fit on ship? </p>
<p>Or let's say ship only carries let's say 100km of cable, who and how is connecting those cables in few km depth on the ocean floor?</p>
<p>Doesn't it take like forever? And how about fixing broken cables?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cable ships have large cylindrical tanks that holds the cable in towering coils.  Depending on the type and length of uparmoring, a single tank can hold over 2000 km of cable on the vessel I'm on (we have 3 tanks).  The plow sits on the aft deck and is lowered by the A-frame, it is a <a href="https://i.imgur.com/EknrBnm.jpg" target="_blank">remote-operated contraption that looks like this</a>.  You usually only plow very close to shore with a water depth in the 100s of meters or less -- though the umbilical for the plow is on an over 1km long spool to let the plow chase behind the ship where the cable catenary meets the sea floor. </p>
<p>Depending on the length of the install, it can all be done by a single vessel.  If multiple ships are involved, you simply leave the final end of cable on the sea floor with a clump weight and ground rope, with or without a buoy.</p>
<p>For repairs you first do a cutting drag of the cable with a specialized anchor that slices the cable.  Then you do a holding drag for each end with a specialized anchor designed to capture and hold onto cable without slipping under the tons of tension as you recover.  The repair creates extra cable length and the cable is relaid into the ocean with a new S-shaped bight as such, after the repair splice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>they have 2 ships, the first ship runs out, they put a float on the end so it doesnt sink. The next ship comes in and grabs the end, attaches it to their spool, then continues on.  </p>
<p>They also leave slack, so if a problem occurs, they can grab the cable, pull it up, and then do whatever work they need to do before lowering it again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find it fascinating that they were able to even build that much cable, let alone install it. I'm surprised that we never (or I never) hear about defects or breaks in the cable. I would imagine that they have some way to alert where those breaks would be but that much be difficult to repair.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back in the day (IIRC about 1997?) we (the UK) lost the main cable providing the trans-Atlantic Internet connection. For about a day we could only look at the web from sites hosted here in the UK (or Europe). Turned out someone had accidentally dug through the cable where it made landfall (buried, natch). I'm assuming these days there's a lot more redundancy in the internet cabling!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you pay attention to the right news circles (I do, since I'm involved in the submarine fiber industry) you actually do hear about breaks/faults pretty regularly. </p>
<p>However, you almost NEVER hear about them on major routes (i.e., New York - London or Los Angeles - Tokyo) because cables that serve those routes are high on the maintenance priority list and have repair ships dedicated to only serving those zones. Breaks on these cables are repaired within a few days at most. Plus, there are multiple cables that follow these routes so traffic is generally just temporarily rerouted to other cables as the operators generally all have agreements with each other.</p>
<p>However, in places like Southeast Asia or Africa where you may only have one cable serving a route you hear about the problems more often because people notice the impact. Additionally, places like India and Indonesia have pretty strict permit requirements (you need to get a permit to do repair work in a country's territorial water) and can take a long time to get, which impacts the overall repair time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hihi. Getting broken ones unbroke used to be my job on the drier side of the internet.</p>
<p>The internet dies little deaths all the time. Redundancy makes it live on with exceptionally little effect to a very limited area, even with the transatlantic and transpacific cables. More remote regions, there's likely still concern.</p>
<p>Even 25 years ago, when we had excessively less connections and almost no peering between private companies, redundancy was usually good enough. For example, the fiber that connected the center of the US (Chicago to Dallas) disappeared, and all packets had to take the long way around. Should've been ~+40ms or so at greatest distance, which you would not notice unless staring at your ping or playing an fps.</p>
<p>Dude got mad at a gopher in his back yard. As such, you could technically say that a shotgun took out a large section of the internet.</p>
<p>Though a rat did completely take out Seattle for a couple few hours, once. Good times.</p>
<p>p.s. Backhoes are the devil.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yup, when fibre was new in the UK someone dug up a major trunk link and the UK internet firm died.  The construction firm went out of business.
I used to manage premises fibre optic installs of military and ATC sites and remember all the issues when someone damaged a splice through being thoughtless.  I even saw someone shut a hanger door with a temporary fibre cable going into the hangar.  ooops.</p></div>		</li>
