			<div class="markdown"><p>Same speed, same starting point and end point. So velocity in a linear motion I'm assuming, and since the mass is the same (1,000 kg each) they'll reach the finish line at the same time. Sure nails is more dense than cotton, but since density = mass/volume, this just mean 1,000 kg of cotton will take up more space than 1,000 kg of nails, however since they're both inside the truck, they won't be affected by air friction/drag.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OK, I missed the &quot;same speed&quot; part. As stated the problem doesn't make sense. Maybe OP misquoted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OP said same speed, not velocity. But if you assume they have the same velocity, then drag, friction, etc. aren’t relevant. If the cotton was spun into a parachute for example, they would still reach the end at the same time. </p>
<p>It would take much more work, but again that point is not relevant. 60 MPH is 60 MPH whether you’re towing a parachute or not. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neither of them left anything out, OP just ignored that it was the same driver. The trucks are starting from the same place but not at the same time.</p></div>		</li>
