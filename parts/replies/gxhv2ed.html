			<div class="markdown"><p>The transistors are getting smaller but at nowhere the rate this was happening a couple of decades ago. The process-node names haven't changed to reflect that and so have become increasingly separated from reality, hence the confusion over what &quot;2nm&quot; really means.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I can tell, the &quot;length&quot; transistor processes are reported at now refers to something like &quot;how short the old design of transistors would have to be to be this efficient if the quantum effects that mean very short transistors don't work didn't actually happen&quot;.</p>
<p>In other words, if we'd been able to just keep making transistors smaller and getting the same increase in efficiency out of them, then that's how small they'd be now, but instead we've had to find other ways to get those increases in efficiency, but we're still using names that suggest we're just shrinking them.</p></div>		</li>
