			<div class="markdown"><p>And for anyone who doesn't know this trick, filling a sink with cold water and putting your hands/wrists in it for a few minutes is a really good way to cool off if you don't have AC.</p>
<p>Or for warming up (with hot water) if your heating is shit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A piece of cloth like a handkerchief, flannel or a synthetic that holds water, wetted and wrung out just enough to stop dripping, laid across any large stretch of skin, like across the shoulders or neck or on the forehead also cools you down a lot. Especially if there's even a light airflow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For bonus cooling put it in the freezer for a bit to. </p>
<p>When my Mrs was heavily pregnant during the summer and uncomfortably hot we always kept a bunch of damp towels in the freezer.  They are pretty amazing for quickly cooling you down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;If you're wondering why one leg doesn't get cold while the rest of you stays warm, that would be blood flow.&quot;</p>
<p>I've definitely stayed warm while the leg that was out got cold, it's really annoying because keeping the leg in is too warm and keeping it out is too cold.</p></div>		</li>
