			<div class="markdown"><p>TI, Casio and Sharp calculators are shitty because they largely sell to students who are ordered to buy a specific brand and model by teachers and profs. The teachers want them to buy something good enough to do the basic arithmetic in STEM exams but not good enough to do more advanced parts of the problem they want the student to do themselves. Hence they are stuck at that level. That’s the main reason they still exist - for serious calculations, we have computers. </p>
<p>The price doesn’t change for the same reason that textbooks are super expensive: when the person making the purchasing decisions (profs etc.) is not the person shelling out the dosh (the students), the laws of pricing and competition get messed up. A so-called ‘broken market’. The only limit would be if they were so hyper-absurdly expensive they added significantly to the cost of tuition itself and put pressure on the profs too since students might go elsewhere - but they’re happy to remain merely super-absurd. It sucks.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Those were done months ahead of time on Earth and needed to be loaded in and the burn sequences executed by the computer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the computer did a pretty good job! Except for that one scary one on Apollo 13 where they had to use Jack Swigert's Omega Speedmaster to time one of the burns.</p></div>		</li>
