			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, if the price is $2.599/gal, and you buy ten gallons, you'll pay $2.60 for the first nine gallons and $2.59 for the tenth gallon. Also, there is a name for a tenth of a cent. It is called a mill. There has never been a mill coin minted in the U.S., but I do remember the value in mills printed on S&amp;H Green Stamps back in the day!</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's not quite how the math works out. You actually pay 2.60 for the first 5 gallons and 2.59 for the 6th one, due to rounding. 2.599x5 is $12.995, which rounds up to $13.00 or exactly $2.60/gal. 2.599x6 is $15.594, which rounds down to $15.59, or $2.59 more than buying 5 gallons. </p>
<p>However, in practice you're buying fractions of a gallon that might round up or down at any amount.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Thatâ€™s a really good way of putting it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're close. You pay $2.60 for the first FIVE Gallons, then $2.59 for the SIXTH gallon.  <em>Then</em> it goes nine gallons at $2.60 then one gallon at $2.59</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are multiple valid rounding models.  So technically they are all correct.  Including even-odd, six and up, and many more.</p>
<p>I think you meant they use the common half-up model.</p></div>		</li>

<p>People were worried that gas stations are <em>always</em> rounding up (which yes is <em>a</em> way of rounding). I worded my answer to respond to those concerns - they round the way you were probably taught in 3rd grade.</p></div>		</li>
