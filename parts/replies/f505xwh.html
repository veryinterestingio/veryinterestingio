			<div class="markdown"><p>This is something they teach about in psychology intro classes in college. It relates to how our brains are haven't changed almost at all from our ancestors who ran from lions and other predators etc etc. </p>
<p>You're brain is hardwired to remember and treat anything it considers to be &quot;dangerous&quot; as something to either A be feared (and subsequently run from) or B something to be hunted and killed. So while you might not ne thinking in you're head &quot;okay bruh I'm gonna kill this fucking ghost or I'm gonna run&quot; you're subconscious is processing all information recieved by your brain like that.</p>
<p>This process is sometimes called fight or flight and it resides in the oldest part of our brain, our brain stem and a small lobe called the amygdala. These were the first lobes in our brain to develop and so consequently, to wrap years of explanation into 1 sentence, their functions resonate the strongest in our bodies. In short as my professor put it</p>
<p>&quot;Humans are hardwired to remember pain and fear, that's why horrible memories are so much stronger than the good memories. The horrible memories help us remember what we did to survive that situation but the good ones dont necessarily do that&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But like any good computer, it can be modified :)</p>
<p>This is why people say studying psychology and psychiatry can turn you into an asshole. You become hyper aware of the way you act and the way others act; and you <em>think</em> you can immediately connect a life experience with why someone acts a certain way. You can become very judgy because you <em>think</em> you can see into everyone's head. It causes you to lose sight that no, we are not all exactly like our ancestors or eachother and the brain is driven in an entirely new way.</p>
<p>I also believe thats why a lot of people don't like therapy, most therapists I've talked to almost act they are smarter then you, or that their PHD means if you listen to them it will solve all your problems. With psychiatric help they want to give you pills, and with psychological help they think that childhood is the root of all issue, and they can easily manipulate weak people. </p>
<p>In my opinion the best therapy is when you talk with a bunch of people and don't really have to talk at all, because forcing someone to say shit they don't want to when they feel terrible is never going to work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, a big part of that curiosity is the brain's desire to understand what happened and the consequences of what happened so that, if it ever finds itself in a similar situation, it's better prepared. There is a survival benefit to having observed dangerous situations that went south.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This extends to why children and rude adults will stare at a person with a deformity. it isn't necessarily out of cruelty, but because one's brain urges one to process this new image. I've heard people with disabilities say that this is their preferred way to look at the situation - iumderstanding can sort of let the rude person off the hook and relieves the object of interest from some of the embarrassment.</p></div>		</li>
