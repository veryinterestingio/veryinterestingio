			<div class="markdown"><p>There is not that much sugar in bread...</p>
<p>Just checked on mine, 4g of sugar on 675g bread, or just under 1 tea spoon per 1.5lb bread, but I suspect that the actual content is less because my bread machine ask for 1 tea spoon of sugar, and yeast feed on sugar. They usually do not test the content anymore, they just go with the initial ingredients. Can't go wrong (as it can't have more than you initially had) and it do not require any testing at all.</p></div>		</li>
