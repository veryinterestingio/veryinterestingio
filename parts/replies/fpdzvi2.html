			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely! Planting native flowering plants, avoiding pesticides at home, and setting aside areas for bees and other pollinators to rest/nest are great places to start. Some people like to put up “bee hotels” for native solitary bees that like to create nests in small cavities, but I’ve heard mixed reviews about their success. You can also provide things like logs, tall grasses, and patches of exposed soil for bees to potentially use as nest sites. A water dish with rocks in it (to protect from drowning) is also appreciated by bees. </p>
<p>Here’s a good place to start: <a href="https://blog.nwf.org/2018/04/six-ways-to-help-bees-and-beesponsible/" target="_blank">https://blog.nwf.org/2018/04/six-ways-to-help-bees-and-beesponsible/</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have a section of wild mint that we let grow unchecked (even though I hate it) because it's practically humming every year from the multitude of bees on it. We have other plants and let our grass grow out but the mint is this sort of bee Shang-ri-la where all manner of them come together in peace and harmony.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They invite the hornet it into their hive and then swarm it in what's called a bee ball. The bees that vigorously flap their wings to increase their body temperature. The hornet dies at 1-2C below the temperature that the bee dies of so it's a method that is pretty good at killing the hornet with minimal loss of life to the hive </p>
<p>Also the Japanese honey bee is also one of the world's smallest honey bees.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is freaking incredible. I have zero doubt in evolution, but to think that this is a behaviour that evolved to deal with this particular threat is beyond amazing. The people who claimed the impossibility of transitional forms used to say &quot;half an eye&quot; or &quot;half a wing&quot; was useless, and we know better. But really, it's hard to fathom how &quot;half a bee ball&quot; was a useful step in the evolution of their behaviour!</p></div>		</li>
