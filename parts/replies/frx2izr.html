			<div class="markdown"><p>What you have described is the &quot;good route&quot; for the PE-bankruptcy connection. What others are describing is the &quot;bad route&quot;. Both explanations are correct in that both scenarios happen, it's just a question of what to focus on. It may be true that the &quot;good route&quot; happens more often; but the harm from the &quot;bad route&quot; may be sufficient to still be worthy of attention.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks.  So specifically the PE that bought JCrew and Payless went in with good intentions but were just unable to turn the brands around?  They didn't have any malicious intent to saddle the companies with huge debt repayments?  No stake in this but I find this world fascinating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. The days of &quot;corporate raiding&quot;, where PE firms would buy a company using extreme amounts of debt (say 15x their annual earnings), sell off all the assets individually, and leave the company saddled with that debt were almost exclusively in the 1980s and 1990s. Barbarians at the Gate is about this - it's one of the most read books in finance circles.</p>
<p>These days, PE funds are much more in the spotlight and are much more regulated (Obama passed a rule that essentially said PE funds could only borrow up to 6x a company's annual earnings - Trump has relaxed this). Additionally, PE fund investors who provide the PE capital to make investments are much more vigilant about good corporate governance practice. Not a PE apologist - there are certainly some weasels in the industry and firms known to be harder on the cost cutting side. But in my experience, overwhelming majority of PE professionals I have come across want to grow the business rather than cut their way to returns.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fantastic review and notes above, Storgan. PE gets a bad rap for the shitty businesses like Sears and JC Penney who would’ve died under their own weight anyway. Walk through a mall department store and just gawk at the sheer magnitude of square footage of the store. Then multiply that by thousands of stores. Ain’t pretty. Great lesson Storgan_Manley. Now if we could just figure out where you worked...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing worth noting here is that a lot of the shadier stuff like levering up at 15x or stripping down the assets is now impossible - lenders now have covenants that prevent PE shops from doing the more pirate-y stuff, and selling the debt on a very highly leveraged buyout is challenging.</p>
<p>In my experience as an industry professional, most PE shops aim to put as much debt as possible while still maintaining a B2/B rating and hitting 20% IRR, and will only sacrifice the ratings if they strongly believe in the target and are willing to cope with the more challenging execution of a very leveraged deal.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Rather, it is more likely a measure of overconfidence, in that PE thought they would be able to cut costs enough to balance out the additional debt. Remember, the ones who are really getting cash out of a huge buyout is not the buyers, it is the sellers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A PE will only buy a company that they think they can grow in value. As the other guy mentioned, bankruptcy is a horrible failure and will harm the PE firm's ability to raise more money from investors.</p>
<p>Remember, a PE firm is just a group of people saying &quot;Hey, invest your money with us. We can give you 20% annual returns because we're really good at buying, then fixing/growing companies and selling them for a lot more than we paid!&quot;  The firm will simply not survive if it destroys value via bankruptcy with any sort of frequency. It is a large industry, through, so there are failures that can be cherry picked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's one possibility.  Another is that the company's real estate, which is carried on the books at cost, is worth a lot more than the entire company.  So they buy the company, kill it, and sell the real estate.</p></div>		</li>
