			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this and clarify for the OP:  </p>
<p>Yes, they are essentially both concentrated coffee. However, part of complex chemical reactions (like brewing coffee) is the time they take to occur and the temperature and pressure they happen at, as well as what environment they happen in.  </p>
<p>Basically, you can get highly concentrated coffee out of using a lot of instant coffee, or you can get it out of an espresso machine.  </p>
<p>Which tastes &quot;better&quot; may come down to personal preference, but the objective fact is that they taste different because they were exposed to water and air for different amounts of time at different temperatures and thus slightly different chemical and physical reactions took place to get you your coffee. This is true for all other foods, as well, otherwise we'd just boil our steaks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that quality of the beans plays a huge part. Insta coffee is the equivalent of chicken nuggets. Its probably low grade beans that were left on the floor. Coffee is about the oils you can press out of the beans, so quality beans, fresh ground, and with water at just the right temperature gives you a great coffee brew.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is true, to an extent. It is possible to get high end instant coffee, which is a combination of freeze dried coffee and very finely ground beans. It is supposed to get to a more barrista level of drink, and some brands sell quite well.</p>
<p>That being said, the cheapest of the cheap instant coffee is going to be the dregs of the roasting process or really cheap, lower quality beans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it's a little like ordering a steak well done. When the cook cracks open a case of steaks, he used the worst ones for the well-done customers, and saves the best ones for medium / medium-rare.</p>
<p>(As much as is possible)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to this, I suspect they're using beans that are near or past the Sell By date. There's gotta be a lot of unsold roasted coffee beans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it's intuitive that different brewing methods change the product. Soaking a sponge in a glass of water isn't going to be the same as wringing out a sponge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for an answer that is specific and objective. I thoroughly enjoy both beverages in completely different contexts, and thatâ€™s fine! Iâ€™ll aeropress specialty beans at home blah blah blah, but in a pinch if you try to take my powdered bullshit I will CUT YOU. ðŸ˜‡</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a conical burr grinder, espresso machine, french press, and a colder brewer depending on where my mood takes me. My modest setup has probably cost me somewhere in the region of Â£650, just for making coffee. Some people are unwilling or unable to spend that much to make a cup of coffee, or don't see the point. If you are happy drinking freeze dried coffee then that is all the matters.</p>
<p>I may be a coffee snob, but I am not a coffee nazi.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a Nespresso Latissima, Italian Moka Pot, Electric Burr Grinder &amp; French Press but I probably drink more instant coffee than the rest combined.</p>
<p>I only drink NescafÃ© Azera instant coffee though. It's much better in my opinion than any other instant coffee. Think it is because it is a fine powder which gives a bit of (fake) crema.</p></div>		</li>
