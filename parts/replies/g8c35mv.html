<p>Just a quick back of the napkin number crunch tells me if that was the case, we'd be looking at around 2 million Covid19 deaths in the US alone within the first year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And more severe symptoms (in symptomatic patients) make SARS-CoV-2 easy to recognize, so we know that it's spreading. Less severe flus can spread more quickly without raising the same level of alarm, and people don't take extra precautions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't understand how H1N1 infected 60 million americans in year one while SARS COV 2 official numbers are only looking to be at around the 10 million mark within year one? Wouldn't that suggest that H1N1 was around 6x more infectious? Or are our numbers for this current pandemic just that far off?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s a limit in both though. A virus that’s too virulent loses infectiveness because its hosts become too incapacitated to spread it. Meanwhile the most infectious viruses are not super debilitating relatively speaking.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm sure after this is over, the world will take precautions against the next pandemic. Oh wait...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The UK estimated that this first wave of the H1N1 pandemic had a Case Fatality Rate of only 0.026%, based on 138 confirmed deaths.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With this denominator, the case fatality rate was 26 (11-66) deaths per 100 000 cases. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The IFR was likely even lower. </p>
<p>However, the UK estimated that COVID-19 has an IFR of 1.4%, based on over 40,000 confirmed deaths and an infection rate of 6% based on antibody tests. Completely different league. </p>
<p>Interestingly, the median age of death from H1N1 was just 39.</p>
