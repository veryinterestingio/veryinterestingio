<p>Similarly, I work in a different system and we reserve weekends for a different intensive batch process we want to run when there no staff trying to access the same databases we're in the process of updating along with choosing when to place the strain on the system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm guessing you don't send out important customer Comms directly from those runs, as running it Sun-Thu night means there will be somebody in the following day to update customers is something goes wrong (also removing Sun means people can do final checks the same day and avoids changes to the system on a Friday), ofc I also means the reports have to fit into ~12 hrs</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This does not make sense to me. We can have porn on 4k on our phones, but a multi-billion dollar company can't process payments - which is at best a few bytes each? I'm not saying you're wrong, it just doesn't make sense to me.</p>
<p>Also, Canada is now working on their instant payments system. This is being done exactly how another commenter said - in small stages, without affecting main operations; they're switching the payments platforms, and making APIs. US can't be far behind.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If your bank account is emptied due to an error, you probably care quite a lot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two different things my friend. Ability to process x number of payments is the processing capacity and bandwidth. Errors in an algorithm is not related to processing speed. Errors are errors regardless of speed.</p></div>		</li>
