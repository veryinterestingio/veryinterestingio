<p>I can remember the number of my first credit card from 1972, old auto insurance policy numbers, phone numbers of old friends from 40+ years ago, and song lyrics and the artist from the 60's.</p>
<p>But I can go to a party, meet 5 people, and not remember any of their names a week later.</p></div>		</li>
