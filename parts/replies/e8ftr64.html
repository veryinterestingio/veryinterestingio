<p>NaCl, KCl, and CaCl2 are ionic compounds, which are formed from ions but are not ions in and of themselves. In solution, such as it would be inside and around a cell, the compounds dissociate and exist as free ions: Na^+ , K^+ , Ca^2+ , and Cl^- . It is these individual ions that pass through ion channels.</p></div>		</li>
