			<div class="markdown"><p>This is all true, but it's important to also remember that Spain was a dictatorship until <em>really</em> late in the game: Franco died in 1975, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalissimo_Francisco_Franco_is_still_dead" target="_blank">during <em>Saturday Night Live</em>'s first year on the air</a>. Catalonia is <em>really</em> touchy about the whole autocracy thing, because Franco pretty much tried to personally fuck their language and culture into the dirt during his rule. This is looking a <em>lot</em> like a country that isn't in the mood to tolerate any dissent. (Also, they appear to be really inept about the whole thing. A couple of days ago, the Civil Guard raided a warehouse that was full of Pro-Independence leaflets so they could be destroyed... and then proceeded to tweet out <a href="https://twitter.com/europapress/status/908761811033497600" target="_blank">a really nice, clear picture of them</a>, thus giving them a much wider distribution than they ever would have had stuck to lampposts.) When Scotland had their independence referendum a couple of years ago, for example, there was pretty heated rhetoric on both sides, but nothing that even came <em>close</em> to this.</p>
<p>Saying that Junts Pel Sí are a precarious coalition is true, but a real understatement: imagine if the Bernie Sanders Democrats and the Tea Party got together, and you're getting pretty close. A lot of people are pissed off that the leftwing CUP seem to have 'sold out' their beliefs in order to get the support they need for Independence, which is doing them a <em>little</em> bit of political damage but probably not as much as might be expected.</p>
<p>Until two months ago I lived in Barcelona, and contrary to how the media is putting it out, I found that a fair chunk of people in Catalonia are pretty nonplussed about the whole independence debate. The problem is that these heavy-handed methods from the Spanish government are pushing people who were otherwise indifferent towards the pro-Independence side, which is only going to make the situation worse for the State in the long run.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I lived on Mallorca when I was a kid and still visit every year, and I know a lot of old people who lived under the Franco regime and know very little Castillian, and instead speak almost exclusively Catalá (or Mallorquí, if you ask them). This is because, when Franco banned the speaking of anything but Castillian, it had the opposite effect of these isolated country people speaking only Catalá behind the closed doors of their farms. Young people are fluent in both languages, of course, but many elders actually have significant problems with the Spanish language, despite having lived in Spain all their lives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Small tidbit- People often say they speak Mallorqui here because while it has the same root as catalan, it varies in many ways. My partner (from barcelona) had trouble understanding mallorqui at first and still learns new words and phrases in mallorqui that are not in catalan, and she has lived here for over a decade.Many older towny mallorquins would have trouble going to catalonia speaking castillian OR catalan, but they get by ?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ok. I need to point something out: secessionists in Catalonia have been advocating for their cause for years now. On the catalan national day they have hold massive rallies. The catalan government is constantly talking about independence. Without any problems, at all. This does not look at all like Spain beeing a system that doesn't tolerate dissent. Catalan nationalism enjoys and will keep enjoying freedom of speech, the right to reunion and self-government.</p>
<p>As I have explained in this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/71hv9k/eli5_what_is_the_back_ground_to_the_current/dnb133v/" target="_blank">post</a> the secessionists steped up their game, essentially declaring the spanish constitution and catalan laws to have been abolished and substituted by a new legal framework. The investigations and arrests we have seen are not targeting dissent, they are investigating/targeting a series of alleged crimes related with this strategy. </p></div>		</li>

<p>For about 10 years, Catalonia's government has been lobbying the Spanish government for greater autonomy both economically and culturally (i.e. the right to collect their own taxes, the right to use the Catalan language in any context they please). It is important to remember that most important taxes in Spain are levied by the national (federal) government. This contrasts with the United States, whose citizens pay considerable taxes to local and regional (state) governments. This is why you often here Catalans claiming that they pay a disproportionate share of federal taxes -- because <strong>the whole country pays into a pool and it then gets divied up based on need</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just wanted to point out that some other regions such as Navarra and Basque country have control over their taxes unlike Catalonia. Also as of yesterday the central government has taken complete control of catalan finances.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit2: It has been pointed out that Basque Country enjoys federally sanctioned financial privileges that no other &quot;autonomous community&quot; in Spain enjoys, and this is absolutely true. This is important, I suppose, insofar as it means there is a precedent for the financial &quot;autonomy&quot; many Catalans have been advocating for years, and since most Spaniards consider Basque privilege to be the result of separatism. However, the history of these two regions could hardly be more different, and Basque Country's special status was hard-won.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Worth pointing out then, that this special status was offered to the then regional president of Catalonia Jordi Pujol when the current constitution was beeing set up. He refused. <a href="http://www.elperiodico.com/es/politica/20170507/catalunya-rechazo-concierto-economico-cupo-vasco-1980-6020846" target="_blank">Source</a> (In spanish). </p></div>		</li>
