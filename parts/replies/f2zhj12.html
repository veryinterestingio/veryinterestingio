<p>Edit:
&quot;Supposedly, in the Middle Ages scholars would write 'quaestio' at the end of a sentence to show that it was a question, which in turn was shortened to qo. Eventually, the q was written on top of the o, before steadily morphing into a recognisably modern question mark&quot; </p>
<p>So literally like [No.]
And question mark is actually a q... </p>

<p>Hmm, makes me wonder if &quot;!&quot; comes from something like &quot;imperatif&quot;           </p>
<p>Edit: No, comes from &quot;joi&quot;.        </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Graphically the exclamation mark is represented as a full stop point with a vertical line above. One theory of its origin is that it is derived from a Latin exclamation of joy (io). The modern graphical representation is believed to have been born in the Middle Ages. Medieval copyists wrote the Latin word io at the end of a sentence to indicate joy. The word io meant &quot;hurray&quot;. Over time, the i moved above the o, and the o became smaller, becoming a point.[1][2]</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So before there was a question mark you have to write &quot;question&quot; to indicate that sentence is indeed a question.</p>
