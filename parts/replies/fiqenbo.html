			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure any of us <strong>truly</strong> understands electrons, but it does get asymptotically better with time, particularly when you really work with something. Then your intuition starts to progressively digest it and it starts to make sense. I do still keep on being occasionally surprised and puzzeld though. I mean, take the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aharonov%E2%80%93Bohm_effect" target="_blank">Aharonov Bohm effect</a>: electrons can interact with fields, <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1209/0295-5075/112/40006" target="_blank">without even passing through them</a> (paper also available <a href="https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/physicsbatelaan/3/" target="_blank">here</a>). If that doesn't mess with your head, I don't know what will.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is it possible to explain this in simple language?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let me try (and most likely fail horribly).</p>
<p>The Aharonov Bohm effect relies on the fact that the phase of an electron wavefunction around any closed loop is related the magnetic field lines going through the loop. This means that if you have a metallic ring and a magnetic field passing through the hole in the middle, but zero field in the metal, the electrons would be affected.</p>
<p>The effect seems a lot less spooky if you accept that the fundamental quantities of electromagnetism are not the familiar electric and magnetic field, but the electric potential (i.e. voltage) and the magnetic vector potential. In the situation above, the magnetic field is zero in the metal, but the magnetic vector potential is not.</p>
<p>The electrons seem to be affected by a distant magnetic field, but actually they are affected by a local vector potential.</p></div>		</li>
