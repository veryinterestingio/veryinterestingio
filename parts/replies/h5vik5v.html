			<div class="markdown"><p>Well take new loans to pay old loans. As long your total debt is less than your net worth it's no risk for the bank and they're happy to collect the interest. And once your bill is so big that you can't pay it anymore the bank also can't afford to let it default, so they must put in more to keep you above the water.</p>
<p>Thats basically how Donald Trump got rich. Debt management.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Interesting read, and if you're busy or don't want to read, you can listen with firefox's builtin reader. Everyone should get wind of this just so they can all understand the need to make top earners pay their fair share.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. It's also worth noting that public reporting requirements have an effect. Shareholders prefer that the insiders don't sell, since visibility of any insider sell-off results in downward pressure on the stock price. Thus there's additional incentive for the insiders to hold onto stock.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, if Tesla crushed he would be in major trouble. You have to take into account that before Tesla stock exploded he was worth about 25 billions (early 2020), but today he is worth about 160 billions.</p>
<p>Which shows that majority of his assets are in Tesla stock.</p>

Yeah it would be tough but tough compared to your company going under and having no job and no assets since you were a minimum pay worker in a Fed minimum wage state?

<p>You certainly can, if you're left with $16 billion afterwards.  </p>
