			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh wow so I thought making an open world game was far harder than a linear story game, now I see maybe that’s not the case, considering that in many games like god of war 4 for example I’m pretty sure that most of the places and designs are man made</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The difficulty is not making the world, it is designing the mechanics.</p>
<p>I could show you how to make a basic world in unreal in like 30 mins. But getting all the things to interact with each other and the player? Designing a mission/quest system? NPC pathing, animations and AI? That would take a fair bit longer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also a ton of playtesting and debugging that has to go into it, too.  You can lay down the trees in 30 minutes, maybe, but they're not going to be positioned to make sense with your mechanics, so you have to have playtesters go over every inch of the resulting landscape to make sure that eg. you don't have a tree blocking something important, or positioned in a way that breaks some key mechanic or whatever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pathing kind of blows my mind. The idea that you have to programmatically handle how NPCs react to the environment, like knowing how to navigate around complex objects, such as vaulting or taking a longer way around, while trying not to break immersion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ohhh that’s so interesting.</p>
<p>That’s why Red dead redemption 2 is so much better than maybe other open world games right? Because they almost perfected all that you pointed out.</p>
<p>For example I’m playing the Witcher right now and I LOVE IT, but I do sometimes see some issues with the open world like plants or trees constantly phasing through each other and stuff like that, that’s the hard part right? </p>
<p>The open world of The Witcher 3 is still top notch tho.</p>
<p>That’s why you can make a huge open world but making it interesting is the challenge? Like filling it with life and substance and making sure every aspect in that open world interacts well with each other</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Making a massive open world game like Skyrim is super hard, look at how many bugs make it to release.</p>
<p>One big challenge is that the player can do just about anything in any order, they might enter through a door you expected to have been locked, but another quest unlocked it. You might rely on an NPC being in a certain position but another quest moved it. You might need to have a certain location positioned in a certain way so your quest item spawns on a table, but some designer had to move the table to stop it from messing with a shader and now your quest item doesn't spawn.</p>
<p>When the game is linear, a lot of these problems go away and you can better predict what the player is doing and what the state of the world is.</p>
<p>It doesn't mean one is harder than the other, they're just different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly enough, if you’re interested in like...a super basic idea of how this all fits together, including using “tree brushes,” etc., you can get a game like Warcraft III, Starcraft, Age of Empires, etc., and fool around with map making.</p>
<p>It’s not exactly the same, and there is a lot more that goes into making a legit open world map, but you can get sort of an idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. If you have someone who really knows it as well as a decent artist who can work in blendr etc you can actually put out some pretty decent stuff.</p>
<p>The amount of resources available in the libraries is absolutely insane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to this, a significant issue with open-world games is playtesting, for example, trying to eliminate the hazard for players to get &quot;stuck&quot; somewhere in the terrain, unable to get out from behind a rock or between two bushes, <em>simply because the game mechanics won't let them.</em>  How many times have you experienced trying to jump over a 50cm rock in various ways because otherwise you're unable to move forwards or backwards, and the only option is to reload from the last save?</p>
<p>Even when this happens only once, it can significantly break immersion and reduce trust that the QA team has done their jobs properly.  More than once and may players will simply rage quit and claim it's &quot;too buggy&quot;. </p>
<p>In the past this meant having a QA team and beta testers explore every inch of the map, ideally from every direction with every possible loadout and skill set.  Immeasurably tedious.  Nowadays there are software &quot;bots&quot; that can perform this task automatically, noting anywhere on the map that meets any predefined criteria -- they get stuck, they clip through the terrain, they can't get to Point B from Point A, and so on.  Game designers can be notified of any problems, and choose whether to modify the terrain model, or modify how the terrain is procedurally generated.</p>
<p>Naturally the same or similar tools exist for more linear games, but possibly with more directed targets, or requiring less computing power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good points.</p>
<p>I have been stuck on scenery so many times as I am one of 'those' players that likes to explore. When there is obvious design to prevent it I always notice and think &quot;good job guys&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
