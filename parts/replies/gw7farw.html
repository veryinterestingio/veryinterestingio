</blockquote>
<p>My favorite practical demonstration is that mixing equal parts red/yellow/blue together makes <a href="https://thevirtualinstructor.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/zCoPencilRatio.jpg" target="_blank">brown</a>, not gray. This is because the trio leans toward the warm colors too aggressively (brown is basically dark orange). However, if you mix cyan/magenta/yellow together, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHBasur7b9Y" target="_blank">you get gray</a> (all the hues cancel out).  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I highly suspect children being taught &quot;blue&quot; as a paint primary is the same as &quot;blue&quot; in the rainbow - that is, it's <em>supposed</em> to mean cyan.</p>
<p>End of rainbow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Green</li>
<li>Blue (cyan)</li>
<li>Indigo (aka blue)</li>
<li>Violet *</li>
</ul>
<p>* violet is a whole other rant - it's technically a colour bluer than &quot;indigo blue&quot;, and impossible to represent with RGB because it's <em>outside</em> the RGB primaries. It is <em>not</em> a slightly red blue-purple.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always thought the secondary comours used into printing today is a carry over from darkroom printing? In a darkroom, cyan magenta and yellow are used because they are subtractive. E.g adding cyan (which is blue and green) subtracts red. And because printing inverts a negative image onto paper, then subtracting red from the light will add red onto the image.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it's the correct answer, but prepare to have your mind blown with an interesting correction.  We do not actually have red, green, and blue light detectors in the cone cells of our retina.  The cone cell pigments are most sensitive to yellow, green, and violet, respectively. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_cell#/media/File:Cone-fundamentals-with-srgb-spectrum.svg" target="_blank">graph</a> It's the _differences_ between these signals that the retina processes and then the brain interprets as red, green, and blue.  For example if the light has more yellow than green, then it's red.  See <a href="http://psych.fullerton.edu/eriko/research/ColorVision.html" target="_blank">color vision from differences</a>. So the choice of red green and blue colors in your computer monitor do not match the maximum sensitivity of the three cone pigments- they match colors that produce a large difference in sensitivity between the cone types. </p>
<p>Even though I work in this area, I do not think I fully understand purple.  Maybe someone can help!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Simultaneous stimulation of the yellow and violet receptors with minimized stimulation of the green receptors causes purple. It is effective to refer to the yellow receptor as a red receptor because red (higher wavelength) light stimulates that receptor more strongly than the green receptor, despite lower yellow wavelengths being its peak stimulator. The violet receptor has comparatively so little overlap with the green receptor that it is effective to call it the blue receptor despite lower violet wavelengths being its peak stimulator. </p>
<p>Tangentially related fact: the light emission spectrum of the sun and similar stars peaks at green wavelengths, but the peak is so shallow they look white. Then our atmosphere scatters out the blue, making the sun look yellow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are spectral shades of purple, which range from bluish to indigo to violet. But a lot of what we call purple colors are mixed with colors on the red end of the spectrum. Colors like these are sometimes called nonspectral, meaning that they cannot exist as a single wavelength of light. In a sense, they only exist in the mind of an observer when two or more wavelengths reach the retina and are combined in the visual system.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Digital: RGB, Print: CMY (for the sake of example, we're leaving black out)</p>
<p>The first letter of each are opposites.</p>
<p>I.e. is your image looking too golden? Reduce yellow and/or increase blue. Want it to be cooler? Reduce red and/or add cyan. Etc...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a thing in the lighting world too. If you have an LED fixture, you ADD intensity to the Red, Green, and Blue diodes in different proportions to mix color. If you have say an arc-lamp putting out white light in a fixture, you use Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow filters to REMOVE color from the white to achieve the color mix you need.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good explanation, and I'm going to try to use it when I try to explain to people why white *light* is ALL colors, and yet white *paint* (for example) is technically NO colors.  The paint itself I mean, not what you see when you <em>look</em> at the paint.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want to drive that point home, explain it by saying you can't make white paint by mixing colored paints together. This is because all the colored paints will absorb some colored light, while white paint absorbs no colored light.</p>
<p>Edit: that's also a good way to explain why white surfaces don't get as hot as dark surfaces in sunlight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The real flaw in the old adage is in haphazardly comparing light itself to the light absorbed by pigments. If you compare light itself to the light reflected by pigments, white remains all colors in both cases. But that's not useful in explaining how to mix pigments, since red + green paint won't give you yellow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some paints have a white base and some have a clear base and there are also variations in-between.  <a href="https://askinglot.com/what-is-the-difference-between-bases-in-paint" target="_blank">https://askinglot.com/what-is-the-difference-between-bases-in-paint</a></p>
<p>The base typically determines how light or dark the color is.  With white paint, the topmost pigments could be white or the added colors.  It's a probability thing as the how many of each pigment you see, and the combined proportion of each makes up the whole color.  There's also multi-bounce stuff happening and light penetrating some depth into the surface, especially off of the white pigments.</p>
<p>Paints are not an additive or Subtractive color system so much as it's an average of the pigments.  You can think of it as additive though in terms of mixing.  Each pigment itself is a Subtractive color process that reflects only a portion of the ambient light it receives, like how almost everything you see works.  Cheap color-fast pigments are rarely pure colors, so they kind of figure out which pigments they can easily get from various natural elements with minimal processing and then combine a bunch of these to create the colors they want, which is why you see 8-20 barrels on paint mixers.</p>
<p>Additive colors are like solid color pigments like most paints or generated lights like a computer monitor, typically red green blue (RGB).  In a pure system, the pigments reflect or the light generates one 'primary' color.</p>
<p>Subtractive colors are translucent pigments like a printer, cyan magenta yellow (CYM).  In a pure system, the pigments pass all but one 'primary' color light that would otherwise be reflected by the white paper.  So it takes 2 colors together to filter all but one primary color.  CYM generates RGB when combined in pairs.</p>
<p>RGB and CYM are both designed around the eyes color receptor cones, and trick us into seeing primary colors we can't actually see.  I'm saying 'primary' above in this sense.  Someone else already explained this pretty well.</p></div>		</li>
