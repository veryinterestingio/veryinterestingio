			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm guessing it depends on which type of Ig? Also, unless I really missed something in my textbooks, I thought antibodies, particularly IgG's are the antibodies specially designated to flag antigens to make the pathogen more visible and easily killed. Maybe its possible they have a regulatory role, but I thought that went to some of the other inhibitory cytokines? A cursory internet search suggests ivig can be used in the treatment of some autoimmune conditions, but I see nothing for covid-19.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IVIG has been tried in COVID (Hyperinflammatory shock in children during COVID-19 pandemic, Lancet) although I am not aware of good evidence for its use. None of the COVID patients that I've taken care of have received IVIG. We typically use remdesivir and convalescent plasma in severely ill patients.</p></div>		</li>
