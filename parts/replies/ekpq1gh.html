<p>If weight shifts to one side, you can correct this by either shifting your weight to the opposite side, or by moving the wheels so that they're directly below where the weight has shifted to. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think its worth noting that there are two regimes. The relatively slow regime that extends up to about casual walking speed (if you have ever tried to keep pace with a walking person, you know its really hard) and the moving one, which is above that.</p>
<p>In the slow regime, there is no momentum worth speaking of, and it is easily overcome by control inputs. You point the wheel right, the bike tends to go right. The turning gives the weel freedom of motion sideways, and the bike frame angle will tip accordingly. Its very unstable and hard to control.</p>
<p>In the fast regime, countersteering happens. Pushing the frame tends to lean the bike in the direction of the PUSH (away from the direction of the front of the wheel). As the bike leans, the contact with the ground moves to the side of the tire, and the direction of force is decidedly into the turn.</p>
<p>However, the rider has no contact with the ground (no foot dragging! he has confidence!) so his momentum is forwards, but he has leaned over so the bike is slightly to the outside of the turn and he is to the inside. The seat of the bike and handle bars are now pushing him sideways. As his momentum changes, so does the direction of the force, until, he straightens out.</p>
<p>Now consider what happens if he applies the rear brake while turning. Well the wheel stops moving and begins to slide, as sliding friction is lower than static, there is less force to oppose momentum  in the back, but not in the front.... the back wheel slides out from under the rider, to the outside of the turn. </p>
<p>Of course, our novice rider, with all the confidence and no training (how do you think he got into this mess), he has dumped this way once before. Last time it was instant, this time he feels it happening, so this time he immediately removes his foot from the brake. The back wheel begins to spin and catches.... the bike suddenly rights itself to the angle it wants to be at....throwing the rider right up into the air and off the back of the bike.</p>
<p>This is, indeed, one of the common failure modes that new motorcycle riders are warned about. Especially since its so easy to do and not get thrown that some people don't realize how dangerous it is. A lot less injuries falling on the low side than getting thrown to the high.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'd like to know more about this bike of yours.</p>
<p>In all seriousness, though — for anybody who wasn't convinced by the &quot;doesn't have any one single explanation&quot; part of my post, consider that this is a long, elaborate comment serving as refinement and clarification on my own comment (basically a form of &quot;it's like that except when it's not&quot;, rather than covering entirely new ground), and still comes with a whole bunch of gotchas and caveats of its own. This is a <em>really</em> tricky topic from a physics point of view.</p></div>		</li>

<p>While I totally swapped bicycles and motorcycles, both can have a rear foot brake. Motorcycles have it on the right, single speed bikes usually engage it by pushing the peddle backwards.</p>
<p>The big difference between them is in how the front brake handles. A motorcycle typically has its center of mass low enough to the wheel base that it wont flip over the front wheel under hard braking. This actually makes the front brake the more important brake on a motorcycle since the weight shifting forward actually gives it more stopping power before it locks up and slides.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is, yes. But it's not <em>that</em> strong, because the wheels are neither heavy enough nor spinning fast enough to function as a very effective gyroscope — it's just one of the &quot;many small factors&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
