<p>Edit 1: Actually, this is the one I was trying to find: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/10/meet-badbios-the-mysterious-mac-and-pc-malware-that-jumps-airgaps/" target="_blank">https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/10/meet-badbios-the-mysterious-mac-and-pc-malware-that-jumps-airgaps/</a></p>
<p>Edit 2: u/marcan42 pointed out that the badBIOS malware was kind of a delusion of the author and never proved to be true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we're talking about extreme hacking methods, I believe I read somewhere once it was theoretically possibleto freeze RAM (like, hit it with extremely low temperatures) and put it in a new machine and read the bits off of it at freeze time.</p>
<p>So all you need is some liquid nitrogen and access to the hardware to steal passwords.</p></div>		</li>

<p>An air-gap can be compromised if someone carries a disk across the gap. This is how the US and Israel sabotaged the uranium enrichment facility in Natanz, Iran using the Stuxnet worm.</p>
<p>In that case, the US and Israel who designed the malware got it on to the PCs supervising the centrifuges by compromising the less-rigorous security of a number of companies supplying equipment to the plant. </p>
<p>It’s still not clear how Stuxnet got into Natanz, but it’s thought it was carried in on a CD-ROM or memory stick during an upgrade to the plant’s SCADA network. When the contractor inserted the disk, it compromised the PC and spread across the network inside the air-gap.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most very high security government machines (Used by the US alphabets at least) are custom built at the micro electronic level including micro code in secure and monitored factories.</p>
<p>They don't feature any non essential or nonexternal interfaces or features such as speakers and are placed in monitored and EM dampened rooms however other governments often use off the shelf components made in foreign factories.</p>
<p>I was once in a facility that used machines with no external ports but their motherboards still had the chips and capability for usb, you could solder on a port if you had time.</p>
<p>Before that air gap hack was created I once read of a project where a guy networked two commodore 64s together using midi music to encode the information. I thought that would be an interesting covert channel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, one point though-
Some computers are air gapped by themselves, not even connected to an intranet, and require a man-in-the-loop action to do any patch, installation or data retrieval.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back in the 90s I did internal controls testing of large financial instituions. That's where I learned the term &quot;sneaker net&quot; (which now seems to be called &quot;air gap&quot;).  But for things like issuing securities, they kept the risky stuff offline.  I assume they still do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of spook systems are like that. You have to physically mount the patch CD to apply the patches. We went round and round every year or two with management:</p>
<p>Manager: This patch CD effort costs a fortune! Doesn't everyone have Internet by now?</p>
<p>Us: We still have spooks, black systems, some DoD stuff, and others who <em>will not</em> connect to the Internet. They need CDs.</p></div>		</li>
