			<div class="markdown"><p>On point 3: Since pills are typically tasteless or even mildly bitter, they don't stimulate salivation the was a proper piece of food of comparable size would be. It's more like trying to swallow a pebble or something else generally inedible -- the body doesn't respond to it as ingestible.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably. But also it's small and round, and has a slick coating. Advil pretty much has everything going for it.</p>

<p>there are multiple stages of swallow. you are referring to the oral stage. the person you replied to is referring to the pharyngeal stage. different mechanics are involved.</p>
<p>during the oral phase, your tongue pushes the water/pill from front to back.  sinking/floating isn't really important. for example, you can swallow a spoonful of soup that has a chunk of solid that &quot;sinks&quot; in it. your tongue is plenty powerful to push a pill to the back of your mouth even if your head is down.</p>
<p>after food gets to the back of your throat, that triggers a swallow reflex. this is the pharyngeal phase. as part of the reflex, your esophagus opens.  when you put your head back it narrows your esophagus. if you tuck your chin forward towards your chest, the esophagus can open wider.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely point 1 but a big part is also the <em>act</em> of chewing. We don't think about it but our jaws, tongue, palates (there's two of them) do a lot when it comes to chewing and swallowing and not just mechanical things. Nerves are firing, numbers are crunched, a beautiful physiological ballet to shove a food bolus (a delicious food ball) down your throat.</p>
<p>Here's an NHI <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2597750/" target="_blank">article</a> about swallowing. It's a fucking novel. I'm in medical school and I'm still amazed at the things our bodies can do with no conscious thought needed. So as a commenter below said: fake chew then swallow with either saliva or a liquid for lubricant. Let your body do its job for the love of God.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely. I didn't realize SLPs deal with feeding issues until I did my peds rotation but it makes sense. We had a baby who plateaued on bronchiolitis treatment and it wasn't until we ordered a swallow study that we found he was microaspirating. Without that, he wouldn't have gotten to go home for a much longer time.</p></div>		</li>
