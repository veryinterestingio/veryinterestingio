			<div class="markdown"><p>Average 5 year old doesn't know the equation for Newtonian momentum (p=mv), and the sub's rule #4 says to explain for laypeople, not actual 5 year olds, so the answer is pretty spot-on for what it's supposed to be. It's highly likely that OP was able to read and understand the answer given their demonstrated knowledge (basic high school physics).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its a good answer but you do have to have some fundamental high-school level physics to understand. As the commenter who responded to my joke said: the responses are meant to basically at the level of the OP which I'm pretty sure this was.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. There’s magic momentum in a non-space place where things are just numbers, and light has no time and therefore gets to access the magic no space place because special relativity.  </p>
<p>Makes sense to me</p></div>		</li>
