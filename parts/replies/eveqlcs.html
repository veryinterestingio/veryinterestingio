<p>And while our regular units, be they meters, miles, grams or pounds, are rooted very much in our own history and are therefore very human-centric, the Planck units are based only on universal constants.</p>

<p>isn't one meter recognized as how far light travels in 1/299792458 of a second, making it too based on a universal constant</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;second&quot; isn't based on any universal constants though. It's a pretty arbitrary length of time that someone at some point considered to be convenient to use as a baseline.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The constant is the speed of light. Because the speed of light is always the same, hence 'constant'.</p>
<p>The meter was originally a fraction of the distance from the equator to the north Pole. This new definition using the speed of light was done because you can reproduce it everywhere instead of actually having to measure a defined distance on Earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>299792458 is a universal constant? Off hand, it doesn't seem any more special that any other number.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean it is special, it's the speed of light in SI units. The point of note is how those units are derived, not what that number is.</p></div>		</li>
