			<div class="markdown"><p>Just had laparoscopic surgery. Definitely had a bit of pain from the gas, mostly in the shoulders but only for a day or two.</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks to those sharing their stories, I didn’t realize how bad that pain is for so many.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It was literally the worst pain I’ve ever endured and I’m covered in tattoos.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same with me. Had cancer and had surgery to remove the tumor and the gas pressure was way worse pain than the incision pain. Had to shuffle around and that helped me burp. Didnt fart for 3 days and when I finally did, it helped so much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a laparoscopic sugury in my abdominal area a few months ago. They must've left some air because once the anesthetics wore off, I was hit by waves of pain. I couldn't inhale for more than a half a second before my chest, sides, and back experienced sharp pain. At times I had these episodes of immense amount of pain around my chest and sides, pain that rendered me unable to move due to the pain for 10 minutes. This shit lasted for week. Walking helped marginally but the pain made it difficult to walk for more than 10 minutes. I'm glad it's over now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is horrible, I’m sorry. I had some intense pain when the anesthesia wore off around day 3 but I assumed it was the surgery site.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s actually something called referred pain. The residual air in your abdomen was likely irritating your diaphragm. Our body isn’t good at localizing visceral pain and due to the way our nerves are wired, pain is sensed away from the actual source</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do they at least apply suction to get some air out before fishing stitching them up? Like stick the suction in there, then pull it out and quickly finish stitching the body up. Or press down into the body to squeeze the air out, have a nurse hold the body down to keep positive pressure on the body cavity, while you finish the last few stitches,</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I've seen, no. And they don't really need to. The majority of the air pumped into the abdomen escapes through the holes the use for the laproscopic surgery. Gravity and air pressure probably play a big part in it. Also due to the size of the hole used, it can sound very much like a big fart. I giggled.</p></div>		</li>
