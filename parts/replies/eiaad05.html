			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true.  For example, you could simulate any quantum algorithm on a powerful enough classical computer (it just might take a long time).</p>
<p>People might say a quantum computer can solve a problem that a classical computer “can’t”.  What they mean by that is a decent quantum computer* could solve the problem in a reasonable amount of time (less than a day, for example) while the world’s greatest classical supercomputer would take an infeasible amount of time (like millions of years).</p>
<p>But this is why the previous commentor mentioned that the quantum Turing machine is only different in terms of runtime.  It’s worth noting that a quantum computer can run any classical algorithm in the classical runtime, but not all quantum algorithms can be run on a classical computer in the quantum runtime.</p>
<p>* <em>a “decent quantum computer” does not currently exist.  The ones currently in research labs are not yet powerful enough to solve problems that classical computers can’t reasonably solve.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once read a sci-fi short story about how an advanced human civilization asked a computer/AI how to overcome the end of the universe. The computer worked on the problem for billions of years until the very end. Then at the end of the universe, after humans had long since gone extinct, it solved the problem and sent the final message with the answer on. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two issues at stake. (1) What can a specific model of computation do, and (2) how fast* can it do it?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Quantum computers and Turing machines have the same answer for (1), but that doesn't mean that they have the same answer for (2). Quantum computers can solve many problems faster than Turing machines, but a Turing machine still could solve it if it had more time.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>*Wait, what does &quot;fast&quot; mean here? Different computers run at different speeds already! We're talking about computational complexity here, which is the study of the relationship between the running time of an algorithm and the size of the algorithm's input. Some algorithms always take the same amount of time, but some algorithms get slower the bigger the input is. A common example is sorting: if you have N items, most simple sorting algorithms take \~N\^2 operations to sort it. But if you're smart, it can take log(N) * N instead. Quantum algorithms don't always outperform classical algorithms, but in some cases they do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In terms of computational complexity, it appears that QCs do have advantages over traditional computers in many spaces.

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's 'only' a conjecture - proving that no more powerful model exists is inherently hard because defining what a <em>problem</em> even is and what it means to <em>decide</em> it is 'highly non-trivial', as my professor liked to put it. However, many different approaches to define computability / decidability have been shown to be equivalent to Turing Machines.</p>

<p>Yep.  As the professor in my &quot;here's the underlying theory&quot; course put it, it's only a conjecture, but it's been that way for a long time with no conclusive replacement.</p>
<p>The only whole &quot;decidability problem&quot; thing is not a super nailed down thing, either... but no conclusive replacement for <em>that</em> has stood the test of time either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As pointed out, computability and complexity of a problem are two different concepts. In terms of computability, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Turing_machine" target="_blank">quantum Turing machine</a> is equivalent in power to a regular Turing machine. In terms of complexity, the answer is much less clear. The class of problems solvable in polynomial time by a quantum computer is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BQP" target="_blank">BQP</a>. The known relationships between BQP and other complexity classes is only that P⊆(BQP⫔NP)⊆PSPACE. The prevailing opinion among computer scientists is that P⊆BQP⊂NP⊂PSPACE, but no one has yet proven this.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is correct, I mis-copied ⫔ as ⊆ from a unicode chart and have edited my response.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I'm not an expert in quantum complexity theory, but what I have gathered from the literature I have read is that most computer scientists assume that NP⊈BQP, but that not much is known about the conjecture that BQP⊈NP, so I'm not sure that &quot;it is generally believed&quot; is the correct assertion.</p>
