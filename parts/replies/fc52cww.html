			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the real answer. Also, the fabric was originally invented for miners' tents due to its durability. Using tent fabric to make durable pants was the big innovation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is the story about the rivets true as well? The one I heard was that a miner kept bringing his pants back for repairs so Strauss or somebody used rivets as a joke and out of frustration.</p></div>		</li>

The rivets helped hold the fabric together, and meant the trousers were less likely to tear.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Blue Jean's were still seen as only for the poor and day laborers. </p>
<p>It really wasnt until US navy veterans helped make the dungaree popular post ww2.</p>
<p>They were comfortable and durable for  naval work in ships. </p>
<p>Veterans unknowingly helped to make fashionable and acceptable for everyday work and dress into the middle and upper class.</p>
<p>Motorcycle 'gangs' formed by veterans also helped propel the blue jean into a coolness factor that was desirable by rebellious youth. Movies like Rebel without a Cause pushed thr coolness factor.</p></div>		</li>
