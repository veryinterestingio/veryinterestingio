			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! Is there a reason why it seems so often the last 90% is the one that takes as long as all the others combined? I know my first instinct would be to respond to that question by saying &quot;it's all in your head and the last 10% just tends to seem longer because you're getting impatient,&quot; but I really don't think that's the case. Or, rather, it may be the case that subjectively it seems longer but I do think that it's often objectively the longest as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes!</p>
<p>The data often comes compressed. This is like if you're from Philadelphia to Cleveland, each of your items has 300 miles to go. Once its all packed in the truck you start. The first 95% of that journey is shipping the boxes which is straight forward and easy to comptue the time remaining, just look at how many miles you went.</p>
<p>The hard part comes once all the boxes are inside, and you need to unpack them. It's hard to predict where all your things will go, how long it'll take to set up your electrics and wiring, and that last step can take a lot of time, even though your just moving the box a few dozen feet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see the term “unpacking” on screen sometimes during loading bars. While we’re on the topic could someone tell us what’s the difference in all of these steps? Ie. Downloading, unpacking, initializing, installing etc. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A common practice in programming is to gather all the data and then perform calculations on it.</p>
<p>The gathering tasks can be relatively fast.  That would account for your first 90% of the bar.</p>
<p>That last 10% could be where the program finally USES the data it gathered.  Number crunching is resource intensive so it takes longer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Different calls to different services take different times. </p>
<p>Imagine trying to bake a cake with only ingredients from your neighbors. The sugar is right next door so it's quick. While the eggs might be from down the road and take much longer to return with. </p>
<p>Depending on the code you might even do these call concurrently meaning you could have an aid that goes out and gets ingredients with you. This can also speed up the process. </p>
<p>One last thing is when the developer considers the call &quot;done&quot;. Is it right after getting the eggs or after preparing the eggs for use. When calling services you don't always get exactly what you need. You will combine pieces of data from one call or another to determine what to show the user and depending on the data size that may take time. I know I prefer to finish loading when everything is done and user gets to see my product.</p></div>		</li>
