<p>To be nitpicky it should be <em>controlled</em> nuclear fusion (that releases more energy than went into it), humans demonstrated in 1952 how to release <strong>huge</strong> amounts of fusion energy at once.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fair enough. We have had research fusion reactors for quite a while, so we have had “controlled” fusion for a while too, at least in some sense. Just not controlled enough that we can sustain it for prolonged periods or with less energy in than energy out. We understand all the basic principles about fusion, but using it for power has been 20 years away for the last 30 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We know how to produce controlled nuclear fusion. You get a LOT of hydrogen together. You’ll need about 13 times the mass of Jupiter if deuterium fusion is sufficient for your purposes. If only hydrogen fusion will do, you’ll need a lot more. Then you put it all together and let its own gravity compress the center enough to support sustained fusion. </p>
<p>The nice part is, it will keep the fusion going on its own. If you get around 125 times the mass of Jupiter, it will keep going for four TRILLION years. The waste products of fusion are heavier than the hydrogen fuel, so they stay inside the reactor where nobody can be exposed to them.</p>
<p>There are certain difficulties with actually doing this, of course.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a couple of points you are missing. </p>
<p>Firstly, plants do this very slow. You need to plant a huge amount of trees to do the same job a machine does (I can look up the numbers if you want).</p>
<p>Secondly, when plants do it, your storage time is small compared to storing CO2 in an emptied gas field for example. You plant a tree, it dies after 100 years and composes and releases all the CO2 that it captured. Or there is a fire after 10 years and then all CO2 captured goes to the atmosphere again.</p>
<p>That being said, of course I am not against forestation. Climate change is a huge problem and we have to approach it from many fronts at the same time. We have to plant more trees, but we have to develop the technology to capture and store CO2 out of air as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>planting is done mechanically or by manual labour, no matter the method it also generates CO2... plants when alive also generate CO2 when there is no light, say, at night and other variables... </p>
<p>Factories could work 24/7 all year round, it does not matter what you use as long as the net worth in the end justifies it and the mathematics work out to be sound, say for example if a factory effort to reduce CO2 produces 100 tons of carbon a month <em><del>(including energy production costs/people their labour and transportation/ground usage/etc)</del></em>, but scrubs the atmosphere/<em><del>(ocean)</del></em>water of 110-150 tons of carbon a month you have a net negative of 10-50 tons of CO2 reduction a month, which is a positive thing no matter how you look at it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really don't think that argument holds.. Evolution took millions of years, coz it is essentially random, and anything that sticks is kept..<br />
We didn't take millions of years to create artificial flying (it is so common that it sounds weird to call it that), we are the fastest beings on the planet, thanks to our rockets and cars(again artificial), we created cameras(with those zoom lenses), much better eyes than we were given by evolution.. </p>
<p>Yes, these are all tools, but they enhance our natural human capabilities, much like evolution.. and they didn't take millions of years, coz we were focussed towards a goal.</p>
<p>But definately, plants are very efficient at what they do, and the most feasible way to do what they do, is to plant more plants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But this post is talking about using photosynthesis, not about any means to remove CO2, but the specific one plants use. And we cant do that better than plants.
We dont fly the same way birds do because we cant imitate their evolutionary characteristics. Our flight is much less impressive when you consider how much more control birds have in the air than we do. The reason we can defest the human flight capabilities is because humans did not evolve to fly. But we do not fly better than birds do, although we are faster.
What technology allows us to do is find alternativen solutions to our problems, and it does allows us to do things we did not evolve for, such as space exploration.
We didnt achieve that by copying biology though, and
also it is weird to call it artificial flight because that implies that a bird's flight is authentic and a plane's isn't, but neither is more valid than the other, neither is artificial, both are flight.</p>
<p>But we did not create cameras by simulating sight, and we will not create artificial photosynthesis as long as we can control plants, we will find other methods of reducing CO2 or we might even just keep using already existing plants.</p></div>		</li>
