<p>More importantly, there are now increasing data indicating that the type of inflammation in asthma may play an important role in the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Asthma, particularly in the paediatric population, is mostly associated with type 2 inflammation, which is characterized by a dominance of T helper 2 (TH2) cells and their hallmark cytokines IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13, and eosinophilia. IL-13 has been shown to downregulate the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on airway epithelial cells, and reduced levels of ACE2 transcripts have been associated with allergy, allergen exposure and high IgE levels5,6. Also, ACE2 gene expression correlates negatively with type 2 biomarkers, such as allergen-specific IgE and fractional exhaled nitric oxide7, and the lowest levels of ACE2 mRNA have been detected in patients with both allergic sensitization and asthma. Eosinophils depend on the TH2 cell-associated cytokine IL-5 for their survival and function. They express Toll-like receptor 7, which recognizes single-stranded RNA, triggering an activation pathway that enhances the antiviral effects of eosinophils8. Eosinophilia is negatively associated with COVID-19 susceptibility, whereas eosinopenia is a biomarker of severe COVID-19. Also, mast cells, the other major allergy-associated effector cells, have high antiviral potential owing to their production of interferons and other antiviral mediators. In combination, these and other mechanisms9 associated with type 2 inflammation may reduce the risk for severe COVID-19.</p>
<p>This is in contrast to mechanisms associated with non-type 2 asthma and COPD, which show a dominance of TH1-type or type 1 cytotoxic T (Tc1)-type responses and TH17 cell activation. This type of inflammation is associated with an increased expression of ACE2, although the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood5,7,9. Furthermore, many patients with non-type 2 asthma or COPD suffer from other comorbidities that are associated with chronic low grade inflammation10, and this may predispose to a more severe course of the disease</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow! I’ve been looking for this answer (though not exactly asking) for a while. I had seen the early data on type 2 asthma as a slight protective factor for Covid, but had no clue as to the mechanism. Also the data seemed weak way back then.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great explanation for how complicated the situation for different underlying conditions are. Thank you for this.</p>
<p>Would you have any insight into how this would play out for other illnesses, particularly those that seem to be sometimes (it's a theory / association or some cases only of course) be associated with overactive immune response to infections, e.g. multiple sclerosis?</p>
<p>Or how the level of inflammatory response or vaccine effectiveness would change for immunocompromised patients?</p></div>		</li>
