This ignores things such as variable amounts of water present, which would be the other main contribution to the mass of an animal, and so is probably a more consistent measure across different species.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So by my arithmetic that means that if 7 billion people is 0.6 billion metric tons of carbon, then each person uses 85kg or 187 pounds of carbon.  That seems like a lot of carbon if we're getting rid of at least 50-75% of the mass of each human just from water.  Am I calculating something wrong?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, blue whales weigh about 75000kg on average, so if an average human weighs about 75kg, then one blue whale is as much biomass as 1000 humans. There are around 10000 blue whales in the world, so that’s only as much as 10 million humans, only about 0.1% of the total human biomass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's just blue whales though. What's the current population of killer whales or all types of dolphins? Killer whales aren't endangered at all right? On land there's just surface area(unless your one of the few and smaller creatures that can fly) in the ocean just the surface area is 1 to 4 ratio in size to land but it goes down in depth too, so it means it's larger and accessible to ocean mammalian life. I was just curious if it was included in the numbers, if it is I would be surprised that's all. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In 2018 a paper came out in PNAS (linked below but I don’t know how to reddit so, may not come through.) by Bar-on, Phillips, and Milo titled ‘The Biomass distribution on Earth’. They came to the conclusion that animals are actually 6th in line for largest biomass percentage. That’s behind #1 Plants, then bacteria, fungi, archaea, and protists. Out of the animal biomass, the largest groups are the arthropods (represented by mostly krill and termites), and fish, then mollusks and annelids. Humans come in just behind livestock with much lower percentages. </p>
<p>Quick note, I want to state I’m not 100% on board with all their methods, however I think it’s an incredible attempt at accomplishing such a feat. I think their methods are worth discussing and improving on!</p>
