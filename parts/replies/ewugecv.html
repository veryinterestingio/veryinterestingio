			<div class="markdown"><p>True. I work in digital design for an RF modem transceiver and leakage current is a major contributor of power consumption in ≤28nm technology nodes. Leakage current rises significantly with voltage and temperature. </p>
<p>To reduce dynamic power we’ve been doing clock gating (i.e. turning off the clock for parts and sub-systems when they are not in use) for ages. To reduce leakage current we now also have to introduce power domains where we turn off the supply of parts of the chip.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer with key points missing elsewhere in the discussion.  </p>
<p>One refinement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your power consumption will be proportional to your voltage so that reduces power.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be more precise, in a typical CMOS system, the dynamic power is approximately proportional to the product of frequency and voltage <em>squared</em>.  You can think of that power equal to voltage times current, with current proportional to voltage, because the current is proportional to the charge on the capacitance being switched.</p></div>		</li>
