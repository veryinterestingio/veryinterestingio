			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, how glorious it would be to have only 50.  Each state has dozens to hundreds of counties, each with their own ballots for local offices and local measures.  There are 435 house districts, which don't align on country borders, and you have to distinguish each of those.  Plus there are city officials, like mayor, where only precincts in the city limits get to vote.  The federal election commission says there were 174,252 precincts in the election last week.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>haha yeah, i was keeping it more simple.  Its a tremendous amount of stuff, but my point was more that its a reporting bias, in that you hear about ones that are issues, not the other 99% that everything is fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's basically reporting bias.  You hear about the small tiny bit that went wrong, not the 99% that went right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The old squeaky wheel thing, but instead of grease, the &lt;1% gets all the attention.  Considering how many voting precincts are in the US, we have a remarkable ability to count and tally votes in a very timely fashion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That said, I'd say the issues can be rare but serious.  We have some very destructive cases of gerrymandering and voter suppression, but they don't nearly represent the majority of the institution of voting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Point taken. But when the margin between close races is &lt; 1%, that tiny bit becomes all the more important. </p></div>		</li>
