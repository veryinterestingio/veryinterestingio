			<div class="markdown"><p>I have gone to the eye doctor's before and they had a machine with this same picture thing. Instead though, there was a green light in the middle that they asked you to stare at, and when you got comfortable and relaxed, they puffed a bit of air into your eye. I have no idea what this did. Then, the next machine was one with the adjusting lights.Then reading the letters, then one or two.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The machine watches how the surface of the eye bounces back after the puff of air hits it; this is used to calculate the pressure inside the eye to test for glaucoma.</p>
<p>This is called non-contact tonometry, since it does not physically touch your eye to take the measurement; it’s quick, easy to do, can’t damage the eye, and pretty accurate, so tends to be the most popular method.</p>
<p>The other ways of testing the internal eye pressure, but they all involve the device actually touching your eye so carry a bit more risk. The most accurate is Goldmann applanation tonometry, which requires a topical anesthetic and dye in your eyes, and a skilled practitioner to carefully apply the tonometer to the eye to take the measurement.
