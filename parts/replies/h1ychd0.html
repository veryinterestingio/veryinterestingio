			<div class="markdown"><p>This is it right here.  I don’t drink much any more, but when I drank a lot following my divorce, I would go through a few bottles of liquor a week.  Tequila, whiskey, rum, gin, etc.  It’s safe to say I have researched the topic extensively and am confident in my findings.</p>
<p>I didn’t experience any different mood changes based on the liquor - my mood when drunk was defined by my overall mental state.</p>
<p>Tequila: mopey and depressed
Whiskey: mopey and depressed
Rum: mopey and depressed
Gin: mopey and depressed</p>
<p>People blame the liquor for their behavior, but it’s all about mood, setting, the people you are drinking with (or lack thereof), and so on.</p></div>		</li>
