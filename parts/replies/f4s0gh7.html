			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the most thorough answer. Not turning a profit is the norm for almost any new company that wants to scale. They seek investment to cover salaries and other expenses with the hope to turn a profit or otherwise pay out more than the investment to stockholders. Other ways of achieving this is through IPOs or acquisition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. That is why it is considered pretty risky. For every company that makes it there are many more who don't. Many more investments fail than succeed. </p>
<p>But if you get it right you can turn millions into billions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially if they completely fail everyone loses their money. There will probably be a couple lawsuits depending on what failed and why so the lenders can pick the bones. </p>
<p>You can see it happening in the real world with WeWorks absolutely abysmal IPO. It showed the company was hemorrhaging money without a plan to become profitable. It also showed the CEO was borrowing money from the company to buy properties and then leasing them back to the company.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not turning a profit is pretty normal for any company looking to grow, it's one of many ways to avoid tax.</p>
<p>If you reinvest everything you earn in growth, then you pay 0% tax, it's what Amazon do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to pile on...most young companies, especially the tech related ones, choose fast growth over stable profits initially. That means that on paper they bleed money but they usually grow their user base and acquire the competition over that period. Once they've reached a certain scale they begin to prioritize profit or try to cash out by going public or selling to an investor. FWIW there are several public companies that are in the hole</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll add to this a bit:</p>
<p>All companies typically have to decide on some balance of making money and giving it to the company owners, or using that money to grow.  Tech startups typically choose growth, to such a high degree that they spend much more money than they earn.</p>
<p>In order to get that money for growth, companies like Lyft fundraise.  A very simplified version is that they will go to investors, and offer a part of their company in exchange for a set amount of money.  </p>
<p>So, a company like Lyft might ask for $1 million for ten percent of the company, which means that Lyft now has a $10 million dollar (pre-money) valuation, since $10 million * 10% == $1 million.</p>
<p>Once Lyft has the money, they'll figure out what their runway is, which is how long they can last at their current rate of spending (burn rate), to understand when they need to go out and find more investors.  </p>
<p>So, if Lyft is spending $1.5 million a year, for marketing and moving into new markets, and earning $750,000 per year, that means they have about 18 months before the CEO needs to fund raise more money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm actually pretty sure my burnrate example is close, but still a bit off.  I did the numbers in my head, and didn't actually work it out on paper...</p>
<p>edit:  Yeah, it's actually a 16 months runway.  I finally did the math (1.5<em>x - .75</em>x = 1, x=1.33 years)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, very. Generally companies will have a plan for making their operations profitable through progressive growth over time; this plan is provided to potential investors/creditors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Example: Amazon. </p>
<ul>
<li>1994 - Founded. </li>
<li>2004 - First year with an annual profit (10 consecutive years of losses before that). </li>
<li>2019 - First year Amazon will pay taxes on profit (it's initial losses were so significant, that it has been carrying forward those losses for over 20 years). So this is the first year, 25 years after its founding, that the company is covering its initial investments.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And the crazy bit is that Amazon's profit largely comes from it's Amazon Web Services product, not all the shit we buy. They were profitable in 2004 and beyond (sometimes) but these profits we're pretty small compared to their revenue. Last year alone AWS accounted for over 7 billion of their 10 billion in profits and the bulk of the rest came from their digital ad business.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's misleading. Their Web Services only exist due to their heavy spending into R&amp;D, which was funded by &quot;all the shit we buy&quot; over the years.</p>
<p>It's not like Amazon wasn't making a lot of money, they just invested it into R&amp;D.</p></div>		</li>
