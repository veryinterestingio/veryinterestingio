<p>The easiest and most realistic holographic display that you can make yourself at the moment would be this: <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/3D-Holographic-Display-Pyramid-Stand-Projector-for-3-5-6-5-Smart-Cell-Phone-/252616547841" target="_blank">https://www.ebay.com/itm/3D-Holographic-Display-Pyramid-Stand-Projector-for-3-5-6-5-Smart-Cell-Phone-/252616547841</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was wondering if it was possible in theory to create an arbitrary visible light interference pattern, or emulate the structural color effect of butterfly wings.</p>
<p>Edit: This seems to exist in the lab, and what I'm thinking of is an &quot;array of phase-controlling plasmonic nanoantennas&quot;, which sounds like some treknobabble BS but is apparently a real thing humans can build.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There were actually some techniques developed years ago where they were able to stop a photon with another photon from the opposite direction. Depending on timing and coordinates combined with POV, this could potentially create the holographic image. I think it’s far from developed yet though. I was fascinated with it when I first read about it because I too understand the reasons why holographs cannot yet be a thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. Not wrong. Don't discount the potential of a quantum dot enhanced lcd. In terms of image retention and proportial color volume(over time especially), QLED' s have an advantage over OLED. Quantum dots are interesting, and it will be interesting to see their combination with other tech like solar photovoltaics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quantum Dot (QD) products are a confusing mix.</p>
<p>Quantum Dots are tiny particles (crystals?) that have been grown to very specific sizes. They're so small that they act like individual atoms on the quantum scale (thus the name) in spite of being made up of clusters of atoms. This lets one effectively manufacture artificial &quot;atoms&quot; (dots) with characteristics not found in natural elements.</p>
<p>In the case of TVs, the characteristic they're playing with is the fluorescence of the dots - the material can absorb light of a higher energy wavelength such as blue (430nm is common) or near UV (400-ish nm) and emit the energy as a lower energy wavelength such as green, red or yellow. That allows for simplification of manufacturing, improvements in energy efficiency and/or contrast of the display.</p>
<p>The confusion is in how the dots are used versus the marketing jargon. My go-to example of jargon is when OLED TVs first hit the market, manufacturers started calling their LED-backlit LCD TVs &quot;LED TVs&quot;. Liquid Crystal panes can only switch between opaque (black or a few other colors such as blue or green) and clear. Color LCDs get color out of this by putting red, green and blue filters in front of three clear/black LC sub-pixels, and varying the opaque-ness of the individual sub pixels to produce different colors. Like a slide in a slide projector, or an old film movie, you still need a light source to shine through the LC and color filters in order to get light out the front of the display. Old TVs used cold-cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFL) to produce the light. Those jargon-y TVs switched to using white LEDs. Yes that's provides an improvement in energy efficiency, but it's not what OLED TVs are doing. OLED displays have individual red, green and blue LEDs (light emitters) for each sub-pixel of the display. That makes a difference because LC sub-pixels can't turn perfectly opaque - even when a LCD is trying to show its darkest black, there's still some glow of light leaking through. With OLEDs displays, when the LEDs are off it's not producing any light. An OLED TV can (in a dark room at least) display perfect black.</p>
<p>Quantum dots can be used with either of those approaches but will still have the perfect-black problem.</p>
<p>In true LED displays (OLED or otherwise), they can make a panel with nothing but high efficiency blue LED sub-pixels, and then cover corresponding sub-pixels with red or green quantum dots. Or UV leds with red, green and blue quantum dots if that provides some advantage. Throw yellow in there if patents and pricing allows. Using only one color of LED reduces manufacturing complexity and therefor cost.</p>
<p>LCD displays can use quantum dots by replacing the color filter with quantum dots. Instead of a white backlight, the display uses a blue backlight. The backlight then either constantly illuminates red and green quantum dots with the LCD blocking or passing the light (the blue sub-pixel passes straight through, no dots), or the LCD blocks and passes the blue backlight, with the quantum dots on the viewer's side of the LCD. This improves efficiency by eliminating the color filter. Filters absorb light and turn it into waste heat where quantum dots absorb light and turn it into a different color of light. Again, LCD = no perfect black.</p></div>		</li>
