<p>Found the German. For everyone scratching their head: that's Scrooge McDuck. In the German localizations he is called &quot;Dagobert Duck&quot;, probably because A Christmas Carol us not very well known here, so the reference would not have made a lot of sense, and comic readers would not have known how to pronounce &quot;Scrooge&quot; correctly (German speakers might read it as &quot;Skroh-geh&quot;)</p></div>		</li>
