			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was in high school there was this popular kid who burned CDs for five bucks. I had him burn me one with some sailor Moon stuff on it, not thinking that he'd go through and listen to the songs I sent him. The look on his face when he handed me that CD though made it pretty clear he thought I was a nut.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Naoko Takeuchi did that intentionally, as she took a lot of her research out of Greek and Roman mythology. (Saturday is Saturn's day too ;) ) It does extend to all the regular planet senshi. I am not sure if this applies to, like, Sailor Tin Mouse (that is, if she matched Sailor Tin Mouse to mythology, I do not know/I'm not sure which myth story it would be. Does anyone else know?)</p></div>		</li>

My knowledge of finish and islandic is too limited to be able op confirm their weekday names. A qualified guess would be yes to islandic and no to Finnish. </p>
<p>As far as I'm aware Greenlandish, while technically part of Denmark, does not follow this pattern.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Iran (persian language) it’s much easier to memorize and also meaningless!
Saturday is “Shanbeh شنبه” and after that we have 1 shanbeh, 2 shanbeh, 3 shanbeh, 4 shabeh, 5 shanbeh. But friday is “Jomeh جمعه”</p>
<p>In traditional persian calendar, we don’t have any weeks. Every month has 30 days and every day has its own name. For example, the first day of every month was “Ormozd”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Blew my mind. Monday = Lundi, which sounds like Moon = Lune, so that makes sense as &quot;Moon day&quot;.</p>
<p>...too bad Sunday doesn't have as nice a connection. Sun = Soleil while Sunday = Dimanche. Google says that that's from the latin of &quot;Sun's day&quot; = &quot;dies solis&quot;, which apparently also affected Spanish/Italian too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dimanche apparently comes from Latin for ‘day of the lord’. Dies dominicu-&gt; didominicu-&gt;diominicu-&gt;dimanche. No idea how diominicu became dimanche but apparently that’s what happened. What you said about Lundi and Moon Day reminds me of when I realised some things about the Netherlands. Holland= Hollow Land/Hole Land. And Netherlands means the low lands or land beneath in English. Pays Bas means Low Land in French.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's an intense and widely popular heavy metal band in Taiwan by that name. The lead singer also ran for a legislative seat back in 2016 and won. He was also one of the founding leaders of the New Power Party (NPP) in Taiwan and represented the party in the Legislative Yuan until last year. And he just won a second legislative term as an independent, supporting Tsai Ing-Wen (Democatic Progressive Party aka the DPP), who won her second term of presidency recently as well. </p>
<p>Wikipedia says that Chtonic is the &quot;Black Sabbath of Asia&quot;, but they're so much more than that. If you can, check out one of their live shows on YouTube, their live shows are just as intense as they are. They also have their own beer, it's not that tasty though (IMO).</p></div>		</li>
