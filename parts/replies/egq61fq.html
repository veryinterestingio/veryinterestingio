			<div class="markdown"><p>now the question is. if I cut a camembert for example or a different one with that white mould around it.
and let it sit for a while in its packaging.
It starts to grow around the exposed area.</p>
<p>what is that?
Is it that edible mould just growing on or could it be a combination of white toxic mould when I opened it and the edible one competing for space?</p>
<p>since the regrowing happens relatively fast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most likely it's the same white mold, especially if it's even and comes on quickly. Camembert mold is usually inoculated in the milk, causing it to grow wherever exposed to air, but it can also be sprayed on externally. Commercial camembert cultures are pretty vigorous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's generally the same white mould, and is called a bloom.</p>
<p>The mild on a camembert is a living thing, and will expand quickly to exposed cheese.</p></div>		</li>

<p>the basic idea of blue cheese or other mouldy cheeses like camembert was to let one nontoxic mould form on the cheese to prevent other moulds from attacking it. the harmful moulds can't comptet with the edible one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the name of that mold? <em>Penicillium roqueforti,</em> cousin to the penicillin-producing penicillium.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An older gentleman came into my workplace around 1999. He said he had some sort of dental surgery when he was young and the dentist told him to keep gorgonzola cheese in his mouth near the site of the surgery because antibiotics were not as common then. I am not sure if he was pulling my leg, but he was at the deli buying gorgonzola.</p></div>		</li>
