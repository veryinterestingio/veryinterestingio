			<div class="markdown"><p>Come now:  Needles are either sapphire or diamond.  Aluminum isn't nearly as hard.  But aluminum is three times the weight; bends easily, and is several times the price.  Molding it would require much higher temperatures and would likely bond to the metal stamping plates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Were they always though? Our ability to coat and form things in diamond didn't really take off until the 90s at least, so I feel like his answer probably has a historical context where it fits.</p>
<p>Edit: also you're somewhat right about aluminum &quot;moulding&quot; or casting really. You need to either cast or forge it (or machine, but that would be expensive and time consuming). In casting you'd use something like silica sand as a release agent, which would significantly degrade the surface quality and probably lose all the recording information anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The disc is pressed from a steel master disc.  </p>
<p>Its needs to be a thermoplastic for the mould to form an image, that rules out PVC and polycarbonate which are harder.</p>
<p>They did actually make floppy discs (given away on magazines) and picture discs (there was a picture on the disc) from polyethylene, but the picture discs had poorer reproduction because of noise created by vibrations in the disc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's all about relative hardness. A softer material could be used and the needle could by nylon all the way down.  A harder material could be used and the tip of the needle could be ruby.  Really, any vast change to one would push a change of the other.  Yay materials science lol.</p></div>		</li>
