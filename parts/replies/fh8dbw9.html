			<div class="markdown"><p>Only the people on the ship could have made that mistake. They say that it orbits a lot closer than they thought, so their readings were off. They then discuss what to do, so only the 3 scientists and the pilot made the error. Miller probably landed, was destroyed and her signal echoed around for a few hours until the endurance shows up, or it hadn't updated yet and they were just assuming it was still good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They should have been able to calculate it pretty accurately since the signal being transmitted would have been shifted and the receiver would have to take time dilation into account to reconstruct it.</p>
<p>As for the initial expedition only lasting as long as they did, there was no way to determine that until arriving, but the time dilation effects were definitely understood.</p></div>		</li>
