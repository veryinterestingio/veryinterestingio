			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  There's some fairly solid research which indicates if a patient discontinues anti-depressants, the same medication may not be effective in the future, i.e. taking the medication changes something long-term in the brain. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This would be almost entirely dependent on the individual and up to a doctor's discretion. For this situation its hard to have a truly permanent response since there are so many factors that can lead to neurological shifts but net positive long-term changes do occur. At least four months of treatment post complete remission of symptoms is recommended. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3181895/" target="_blank">Studies have shown</a> that 76% of patients with residual symptoms that discontinued treatment relapsed within 10 months compared to 25% of patients with complete remission. Every person is different and <a href="https://genesight.com/landmark-study-shows-genesight-test-led-to-significant-improvement-in-mental-health-outcomes-for-patients-with-major-depressive-disorder/" target="_blank">genetics play a huge role</a>. I wish the question had a straightforward answer but I hope this helped!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of the side effects of anti-depressants don't go away, could that have to do with this? things like reduced sex drive, twitches and personality changes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very little is known about why these side effects occur and remain prevalent after treatment has stopped but gene expression is a major driving force behind how our bodies function so it is a definitely a possibility and worth extensive research.</p></div>		</li>
