			<div class="markdown"><p>In middle school I had to write a research paper, my very first, and I used it to make a quote that said the exact opposite of the original quote.  The original was, like: &quot;Napoleon was not a very good general and his success had more to do with luck than his personal brilliance&quot;  and I made it &quot;Napoleon was [...] a very good general and his success had [...] to do with [...] his personal brilliance.&quot;  I imagine grading middle school research papers is kind of a slog, so I don't blame my teacher for not picking up on it.</p></div>		</li>
