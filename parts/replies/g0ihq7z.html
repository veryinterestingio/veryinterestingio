			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to the body of info about turtles:
Their penis can indeed be quite large, as long as half the length of their shell. Sexual maturity is based on size, not age. So while a Greek tortoise might not reach sexual maturity for 10 or 15 years in the wild, the little guy I had was approaching maturity at only 4 years old. When males reach sexual maturity, some of them will start to &quot;flash&quot; their penises, so you can see what they look like that way (if you're into that sort of thing). However this can also be dangerous and there can be complications with the penis not going back in properly.
Tortoises, at least, tend to be quite easy to sex once they are mature. There are significant differences in shell and tail shape. Male tails do indeed tend to be longer and they sort of curl because of their length. Female tails are short and stout and tend to stick straight out. Also females have a larger body size overall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love his vids and I usually learn something new. I like that he includes facts that aren't necessarily the most glamorous aspects of the animal world, so not likely something you'd see/hear on a typical nature doc.</p></div>		</li>
