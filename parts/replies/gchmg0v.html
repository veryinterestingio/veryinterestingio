<p>In short, it's a great discovery if confirmed, because it confirms that life can be everywhere even in places like the atmosphere of a hellish planet like Venus. It will force us to think a bit outside the box and search for life in inhospitable places, and maybe go back to old data taken by missions like Pioneers and Venera.</p></div>		</li>
