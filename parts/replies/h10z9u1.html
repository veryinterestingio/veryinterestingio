			<div class="markdown"><p>Dyslexia is a fantastic example.  150 years ago, it was still fairly normal to be mostly or wholly illiterate, and even if you weren't, reading and writing weren't necessarily something you'd be doing every day to any lengthy extent.  You can't really figure out you're dyslexic if you can't read and your parents can't either.  Similarly, if you're dyslexic and can read, but your parents can't, they'd see you as having a talent, not a challenge, because being able to read at all would be impressive.  The more educated we become and the more academically complex jobs become, the more obvious it is if a person processes written language differently than the broader population.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I <em>think,</em> but I don't <em>know:</em></p>
<p>I think this is a big part of what we mean when we say certain disabilities are society dependent. People hear ADHD is a &quot;society dependent&quot; disability and they think that means it's not real, but what we're actually saying is that its severity is dependent on the society we live in. Consider that the disability facet of epilepsy probably went up when cars became an important part of daily life. Someday, possibly very soon, prosthetics might reach the point where missing a limb won't be as disabling as it is now.  </p>
<p>I took an exceptional children course in college, and the professor shared a model of thought that I quite liked, but I don't see used or discussed a lot. <strong>Impairment</strong> is when the body can't do a thing that we expect a body to do. A person without a leg is impaired because they can't use their leg, a person without a pinky is impaired because they can't use their pinky. <strong>Disability</strong> is when something interferes with day to day life. Having one leg is disabling because we're a species that relies on our legs, and we've built a society around the assumed use of legs. Having no pinky is much less disabling, because the pinky isn't the most critical index, and you can have a mostly normal life in spite of not having a pinky. </p>
<p>Until right this moment, when I was doing the research, I thought it was the other way around. I thought disability was when the body can't do a thing a body is expected to do, and impairment is when it gets in the way of daily life. I mean that makes sense to me...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An example of a disability or impairment that has more or less been erased except in niche areas is when someone needs glasses. My vision is extremely bad but I can see just fine with glasses. Glasses make it hard for me to do things like snorkeling or wearing a face mask and if they get broken or lost I can't do much, but overall they're so ubiquitous in society that no one even thinks about it. Before the invention of glasses my eyesight would have made me struggle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s known as the social model of disability, which states (as you said) that the impairment doesn’t cause a disability but instead how the world creates a barrier for those with that impairment. Remove the barrier and remove the disability. This model is the one disabled people’s organisations and charities (at least the ones I’ve encountered) highlight.</p>
<p>This compares with the medical model of disability, which is focused on ‘curing’ the impairment to remove the barrier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a friend that probably has dyslexia. She was struggling a lot in classes, and while helping her out I realized she couldn't find elements on the periodic table. I thought she was just stupid, but she's actually really smart, she just can't understand when the teacher talks, and has trouble reading the table. What she does manage to get she understands really well though, and it didn't take much for me to explain everything she was missing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ask her to try and read things from off-white paper, usually a soft yellow and see if that helps.</p>
<p>A lot of dyslexic people find changing paper colour or using a <a href="https://www.crossboweducation.com/dyslexia-coloured-overlays-and-visual-stress" target="_blank">coloured overlay</a> makes a significant difference in their ability to process and retain information.</p>
<p>Edit: Quite a few upvotes so I thought I'd come back and mention one other often overlooked aspect of dyslexia.  (I'm a SEN teacher.)</p>
<p>Some dyslexic kids (but not all) <em>really</em> struggle with organisation, to the point where a Sunday evening can become an incredibly emotional experience for a family as can simply packing the bag for the days lessons.  Home school books can be very useful to enable communication between teachers and parents.  Packing bags for school with parental help is often a big deal as well as just granting the kid a general understanding of what's coming up.  Calendars, colour coded timetables and planners are really useful tools.</p>
<p>If you reduce the elements of a students life that lead to anxiety.  Less of the mind's 'processing power' is focused on the worries.  This means more 'space' is freed to focus on the task at hand.  If you consider how difficult reading and processing language is for most dyslexic kids, they really don't need the added stress of remembering where they're supposed to be and what they were supposed to have as well as the general social stigma of always feeling weaker than your peers.  This becomes exhausting for many of them.</p>
<p>If you can give them strategies to organise, you can begin to counter the anxiety.  If you manage this then suddenly they can focus on what they need to do and generally outcomes will improve. </p>
<p>Essentially, in many cases,  a lot of the learning difficulty can be managed by supporting in other areas of the students education, primarily well-being and organisation.  You don't always have to be diving in with dyslexia interventions etc.  It's especially important for the self conscious kids who don't want to be labelled 'Sen' as they will often not engage with interventions or targeted support.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another idea, as a ESL tescher myself, is to stay beside the student as they're reading, but cover the entire text <em>except</em> the line they're reading from. That might help a great deal. Another idea is to just make the text bigger for them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Introduce her to the free font OpenDyslexic; it weights all characters so that they're easier to distinguish between. Also try getting a colored sheet of plastic to place over white paper while reading, and print on colored paper instead of white.</p>
<p>These are simple to try, and might help.</p>
<p>Edit: This post is getting traction, I see. There's also CSS (web style sheets) overrides you can apply (sometimes via browser settings, sometimes need a plug-in) to force a different background color for web text than white (you can also change your web browser default font, btw)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Holy hell, I struggled my whole life with reading out loud because I'd lose track of where I was reading in the sentence. I thought it was because I naturally read so fast. When reading to myself I'm fine until I get  fatigued then it's like I'm reading out loud in that I simply lose my place mid sentence.</p>
<p>Maybe I actually have light Dyslexia because that website was extremely easy for me to read.</p></div>		</li>

Pretty certain the only reason he hasn't been diagnosed himself is because he is very high function and no one diagnosed people with high functioning Aspergers when he was a kid. And he doesn't struggle with it as much as his kid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep! As a kid I was brought to the doctor for being a bit off. I had some sensory issues with sound and wasn't making friends very well. They diagnosed it as a hearing problem and sent me on my way. I am fairly sure I'm a high functioning person somewhere on the spectrum.</p>
<p>Body language does NOT come intuitively - I can read it after I ask a bunch of questions and then tie that body language to a general emotion/ feeling.</p>
<p>I'm a conceptual learner - if I don't understand the overall concept it is very challenging for me to learn. For example on the day we learned division &amp; long division I didn't know what the word divide meant or how it related to math. I cried in class because everyone else was doing the problems and I didn't know what any of it meant. Then the teacher helped me and said something like &quot;well dividing is kind of like splitting - if you have 9/3 you're figuring out how many 3s would add up to 9&quot; and it clicked in my head and I was doing long division in my head 30 seconds later.</p>
<p>But now I'm in my mid 30s and am too scared to talk to a doctor. I have ADHD and anxiety and those medications help me a lot. I don't know whether I'm on the spectrum or not but it sure feels like it some days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had like three different people suggest I had Aspergers or was on the spectrum. I didn't know the word twenty years ago. Most recent one was about a bundle of cables covered in tape that I offered to clean up and coil properly. The owner asked if I had Aspergers, had a tactile fixation with sticky stuff or something. I responded &quot;no, I just believe there's a correct way to do things and like to do them the way they're supposed to be done and your sticky tape nest is distracting and annoying&quot;. I'm not sure if I made my point or his.</p></div>		</li>
