			<div class="markdown"><p>German is loaded with them, especially surnames. Since nouns are capitalized in German, sometimes I wonder if it doesn't get confusing what's a name and what's just the noun, in written text.</p>
<p>From wikipedia:</p>
<p>The most common surnames in Germany are reportedly:[14]</p>
<pre><code>Müller, Möller ("miller")
Schmidt, Schmitt, Schmitz, Schmied ("smith, blacksmith")
Schneider ("tailor")
Fischer ("fisherman")
Weber ("weaver")
Meyer, Meier, Meir, Meyr, Mayer, Maier, Mair, or Mayr (often the senior farmer in a given settlement [running a "full range" farmstead in terms of area, workforce and harvest, compared to various partitions of lesser size], often as the leaseholder of a landlord like an abbey, a worldly ruler, etc.; "tenant, steward, sometimes also a bailiff, but not a mayor"[15][unreliable source])
Wagner ("carter, cartwright")</code></pre></div>		</li>

<p>But in the ancient world it was more common to have names that would be a word of phrase in the language as they did not have the big pool of names to draw from.</p>

<p>In ancient Rome it was even usual to simply give your child a number for a name. E.g. Quintus, Sixtus, Septimus for the fifth, sixth or seventh son of a family.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm reminded by the brief stint of poets trying to come up with poems involving flies for some reason...  At least one was about a guy trying to convince a woman that what he wanted to do wasn't fornication... because flies, basically.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, I hardly remember this, I just feel like there's something about flies that we're missing.</p></div>		</li>
