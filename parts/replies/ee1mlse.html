			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes sense!</p>
<p>It happens every time I'm &quot;empty&quot;. I've learned my lesson and drink a LOT of water, so it shouldn't happen again.
Not gonna puke on an empty stomach again :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's also my solution, but I wondered what makes it feel much worst than actually throwing up. Pretty sure we've all been there!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had this feeling last year. And I cannot stress enough how seeing the doctor is important. I thought I had food poisoning again, turns out I had big marble sized gal stones that required my galbladder to be removed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Opposite side of the spectrum. </p>
<p>My ex's step dad went blind about 6 years ago. Just chalked it up to age. Not totally blind. Just can't read or drive. </p>
<p>Fast forward, last year he got sick. Lost a bunch of weight. Finally went to the doctor where they diagnosed him with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The first symptom? Loss of vision. </p>
<p>Had he went to the doctor years ago, he'd have a much better road from here on out. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Not being sarcastic, my parents never took my to a doctor when I had a stomach flu so I'm not sure what happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh. I guess I could see that. My brother and I couldn't hold anything down for 3-4 days and our parents said if we didn't get better we would go in for fluids. But stomach bugs are almost always caused by a virus so antibiotics can't help. You just need to let them go. Rest, drink fluids, rest. That's what I always thought.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My fiancee just spent Christmas weekend in the hospital. They were throwing up for 3 days, but couldn't figure out why. When they finally went to the ER&lt; they were so dehydrated, their kidneys were shutting down, and there blood was becoming septic.</p>
<p>If we had waited 6-12 more hours, they very well could have died.</p></div>		</li>
