			<div class="markdown"><p>Layman here, isn't it going to depend on nutrient availability whether or not success is achieved in restoring function? I would think the ability to restore blood flow would be very important in this. Isn't that why the blood vessels are chirurgically re-attached?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, first thing that should be aimed is usually restoring blood flow to a sufficient extent, thus preventing tissue necrosis due to lack of oxygen and nutrients. That being said, in regards to restoring motor function, the most important thing is trying to reattach the proximal and distal parts of the severed nerve. The intention is not reattaching the nerve per se, but the connective tissue around the fibers, it acts as a &quot;guide&quot; for the fibers to grow back and reach new the tissue again</p></div>		</li>
