			<div class="markdown"><p>This is so true. I had read that if you feel like you have difficulty remembering a subject such as when you are studying for an exam in college, you should go to sleep and repeat the study and you will realize you can actually remember the details you couldn't the night before. I always had success with this method. I'd study the night before and no matter how frustrated I got about some subjects, I'd go to sleep and wake up early and repeat the study and I'd remember it all during the exam. I also often solved math and physics problems in my sleep and remembered the solution in the morning.</p></div>		</li>
