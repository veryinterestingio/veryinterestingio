			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll take this opportunity to point out that almost none of the countertops advertised as &quot;granite&quot; are actually granite.</p>
<p>A huge proportion are marbles, schists, gniesses, andesites, gabbros etc etc etc. There's a lot of <em>very pretty</em> rocks being used, but there's a lot that are pretty which I wouldn't choose to put in a kitchen for mechanical/chemical reasons. There's also a lot of man-made cemented aggregates getting used.</p>
<p>Sorry, geology pet peeve. :D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want hot pans, you need to go with natural stone, like marble, but you need to know that they are slightly porous and you need to wipe them down if you spill colored stuff like wine. Engineered stones (quartz) don't handle heat but are non porous. That's the choice you need to make. I'm pretty sure there is a stone that does both, but it wasn't in my price range when I was doing research.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We went with stainless steel countertops. Can handle heat, don't stain and easy to clean. We went to a metal shop and they measured, did the bends and installed for a quarter the price of granite. Not many people like the look of stainless, but we sure do. And everyone that comes over ask for out countertop guy's number.  It does scratch, but that adds character for us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For purely practical reasons, stainless steel makes the best countertops. Source: 15 years in production kitchens. Steel can handle abuse, heat, stains, anything. Plus you can wipe it down and immediately see if you missed a spot.</p>
<p>However, if you deck out your whole kitchen in stainless steel it's gonna look like a morgue or a surgery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In terms of hard wearing sanitary surfaces, stainless steel is pretty difficult to beat. </p>
<p>If you want rock, granite is very hard wearing and minimally porous or reactive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen quartz done like this... 3/4&quot;  thick material with a mitered 1.5&quot; edge and 3/4&quot; plywood buildup.</p>
<p>Nothing cheap or low quality about it though. 2cm stone is still a quality product.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quartz is also often way stronger and thus id imagine it would be able to be thinner while still being quite durable. Most of what I've put is have been custom built cabinets where the client wouldn't stand for anything less than a solid top. But just about everything I've torn out prior to a remodel has been either formica, composite, or cheaper granite.</p></div>		</li>
