			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the kind of fish. Some fish need larger spaces than others, and some fish can cohabitate more peacefully than others. I personally believe that a 5-gallon tank is the bare minimum - fishbowls or anything else smaller than 5g is just unfair to the fish.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>generally you should not put fish in anything less than 10 gallons. you should aim for 1 small fish per 1-2 gallons and also be mindful of the aquarium bioload, which is basically the amount of biological waste vs the habitat's capability of dealing with it. the bigger the tank and the better the filtration, the higher bioload that your aquarium will be able to handle and the more fish that you can have. </p>
<p>when in doubt, it is much better to understock your tank than overstock it and kill them all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the species involved, but as a good general rule, I usually hear 1 gallon per inch of fish, and some need considerably more than that.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>without some kind of filtration system, will end up depleted of oxygen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not so much filtering, as disturbing the surface.  Moving the water.  More water / air interaction the more gas exchange can take place.  It will always try to balance the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels.  In aquariums we simulate this with power heads and bubbles.  In nature, waves, wind and anything that disrupts the water surface does the work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If any natural body of water were as full of feces as an unfiltered fish tank, those fish would be sick and dying too</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To a point.  Aquariums require a start up phase.  It is building up the bacterial load to complete the nitrogen cycle.  With a big enough bacteria load, ammonia no longer because a problem.  It is converted and pushed down the line in the cycle.  Eventually being used by plants.  It is possible to achieve a balance and not need a filter for your aquarium.  This is called the Walstad method.  Named after the author of Ecology of a Planted Aquarium.</p></div>		</li>
