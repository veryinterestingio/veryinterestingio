			<div class="markdown"><p>I think these are all good points but one more is the concept of competition.  In preschool they are in a big group for the first time and when they want to be heard in a large group of similarly aged children they only have a few tools, one of which is to simply be way louder to get the teachers attention..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a really good contribution.</p>
<p>I'm sure that anyone can attest to the fact that when you're in a space where people are speaking loudly you also compensate naturally, which leads to others nearby also increasing their volume, and this can create a positive feedback loop of increasingly loud voices when it's a group situation in a confined space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In elementary school our teachers eventually introduced a &quot;traffic light&quot; (looked like one too) with Green, yellow, red levels into the lunch room which monitored the ambient noise levels of all us kids.  Anytime it hit red it would sound a quick tone and it meant 30 seconds of silence.  Hated it as a kid, but it certainly helped us kids learn and it was entertaining to watch it slowly creep up.</p>
<p>As an adult in healthcare now, we have the same basic devices in ICUs to help keep tabs us noisy adults, lol.  But again... It helps keep everyone in check when things get crazy and those feedback loops begin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most teachers are taught not to escalate the noise. When your class is noisy if you raise your voice, so will the students. Instead lower your voice, sometimes stop and wait. People find silence uncomfortable and will stop what they are doing to see why it got quiet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it kind of dovetails with the original idea that they are children and they're still learning.  When you're 4 your tool box is kind of sparce right?  You have tantrums and pouting and yelling lol.  So in this case you choose yelling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. My eldest was a quiet kid before he started school. Talked at reasonable levels all the time. A couple of months after starting school and he's yelling everything, which trickles down to his younger sibling and now they both yell to he heard over the other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kids that are always talking way too loud have struggled to be heard in the past. It doesn't have to be in large groups though, a parent that is also very loud or hard of hearing is all it takes. And it's much harder to ignore a loud child's pestering for attention. If you don't tell them off every time, they'll keep using their &quot;trick to be heard&quot;, especially if there are no consequences.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This might not always be the case. I believe the lack of self awareness from my personal experience. My son seemed to have only one volume when he was little - when we were indoors it was too loud, when we were out or in a noisy place, it was too quiet. My daughter, who was much more socially aware from a much earlier age never seemed to have that problem.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Or a parent who ignores them. We've all been in a store where a kid is repeating &quot; Mom. Mom. MOM. MOM! MOM!!!&quot; while mom is obliviously checking her phone or whatever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great points. Also empathy hasn't developed - young kids need to learn to put themselves in other's shoes. So while it's second nature to most adults to talk quietly because someone's asleep/working, it won't even occur to a child to consider that.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As adults, we would be, like &quot;hey, little fucker, can't you see your mom is having a conversation ?&quot;, but children are completely oblivious to anyhting but the attention they request.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but is also a matter of learning the kid to not interrupt when adults are talking and not stopping the conversation every time the kid wants.
I've been sometimes visiting and decided to go because it was literally impossible to talk more than a couple of minutes. The kids were the whole time asking for attention.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But I think also, as adults, most of us would make an effort to include the third person in the conversation, which people generally don't do with kids. If I'm out with my friend and they bump into a colleague and start chatting to them while totally ignoring me, I'm going to get impatient too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Culture is a big part of this too....</p>
<p>Children in some cultures are much quieter than other cultures. How the parents parent and enforce social norms at home makes a big difference.</p>
<p>I guess this is part of the whole nature versus nurture thing, and Iâ€™ve always thought it was a mix.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. I'm this case, I'd argue it's less enforcement and more role modelling.</p>
<p>I grew up in a quiet home - no one ever needed to raise their voice to be listened to, the TV was never loud, music was an instrument being played not a stereo on full blast, everyone even <em>moved</em> quietly around the place. My siblings and I were often noisy kids, obviously, but as we grew we slowly took on those characteristics because that's the way our world was.</p>
<p>My first girlfriend came from a loud home. She had to talk over people to be heard, people competed with cranking up their music, she and her siblings defined their space by taking it over with noise apart from anything else. Boy they were loud people! They would even stand opposite ends of the house hollering at each other. </p>
<p>I remember the day I explained &amp; demonstrated how you could walk half a minute and have a quiet conversation with someone, rather than shouting upstairs louder and louder until they responded. It was like a light going on in her head. She'd just never been shown how to live that way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny, I always found it irritating that my ex would insist on me dropping everything I was doing, relocating myself to the room she was in and then asking the question quietly, rather than just calling out, even when the question was a yes/no or I was in immediate need of physical assistance.</p>
<p>YMMV. Shouted conversations are not great obviously, but silence is not inherently virtuous.</p></div>		</li>

<p>My childhood was this, too, and then I dated someone similar to you who asked me to stop shouting across the house. I tried it out and realized I prefer it so much. Just walk to wherever the person is who you want to talk to and talk to them there. Now I find shouting across the house super jarring and disruptive.</p></div>		</li>
