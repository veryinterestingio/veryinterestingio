			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention our life styles are dramatically different now. Humans were not built to live sedentary lifestyles. Evolutionarily speaking in less than half of a blink of an eye we went from tracking game down by tiring it out over 30 miles and being the best long distance travelers in the animal kingdom to playing league of legends and sitting in an office for most of the time we are awake.</p>
<p>Evolution happens on times scales in the millions to tens of millions of years. Its been IIRC like 10k years since we went from hunter gatherers to farmstead societies? Evolution has not even started to notice its changed and its unrecognizably different in the ways we live our life. So our bodies are just not &quot;balanced&quot; for this type of lifestyle. We are putting round pegs though square holes with modern medicine and its an amazing miracle.</p>
<p>Thats not even including the fact that there is no traditional Darwinism any more. Social Darwinism is now dramatically more important in carrying on your line than if your not an idiot and can find food and have no birth defects. So we have no real filter for keeping out &quot;bad&quot; traits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. It's been roughly 12000 years between starting to learn agriculture and now with the internet and shit. Evolutionarily speaking we are going about our lives with &quot;caveman&quot; brains still. We literally weren't built for how our societies function these days. </p>
<p>As for your last point. It's basically <a href="https://youtu.be/sP2tUW0HDHA" target="_blank">this</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Humans have been fundamentally unchanged in an evolutionary sense for 150-300k years. A human baby from then could be transported today and raised as if they were born to parents from now and turn out just like any other person. </p>
<p>The roughly 10k years between going from nomadic hunter gatherers to working 9-5s in a sedentary office is the blink of an eye.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Or</p>
<p>What if you took 200 engineers, accountants and business analysts and plopped them into the jungle with spears and wild boars.  </p>

<p>It's hard living in areas where descendants of traditional cultures struggle to integrate with modern civilization. It's tough to see so much potential getting it so hard</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And more importantly, with modern medicine we've basically stopped evolution entirely. Traits only get selected against if they tend to prevent an individual from living long enough to pass on their Genes, and we've artificially stopped that from happening with doctors and hospitals and medicine. Stuff that SHOULD take someone out of the gene pool and thus be evolutionarily disadvantageous now just means a trip to the hospital and boom,  you're still around to pass on your genes.</p>
<p>It also works the other way around; back in the day you needed to be better than most of your peers in order to survive and pass on your genes, so EVERY tiny little advantage mattered. If you were just a bit taller, or had better eyesight, or could run faster, or were a tiny bit more resistant to some disease, those traits would be selected for, and over time, humanity as a whole would become taller, or have better eyesight, or run faster, or be more resistant to that disease.</p>
<p>But in modern times, youre basically GUARANTEED to survive, relatively speaking, so EVERYONE passes on their genes rather than just the ones with those advantageous traits, so we dont ever change. We, as a species, stop getting taller or faster or more resistant to some disease or getting better eyesight, because those traits no longer provide a survival advantage over others who dont have them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But you're wrong. Evolution doesn't stop just because our environment looks different. Not everyone has kids, not everyone lives very long and most of the genetic diseases that exist today exist precisely because natural selection did not filter it out. The biological norms for humans will surely change regardless.</p>
<p>Lot's of people misunderstand what &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; means and the term itself isn't perfect. It's not &quot;only the best survive and have kids!!&quot; it's more about  being better than completely misadapted and... having a bit of luck. The reason cancer is so common among older people is because it doesn't lower the chances of surviving until you can have and raise some kids. People who don't get cancer when they're old don't have higher fitness than those who do.</p>
<p>And either way, humans have survived because of cooperation and taking care of each other. Our ancestors didn't survive because they alone were the best, but because they were a part of a group. It would be a kind of evolution to &quot;filter out&quot; any humans that don't have &quot;perfect genes&quot; (whoever gets to decide that...), but it would also be a step back for humanity. I would love to live in a world where every human gets a good life, regardless of their genetic makeup. Evolution doesn't just go one way, towards the perfect organism, it's wonky and messy and so so random. Evolution literally just means change in the overall genetic makeup of a population.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, since addiction is usually defined in terms of &quot;a substance or behavior that someone feels compelled to continue doing despite negative life consequences&quot;, the idea of a 'positive addiction' is sort of an oxymoron. You could frame a couple of things that way that have both negative and positive effects where we consider the positive to be worth the negative, like caffeine or many prescription drugs, but I don't think that's what you were talling about.</p>
<p>Good things that give you cravings to do more of them are usually just considered, well... good. Exercise causes endorphins that can be super habit-building, for example, and is a good thing unless you take it to an unhealthy extreme. Or cleaning, or socializing, or playing, or eating calorie-dense food... in moderation, all of these things are good for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically I agree. But I think ppl who have surveyed the land so to speak, and decided run 4 miles or drugs?   Will sometimes choose the latter as a public service to society. I'd agree moderation is probably the healthiest choice tho. Have a good sunday.</p></div>		</li>
