			<div class="markdown"><p>To carry your analogy</p>
<p>It could also be, say a new roof.</p>
<p>As part of the addition, you can extend upwards into the loft.</p>
<p>Which may require a different roof support structure.</p>
<p>This could, in theory, have less wood.</p>
<p>So, you don't really gain a loft, you lose an old normal loft and gain a new liveable loft.</p>
<p>But because it's a change of content, the removal of old and addition of new might result in less wood for the new structure.</p></div>		</li>
