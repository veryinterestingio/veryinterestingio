			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course, basically everything in the body has a possibility of malfunctioning because of certain conditions. Insomnia can be caused by problem in the multiple mechanisms that help you to sleep, anxiety and stress for example can cause insomnia. The more information your doctor gets from you then the better chance of knowing what exactly is the problem ex: sleep schedule, use of devices before bed, stress, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The brain is extremely complicated and as such, it can malfunction in all sorts of ways, both mundane and bizarre. I couldn't possibly tell you why you have insomnia and can only say that you should listen to your doctor. If it's beyond the ability of your primary care doctor to treat, you should find a specialist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>sometimes insomnia is a form of learnt behaviour and not a chemical issue which is why they use CBTi to understand the root causes and find routes to help people un-learn the behaviours/anxieties</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is super interesting because it would imply we have direct conscious control over this process. or we don't have real control at all and our brain just makes up a story that suits what is happening. &quot;Just one more video&quot; = The awake chemicals are still winning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whether or not you have conscious control of anything, free will, is more of a philosophical question than a scientific one. Personally, I don't think free will is real because it would necessitate consciousness having some extra-physical properties, and I don't believe in such things. I also think compatibilism is a rhetorical trick and does not actually resolve the issue at hand.</p></div>		</li>
