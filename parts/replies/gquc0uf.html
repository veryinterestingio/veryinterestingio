			<div class="markdown"><p>That is very interesting, so I am just wondering if what I am taking from this article is correct. Are the extreme magnetic fields actually changing the chemical properties of the atoms. Thanks :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is correct. Even under small magnetic fields, pairs of up and down spin electrons will deviate slightly from their expected energy values. </p>
<p>See: Zeeman Splitting

<p>The sorts of magnetic fields that are encountered in astrophysics are crazy, and can distort the atoms even further (past the linear regime) and stretch the atoms out like little needles. This means the energy values of the electrons become totally alien from the perspective of our normal chemistry, when the perturbing magnetic term dominate over the other terms in the schrodinger equation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Magnetic fields affecting atoms is how ESR spectroscopy works, although only changing things by enough to detect it with radio waves!</p>
<p>NMR/MRI is similar, but with the magnetic fields affecting the nucleus of the atoms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This article is about white dwarfs not neutron Stars. In neutron Stars, besides in the very outermost layers, you don't have any real atoms left so it doesn't make sense to talk about atoms, molecules and chemistry</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OOOOPS. My mistake.</p>
<p>The article is however about the matter in the surface of neutron stars, where electrons and nuclei will organize into some kind of structure and behave according to some patterns when interacting with themselves, with light, etc. The structures would be very far from ordinary matter, and the behavior far from ordinary chemistry and spectroscopy, but you can still try to make sense out of them.</p></div>		</li>
