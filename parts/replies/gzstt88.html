			<div class="markdown"><p>That is kosher salt though, which is quite uncommon in home cooking, but almost a given in any gourmet recipe or restaurant food. Kosher salt is orders of magnitude weaker than table salt, which allows for better coverage, so every bite is salted evenly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s a lot more common than it used to be, in the US. Alton Brown and other Food Network folks have popularized it in the last 20 years. Growing up, I don’t think my small town grocery store even carried kosher salt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish I knew how to use salt better. I’m so hesitant to use salt, because I’m afraid of over-salting and ending up with a salty taste in the end. But, I probably end up under-salting in reality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing to note is to salt your food beforehand. If you’re using any liquids with salt in your dish like soy sauce, fish sauce, broth, or cooking wine, or any powder seasonings with salt, use less salt than you would normally. It’s important not to forgo salt while cooking, because when you add it to the meal beforehand, it gives the salt time to dissolve into the food evenly, which is best for taste. If you do it afterwards, you risk putting too much because the salt crystals aren’t fully dissolved, so you don’t taste all the salt you’re eating and it still tastes bland. But yeah, you have to learn your own tastes for putting salt into things, but that’s why you should taste as you go along. If you like things saltier than other people, be sure to put a little less than what you think tastes right. And remember not to put salt in multiple parts of your dish (for example, don’t have a sauce with cooking sherry AND a salted dry rub, do one or the other.). Seriously. That’s the main thing people do that makes things salty.</p></div>		</li>
