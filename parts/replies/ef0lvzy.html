			<div class="markdown"><p>Hence “predominantly” in my statement.  I’m actually an apheresis physician who treats both refractory humoral rejection (plasma exchange) and GVHD and refractory cellular rejection (photopheresis).  Cellular rejection is far more common.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, it's an autoimmune disease but using immunosuppressors isn't something a doc would likely choose to use to treat it.  These drugs are seriously hard on the body and can cause lung and liver damage.  On top of it, the side effects (nausea esp) are pretty hardcore.  I am on one and when I took it orally, I was nauseous for about 3-4 days, sometimes longer depending on how bad my stomach took it.  On injections, I'm mildly nauseous for 1-2 days.  Being on one of these drugs is like planning to have a regular flu scheduled once a week.  Not to mention that hair falling out is another side effect.   </p>
<p>AA is a super distressing disease for sure but sadly, this would be like treating it with a nuke.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agree- I have alopecia (totalis- totally bald) and would give anything for a cure, but there’s no way I’d go near any of the current immunosuppressant drugs. Not worth it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I was to take a total guess at a use case it would be for something like auto-immunity where you truly want to reset the immune system rather than suppress it for a period of time.  I know nothing about measles and I would guess it wouldn’t accomplish that, but nonetheless a cool thought experiment to try and use a virus as a reset...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its definitely something that could in &quot;theory&quot; be helpful, but we have better ways to achieve the same thing while having more control over how much damage we are doing. But, I agree its interesting as a sort of &quot;thought experiment&quot; for lack of a better term.</p></div>		</li>
