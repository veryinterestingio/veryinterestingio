			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, you just reminded me... What you describe is the difference between being in deep non-REM sleep vs light REM stage of sleep. Typically we'd go thru about 4 cycles iirc during an 8 hour sleep.</p>
<p>You probably know about those are smart alarm apps that track your sleep stage and wake you up during a window of time when you are in a light phase of sleep. This means you wake up easily feeling refreshed vs a fixed alarm that has the chance of disturbing a deep phase where you'd feel sluggish and is much harder to wake up from.</p>
<p>So probably what's happening when I overdo the supplements is i'm spending longer in these deep phases and/or these deep phases of sleep are much deeper than typical.</p>
<p>Interesting topic but i'm definitely not an authority on it.</p></div>		</li>
