			<div class="markdown"><p>Man, I loudly gasped at your graph. Could you explain further? Is that real data or simulated? What did you graph it with? To what corresponds the green part and the width of the signal?? Also, what class is that for?</p>
<p>Currently studying Astronomy and this really grabbed my attention. Congrats!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Think of that image as being a continous feed from a printer, like the graphs on a EKG measuring heart activity. This graph prints in a downwards direction.</p>
<p>The satellite is transmitting on one small range of frequencies, and as it got closer to the receiver the radio waves was compressed so it looked like the frequency range moved sideways on the receiver side. That means the receiver has to adjust the range of frequencies it listens to in order to follow the signal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, so I got inspired and tried to simulate that same graph but with real data. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/FP6ClWD.png" target="_blank">Here are the results</a>, beware for they are in spanish but I hope there's no really need for a translation. Here's the data I used:</p>
<p>Satellite in question: The ISS</p>
<p>Height of Orbit = 400km over surface</p>
<p>Carrier Band = 3GHz (Or the S-Band according to <a href="https://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Telecommunications_Integrated_Applications/Satellite_frequency_bands" target="_blank">this website</a>) Which is where the 0 in centered on my graph's vertical axis.</p>
<p>Max Freq of Transmission = 15kHz</p>
<p>Module Index = 1</p>
<p>Hope it is a little bit clearer now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look at some SDR software like SDRSharp.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
OK, first look up &quot;SDR&quot; (Software Defined Radio) on Amazon/whatever, and see that you can get one for $25.  Then, once it's delivered, build a ghetto 2 meters antenna out of scrap wires (or sticks and coat hangers) laying around, plug it into your computer, and run an SDR app (like SDRSharp for Windows), and have a blast seeing and hearing all this stuff.   Depending on your geographic location (and noise floor - away from the city is better), you can absolutely pick up a sat with a surprisingly small/cheap amount of equipment.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Hit me up if you really think this stuff is neat (or head over to /r/amateurradio and/or /r/sdr ); we can help get you started for dirt-cheap.  Amateur radio isn't just about 70 year olds bitching about their ingrown toenails; I got into it because I like the tech aspect.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Here you can see the radiocommunications of a normal satellite that is passing over a ground station.</p>

<p>Is that second, fainter band that looks like it has a different curvature, from a different satellite?</p></div>		</li>
