			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I'm a biologist, not a nanotechnology expert, but it seems like we pretty much have the technology to make similar structures already.  <a href="https://epsrc.ukri.org/newsevents/news/selfcleaningwindows/" target="_blank">This article</a> discusses a type of glass with nanostructures of the same basic size and shape, though it wasn't designed with antibacterial properties in mind.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Brass handles and other surfaces are promising. Don't know if the time scale is too large though.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought that was why the push plate on a lot of public toilets was brass but then over the years they seemed to turn to stainless steel and then to disappear altogether (i guess for design reasons) so then i thought I'd remembered wrong or it had been proven not ti be the case or something.</p>
<p>Imagine the public health benefits if commonly touched sutfaces eg handles and hand railes were copper alloys.</p></div>		</li>
