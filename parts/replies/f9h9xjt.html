			<div class="markdown"><p>There are other forms of humor, but yes, memes are often funny because they are confusing/surprising.  Also, it is not just about confusion, but redirection as well, you thought the pattern was going one way, but it went another way that still fit with the pattern.</p>
<p>Memes often take a familiar character or catchphrase and put them in a novel setting that temporary confuses us.  That's part of the reason memes get stale so quickly, not just because everyone has to try their own lame-ass take, but because they become more familiar than their source material and lose the sense of surprise.  The only become funny again when they break their own pattern.  *Yawn*, there is condescending Willy Wonka, wait, he is making fun of the unimaginative jerks who misuse this meme, that's funny.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say some of the funniest jokes are the are then we don't know we are being tricked, even if we know a joke is coming.</p>
<p>&quot;A man walks into a bar...&quot; sets up the standard patron-bartender exchange joke, but &quot;...damn near fractured his skull.&quot; tricks up because we already went down the wrong path with our expectations.  The same is true for deadpan humor where you aren't even aware a joke was being told until after it is finished.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but that's what I'm saying. The whole context is that we know we are being tricked but the way we are being tricked is different than as to what we expect. And of course this doesn't include all types of humor.</p></div>		</li>
