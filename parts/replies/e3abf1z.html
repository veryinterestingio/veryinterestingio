			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha u/r0hhan's heart is at the right place, just that his explanation is too concise for ELI5.
Let me try.</p>
<p>Newton's idea that &quot;every mass is attracted to every other mass&quot;, while a good approximation, is not right and gravity is better explained by Einstein's idea of &quot;general relativity&quot;.</p>
<p>It states that gravity isn't a force that pulls objects towards one another, like Newton thought, but instead is a result of how space and time behave. Space can stretch and squeeze and time can flow at different rates for different people. We combine the <em>squishing</em> and <em>stretching</em> of space, and <em>speeding</em> and <em>slowing</em> of time into one convenient 4D vector called &quot;spacetime&quot;.</p>
<p>Einstein's field equations show that &quot;gravity&quot; is an illusion caused by an object following its natural path in a curved spacetime. </p>
<p>Say two ants start on the south pole of a basketball. The basketball would look like a flat surface to them. Now they walk at different angles in a straight line towards the north pole. They'd eventually meet up at the north pole. It's plain obvious to us, but the meetup would completley baffle the ants because to them they walked on a flat plane in two different directions and yet ended up at the same place! They can't see that their flat 2-D basketball surface is actually &quot;curved&quot; into the 3rd dimension which is causing this behavior. </p>
<p>To make any sense of this, they assume that there must be a mysterious force acting on them that pulled them towards each other.  How else would they end up in the same place? They name it &quot;Bravity&quot;. Their Newton even comes up with a good formula for bravity. Until, centuries later, Ant-stein realizes that even though they can't see it, their 2-D surface is not 2-D but is actually curved into the 3rd dimension in a sphere shape and bravity is just a result of this curvature.</p>
<p>Similarly, we are the ants. Our 3D space is &quot;curved&quot; into the 4th dimension. For a 4 dimensional being gravity would be trivially obvious but to us it looks like a force. </p>
<p>Light, while massless, travels through this spacetime and is actually just following a &quot;straight line path&quot; in 4D spacetime, which looks curved to us in 3D, as if some force affected it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good explanation on gravity, but it doesn't explain why light exerts a gravitational force on other objects - it only explains why light experiences a gravitational force.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I actually edited out the part where I explained how this spacetime fabric is warped by matter and local concentration of energy because OP only asked &quot;how does light experience gravity&quot;and adding that would've made an already long answer really long </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, in a way, Newton’s second law still kinda hold true. The whole “equal and opposite reaction” thing. If only the light felt gravity and not the other way around, it would violate the core idea that forces come in pairs.</p>
<p>Also, it would violate conservation of momentum.  If the light experiences gravity and loses momentum than something <strong>must</strong> gain it.</p>
<p>As has been explained above, gravity <strong>isnt</strong> a force. However, the Newton’s second law, hints at a property that is much more fundamental and is still true even when gravity isn’t though of as a force.
Conservation of (angular) momentum is one of the most fundamental ideas in physics and the idea that if light experiences gravity from an object than that object must feel light’s gravity can be derived from it.</p></div>		</li>
