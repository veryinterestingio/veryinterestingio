			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't a modern forge basically a historical re-enactment though? Like the real modern equivalent (ie where the majority of metal tools are made) is a totally automated factory or at the very least a machine shop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much. The metal industry has moved on from forges, the only active ones that are left are more like metal sculpture artists. Just like how carpenters and cobblers still exist, but aren't the focus of the furniture or shoe industry anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are still some things that are best done by hand. (Or at least non-automated.) Years ago I took a blacksmithing class from a master smith whose shop specialized in artistic lighting pieces. His shop had created all the sconces and chandeliers for Universal's Harry Potter Park in FL, as well as a gigantic chandelier in the Wynn in Las Vegas. They make everything by hand, though supplemented with things like power hammers for parts of it. But the artistic parts and still done through human power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much. We have hydraulic and pneumatic tools, powered fans, induction heating, and digital thermometers. But there is the point that it's not just historical reenactment, people really do enjoy blacksmithing. So it is something that arguably survives in modern times, even if it isn't present in commercial manufacturing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Due to the way the modern machines look, sure, but the concept of automated hammers is quite old and wouldn't be entirely incomprehensible to them. People used automatic hammers powered by river mills well before the middle ages, they were just extremely rare until the industrial revolution made it possible to build them anywhere.</p>
<p>A factory would definitely be seen as witchcraft, but a power hammer is probably pretty easy for someone from the middle ages to understand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the things you learn to do early on with modern blacksmithing is how to make your own tools. I can imagine this has been true for pretty much the entirety of blacksmithing. That smith from Gotland probably made his first set of tools by using the tools the smith he learned from had and so on and so forth back to some early smith using rocks to hammer out the first crude tools.</p></div>		</li>
