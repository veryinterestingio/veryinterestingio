<p>I just wanted to add my favorite example, <a href="https://forum.duolingo.com/comment/25323797/Fun-Chinese-poem-The-Lion-Eating-Poet-in-the-Stone-Den" target="_blank">Lion-Eating Poet in the Stone Den</a>.</p>
<p>The translated story reads: In a stone den was a poet called Shi Shi, who was a lion addict, and had resolved to eat ten lions. He often went to the market to look for lions. At ten o’clock, ten lions had just arrived at the market. At that time, Shi had just arrived at the market. He saw those ten lions, and using his trusty arrows, caused the ten lions to die. He brought the corpses of the ten lions to the stone den. The stone den was damp. He asked his servants to wipe it. After the stone den was wiped, he tried to eat those ten lions. When he ate, he realized that these ten lions were in fact ten stone lion corpses. Try to explain this matter.</p>
<p>In Chinese, however, it is read: Shíshì shīshì Shī Shì, shì shī, shì shí shí shī. Shì shíshí shì shì shì shī. Shí shí, shì shí shī shì shì. Shì shí, shì Shī Shì shì shì. Shì shì shì shí shī, shì shǐ shì, shǐ shì shí shī shìshì. Shì shí shì shí shī shī, shì shíshì. Shíshì shī, Shì shǐ shì shì shíshì. Shíshì shì, Shì shǐ shì shí shì shí shī. Shí shí, shǐ shí shì shí shī shī, shí shí shí shī shī. Shì shì shì shì.</p></div>		</li>

<p>First, you have to understand that each of the shapes above and below the letter is its own character. So &quot;A&quot; + &quot; &#x0308;&quot; = &quot;A&#x0308;&quot;, made of the two characters. The OP's Noice is at least 30 letters long.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Third, Unicode has a simple way of implementing these symbols. They move to a position relative to the preceding character. Like how &quot;A&quot; + &quot; &#x0308;&quot; = &quot;A&#x0308;&quot;, you can continue adding and stacking symbols. &quot;A&quot; + &quot; &#x0308;&quot; + &quot; &#x0303;&quot; = &quot;A&#x0308;&#x0303;&quot;</p>
<p>[...]</p>

<p>Fixed that (hopefully) for you.  To get U+0303 (for example), you can type <code>&amp;#x0303;</code> (note specifically the <code>x</code> after the <code>#</code> and the closing <code>;</code>, both required).</p></div>		</li>
