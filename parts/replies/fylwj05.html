<p>It's just really reasonable to take all the holds down and clean them with any regularity.</p></div>		</li>

<li>Artistry - Go on r/bombing and it's pretty obvious these people have a respect for their craft. Also, since mayors only beautify the areas of a city that can attract tourists or belong to middle class and higher, tags are often the most beautiful part of a poor neighborhood.</li>
<li>Exposure - There's something more visceral about seeing tags on buildings than in an art museum. It's like the inverse of billboards, since what you're seeing is unsolicited personal expression rather than unsolicited corporate interests. Banksy has a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Graffiti/comments/8ngoxj/banksy_on_messing_with_advertisement/" target="_blank">fantastic quote</a> about this.</li>
<li>Fun - Climbers do something called &quot;reading&quot; routes and bouldering problems; basically, it's figuring out where your hands and feet are going to go, in what order, and which positions you're going to use to maintain control during the climb. The problem-solving aspect is one of the most fun aspects of the activity, and tagging in difficulty places requires you to read buildings.</li>
<li>Agency - So much of what people do now feels transient and unfulfilling. You spend all day working for someone else, or you create and share things on digital mediums that aren't reflected in the material world. What you tag physically persists in the real world. Other people see it. You get to see your own work when you walk past it.</li>
<li>Collaboration - Occasionally I see tags on buildings that have small tags in the corner listing all the people that worked on it. Some of these people work together.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the response it's quite enlightening, particularly the part about agency. I guess I was more thinking less about street art (some of which is phenomenal) but more those illegal random bubble words that get tagged everywhere.</p></div>		</li>
