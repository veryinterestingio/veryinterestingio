<p>One additional point, elephants have 3 copies of the P53 tumor suppressor, the most of any animal iirc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They do have the most, but it's 20 copies not 3.</p>
<p>You answered the question mechanically, whereas I sort of interpreted it more holistically. Why did these 2 animals evolve to have such different reproductive pathways and lifetimes?</p>
<p>Why did giraffes get a shorter gestation as you point out?</p>
<p>Did elephants get lucky with a progenitor shitting out P53 replications, living longer lifetimes, and they evolved accordingly?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Once you have passed your genes on, and not just through reproduction but also by caring for kin, then your natural purpose has been fulfilled. It takes elephants a long time to do this</p>

<p>Are you saying that parents pass onto their offspring not only their genes, but also the psychological traits ? And that block of psychological traits is passed on to the follow-up generations, while developing and evolving ? But, essentially, we could talk about a persisting psychological trait that exists through generations ? And maybe even it interacts and competes with the other &quot;psychological traits&quot; ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, I’m saying that genes are so selfish that even if you are a gay uncle who never passes on your own genes but you do a good job at helping your nieces and nephews pass on their genes that it will contribute to the overall “fitness” (genetics term). Similarly, if you possess traits that allow you to be a grandparent and help your grandchildren reproduce then that would likely be beneficial and thus selected for.</p>
<p>Your genes are not just yours, they are your families, so helping out your family to live (and thus reproduce) is similar to reproduction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, psychological traits can be inherited, yeah. Behaviours can be innate, meaning they are not learned, and it is known that mental disorders such as schizophrenia or depression run in families, even in family members separated in birth and raised by different people, even different cultures. I don't know exactly the mechanism, but my best guess is genes that regulate the expression of certain chemicals in the brain, and genes that affect the physical distribution of neural pathways in the brain. </p>
<p>This all makes sense, if you think of it. You share 50% of your genes with mom, dad and your siblings, as much as with any of your children. So say you have some genetic mutations that make you more predisposed to be empathetic with them, feed them when they are hungry, care for them when they are sick. You have 5 kids that carry your genes, and 6 siblings that do too, and with your nurturing behaviour all survive. Your genes have spread far more than your 5 kids, as each of your siblings, that survived thanks to you, have their own kids, who share some of their dna with you. These nurturing genes clearly gave you an advantage. </p>
<p>Another example can be innate fears. Spiders and snakes cause fear. At some point in evolution, the people who had some genetic traits that made them more likely to flee snakes and spiders survived far more than their fearless counterparts, and their genes survived with them. The colour red raises alertness, is the colour we detect the fastest, which, considering red is the colour of blood and ripe fruit and of genitals ready for mating, is no wonder we're so fast to see it. Sucking milk for infants, or not breathing when underwater for aquatic and semiaquatic mammals. </p>
<p>This is not to say that environement does not affect our psyche. My teacher once said: genes give you a range within which you can move, and your experiences move you within that range towards one end or the other.</p></div>		</li>
