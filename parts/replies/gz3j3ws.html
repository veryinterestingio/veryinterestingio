			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes the most sense. Anytime I hear someone way smarter than me talk about life on other planets, they tend to say that x planet doesn't have the same composition as Earth. Therefore, probably not sustainable for life. I've always thought to myself that there could be life outside of what we see as the &quot;norm&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. That's a great point to make and the people whose job it is to search for life are aware of this. So your instincts are correct.</p>
<p>Like others have said though; it makes more sense, for now atleast, to search for finger prints of life <em>as we know it</em>, as we have a massive understanding of what to look for, how life forms, and we have proven data to use to guide that search. We know <em>exactly</em> what to look for, and how to look for it. So we start there. This isnt to say, that we think all life must be carbon based, only that we have to start with what we understand, then work the possibilities from there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There could. But there are good reasons based in basic chemistry for Earth life taking the path it did.</p>
<p>The chemical reactions required for life require a volatile element to take in and repurpose other chemicals (ie. eating). Oxygen is particularly useful for that and particularly common throughout the universe.</p>
<p>So there are decent reasons for believing that chemical-based life will likelier breathe oxygen (or carbon dioxide from which you can derive oxygen) than not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand the volatility of oxygen, versatility of carbon and their abundance would very much likely make for the most common elements of life as we know it. Given that chemistry and physics are the same everywhere.</p>
<p>That being said, in my totally layman speculation, I would be surprised if nearly all sufficiently intelligent forms of life capable of significantly manipulating its environment weren't land-dwelling, bipedal tetrapods shaped more or less like us, and similarly sized.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve always agreed with that. “Aliens could be anything” but not really. They have to conform to physics, chemistry, and evolution. Intelligent life had billions of years before us to develop but it didn’t, it only happened with us bipedal land dwellers and even we barely made it.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly enough, we don't actually know that the laws of chemistry and physics are the same everywhere. Some physics theories rely on the idea that the laws of physics have changed over the lifetime of the universe. </p>
<p>From our knowledge of Chemistry on earth, I think it's hard to imagine life being based on anything other than carbon. Sure, it's possible, but it seems very very unlikely. </p>
<p>Now to completely contradict myself, the universe is so massive that even something very unlikely has a high probability of existing, so there are probably predator style silicon based life forms a few million light years away that we will never know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why not aquatic? Never learning the use of fire might be a significant barrier to technological progress, I guess. I suppose it might depend what you mean by ‘significantly manipulate their environment’. But I see no reason at all that they should necessarily be similarly sized to us. What’s your thought process there?</p></div>		</li>
