<p>Edit:  Realized after posting that this is a very basic explanation.  They also use advanced techniques such as using a <a href="http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/awesome-spider-dangles-rock-web/" target="_blank">rock for a counterweight to hold tension</a> , and <a href="https://youtu.be/-n8nbL2ZBBU" target="_blank">using progressively shorter lines to lift heavy objects</a> .  They're natural engineers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a common house spider (P. tepidariorum) that lived in my master bathroom for a little over a year during her sexual maturity (she passed recently; I miss her). I fed her crickets of the same type I bought for my tarantulas. Watching her move them around her web was incredible. These things were as big or bigger than she was. She would hook a line to the cricket (which she'd already envenomated), selectively cut a line or two to which it was already attached, then run up higher into her web and drag the cricket a little way up toward her. Then she'd turn around and head back down, add another strand or two of web, carefully cut lines that were holding the cricket, drag it up a bit, and repeat until it was positioned where she wanted it in her web.</p>
<p>This type of spider builds &quot;messy&quot; webs (think cobwebs), not the classic orb webs, but they are still marvels of engineering. I will never cease to be awed and amazed by spiders.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They can make sticky and non sticky web. Anchor on one post, let out as much line as needed to climb to the other post, pull in excess line then stick to post. Then if they want a sticky line there, walk across previous line laying sticky. That's how I understand it at least.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only about half of all known spider species build webs. Others are hunters, like the ones on your ceiling. Spiders can go months and months without food, so hanging out in a location where prey bugs naturally head towards (dark corners) usually leads to a meal </p></div>		</li>
