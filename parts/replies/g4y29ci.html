			<div class="markdown"><p>The temperature in a borehole is a product of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_gradient" target="_blank">geothermal gradient</a>. If you have a hypothetical open shaft, heat from the walls would start to heat the air, but this would depend on how moved (or didn't) in the shaft. For the pressure, are you talking about the increase in pressure as a function of depth as if you were moving through the Earth or the pressure of an air filled shaft? The density of rock vs air is very different thus the pressure at depth would be very different.</p></div>		</li>
