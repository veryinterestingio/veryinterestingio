			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting anecdote that I’ll share here, maybe someone can put some science behind it:</p>
<p>Several years ago a family member of mine had something called “transient global amnesia”. He had been going through a stressful period, someone close to him died, and suddenly... poof. He was getting ready for the funeral when he asked his wife, “why is my suit set out on the bed?” Naturally, she initially thought he was joking or something, but quickly realized he was very, very confused. </p>
<p>Something interesting about it was that he could remember basically nothing for a span of about 20 years. He remembered his wife’s name, he remembered their kids’ names, but he remembered the home address from two houses ago, and thought the kids were children, not adults. He had basically no recollection of his current house, what he was doing for work, or anything. </p>
<p>They checked him out at the hospital and found nothing obvious. And his old memories came back to him over the course of a couple days. He’s totally back to normal now, as if it never happened. </p>
<p>Absolutely insane to think this could happen. Few relevant tidbits - he was probably about 70 when it happened, active, still working and fully “with it” mentally. He was doing some stressful work related stuff at the time that the loved one died. He is a Vietnam war vet and has shared very little of that experience (we know he was close to battle but don’t think he had a major combat role, but also all suspect he had some traumatic experiences there). </p>
<p>Any brain nerds out there got any insights?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a couple of mild episodes of this when I was in my fifties.  Had my suit on to go to work and suddenly had no clue why I was dressed like that or where I was going.  My partner took me to the ER. Another time I was sitting at a traffic light and it turned green and I had no idea what I was supposed to do.  Did not know what a green light meant.  I sat the the whole cycle and then realized what I should do.  Strange feelings. Glad it seems to have stopped.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Doubtful any &quot;brain nerds&quot; will have any conclusive insights - no one knows for sure what causes this. The brain is very complicated.  Might be some scientists on the forefront of research who might know something, bit again, nothing is known for <em>certain.</em></p></div>		</li>

<p>An instance of this is struggling and eventually remembering someone's name.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Based on the frequency with which I do this (and the fact that I do remember some other categories of things quickly and effectively), I'm assuming there's a wide range of degrees to which this is experienced.  Can you characterize that continuum?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can’t give you a scientific answer but I experience anomic aphasia specifically for nouns.  It gets better and worse depending on many factors-not enough sleep, a lot of intense concentration or focus, and anaemia.  The last one caused all kinds of mental processing issues but at the time I had no idea what was going on and it was terrifying.  </p>
<p>I started taking supplements and my brain went back to its standard operation.  That’s when I realized that aphasia was a symptom of anaemia for me.</p>
<p>Moral of the story, if you notice your thinking pattern is changing, check it out.  It could be a simple life changing fix.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmmmm... I have bouts of inability to recall nouns. I've never heard of anyone else talking about this and it has always been a low-key worry about the state of my brain. I'll look into seeing whether or not I'm anemic, thank you!</p></div>		</li>
