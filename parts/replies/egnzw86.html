<p>Do you have a source for this? I do spectroscopy and a lot of chlorophyll fluorescence work <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in vivo</em> and I'm not aware of these fluorescent pigments. A quick google search has come up with no results for these additional pigments.</p>
<p><em>In vivo</em> chlorophyll will typically fluoresce at around 683 and 735nm. Much of the 683nm light will be reabsorbed, unlike 735nm, so I can use these two peaks to get an estimate of light penetration by wavelength in to leaf tissue by measuring the adaxial and abaxial sides. They can also give me an idea of how well the photosystem II is working.</p>
<p>Perhaps 1-2% of the light absorbed is readmitted as fluorescence.</p>
<p>edit- bad grammar and here is a paper that looks at photosynthesis from more of a physics perspective including bandgaps and energy costs</p>
