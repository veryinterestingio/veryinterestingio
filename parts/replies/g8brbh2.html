			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice answer ! It is indeed a mix between day length and temperatures. The reason literature seems sparse is because this varies a lot between different species and even different populations/individuals inside a species. It depends a lot of the climate and how the plants are adapted to it. Sometimes frost can happens suddenly and the mean temperature is not a good indicator of it. The plants who are sensitive to it will then use more the days’ length as an indicator that they are in the dangerous period and stop their growth (and shed their leaves). In places where the climate is more temperate and the temperatures drop more progressively, the plants can then rely on the temperature as an indicator. which allow them to adapt their growing period to grow longer the warm years without being at risk the colder years (which they couldn’t do by relying on day length only).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting! More than once, people have posted pictures of trees where one side faces a streetlight, and that side maintains it's greenness/holds on to its leaves longer than the side 'in the dark', so to speak. I wonder if the light is the driver in this scenario, or perhaps the heat from the lights? I don't know how much heat you can get from a streetlight.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Depends on the make of the light, but generally not much, and <em>very</em> not much if the streetlight isn't crappy old technology. Any heat the lamp gives off is wasted energy, so an energy efficient design shouldn't be giving off much heat at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something to keep in mind with this is that it's not necessarily 'fooling' the plant about the season so much as the extra light actually helps a bit and it's worth keeping those leaves just a little bit longer.</p></div>		</li>
