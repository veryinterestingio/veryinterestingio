			<div class="markdown"><p>Snap!  I'd never had hives before.  Then I changed jobs and started working for someone who was the most controlling micro-manager I'd ever met.  The job was not what I'd been promised (think direct opposite!) and I have never been so miserable in all of my working life.  The stress was unbelievable, so you can imagine how I freaked out when hives started popping up everywhere.  I was covered - everywhere except the palms of my hands and the soles of my feet.  Doctor couldn't figure out what was causing them.  I changed jobs and they disappeared and I've never had them since (3 years ago now).  Crappy work situations can be bad for your health!</p></div>		</li>
