			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct.</p>
<p>As an example let's say you run a red light and totally destroy my brand new BMW x5. You also brake my leg. Now my car is going to cost about 70k to replace. My medical costs are going to be about 50k. So in total you will need to pay me 120k. Do you have 120k in your bank account right now? I'm going to guess no. Let's say after holding you upside down and shaking to see what comes out i get 20k. Why should I lose 100k of my money because YOU ran a red light? How is that in any way fair? This is why you must have insurance. In my state you have to have at least 200k in liability coverage. This way your insurance pays me the full 120k and I don't get jiped out of money for something that is your fault.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And this is only part of the story: that broken leg means you can't walk for 6 months, and you have to give up your job as a professional backing dancer, and you have ongoing pain. Now the compensation awarded to you reaches somewhere near $1.3 million and could rise. The costs associated with accidents can go on for years and years. And that's not including the (hypothetical) passengers in the vehicle. </p>
<p>Here in the UK the legal minimum liability cover is £1.2 million for property damage and <em>unlimited</em> for bodily injury or death. I'm surprised that in the States it is so low, when medical costs are astronomically higher. We also have the MIB which may agree to award compensation if you are hit by someone who is uninsured, exactly so that you don't miss out on the compensation owed to you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is frequently not included and must be asked for (and paid for) as an extra rider on insurance plans.

			<div class="markdown"><p>You would be covered for your property damage, i.e. the damage to the vehicle. But you wouldn't get any of the medical costs, or compensation because you as a person are not covered by the policy you have for your own vehicle (there is no liability to yourself). At least, in the UK.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. My brother was in an accident and his full coverage insurance covered it. Then tried to drop him from the insurance plan even though he’d never made a claim, never missed a payment, has a perfectly clean driving record &amp; the accident wasn’t entirely his fault (I think it was deemed 30% his fault).</p></div>		</li>
