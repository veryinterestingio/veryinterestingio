			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone mentioned above, humans need versatility; we may need to build up our legs on a long treck then we'll need big arms as we start building structures and hauling materials.  We gain muscle we're using quickly and lose muscle we aren't just as quickly.</p>
<p>Bears don't have that. Bears are bears.  Since bears only do bear things their muscles just stay bear muscles because it would hurt them if they lost their bear muscles only to have to build them up again.  They don't lose or gain muscle mass like humans, are just bears.  Or something. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;They've evolved this way.&quot; doesn't really answer how bears can hibernate and keep their muscle.</p>
<p>The question is HOW do they keep their muscle mass while hibernating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that would also hold true for more human like animals, like gorillas i assume.
are there other animals who are more alike to humans, or are humans unique in that regard? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would be surprised if humans aren't unique in this regard. We're basically the only animal that has traded muscle mass and digestive track for a ridiculously hungry brain.</p></div>		</li>
