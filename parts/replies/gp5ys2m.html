			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate super thin tires. They just don't have the same grip that 'city bikes' (that's what we call them in Belgium) have and I feel like I'm constantly on the verge of slipping. Plus it sucks if it ever snows or is icy out. And also sucks for mounting curb sides.</p>
<p>Unless it's for racing I really don't see why people would want them and yet they seem really popular over here and I see so many people geared up in bike outfits (that sort of look like wetsuits but with short shorts) all the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I'd certainly never go narrower than a 25mm tyre these days, and would ride my bike with 38mm tyres and mudguards in anything approaching wet or slippery conditions (which tbf is most of the time in the UK).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After reading that a couple of years ago I changed out my 700c 28 for 700c 35 tires (wider tires for those of you unfamiliar with tire sizing) and I literally increased my average speed from 15.5 mph to 16.4 mph. Also made a huge difference in the comfort of the bike, generally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never had a bike with a wide enough fork to do this but I can add to it. My average speed and comfort absolutely increased massively going from a 23c tire on the road to a 28c.</p>
<p>I always buy bikes used and the very first thing I do on all of them is drop $80 on tires and swap them out!</p></div>		</li>
