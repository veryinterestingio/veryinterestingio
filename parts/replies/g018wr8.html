			<div class="markdown"><p>You’d also have to drop the bullet in the same position as the fired one (long axis parallel to the ground) to eliminate any difference in turbulence. Oh, and make sure there is no one down range. That will really ruin the experiment</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re probably right. There is bound to be deformation to the slug that was fired, so they wouldn’t be exactly the same shape anyway. I was just goofing</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You also have to assume you're in a vacuum, otherwise the fluid mechanics of the air also comes into play. For example, bullets tend to spin, and that rotational energy can be converted to translational velocity through interactions with the air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, as soon as the bullet starts to fall the spin will cause the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_effect" target="_blank">magnus effect</a> to start deflecting the bullet. This would eventually generate a very slight upwards force. It would probably be difficult to measure, but it would exist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bullets spin in a totally different axis to what would be needed for the Magnus effect to be relevant.</p>
<p>Or think of it like this: consider symmetries.  What argument could you make for a bullet experiencing an upward force that you couldn't also make for it experiencing a downward force.  Or a left or right force?</p></div>		</li>

I knew your ass was leaving out critical info, science teachers! Why on earth would a kid who's only ever known the world he's grown up in assume you're leaving out a bunch of variables if you don't say so! Of course I'm gonna question it!</p></div>		</li>
