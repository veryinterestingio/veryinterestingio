			<div class="markdown"><p>You are completely right but I think you are failing to explain to OP. Because he considers the chair and body as a black box, why does the black box is turning ? Usually when something move there is a force made on the outside. This is what puzzle OP.</p>
<p>And in this case the response is:</p>
<p>The ensemble (chair + body)... is simply not moving. Because there is no force against the outside.</p>
<p>Explanation: The chair and you lower body are turning but your upper body is turning in the opposing direction, so if you add those 2 movement, the whole is not moving.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Using static friction (friction that you only get when the object is not moving) you can actually turn indefinitely one direction alternating slow movement and rapid ones, but it's slow and take some dedication.</p></div>		</li>
