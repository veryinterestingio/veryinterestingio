			<div class="markdown"><p>But surely there are still appraisals and inspections right? I might cash buy a home in Vegas this year and I would still want to do those steps.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but the inspection would have to fail greatly (not just need a new fire detector or fix a fence post) to get you out of the contract. Finance conditions are easy to break the contract. </p>
<p>If you are the buyer you could announce yourself as a cash buyer (like you said, sellers love that) but put a clause in &quot;subject to partner approval&quot; then ask ur dog or something if they like the house haha.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not necessarily true. I just bought a house for cash, and after the inspection we asked for a lower price based on a few things that needed fixing. They were not major. But if the seller hadn’t been willing to come down, we would have been able to walk away and still get our earnest money back. </p>
<p>From my understanding it’s more about the bank, not the buyer. Banks have certain requirements of a home before they are willing to approve the loan, and the seller may not want to fix those things. Example, in OR, all windows and doors must have molding around the exterior. Usually the bank will require the issue to be fixed before the sale, while a cash buyer may be willing to take money off the price to fix it themselves. So it’s not just the buyer that has to be okay with the inspection, but the bank as well.</p>
<p>Without the bank, escrow can also be a lot shorter. We closed in about 3 weeks, which is what enticed the seller to go with our cash offer as opposed to a higher offer contingent on a loan.</p>
<p>Edit: I should have said lender instead of bank, sorry about that!</p>
<p>And appraisal contingencies are also a factor. This can be hard especially in the current market because homes are scarce and going for much more than their appraised value.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not true. Inspections do not come with a pass or fail grade. If a buyer puts in an offer contingent on an inspection, they can simply say they do not want to continue pursuing the house after they go through the inspection, and they don’t even have to give a reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can still do those things, but you make the decision and not the bank. Cash buyers are more matter if fact about the stuff and can get what they want even if there are problems. Probably buying it to fix up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually. Depends on the contract. A lot of cash offers waive appraisal, but not inspection</p></div>		</li>
