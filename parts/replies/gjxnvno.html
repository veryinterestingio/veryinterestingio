<p>For stability reasons you need the weight of a craft in the front of the drag.</p>

<p>Yeah, the old saying goes like this: &quot;A nose-heavy plane flies poorly. A tail-heavy plane flies once.&quot; There have been aircraft deliberately designed to be tail-heavy, in order to improve manoeuvrability, but they use computer control to keep them stable in regular flight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even with the computer control to prevent your fighter jet from turning back to front at every oppertunity a tail heavy design does come at the cost of speed and fuel efficiency. You can have the manouverability of an F-16 or the speed of an F-101 but not both.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can’t really find any resources which argue that static margins heavily affect aerodynamic efficiency. Aerodynamic efficiency is usually measured by the L/D ratio, and that’s not a quantity that’s heavily affected by static margin.</p>
<p>I would argue the opposite is true: an aircraft which is nose heavy, i.e., with a negative static margin, is less efficient in level flight than one whose static margin is closer to zero. This is because the trim drag is increased on an aircraft which needs the tail to compensate more for the amount of pitch down on aircraft where the CG is further forward of the neutral point.</p>
<p>Though this isn’t taking in to account propulsion efficiency. A pusher might be more efficient than a tractor config if it’s a prop, rather than a jet, offsetting the penalties from trim drag. For a jet, I can’t really see a gain, since jet aircraft are basically all pushers, especially fighters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where did you get this idea?</p>
<p>Stability and aero performance are at odds, meaning stability relaxation leads to performance gains, like greater speed, efficiency, and range.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Naval architect here. I can elaborate on the ship part.</p>
<p>Drag on the hull is roughly proportional to the square of velocity. If you place a propeller at the front, the hull is moving in the “wake” of the propeller where the apparent velocity of the water is greater than the forward velocity of the ship. This leads to a huge wastage of energy.</p>
<p>I am assuming, since planes need to generate lift unlike a ship(where reducing drag is the only concern), they benefit from the increase in the wind flow rate across the wings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That benefit you mentioned is most pronounced at low speeds.</p>
<p>The issue with props behind wing is prop getting fed with turbulent air reducing its efficiency. And props getting a chance to get hit by debris if something falls of the plane, then get imbalanced and shake themselves apart.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Skin drag is and other laminar flow phenomena are dwarfed by lift induced drag and turbulent drag that is omnipresent with aircraft.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing that hasn't been mentioned yet, is that you can put larger propeller to the front of the plane. During take off, the front is elevated and the rear goes down and large rear-mounted propeller could easily hit the runway. Larger propeller is more efficient. Propeller in the rear would need to be smaller or mounted higher up which causes its own problems.</p></div>		</li>
