			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder what the point of a problem like that is. What could be the net benefit of solving that problem? Why should anyone care?  </p>
<p>Edit: As i feared, the implications of this kind of math are difficult to completely understand if you're not a higher math person. It's a little frustrating, but unfortunately, I'm not entitled to be not frustrated. It feels like when i try to have conversations with people that don't understand basic economics. It becomes pointless to have the conversation, because it's like a  platform with no steps to it. Sometimes there are no avenues to get there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometime stuff are their own reason ðŸ˜› why do people paint? Or just do crossword? In that example that would be what is called Recreational Mathematic (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_mathematics" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_mathematics</a>) math made for the fun of solving problem like you can have doing crossword or solving a riddle.</p>
<p>But some other problem can be more practical : like &quot;is there a way to pack a number of shape inside another shape&quot; used for packaging. Usually those very abstract math problem solution will be reused by physicist or biologist or other more &quot;practical&quot; field cause the question will be a part of some of their question (like cell reproduce at a certain rate and that rate is similar to a problem solve by mathematician so you can use the formula to model how your cell grow etc..)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One important kind of problem is one where it's easy to check that an answer is correct, but very difficult to find the answer if you don't know it.  For example, finding which two prime numbers you multiplied together to get a particular number.</p>
<p>Can you tell me what numbers you multiply together to get 456949880399?</p>
<p>Answer: &gt;!533747 and 856117!&lt;</p>
<p>Similar problems are the basis of encryption that keeps your internet traffic safe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of math as a language we created to define observations of the rules of the physical world. The more rules we can define the more tools we have to apply to new applications/technologies and to the understanding of more rules that were obfuscated by our ignorance of previous rules.</p></div>		</li>
