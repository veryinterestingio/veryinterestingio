			<div class="markdown"><p>Everyone does it after they've been driving for a few years. This is also why you want to give lots of time between when you begin signaling and then actually maneuvering.
If you do it too quickly, people tend to overreact in response to rapid movement. If it you do it nice and slow, people literally won't even notice, they'll just maneuver to allow you the space you need automatically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Mirror, signal, manoeuvre.&quot;</p>
<p>Braking <strong>is part of the manoeuvre</strong> so you should be signalling <em>before</em> you brake.</p>
<p>It lets other drivers know that you are about to brake, so they are prepared for it.  Turning on your indicator when you are already half way around the corner or already moved into the other lane is useless.</p>
<p>But I rant...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's that autopilot that makes me think of that dad a while ago who normally didn't drop his baby off at daycare and needed to one day, but he drove to work and walked in just like any other day. The baby didnt make it. Stories like this are everywhere, but this was a long time ago before people were sort of bombarded with media and tragedy and the story just really stuck with me. I have 2 kids, and when I drive my whole 40 minute ride home without really remembering, I think of that guy and it freaks me out a little.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's amazing.  One of the craziest activities I've felt that myself was during job of a skydiving cameraman. The day can go like 10+ jumps with instructor and tandem passenger and each jump has similiar scenario. There is additional time of packing the parachute and waiting in the plane to get to altitude. Some days can get tense and tiring. Anyways I'm still paying attention to important parts, but when everything goes smooth I may not remember exactly how many jumps I've done today, what happenned in each jump, how was my exit 3 jumps before? It becomes muscle memory, following the pattern, trying to relax when I can afford to. This happens while jumping out of the plane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why the checks are so thorough and about someone else. I bet you are conscious of the check you do on someone else's parachute every time</p>
<p>Edit: you would not be so conscious if the check was on yourself is my point</p></div>		</li>
