			<div class="markdown"><p>One other aspect to think about is the hardware too. These computers on the Apollo lander had to survive a violent launch sequence as well as the rigors and challenges of space travel and be 100% reliable. They were purpose built, so what they lacked in terms of processing power compared to today, they made up for in being very good at their jobs (which are relatively simple by today's metrics, but were state of the art for 50 years ago).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh definitely. It was one of the primary concerns. Space vacuum offers zero protection and the Sun is pouring out some very nasty and powerful stuff. Consider the fact that on Earth we live on the bottom of a miles-deep ocean of atmosphere made up of all kinds of protective layers, and it's still possible to get damaged by Sun exposure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>“For a medical device to be successful, it must be able to gather sensitive data in real time and meet all of the necessary safety-critical requirements and certifications. This is no small task.</p>
<p>Having an RTOS and Android work together can alleviate much of the pain. As stated earlier, the RTOS must support all of the same connectivity options as Android. This is a critical requirement for the RTOS. If the connectivity is not already built into the RTOS, it is incumbent upon the developer to make sure it can be added easily when the time comes. It’s important to realize that the RTOS not only needs to gather the data quickly, but also support Android in whatever communication/connectivity protocols Android is using.”</p>
<p>That article isn’t about a single operating system with an AOSP runtime on top. It’s about running the critical parts with RTOS, and communicate it back to an android front end. </p>
<p>Android itself is based on the Linux Kernel, which isn’t real-time. The Dalvik VM that runs Java bytecode. Add the google services on top, then you’d get android. Without it, it’s AOSP. </p>
<p>So even if someone successfully swaps out Linux with an RTOS kernel, have it fully compatible with Linux syscalls, and put Dalvik VM on top, you still need to make sure your application isn’t in Java, because Java’s garbage collection will kick in, generally in a way that the application can not control, and it would be like getting mini-beach-balls-of-death until it is done. </p>
<p>You’d have to write in some kind of low level language, most likely C.</p></div>		</li>

Although you may run out of memory much sooner if you're doing something ill-suited to Java.  I don't think Android supports new enough versions of Java for that though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A real-time operating system is one that is completely deterministic with respect to how long a given operation/computation will take to perform.  </p>
<p>Edit:  correction (see below) A real time operating system is one that gives guarantees about the maximum amount of time something will take.</p>
<p>Modern operating systems are meant to give the user control over many different apps in parallel.  I can have google chrome open along with VLC and other applications all running together.  When those applications request some memory or make or let the operating system know that they would like to interact with the hardware, there are delays associated with that that make it difficult to say with 100% certainty how long something will take.</p>
<p>The operating system is in control of the hardware, and the user space applications are simply requesting time on them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is incorrect, real time operating systems are not deterministic. They only guarantee that an operation will not take more than a specified amount of time.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's been a while since I was a comp sci student, so take this explanation with a grain of salt.</p>
<hr />
<p>An iPhone is built to perform many different tasks at once.  None of these tasks are particularly important.  It's okay if a task crashes and it's okay if a task takes a little longer or shorter than expected.  It's also okay if task 1 and task 2 usually get executed in order 1 then 2, but instead get executed in order 2 then 1.  </p>
<p>Because none of the tasks (i'll call them programs from now on) are super-important, and because none of them need to be computed <em>right now or else the phone will explode</em>, the iPhone is somewhat relaxed about which programs it will make the CPU work on now and which programs it will make the CPU work on a few milliseconds later.  </p>
<p>To illustrate this, let's suppose you're currently streaming the opening sequence of <em>All Star</em> by smashmouth over spotify.  You're playing the music on your bluetooth headphones.  You've also just tried to open your email client, and that for some reason your iPhone has only a single CPU core.  There are three tasks your iPhone needs to handle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contact the spotify music servers to request the chorus of <em>All Star</em> by smashmouth, and save the server's response to the iPhone's RAM so the music's there before the chorus needs to be played.  Do this within the next 30 seconds.  This task will take 2 seconds.</li>
<li>Broadcast the first verse of <em>All Star</em> over the bluetooth transmitter.  It's already in the iPhone's RAM and just needs to be sent to the bluetooth headphones before the headphones finish playing the opening instrumental and get to the first verse.  Do this within the next 5 seconds.  This task will take 0.5 seconds.</li>
<li>Load the code for your email client.  Do this within the next 5 seconds.  This task will take 0.3 seconds.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're 5 seconds away from the first verse of <em>All Star</em> it actually doesn't matter which program the CPU works on first.  No matter which task the CPU starts with, it can complete all five within each task's deadline.  The CPU decides which program to work on first by running a special program called the Operating System - specifically, it's Task Scheduler.  The iPhone's Task Scheduling program knows that it doesn't matter which task gets worked on first, so it can be somewhat haphazard about which task goes first.  The Task Scheduler makes no guarantees that any program will be performed within a certain amount of time; it just knows that no matter what you'll get your emails and you'll get your chorus.  Because the Task Scheduling branch of the Operating System doesn't make these guarantees, it's considered to be non-realtime.</p>
<p>For interest - it's a bit of a simplification but one strategy a Task Scheduler uses is to schedule the shortest program first and the longest program last.  </p>
<hr />
<p>The Apollo computer is operating under a different set of constraints and thus works a little differently.  It's not juggling several different, unimportant tasks.  No - the Apollo computer is juggling one or two <em>very important tasks</em>.  Each of these programs - like turning on / off engines or turning on / off fuel pumps - absolutely must be performed at specific times, and because of this, the Apollo computer needs to be able to guarantee that the programs will be performed at exactly those specific times.  Unlike the iPhone, if a program crashes, takes longer or shorter than normal to complete, or is executed out-of-order, it's an absolute <em>disaster.</em></p>
<p>I'm not even sure if the Apollo computer had an operating system or task scheduler, but if did, it would look a little different than an iPhone's task scheduler.  It would be much less laid-back about the timing of programs.  If the Apollo computer had three tasks coming up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ignite the Main Engine Ignition Sequence by placing a voltage over a spark plug in the engine (this isn't how rockets work btw).  Do this at mission time: 0.11 seconds.</li>
<li>Start the Main Engine Fuel Pump.  Do this at mission time: 0.13 seconds.</li>
<li>Check the external airspeed sensors and position the control flaps of the Rocket to counteract any wind.  Do this at mission time: 0.15 seconds</li>
</ul>
<p>And if each task takes 0.02 seconds, it <em>absolutely matters</em> which task happens first.  If the computer's task scheduling system makes the CPU work on those tasks out of order, the Rocket won't go to space today.  The Apollo computer is built in such a way that it can guarantee that tasks will be completed by the time they're due, and because of that, we consider it to be a realtime operating system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An ELI5 explanation would be that in a real time system you as a programmer decide where to concentrate the processing time, while an iPhone, Android, Windows, Linux etc are operating systems that are desined to do it automatically, often by doing some average to make sure everything runs as smootly as possible for the user.</p>
<p>In real time a programmer writes code that (almost) directly triggers hardware changes, while in non realtime there is a middleware of software (operating system).</p>
<p>Edit: the almost part that I'd like to explain. 99.9% of people dont actually write 10011101 code, which is the only language the computer understands. The 100111010 code is being broken down to type of action to perform (add, substract, move from one place in memory to another etc), the memory cells where the values are, and the final memory cell where the final value will be. But people dont do this direct binary code since it's hard to read, and will cause a lot of mistakes.</p>
<p>So people use commands and a piece of software to translate them directly to this binary code. Also you have line numbers. The commands look like:</p>
<p>10: MOV R1 R3</p>
<p>20: ADD R1 R2 R3</p>
<p>30: BLZ R3 10</p>
<p>This is some fictional code, on some fictional interpreter that moves the number from R3 cell to R1, sums what's in R1 with what's in R2 and puts it in R3, and loops to line 10 (the command is branch if lower than 0) while R3 is negative.</p>
<p>So for each command and each memory cell there is a fixed binary reresentation.</p></div>		</li>
