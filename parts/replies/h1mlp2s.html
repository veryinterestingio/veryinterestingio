			<div class="markdown"><p>I never understood why people do this.  Does conspicuous consumption actually get people laid?  Does it make them feel important or something?  I've met some actually wealthy people and none of them were ostentatious about it.</p>
<p>Surely flashing around a designer bag or something which screams &quot;I make poor financial decisions, I could have invested this much money and didn't&quot; would only have positive status value if you're surrounded by people even dumber than that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some people spend $10,000 a year on hobbies. Some might use that money towards a designer piece. Some might wear designer every day and have less items than you. You may not see the value in it, but there is a market and interest behind it. From its artistic value, to how it can be an investment piece. Its no different from people buying 384 bags bags of chips a year to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I bought a $500 pair of Kobe 6 Protro Grinches a few weeks ago </p>
<p>I'm a diehard Kobe fan, grew up loving him. Bought his kicks anytime I could growing up, played a ton of sports so I had the Kobe V - Kobe IX before I stopped really fkin with basketball shoes like that but unfortunately wore them pretty hard and didn't take amazing care of them</p>
<p>I have a signed Kobe jersey from when I met him, went to a home game during his farewell season with my pops, and I plan to buy more Kobe's even if they're even more expensive than the grinches</p>
<p>It's a sentimental thing for me</p>
<p>I love the way the shoes look but I won't even wear them that much</p>
<p>It's just having his gear, the gear I grew up loving and watching my athletic idol play in .. idk how to describe it man it's like it makes me feel better about everything that happened to him and about being robbed of getting to see his HoF speech..</p>
<p>It's really hard to articulate but idk man it makes me feel better and helps with coping with the whole thing cuz even though I didn't know him personally, my family knew some of his family, but it's just a tragic thing idk man when you grow up watching Kobe the way I watched Kobe, probably the way some of the you get generation watched LeBron these last 10 years, the person becomes this pillar of greatness in your life. </p>
<p>The way he passed, with his daughter, so tragically and horrendously, and so early in his life... We probably, and I pray this is true, will never see another sports superstar as big as Kobe die like that so it actually shook me to my core </p>
<p>I still cry when I think about it, no joke.</p>
<p>So, I can't really answer your question about what buying Louis Vuitton or Tiffany does for others but as for what I spend my money on, I try to make it worth it ya know?</p>
<p>And as for what others spend their money on, as long as it's not hurting anyone and it makes you happy, I say go for it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, that makes sense.  But you're doing that for you, because it's meaningful and sentimental to you.  Presumably not to impress other people.  Like, I get why an autograph or a collector's item would be worth a lot of money to the right person.</p>
<p>That's different to buying Gucci because it's Gucci or spending thousands on a bottle of booze that's really no different than something which costs ten Euro at the supermarket.</p></div>		</li>
