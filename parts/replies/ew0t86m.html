			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm it must be too much bedding since I recently had bloodwork done. I like to keep it cold (70-ish) with my fan on, and I’ll start out with a sheet, a light quilt and a fuzzy blanket all cocooned up and then when I wake up I’ll kick the fuzzy blanket off and I’m usually fine afterwards. It’s just getting to sleep with those layers feels necessary at first, but then kicking the blanket feels better when I wake up hot .-.</p></div>		</li>
