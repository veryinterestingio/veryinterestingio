			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>I had to look up some of those physical indicators that we can see today, like fault offset and sediment slump (the first should have been obvious to me).  </p>
<p>Have there been tsunamis caused by any of the larger coastal California earthquakes?  I lived in San Diego when the 7.2 Easter earthquake hit Baja California, and I know they were concerned that might cause a tsunami, but it didn't.  I don't remember hearing about a tsunami after the Northridge quake in 1994, or the World Series quake in 1989, which are the other two large California earthquakes that have occurred in my life (most of which has been in California) and hit coastal areas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tsunamis are generally caused by plates that are pushing towards each other (reverse faults) and then slipping upwards or downwards (like suddenly pulling your hand down from the surface of the water whilst in a pool or bathtub) whereas California's fault line is moving north and south (strike slip fault) making the likelihood of a tsunami much lower</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to/clarify this, in order for a tsunami to occur something must displace water. For an earthquake, that is usually deformation of the ocean floor by surface rupture, so for an earthquake to generate a tsunami, the earthquake needs to generate vertical displacement of the surface (i.e. one side of the fault moves up relative to the other) and be underwater. Both the Northridge and Loma Prieta (the world series earthquake) had significant components of vertical displacement (Northridge was on a blind thrust fault and Loma Prieta was an oblique rupture of a predominantly strike-slip fault), but they were both onshore, so no tsunami was generated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This doesn't specifically address your question about California, but I found this very interesting. There was an earthquake off the coast of Oregon around 1700 that caused a tsunami to reach all the way to Japan. There weren't any written records from North America during that time, but Japan did.

			<div class="markdown"><p>California is not my forte for this (nor is this my direct field of expertise), so can't really say much more than my initial post. Some lakes in the Rockies might record quakes through sediment slumps/deposits. I think the geometry of the tectonic setting and the california coast doesn't favor tsunami's, with most quakes being land based</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>to add since it's a logarithmic scale for earthquakes, the +- range of uncertainty is way lower than it would be if we were talking about linear scales, like time.</p></div>		</li>
