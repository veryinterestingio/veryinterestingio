			<div class="markdown"><p>There are certain birds which can learn to copy sounds from their environment ('true mimic' birds), but these aren't the types of birds that we study, so we can't give you a specific answer as to why or how they mimic sounds. In general, bird song exists to impress females and some species are particularly impressed by large sound repertoires. It's possible that these birds learn any random sounds from their environment just to expand their sound repertoire and impress females. Check out videos of lyre birds for other fun examples of this kind of thing!</p></div>		</li>
