			<div class="markdown"><p>I got a job as a supervisor in a cafe when I was young, and the manager explained to me that you should do this on purpose to remind those under you that you’re in charge. I refused. She would do it to me sometimes too. She would tell me to do shit I was obviously in the middle of doing, like wiping a specific counter, or sweeping an area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the last shit job that I had, which is now over 5 years ago fortunately, I had a manager (and the directors) who were this demotivating, or to put it another way, they motivated me to be demotivated.</p>
<p>During that job, I mastered how to do an hour of work in a day and a day of work in a week.</p>
<p>This is the problem  when they are always looking for ways to cut costs, and looking for any excuse to not bring you in for a week. I worked there for 2 years, and I was only once asked not to come in for a week; I realised I was working too hard. Two can play at that game.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have this happen to me. I always respond rudely, and/or give stupid looks. It’s one of the few things I do automatically and can’t seem to stop. Never once have I took it as “oh this person is powerful, I must obey” but instead question how they survive getting dressed in the morning without some giant dose of natural selection ending them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>“Good lookin’ out”</p>
<p>Is the simplest most beneficial phrase in a workplace. Its not negative at all, but its not some grandiose praise. It just lets the person know “i see you’re doing the things you’re supposed to do and appreciate it.”</p>
<p>Best phrase to discover as a supervisor/manager.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's about control. People want to feel in control as much as possible. </p>
<p>When you set out to do a task, you are in control. Then someone tells you do this task, you lose control. The whole decision making process that lead to you doing the task is disregarded and now you are doing the task only because someone else told you do it. You feel like you lost control and the only way to regain it back is to make a new decision on your own. Refuse to do it, do it differently then the person told you do it, mess up on purpose etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also it gives them ammunition for &quot;You wouldn't have done it if I didn't ask&quot;. So in future they'll ask you even more frequently. But the other times, when you don't do it... &quot;See, I knew you wouldn't do it if I didn't remind you&quot;</p></div>		</li>
