			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Beach erosion is a pretty big problem in Ocean City, MD, but most people don't really understand that Ocean City was built on a barrier island, which naturally erodes over time. Cycles of storms and ocean currents throughout the seasons move sediment down shore, and as it erodes over the course of decades and centuries, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Conceptual-model-of-transgressive-barrier-island-evolution-As-the-barrier-island-moves_fig1_318171138" target="_blank">a barrier island literally moves closer to shore.</a></p>
<p>They've spent millions trying to rebuild the shore line with dredging, but it's all been washed away now. They're going to need to keep doing it if they want to keep buildings from being washed away soon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry, but this is wrong. It has nothing to do with rock type, and has everything to do with plate tectonics and age. </p>
<p>The west coast has dramatic features because the tectonic plate boundary along the west coast forms a subduction zone, causing uplift and, among other things (like earthquakes), volcanic activity (see: the ring of fire).</p>
<p>The west coast is geologically young compared to the east coast. Lack of uplift creating new features, various forms of erosion (such as glacial ice sheets), have all led to the current state of the land on the east. Material has been redeposited and everything smoothed out, so to speak.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't the fact that the west coast runs along a tectonic plate boundary while the east coast doesn't play a role as well? The closest tectonic plate boundary to the east coast runs along the middle of the Atlantic, right?</p></div>		</li>
