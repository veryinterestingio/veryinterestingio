<p>Like in the case of V-1 rockets, or other projectiles I thought a long cord would be used to make modifications to it's trajectory for a short distance until it was disengaged from human input / control.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This article indicates that the F-16 was designed to be easily modified to use manual controls if they had problems getting the fly-by-wire systems to work.  So the existing F-16 is probably not <em>so</em> unstable that you couldn't fly one manually:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.f-16.net/articles_article13.html" target="_blank">https://www.f-16.net/articles_article13.html</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>But while Hillaker and his team couldn’t do much initially to overcome the “bigger is better” contingent of the Air Force, they left themselves an out with the most unique of the F-16’s high-tech features. They designed the plane so it could be fitted with conventional hydro-mechanical controls if the fly-by-wire system couldn’t be made to work acceptably. “We spaced the bulkheads so that we could move the wing back and have a statically-stable airplane,” says Hillaker. “We were just giving ourselves some insurance. The wing would have had to have been moved back eighteen inches. All we had to do was make the two bulkheads have the same load capacity. One of them that we would’ve moved the wing to was higher than it needed to be, unless you moved the wing back.”</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>F16 is still pretty old school. It came out within a year or two of the F-15, and people have landed the F-15 even after it <a href="https://theaviationist.com/2014/09/15/f-15-lands-with-one-wing/" target="_blank">lost an entire wing.</a></p>
<p>Both planes came out in the early 1970s, actually so did the A10. Kind of amazing how planes from nearly 40 years ago are still the gold standard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But not all aircraft have computer controlled fly-by-wire, or even hydraulics.</p>
<p>Lots of vintage aircraft and ultralights have physical cables and other direct linkages going to control surfaces.  Which is nice because they continue to operate with no power of any sort, or hydraulic pressure.  Of course this doesn't make them immune to all problems, physical cables have their own reliability problems.</p>
<p>However, even with unpowered direct linkages, if it comes down to overpowering the hand and foot controls with a feat of great physical strength, something is horribly wrong.  I don't know of designs where even in a stall or other out-of-envelope conditions the controls would need incredible force to move into the desired position.</p>
<p>The film fiction seems to even come from a feel of driving a car before power steering.  I mean, once power steering came about, unless we're specifically dealing with the loss of power steering, you might be fighting the wheels in spirit to regain direction control, but you generally don't need a feat of strength to get the steering wheel where you want it.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>AFAIK the only physical condition that would require a lot of force on the controls is high speed maneuvers, like pulling up out of a dive.</p>
<p>Higher speeds put more force on the control surfaces. In a stall it would likely be very easy to move the control surfaces.</p>
<p>That said, large commercial aircraft are all going to be hydraulics/fly by wire systems, so the only force on the joystick is going to be intentional force feedback designed to make the stick feel 'alive' and wouldn't be tuned to a level that can't be easily overridden by the pilots strength, or even at a level that would fatigue the pilot from fighting for long periods of time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And pulling up out of a dive is pretty much exactly where you see it in movies. So even if it's not accurate for modern fly-by-wire planes, it seems true for those dramatic scenes in older planes, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Autopilots can do some pretty dumb shit with the trim if you’re not paying attention, and when they give up because they ran out of trim to apply you’re going to have to put way more physical work into the controls than you were expecting.  This gets dangerous fast when the reason the autopilot quit is because it ran out of trim trying to keep the airplane level while icing is occurring.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I could see pilots fighting with their control surfaces in older aircraft. I'm thinking specifically of the P-38 Lightning, with it's famous dive compressibility issues. If an aircraft with manual control is traveling so fast that the pressure and forces of the air over the control surfaces become difficult to manage, fighting the controls will become a thing.</p></div>		</li>
