			<div class="markdown"><p>Calculable differences, yes, but <em>measurable</em>, not so much. Jupiter, being teh second most massive object in the solar system, is too far and not massive enough to have a measurable effect at its distance.  </p>
<p>That said, <em>any</em> object of any mass will have a <em>calculable</em> effect on us, gravitationally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Calculate (mass)/(distance to Earth)^3 for different objects and you'll see that the Moon wins, the Sun is a close second with about half the effect size, and everything else is orders of magnitude weaker. The effect of Venus is less than 0.01% the effect of the Moon even at its closest approach, Mars has a lower mass and doesn't come closer, and Jupiter is of the order of 0.001%.</p></div>		</li>
