			<div class="markdown"><p>Omg i had no idea, I always wondered how people didn't flinch even though you see a massive amount of sparks around the person's hands! Like I get scared to stand too close cause of the sparks (in my defence, the sparks flying off a campfire do hurt lol) Is there a point where there's so many sparks it does hurt sometimes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The quantity doesn't really change the sensation. But Sparks coming off of say, a welder or an oxyacetylene torch are a lot bigger sometimes. Those can be a lot less fun.</p></div>		</li>
