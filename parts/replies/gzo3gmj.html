			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn’t this nearly always the case? We have two sexes and billions of each sex. I struggle to think of any binary situation that would be the other way around. </p>
<p>Imo this just seems to be a statistics thing</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s the statistical expression of the fact that humans aren’t very sexually dimorphic in the measured variable. There are some variables where the dimorphism is more pronounced. I believe forward cranking power (of the arm) is a good example of an instance where humans are actually pretty dimorphic (there is some but not much overlap of the bell curves).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This wording is perfect. I had always assumed that humans weren’t particularly dimorphic, at least on the psychological side. Probably just failed to see the valu of the research since it was confirming an assumption I had.</p>
<p>In hindsight my response was lacking for a few reasons haha. I’m going to leave it up since there’s no reason to hide from the mistake.</p>
<p>Your response is perfect though, thanks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily, no. If it was just statistics what would be the explanation for data driven trends in personality characteristics of the sexes? This is some of the more significant findings in the social sciences. The degree of overlap and difference at the extremes also differs with each trait. Men and women aren’t significantly different in traits like conscientiousness or industriousness. They can be very different in traits like neuroticism and agreeableness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t think I worded it well. With such a large population of each sex, would there always be MASSIVE differences between samples of each sex? So the least neurotic male and the most neurotic male would always be a bigger range than the average between the groups.</p>
<p>I just think the outliers will always be very significant and since averages are being used between the two groups, it will be fairly tame.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The average man is considerable larger then the average women.</p>
<p>The palest person in 1000 could be a man or a women.</p>
<p>So i dont think what op said is true all the time.  Its only true of some traits.</p></div>		</li>
