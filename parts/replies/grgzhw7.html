			<div class="markdown"><p>I think adaptive therapy is the most promising development. (See my response to toropoko up above.) I think we can largely cure cancer if we switch from a mindset that 'cure' is eradication and instead focus on cure via control. In other words, if we can keep a tumor under control indefinitely, and the person is able to live our their normal lifespan while harboring a under-control tumor, we should consider that a win. We won't eradicate cancer, but we can learn how to live with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adaptive therapy is a great idea for incurable tumors. </p>
<p>Targeted and immunotherapy are more promising in that they offer “cure” for some cancer types, have vastly revolutionized our idea of killing all rapidly dividing cells (and hoping that’s mostly cancer cells) into actually killing mostly cancer cells, allow us to arm our own immune system for this task, potentially avoid more toxic options (eg transplant), and can be used as part of an adaptive therapy, if that proves to be promising in more than a few cancer types.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree that immunotherapy is also very promising. Often times cancer cells evolve to evade the immune system and the body's natural cellular cheater detection systems. Many immunotherapies essentially help reinstate the body's systems for detecting and suppressing cellular cheating. Unfortunately, though, the evolution of resistance is still a problem for immunotherapies.</p></div>		</li>
