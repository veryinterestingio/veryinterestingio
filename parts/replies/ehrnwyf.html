			<div class="markdown"><p>Ionization of the atmosphere also affects its ability to reflect radio waves. Around that time we used a lot of HF to relay communications, and ionization causes HF to just go right through the atmosphere instead of bounce around between sky and ocean. The studies were able to give better time frames for how long the &quot;blackout&quot; would last.</p>
<p>EDIT&gt; Found a decent coverage of all of this that's not classified:  Page 47 2.60 <a href="http://www.dtra.mil/Portals/61/Documents/NTPR/4-Rad_Exp_Rpts/36_The_Effects_of_Nuclear_Weapons.pdf" target="_blank">The Effects of Nuclear Weapons</a>.  The high-altitude burst section starts pg. 45 and covers most of the questions in a fairly basic sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere" target="_blank">ionosphere</a> is the ionized layer of the atmosphere that bounces HF back to Earth. Sunspots cause increased ionization. The peak of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle" target="_blank">sunspot cycle</a> is when HF works best.</p>

<p>This particularly interests me, one of those things I've never dug into but always had a passing interest in was how we know about things like Holes in the Ozone Layer.  </p>
<p>I always assumed a high-altitude balloon was sent up to measure ozone. but if you can do it from the ground with HF radio waves, that seems a lot more practical and easily repeated over time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Different molecules absorb and reflect light differently at different wavelengths, so just shining a lamp that outputs every wavelength and analyzing what you get back will tell you what you're looking at. Since ozone (O3) is different from regular molecular oxygen (O2), you can measure it that way.</p>
<p>Aside from being able to measure ozone concentrations in the upper atmosphere from the ground, this also lets us measure things like air pollution in real time without having to collect samples. It also works for solids and liquids, but then you don't get that kind of range.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The most long-range form of the high-altitude EMP (the late E3 phase), which is what most people worry about, has a duration of &quot;tens of seconds&quot; (whereas the other forms of pulse, the early E1 and intermediate E2, are typically on the order of milliseconds). So it's a lot slower, which apparently affects shielding issues.</p>
<p>As for recovery, it depends on the device and the damage. If it's a fried circuit, it's not going to recover on its own. One of the difficulties of making concrete conclusions about EMP effects is that the real world is full of a <em>lot</em> of different kinds of electronics and their responses are going to be somewhat unpredictable. This is one of the reason that EMP risk is hard to assess — it's not just &quot;what will happen when the nuke goes off&quot; (which is hard-enough to model well), it's &quot;what will it do&quot; which depends on a <em>lot</em> of modelling, assumptions, etc. People who are &quot;pessimists&quot; here assume it'd kill everything electronic; people who are &quot;optimists&quot; think it'd more idiosyncratic and less dramatic (which is what it was like with Starfish Prime — a few streetlights were blown out, but it wasn't chaos). Our world has a very different electronic &quot;footprint&quot; than did the world of the 1960s, though, which complicates things (integrated circuits, for example, are everywhere now).</p>
<p>For people wanting to wade into the deep technical aspects of EMP, without the hyperbole, the Metatech <a href="http://www.futurescience.com/emp/ferc_Meta-R-320.pdf" target="_blank">R-320</a> and <a href="http://www.futurescience.com/emp/ferc_Meta-R-321.pdf" target="_blank">R-321</a> reports are good, but <em>very</em> dense. They constitute the most technically-savvy unclassified modeling of EMP that I have seen. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suggest looking up the EMP commission. They've been looking at the potential effects of EMPs since at least 2001.</p>
<p>Also if. You are into good novels I'll plug reading &quot;1 second after&quot;</p>
<p>It follows a former military person in the wake of an EMP attack on the US. And was recommended by congress that everyone should read it. Good book, hope I never see it happen </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not too long ago I thought about this and I had the feeling that such electric field pulses shouldn't do much to modern ICs because the electronic components are on such a small scale that there isn't a big enough potential difference across them caused by the field.</p>
<p>The big risk to me seems to be a large metallic object, antenna, accumulating a big potential difference which is then routed through an IC. But most ICs have built-in ESD protection onto the pins, otherwise they'd fry out as soon as they get touched. So even this is probably not a big deal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some electronic devices would be permanently destroyed. Others might need to be power cycled. Very hardened devices might not experience almost any effects.</p>
<p>Everything else is essentially in-between those two outcomes (destroyed and unaffected).</p>
<p>There’s a perception due to Hollywood that an EMP causes some time-duration of “electronics shutdown” that then ends and everything starts working again. The reality is that it’s more like electrocuting someone with a taser or shooting a person with a bullet. The event is over almost instantly, but the effects vary widely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those would probably be classified info by the countries which were capable and interested in taking the readings. The recovery of electronic devices has probably changed since then, but I couldn't tell you if it's gone up or down. It depends too, are you judging civilian equipment which hasn't been hardened against attacks like your router? Or the radar systems for a THAAD?</p></div>		</li>
