<p>It's all just convention, there's no reason behind any of it.</p>

<p>That's not entirely true. </p>
<p>Back when I studied a bit of design in the late 80s, I asked this question directly in a typography class. His answer was because of hand-set printing presses. Periods and commas characters were not as durable because of the small area. Having them inside, between 2 other larger characters, protected them. </p>
<p>IOW not necessarily a style or grammatical reason, but a practical one.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't see how sentences with quotations would be significant in the wear of periods.  What am I missing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The beef I have with it at this point is that one needs to be very precise when communicating IT-related information. You can’t have a superfluous period when stating a password. </p>
<p>Also, there’s a $5 cover charge next Thursday at O’Malley’s to see my band “The Superfluous Periods”. Come out and bring a friend, should be a great show. Special guest: Herman Menderchuk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We all know of their creative differences with Menderchuk. To me Armada without Menderchuk isn’t Armada. And while Menderchuk hasn’t yet found his own voice as a solo artist I think we owe him the space to find it. </p>
<p>And don’t be like others who have teased me with a possible reunion show: I’m tired of showing up only to find it’s a Rod Torfulson’s Armada featuring Herman Menderchuk cover band.</p>
<p>And btw: I’ve worn out my RTAFHM tour tee-shirt and can’t find any on eBay. At this point I’m tempted to create a silk screen copy because I feel naked without that shirt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not necessarily true that they won’t change conventions. I’m not as familiar with Chicago or MLA style, but in AP Style, which is used mostly in the journalism world, there have been many changes to long-held conventions recently. They’ve removed a lot of the use of the hyphen, for example. </p>
<p>Groups get together every year and decide whether the rules still make sense in today’s changing world, and things do get shaken up on occasion.</p></div>		</li>
