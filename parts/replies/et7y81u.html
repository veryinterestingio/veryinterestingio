<p>Normal languages are constantly innovating from all points. The neat new word someone comes with over here doesn't necessarily make sense to people over there.</p>
<p>However, math advances much more slowly - and in a more rigid fashion. Your work is heavily based on other people's work, so you might as well use their symbols - especially when you're trying to explain it to people who only know those concepts when associated with those symbols.</p>
<p>It's the same reason that Chinese programmers understand 'while' loops. 'While' is an English word, not a Chinese word. But from the standpoint of computer programming, it's really just a symbol - and that symbol means the same thing whether or not you understand the language where it originated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like the most basic answer to that is: then they should post that to /r/inferlikeimfive or even /r/implylikeimfive. I mean, this sub is for explaining to a 5yr old. It should be simplified explanations.</p>
<p>Not that I care too much. Do whatever you want I guess.</p></div>		</li>

<p>a^2 + b^2 = c^2 actually stands for</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a right angled triangle:<br />
the square of the hypotenuse is equal to<br />
the sum of the squares of the other two sides.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Math symbols are distilled language/concepts so we can all understand it.</p></div>		</li>
