<p>Over time the value of money only has decreased, as such I wouldn't keep on to the million dollars except for funny money.</p>

<p>This isn't historically true. When currencies were backed by gold and silver, it was not uncommon for the value of those currencies to increase (called deflation). However since currencies stopped generally being backed by precious metals, inflation has been the norm, which is intentional monetary policy by central banks because modest inflation is considered to be better for the economy than any deflation.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflation#/media/File:US_Historical_Inflation_Ancient.svg" target="_blank">This graph</a> shows historical inflation rates in the US. You can see that before the 20th century inflation and deflation were about equally common. Since the 20th century we have experienced almost exclusively inflation.</p>
<p>Of course, none of this is relevant to the Bolivar. It will never regain it's value.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. This was done in 2008 where they removed 3 zeroes and earlier this year where they removed 5.</p>
<p>So 1 current bolivar is actually 100.000.000 bolivars from 2007.</p>
<p>According to dolartoday, 1 dollar costs 687 current bolivars right now or 68 billion bolivars of 2007. By the way, the dolar was around 2.3 bolivars back in 2007. Not sure what the inflation percentage would be.</p></div>		</li>
