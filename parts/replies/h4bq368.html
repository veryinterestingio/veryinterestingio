			<div class="markdown"><p>Lab Meat is actually a simple tissue when it comes to what they grow for eating. Lab grown meat isn’t a fully functional muscle with nerves , lymphatics, etc. but even real muscle tissue may be simpler than blood. Remember blood contains not only the expected various cell types (there’s about 12 or so ) but also a sophisticated clotting system and the dual,  even more sophisticated humoral and complement immune systems. Then there’s all the other odd things blood has to do like carry hormones and other signals, buffering, cooling and heating, and osmotically maintaining a certain amount of fluid in the circulatory system where it belongs and not oozing out. All these things must be constantly fine tuned by the second.</p></div>		</li>
