<p>If supplies run low because of increased use the price of helium will increase and industries will shift to alternative technologies.  For things like MRIs we're already working on superconductors that don't need to be kept at such cold temperatures.  Most welding processes could substitute Argon for Helium if it comes down to it or substitution of different joints or materials that don't require helium.  For things like deep sea diving assume more automation or remote operation of robots, or possibly the using hydrogen which is mentioned in the USGS periodical.</p>

<p>Edit:  Misread the USGS periodical and added up the wrong numbers for total reserves.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I thought most commercial superconductors nowadays like MRI machines were all cooled by Nitrogen already?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I have heard is that they use a Helium condenser pump.  This uses about 1/100 the Helium of the old style where they had the magnets in a bath of  1500L of LHe and there isn't a risk of quenching the system.  I'm a geologist and don't work with MRIs at all, so don't know what the latest and greatest technology is in that field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>very interesting!<br />
adding to the original question: i know that helium is made by alpha-decay inside earth and it floats up unless its accumulated and trapped in deposits, for example with hydrocarbons. does this mean that helium is constantly leaking and being gassed out from the surface (land and ocean) into the atmosphere and then into the almost-vacuum of space? does earth leave a higher concentration of helium along its orbit compared to the interplanetary space?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We can actually synthesise helium via nuclear fusion of hydrogen, just not in an energy positive way. Once the helium supply from natural gas ends, the price of helium will rise to the point that synthesis becomes cost effective.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Zero chance ever.</p>
<p>Just wait for more Helium from underground nuclear decay produces many orders of magnitude more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>'cost effective' is the key word; is it going to come to the surface in easily harvestable pockets or as fractions of other extractable gases?</p></div>		</li>
