			<div class="markdown"><p>This could work but the batteries would have to be connected in series for the voltage to add. If you held them all together in parallel or connected in different places (ie different hands) it wouldn't work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends how you &quot;hold&quot; them. If they're just between your your hands, no. If you hooked them up in series (end to end) you would get about 30v, so it should tingle at least. </p>
<p>If you hooked up about 80 of them in series you could <del>power your TV. For a little while, anyway.</del></p>
<p>Edit: had a brain fart. Not enough current to power a TV with 80 cells, even though the voltage is fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The contacts are much much closer together which massively reduces the resistance, and it's 6 times the voltage. Even that barely gets you a tingle on a wet(even lower resistance) tongue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, it doesn't actually reduce resistance by much.  The majority of the resistance is due to the outer layer of skin (because it's generally dry, which is why sweatyness matters so much on measured resistance).  As soon as you get to blood (AKA nicely conductive salt water), it's a quite low resistance.</p>
<p>Thus your measured resistance from half an inch apart on your hand is pretty much the same as all the way from one arm to the other.</p></div>		</li>
