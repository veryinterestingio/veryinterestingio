<p>You always have to compare the risks of the vaccine against the risks of the illness. For example, measles can kill 10% of children who get it, and even those that can survive can often have brain damage. The measles vaccine, however, has about a 10% of chance of the person receiving it having some local swelling and pain at the injection site, and about 1 in 20 get a bad rash. It's hard to find exact numbers on how many have serious side effects but it's on the order of 2-3 per <em>million</em>, and almost none of those cases are actually fatal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But it's important to realize that the measles vaccine has been around for decades, and has been improved upon many times to the point where it has became near perfect. For coronavirus, however, we are trying to push the vaccine out in less than a year. If governments rush testing too hard (say for economical reasons) we might miss out on some critical side affects which could very well be 1 out of 10000.</p>
<p>This is all speculation - I have no connections to anyone in immunology nor do I know much about the vaccine testing process,</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, I agree. I'm just outlining that the risks versus the benefits can be quite small. It is one of the risks of rolling out a vaccine without appropriate testing, too. I was somewhat surprised to read people (and the stock market) getting excited about a potential vaccine yesterday that has only been tested on <em>eight</em> people. That isn't a reason to get excited, yet.</p></div>		</li>
