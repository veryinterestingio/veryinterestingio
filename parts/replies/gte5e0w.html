			<div class="markdown"><p>I watched a ted talk video on this topic and they mentioned the same things you did. What I got out of it is that the visual function of the brain is a constantly-improving model. It takes in input, and compares it to the version of the model that’s currently in use, and if things have changed, the model is updated. In the video they also talked about why psychedelics cause the hallucinations. Basically, they explained that lysergic acid and psilocybin disrupt the model and it can’t make the right connections anymore. You’re still taking in input, but it’s either being changed from the point of intake on the path to the processing unit, or it’s changing how the unit processes and interprets the input. </p>
<p>This line, though, really blew my mind and helped me make a connection:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>colors are not real also, it's something the brain makes up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I just realized that we don’t actually “see” colors. Our brain perceives the difference in “color” between different objects and uniquely identifies each differentiation with a visual color. I was thinking, however, the differentiation the brain does, it would have to map to a physical phenomenon. Color is defined as the  wavelength of light the object absorbs and reflects. And even this absorption process maps to a deeper physical phenomenon, which is the fact that each object has atoms that vibrate at different natural frequencies, and thus absorb different parts of the light’s spectrum. So it just clicked that the brain basically perceives the natural frequency of the atoms of each object, and it assign a unique value (color) to each frequency of vibration</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Color vision is deceptively simple and just one of many examples of how perception is not necessarily reality.</p>
<p>While it is true that color, as we perceive it, is not a reality you are correct in that color represents the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation. One could say that each color is associated with a wavelength and so when we see color we are actually seeing what wavelength electrons are oscillating at. But even this is not true.</p>
<p>From the perspective of someone who studied spectroscopy and optometry I can say that there are several circumstances under which our perception of color is inaccurate and completely fabricated (I would dare say even most of the time this is true). This is all because we only have 3 variations of color receptors (you may recognize them as red, green, and blue cones). We do not have color receptors specific to orange-yellow, but a photon with a wavelength of that frequency would moderately stimulate red and green cones, ergo we infer orange from the stimulation of red and green cones.</p>
<p>Early color TVs were built with this in mind. It would be expensive and impractical to create a display capable of showing every possible color on each pixel. But since we perceive orange when our red and green cones are triggered, TVs manufacturers create the illusion of orange by shining a red and green together in very close proximity. Therefore, the wavelengths being emitted by a picture of an orange fruit on your TV, and the wavelengths of light being emitted by a real orange fruit on your desk may very well (almost definitely) be different wavelength, but create the same stimulus on your retina. (For all I know, without using a spectrometer, neither case could be true orange.) It's really quite interesting because when presented with pure colors our eyes can differentiate between two colors that are only 3 or so wavelengths different (which is remarkable color resolution). But when presented with impure color, colors that are a mix of more than one wavelength (which is most objects I believe) then what we see is very much an illusion.</p>
<p>Another example of how color is a made up construct within our mind is the color purple. Purple is not a real color. We see it everyday and never question it, even in the context of a rainbow or a prism, but we never stop to think about the fact it doesn't exist. There is no wavelength of light that correlates with purple. It is simply a color that we perceive when our red and blue cones are stimulated. Since those cones are on opposite sides of the spectrum there is no one wavelength of light that could stimulate red cones and blue cones and not stimulate green cones. So every time you see purple you are seeing, basically, an illusion; two or more wavelengths of light that combine to create a stimulus that technically should not be impossible. (Edit: I only just thought if this, but white light is an illusion for the same reason. There is no color white, because white is what we see when all three cones are stimulated, and no one wavelength can do that).</p>
<p>Lastly, I'd like to add that the actual color emitted from objects change depending on lighting. A warm light brings out the warmer colors of an object and a cool light brings out cooler colors. Additionally, certain cones work more effectively in dim lighting than others and this works to exaggerate the effect of the same  objects appearing different colors even further. If our brain simply passed on pure stimuli we'd never know what color anything ever was because they would all seem to change colors depending on the time of day or whether the object were inside vs outside, or under fluorescent lighting versus natural. Going back to the start of the thread, our brain subconsciously compares stimuli with preexisting models of how things should look to tell us what color something is, so that we can identify a red object as red regardless of what lighting it is under. However, if you take away context, or precondition the brain with certain data or stimuli, this can throw that model off and cause us to perceive the wrong color. That is why the world could not agree on whether that dress was white and gold, or blue and black. The photo lacked just enough context for our collective brains to not be able to agree on what color it should be. Brains are designed to quickly resolve perception so in just a split second it chooses a dress color and by time it reaches your perception you're 100% convinced the dress is white and gold even though it's actually blue and black; that is to say color perception does not take doubt or lack of context into account even when your brain is completely wrong in it's assessment.</p>
<p>Tl;Dr seeing may be believing, but it doesn't mean you're believing the truth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is all so fascinating to me and you just shared such interesting information. I feel like I have a better understanding of the system of seeing. So basically the physical phenomenon goes as far as three specific wavelengths stimulating the cones, and the remaining colors are “filled in” so to say by our brains in terms of how much each cone type is being stimulated. </p>
<p>Now this has me thinking: clearly an orange radiates a wave whose wavelength is that of orange which is stimulating the red and green cones at the same time at different intensities. If I shine two beams of light where one is the wavelength of blue and the other is of wavelength of green, and set the intensity of each so it mimics that of the pure orange wavelength, the brain would perceive just orange, correct? In this case, the object itself is not orange; it’s actually two distinct colors getting merged together. In the case of the fruit orange, is it actually orange or is it just an object of two colors being radiated at the same time, which is then perceived as one? I’m assuming superposition applies to light so there would be no way to make the distinction. </p>
<p>Also, what’s the mechanism in the eye that breaks the light apart into its spectrum?</p>
<p>Ultimately, the real magic is happening in the brain. It’s amazing how good of a predictive model the brain is and how good it is at evaluating fuzzy logic, yet, it chooses greedy algorithms for important things such as reward in the short term vs long term. A greedy model is a good model for getting the best result locally but since it doesn’t take the bigger picture into account, it can miss the best solution which can only be seen by looking at the bigger context</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think this statement is a bit misleading, because in general English (if you aren't talking specifically about light), purple tends to include a variety of shades that includes violet colors (i.e. wavelengths of light that are bluer than blue).</p>
<p>When people think of purple things that they see, they aren't usually making a distinction between red and blue wavelengths (purple) vs the shorter-than-blue wavelengths (violet). Purple things usually covers a range of red-purple to blue-purple, unless you are really trying to be more specific (magenta, mauve, violet, etc.). Even when you are being more specific, when talking about every day things that you see, I don't think there is a distinction between a mix of red and blue that is perceived as violet, and geuine violet.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, some points I would emphasize here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nothing is inherently any particular color.  This is all just your brain’s perception.  Another species or device may perceive something to be a different color than you do and this is not wrong.  It is just a different “color language”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are an infinite number of color systems possible.  The ones we use as humans are only a sample of possible systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I say humans use multiple color systems because some of us (like myself) are “colorblind”.  In reality, I just use a different color system than most people.  I don’t see colors incorrectly.  That would imply that some color system is inherently correct.  I just speak a different color language so to say.</p>
</li>
<li>There are many colors that you will never “see” because your brain doesn’t use them.  There are other animals with four primary colors in their vision for example.  On the one hand, you can never know these colors.  On the other hand, colors don’t exist in the first place.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate that “color isn’t real” shit, so many people spout it like it’s some mind blowing thing. But photons hit an object and are reflected back at a certain wavelength, thus making the color, and those photons and the object are real. It’s a case of being technically true, but operationally useless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No that's not correct. Photons reflecting at particular energy states, or specific wavelengths, is correct, but that doesn't contain any colour information, it's just a purely physical phenomenon. It takes a brain receiving different wavelengths and interpreting them based on their surroundings and additional information like expectations to perceive colour (meaning the same wavelength can be perceived as a range of colours). Our visual system assigns particular colours to particular areas, but that same combination of wavelengths could be perceived with a completely different set of colours (as is likely with animal vision).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm interested in the filter and hallucinations. In particular the sense of proprioception. My proprioception gets messed up when falling asleep, having a fever, or having a panic attack. It can feel for eg like my limbs are jumbled (arms connected to my hips for eg), like they are too large/small/light, or that they are in a completely different location to where they are (like feeling that my legs are pointed straight down in bed when they're actually bent at the knee). I don't see it, I feel it and the feeling is proprioceptive not that I can feel pressure against my skin etc. I'm not worried about it as it's always been this way but I've always wondered what's going on with that. If it's a filtering issue then what happens to your filter during a panic attack? And why does proprioception require a filter?</p></div>		</li>
