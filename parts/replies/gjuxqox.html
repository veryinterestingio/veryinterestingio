Thus enticing any nearby bees to go into &quot;attack mode&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. You could spray someone you don't like with isopentyl acetate and they'd be targets for bees any time they went close to a hive. Beekeepers use artificial chemicals all the time, a great example being to attract a swarm to a swarm trap: you can buy a pack of commercial swarm lures that'll last you a season, or simply use lemongrass oil, a little bottle of which will last years for the same price. To get that person you don't like who I mentioned above, put a few drops in awkward spots like a vent into the roof of their house - there's a good chance a swarm will move in.</p>
<p>Less common is the use of artificial queen substance which is used to control the hive when they lose the queen. </p>
<p>So, yes, chemical warfare is common with bees.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does lemongrass work with wasps? I once had a wooden shed I smoked in, and frequently burned incense while inside. One summer, it seemed to become very popular with wasps, and I can't help but wonder if it was because I used lemongrass incense</p></div>		</li>
