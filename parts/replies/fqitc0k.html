			<div class="markdown"><p>I was fascinated to learn that animals can demonstrate &quot;handedness&quot;. For instance with cats, it appears to be sex linked. Males tend to left-handed while females tend to be right-handed. (This is tested by putting a treat at the bottom of a narrow glass and observing which paw the cat uses first to try to retrieve the treat.)</p></div>		</li>
