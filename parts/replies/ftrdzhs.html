			<div class="markdown"><p>We had a doctor here in my town in the 90’s that had a thing for masturbating young men.  You would go there for a cold or whatever, she would ask to see your testicles and then beat you off, clean you up and send you on your way.  Went on for years, I went there all the time.  She ended up getting done for it and offed herself - a real shame as she knew her way around a cock.  RIP Dr Tahn.</p></div>		</li>
