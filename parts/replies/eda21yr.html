It's hundreds of thousands of entities investing in each other's government bonds, with bonds being paid out and sold every day. It's a market. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because that's not how bonds work. Almost all this government debt is in the form of bonds. Also it's not like the debt is to a single entity. The bonds sold by Spain and Italy were probably bought by a large number of groups from banks, institutions, and individuals across multiple borders. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Also if USD goes down in value, China's exports increase in price from the perspective of an American, so China's exports would tank. Now we understand why if one major central bank prints money, every central bank has to print money - to protect its country's export markets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>they cant. its not like they can just call the debt.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>the debt is in the form of bonds. which pay a fixed rate per year until the bond matures. they cant just go and say hey you owe us all this money now.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>and if they were to manipulate the dollar, they would have to do it in a way that made the dollar stronger, so they would get a higher return on their investment. torpedoing the dollar does not change how much they earn on those bonds. they're fixed for the duration until they mature. in fact torpedoing the dollar means they lose money, because the US will still pay them, just with currency that wont be able to buy as much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mainly because the bonds emitted by the US government are to be paid in USD. They've already agreed to the terms and conditions by buying it.</p>
<p>They cannot one-sidedly convert it to RMB. That requires finding a buyer that buys the USD bonds off them and pays in RMB. The only buyer willing to do it it is China itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Currency trading is a lot more volatile than bond trading.  Chinese banks by US Treasury bonds because they are a safe place to store money with a reasonable rate of return. You are guaranteed to make money on T-Bills so long as the rate is higher than inflation.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This answer is pretty close, but as someone who worked on finding out who owns each company by looking at thousands of law mandated disclosures, we can't really be sure since ownership structures are complex and (maybe purposefully so) confusing. </p>
<p>Most of the ownership of debt is owned by funds. These funds invest in lots of other things according to multiple methodologies, then they sell shares of all of goods that allow shareholders to reap the profits. However the company that manages the fund owns the debt, so they do some things like vote, negotiate restructuring with defaulted countries and take delinquents to trials.  But the revenue of the bonds are distributed to shareholders while fund managers only charge a fee.</p>
<p>If that weren't confusing, the funds have to report what they buy, but they don't have to report who they sell their stocks to. Even if we somehow get that information for some important stockholder, the same scheme might run and we don't know who is at the bottom line getting the actual profits.</p>
<p>tl;dr: financial corporations and regular people but we can't be sure of the actual ratio. In my semiqualified opinion, it tilts greatly in favour of nameless corps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's in process of being automated, but with no incentive from companies and little from stock exchanges to cooperate in increasing transparency, it's an upstream swim. It's not uncommom for some companies to publish their documents as pdfs to avoid their data being read by machines for example.</p>
<p>As to how keep of track of it. We mostly provided data as is. Instead of saying,&quot;this company owes this percentage of this other&quot;, customers read &quot;this company reported that this other company owned this security of this company at this date in this disclosure form&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't really matter how many times it's bought and sold. Whoever currently own the bold can cash it in once it's &quot;matured&quot; the government just need to know how many bonds they have issued.</p>
<p>Keeping records of all previous holders are not really necessary, as long as each individual transaction is done properly and no one is scammed into buying non-existing bonds or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What do you mean? It's how investment companies work. They buy and sell assets. Some of it is automated, some of it isn't. Being automated or not doesn't reduce the complexity of it. Each investment company knows what they buy and sell and they keep track of it internally. Government bonds are bought at auction and it's public knowledge about who bought it. It's also public knowledge about how much bond money is floating around out there. What happens after it's sold also becomes public knowledge because it's based off how they're traded day to day.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Governments sell bonds to private investors, those private investors can resell those bonds to other private investors, and so on.</p>
<p>The deeper this goes on, the less information that is publicly available.</p>
<p>In the end, the most accurate information we have is mostly from declarations of possesion, not of trades. And only a few types of financial institutions are required to disclose. Even then, these institutions might appear to own the bonds on paper, but they have private agreements with owners in which they end up receiving the profits.</p>
<p>So for most of the debt, we don't know who owns it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Consider it like this.  The government issues its debt by selling bonds.  They get cash, the buyer gets a bond which is the promise to repay the cash they invested along with some interest.  </p>
<p>But, generally they don’t make interest and principal payments the way you do with your mortgage.   They sell a bond for its value less the interest in the beginning.  For example: a 5-year, $1000 bond at 10% interest would be sold by the government for about $621 and at the end of five years, they would owe the holder $1000.   </p>
<p>It’s the holder’s responsibility to claim their money and safe guard their possession of the bond during that period, and they will because who wouldn’t want their money.   The government doesn’t have to track it. </p>
<p>Of course, the holder can also keep the bond beyond five years still gaining interest, and when they cash it in they’ll get more than $1000 determined by a simple calculation.  </p>
<p>Make sense?</p>
<p>For the question of who owns the government’s debt, the simple answer is there is really no way to know and it doesn’t really matter.  The system has to work with freedom and anonymity.  Does it mean US government interest payments might end up going to unsavory people?   Sure, but if they had something to invest and it wasn’t put in US debt, it would just go somewhere else and they’d get the same or better returns.  </p>
