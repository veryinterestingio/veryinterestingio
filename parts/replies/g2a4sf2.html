			<div class="markdown"><p>As an aside, this is also true for anti-fungal regimens, even over the counter. Even if it appears the rash is gone you keep applying it for the time indicated by the directions, or all you're doing is leaving behind the colonies most resistant to the anti-fungal and allowing them to become the dominant strain.</p>
<p>Also unlike (systemic) antibiotics, there are both over-the-counter and prescription anti-fungals. The idea being they want to  have the prescription-only not ones commonly used, so when infections show up that are resistant to all the standard OTC types (miconazole nitrate, clotrimazole, and terbinafine and tolnaftate) they can prescribe a less-used one that the infection is less likely to be resistant to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Best explanation I've read here.</p>
<p>The NHS explains this as such: &quot;Patients have always been advised to finish their course of antibiotics even if they're feeling better. The reasons given are that this will stop the infection from returning, as well as reduce the risk of the bacteria becoming resistant to the antibiotics.&quot;</p>
<p>You can read the full study here:  <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/358/bmj.j3418" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/358/bmj.j3418" target="_blank">https://www.bmj.com/content/358/bmj.j3418</a></a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way antibiotics work is typically by interfering with a specific phase of bacterial growth or division that causes the cell to fail, not by actively destroying the bacteria.</p>
<p>You take the full course of antibiotics so that ALL the bacteria have time to cycle through that compromised phase while exposed to the antibiotic and thus die.</p>
<p>If you cut it short, not all will be compromised, and you might reduce the bacterial population low enough to relieve symptoms, but still high enough to return once the antibiotic is absent.</p>
<p>The idea that bacteria are going to become antibiotic resistant within a single course of treatment is a myth. Antibiotic resistant strains come from systemic overuse of antibiotics (such as in farm animals), not from incomplete use.</p></div>		</li>
