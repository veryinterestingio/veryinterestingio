			<div class="markdown"><p>Depth is not a condition for the formation of pillow lava, it's enough that the lava has sufficiently low viscosity. It will however look different depending on the depth it formed since lava formed above 3km depth will have formations in the rock showing where steam/gas escaped from the lava as it solidified.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Viscosity is also really important in explosivity. Low viscosity lavas tend to either trap the bubbles or just allow them to easily seep out with little to no issues. Think like blowing bubbles in water. You get some bubbling but not an explosion. </p>
<p>High viscosity lavas get blown apart by gasses since the gas can not easily escape. Think like trying to blow bubbles in tartar sauce. Your gonna build up pressure and then next thing you know, tartar sauce all over the place.</p>
<p>My point is that pillow lava (usually basaltic or andesitic) doesn't explode because A: it doesn't have high enough viscosity and B: usually doesn't have as much gas either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to present a counter argument to the other two posts and confirm that some people believe depth is related to the formation of pillow lava, as you wrote originally. </p>
<p>One source is the book &quot;Living Earth - outline of the geology of Iceland&quot; written by Ari Trausti Guðmundsson. On page 29 in the 1st edition, he writes &quot;if, on the other hand, eruption takes places under glaciers or the sea, water quenches the magma and causes flash boiling, commonly with tephra production as a result. Under thick glaciers (hundreds of meters) or at great depth in the sea, the eruption is contained by water and ice pressure, leading to the formation of pillow lava. When the pillow lava has formed a thick mound, causing water depth to decrease, the eruption becomes explosive (Surtseyan).&quot;</p>
<p>So the pressure and viscosity of the lava has some say, the interaction with water will always cause a lot of gas/vapour to be produced, which makes a&quot; secondary&quot; explosive eruption of the water masses - which in turn affects the characteristics of the lava. This is what happened a few years ago with Eyjafjellajökull that created all the ash that grounded airplane traffic across major parts of Europe. If there is enough water (or ice) to create a pressure able to contain the development of vapour, then the eruption will remain calmer in accordance with the viscosity and gas/volatile pressure of the lava that is extruding.</p></div>		</li>
