<p>OK, so so far we've basically been dealing with the chemical properties of elements. Most of what we've seen so far comes down to the electron structure: from whether it's a gas or a solid, the colour of the material, the way it reacts, the way it conducts heat or electricity... all of that is down to the electrons, and the protons that balance them out.</p>
<p>So why does an element even need neutrons? What do neutrons even do?</p>
<p>This is where we move from chemistry into physics. Think back to when you were a kid playing with magnets (or an adult playing with magnets; magnets are cool, no judgement). A magnet has a positive end, +, and a negative end, -. The positive end and the negative end will stick together perfectly happily, but if you try and stick two positive ends together, you're going to have a bad time. They'll repel each other immediately.</p>
<p>Now think back to the structure of an atom as we discussed earlier. The electrons are all whizzing around, doing their thing, too far apart (thanks to their relative size) to really be repelling each other despite their charge... but in the centre of an atom, you have a ball of heavy protons, all in a very small space. (And when I say a small space, I <em>mean</em> a small space; the radius of an atom's nucleus is <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zwn8b82/revision/3" target="_blank">about 1/10,000 the size of the atom as a whole</a>, electron orbitals included, which means that despite containing almost all of its mass, the nucleus takes up a vanishingly small fraction of the space of the atom.) </p>
<p>So now you've got a problem: all those positively-charged particles that want to get far away from each other, like the two positive ends of your magnets. The nucleus <em>should</em> pop apart... and yet, it doesn't. This is largely down to something called the <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_interaction" target="_blank">strong nuclear force</a>, which lives happily in the world of quantum physics and so gets pretty damn complex pretty damn quickly -- so I won't be covering it in much detail here -- but it is helped by the presence of neutrons. You know how when you press two positive ends of a magnet together, it's really easy when they're far apart and it gets much more difficult when they're close together (and, conversely, how magnets attract a lot more when they're closer than they do when they're far apart)? That's because the electromagnetic force weakens as the square of the distance. A charged particle that is twice as far away, doesn't pull with half the force but a quarter of the force; a charged particle three times as far away pulls not with a third of the force but with a ninth, and so on. In this sense, you can consider neutrons the packing peanuts of the nucleus; they don't necessarily seem like they do much on their own, but you'd surely miss them if they weren't there.</p>
<p>However, while you only have one option for the number of protons/electrons in an element, no such rule applies for neutrons. There are multiple stable (and less-stable; we'll get to that in a minute) versions of most elements, thanks to the number of neutrons in them. Take <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine" target="_blank">chlorine</a> for example. On the periodic table, chlorine's box looks like <a href="https://sciencenotes.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Chlorine_Tile.png" target="_blank">this</a>: you see in the top corner, it has an atomic number of 17 -- that's the number of protons it has, unique to every element -- and at the bottom you see the relative mass of one atom, 35.4527; to calculate the number of neutrons, you just take away the number of protons (remember, electrons have a negligible mass), and you're left with... 18.4527 neutrons. The kids at the front of the class have probably realised that this is <em>not ideal</em> -- you can't have 0.4527 neutrons -- but the reason is because the atomic mass is an <em>average</em>, taken experimentally. About 76% of chlorine atoms in the wild have 18 neutrons (identified by its atomic mass, and called chlorine-35), and about 24% have 20 neutrons (or Chlorine-37). On average, then -- because of the huge numbers of atoms involved in a workable sample in the lab -- you can treat chlorine as having a relative mass of 35.4527. Atoms of the same element that have different numbers of neutrons are called <em>isotopes</em>, and they're kind of a big deal. An atom of chlorine-35 will react in basically the same way as an atom of chlorine-37. However, these are <em>stable</em> isotopes; they'll basically stay chilled out like that for as long as you like.</p>
<p>So what about <em>un</em>stable isotopes? Well, remember how I said that neutrons were like packing peanuts? They're not always packed well. Sometimes the number of peanuts used isn't enough to keep things from rattling around, and when they aren't stable... well, sometimes some weird stuff can happen. Hold onto your butts: we're about to enter the wild world of radioactivity.</p>
<p><strong>I kind of overdid it on the explanation, but while I've got your attention I might as well carry on just a <em>little</em> while longer: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/coveko/eli5_why_does_a_single_proton_change_everything/ewm7v3n/" target="_blank">what's the deal with radioactivity, anyway?</a></strong></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><strong>This might seem like we're going a little way off the reservation with regard to the initial question, but if you want a little more information about it, it all ties together in the end.</strong></p>
<p>So from an ELI5 perspective -- and there's a <em>lot</em> more to it than that, I promise you -- you can think of radioactivity as what happens when an unstable atom breaks down. See, these protons and neutrons want to be in a stable state: with a balanced charge, and with a nucleus that is stable enough that it doesn't want to fly apart at any given opportunity. Neutrons, as we saw earlier, can help with that last part. However, sometimes the number of neutrons you have in an atom isn't <em>quite</em> right to make it perfectly stable. It's the equivalent of patching a leak with duct tape: it might hold for a while, but it isn't going to hold forever, and when it does then things are going to get messy. In this case, 'getting' messy means 'radioactive decay': the atom basically doesn't have the structural integrity to stay together, and it wiggles itself apart, forming smaller, more stable atoms (and shooting out any spare neutrons or protons; more on that later) -- and giving off a <em>buttload</em> of energy.</p>
<p>Now, not every isotope is going to explode dramatically when it decays; in fact, that's very rare. Most of them just break apart on an atom-by-atom basis, not disturbing any of the atoms around them. As for when they decay... well, that's not really so easy to tell either. In short, an unstable atom can decay at any time, but the likelihood of this is all based on statistics; a more unstable atom is more likely to decay more quickly, but you can never be quiet sure when it's going to happen. Instead, we measure it in what's called the <em>half-life</em> of a sample: this is the time it will take for, on average, half of a given sample of an isotope to decay. This can vary <em>wildly</em> between different isotopes. For hydrogen-7, the half-life is 23 yoctoseconds (a yoctosecond being a septillionth of a second); for tellurium-128, the half-life is over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_radioactive_isotopes_by_half-life" target="_blank">160 trillion times the age of the universe</a>.</p>
<p>One example of this is carbon-14, which is commonly used in carbon dating (sometimes called <em>radio</em>carbon dating; 'radio' is a prefix that generally tells you something nuclear is going down). Carbon-14 is radioactive and unstable; it has a half-life of roughly 5,730 years, and about one in every trillion carbon atoms is carbon-14 instead of the vastly more common carbon-12. What that means is that if you know how much carbon-14 is in a dead thing, you can figure out how long ago it stopped bringing in fresh carbon-14 atoms (which are created in the upper atmosphere) to replace the levels in its cells; in other words, you can have a rough guess as to how long ago it died.</p>
<p>Other times, the reaction is a lot more violent. Take uranium-235, for example. It has a half-life of 703,800,000 years, but if you can get the atoms to split, they do so by throwing off neutrons, which then cause other atoms to split, which throw off more neutrons (and the aforementioned buttload of energy), which then cause <em>other</em> atoms to split. In short, you've got yourself a nuclear bomb. Because one atom breaking apart causes other atoms to break apart, and so on down the line, we call this a <em>chain reaction</em>. (In case you're wondering, the reason why this doesn't happen just out in the wild is because most uranium -- something like 99.25% -- is the 238 isotope, which doesn't undergo a chain reaction. Additionally, the half-life being so long means that the odds of enough atoms randomly splitting to cause an explosion at any given time is very, very slim. It's not <em>zero</em> -- quantum physics doesn't allow for that -- but it's still not high, even when you purify out the uranium-235.)</p>
<p>The exact mechanism by which radioactive decay happens is complicated, and probably a bit above ELI5 level, but it can be thought of as an atom trying to become as stable as it can be. Sometimes that means throwing out what we call an <em>alpha particle</em> (a bundle of two protons and two neutrons; we call this <em>alpha decay</em>). Other times, a neutron can become a proton and an electron or a proton can become a neutron and a sort of anti-electron (called a positron) in a process we call <em>beta decay</em>. In both cases, the number of protons in the element changes -- which, as we saw right up at the top, means that the number of electrons needed to keep a neutral charge changes.</p>
<p>So there you have it: protons, neutrons and electrons, and how their various values change the properties of an atom, and occasionally of each other.</p>
