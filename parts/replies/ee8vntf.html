			<div class="markdown"><p>But if they have starships capable of crossing such distances in reasonable lengths of time, they can easily put themselves in any position they like to eclipse a star by any orbiting planet. Being able to stand on a rocky planet might be a slight novelty, but not that amazing on the grand scheme of things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And the people creating those space trips will build Luna Eclipse Station 4 that offers solar eclipses every hour on the hour. If an apparently moon-sized sun is all that rare then they likely won't have considered it just like we don't yearn to see a sea-going vessel perfectly block out the setting moon from an island. Maybe it's a spectacular sight but it's so far from what we ordinarily see that nobody will go looking for it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Honestly. If they can get around the speed of light by bending soacetime, or some other method, they must have technology that would blow our minds. Things that we never even dreamed of.</p>
<p>The power requirements for traveling faster than the speed of light is insaine. You would need exotic mater to bend soacetime, or to keep a wormhole open. Stuff that can make negative energy. Whole fields of physics that don't exist for us yet. They most likely have mastered fusion. And even that's most likely not enough energy. They probably have multiple solar systems that they use just to harvest raw energy from stars. Dyson swarms or Dyson spheres. They'd need self replicating robots to be the manpower behind constructing something of that magnitude. Entire facilities that harvest entire planets for raw resources to make more and more robots that connect to a central Artificial Intelligence just to choreograph putting such large scale projects into motion.</p>
<p>Entire power grids that span countless solar systems.</p>
<p>They'd have populations in the trillions. And most likely many many more robots. All self sufficient. Building and repairing all automatically.</p>
<p>At one point when they started this it would just grow exponentially. Until they're consuming countless planets and stars.</p>
<p>They'd be in a whole nother level that we couldn't even comprehend.</p>
<p>I would assume they would have 3d printers that could take in raw material. Like hunks of iron, silicon, ect. Into a machine that breaks it down into individual atoms. From there they'd have a 3d printer that could place single atoms down, or larger pieces down. They could create a whole robot or machine from start to finish in a single 3D printer. And they'd have billions or trillions of the running non stop. Even making more 3D printers when necessary.</p>
<p>Their production speed would be mind boggling. Their energy usage would be utterly insaine. Using the raw output of countless stars.</p>
<p>/End Rant.</p>
<p>Thinking of this just amazes me. I hope someday humans get to this point. I really hope we don't die on this lonely spec of a rock in a tiny spec of the universe. I wonder how long it would take to get to this point. Maybe in another thousand or so years.bifbtechnology keeps increasing. And only if societies ideologies push for more space exploration and expansion. But right now it seems like there are too many things that could kill us out right. The human population has a good chance of becoming extinct if we never get off this planet and create self sufficient colonies.</p>
<p>Best way to do this would to be able to copy a person's brain into a computer. Then space travel wouldn't be too bad. We could alter our perception of time so a 10,000 year journey doesn't feel like any time passed at all. We wouldn't need any food. Only electricity.</p>
<p>Maybe someday.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just look at what we do to animals. Then imagine how interesting us and our planet would be to something equally or more intelligent than us. </p>
<p>We put animals in zoos and observe them, we cut them up to understand them, eat them, keep them as pets. Just look at furries and then imagine what the aliens will want to do to us when they come here. </p></div>		</li>
