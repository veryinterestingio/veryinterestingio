			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was working on submarines that were in for an overhaul, one of the sailors on watch (even when a sub is laid up for months being overhauled, there's always some crew standing watch) told me this:</p>
<p>They take the new crew members, on their first deep dive, into the torpedo room, the only place on the sub where it's open space the full width of the boat. Then, before the dive, they tie a string all the way across from the port to the starboard frame, stretching it tight. And after they dive, the string is sagging, because the pressure on the hull squeezes it so much.</p>
<p>I have no idea if that was a true story. But just imagine being on a sub, at a depth where the outside pressure would turn a human to jelly, and watching that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very much a real thing, although there are locations beyond the torpedo room where you can run a string like that. I got to see a similar demonstration from the engineering spaces.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's hard to make a structure that's the size of a ship that is perfectly, 100% rigid. All materials have some flex in them, even steel. The importance of naval engineering is designing the ship to stay structurally sound even when parts of it are flexing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And the welding methodology matters a lot, too. I had a coworker who was a welder at a submarine shipyard, and one night after work he was having some beers and blabbing about seeing another welder using some Mild Steel as filler on a pressure hull weld. Now, sub pressure hulls use a very specially formulated and manufactured type of steel, way stronger than standard mild steel.</p>
<p>Someone overheard him blabbing, told shipyard security, and the very next day a team of feds snatched him from home, and spent the day sweating him under hot lights for every detail, from every angle, multiple times.</p>
<p>Edit: changed a letter, cause stringer and stronger mean very different things</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If they weren't somewhat flexible, it would be really bad. The Liberty Ships in WW2 famously had issues with the steel used. Up until that point, most merchant vessels were riveted and crack propagation did not transfer from plate to plate. When they used this same steel, but welded, they found that the small cracks could form and propagate quickly in the cold temperatures of the north atlantic. This caused at least 12 ships to crack in half like an egg.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The last radio contact suggested the hull cracked, and the speed it sank indicates hull failure.</p>
<p>A similar designed ship sank after a similar hull failure in similar conditions, and the crew got a photo of the severed hull before it sank.</p>
<p>We can only guess, but large freighters have broken before in severe storms.</p></div>		</li>
