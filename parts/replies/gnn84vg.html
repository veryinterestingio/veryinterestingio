			<div class="markdown"><p>These telescopes will allow us to image Earth-like planets in the habitable zones of nearby stars. The contrast between planet and star is more favorable in the mid-IR which is therefore better suited for observing solar-type stars. The high spatial resolution in the optical or Near-IR is needed to resolve planets orbiting the narrow habitable zone of the many nearby M-stars. My guess is that the first Earth-like planet image will be taken with an ELT observing a nearby M-star, e.g. Proxima Cen.</p></div>		</li>
