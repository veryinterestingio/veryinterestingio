			<div class="markdown"><p>While it might be an exaggeration to say that anthropogenic climate change directly cause a human extinction, it'll make life for billions of people more miserable, most won't die, but that would lead to more political conflicts. While the rising sea and hurricanes won't wipe out civilizations, nuclear war would, and that can be resulted from an indirect impact of the climate change. One such example is that the receding Arctic ice is opening up more shipping routes for Russia, and many NATO countries have territorial waters that border Russia's. They will fight over the new resources previously economically not viable, and it'll be ugly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally, I feel like the effects of climate change can be overexaggerated on Reddit- most scientists do not believe we are facing an extinction event.  If you are alive today, you won't be dead from climate change by old age.  A lot of Redditors, however, believe this.</p>
<p>On the flip side, I always wonder if it's worth correcting them.  Most scientists <em>do</em> believe we are facing an environmental catastrophe- climate change will displace communities, likely causing wars, causing dramatic increases in cost to maintain existing cities, likely making a lot of land uninhabitable, etc.  It will be a massive economic drag and cheaper if we deal with it in advance, and will likely cause tremendous loss of life and political instability and refugee crisises.</p>
<p>So...it's I guess better that people are <em>too</em> worried than not worried enough?</p></div>		</li>
