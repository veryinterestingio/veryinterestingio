			<div class="markdown"><p>The reticular formation governs consciousness but it's not exactly an &quot;on-off&quot; switch except for sleep. I don't know about going from unconscious--&gt; conscious, but it &quot;regulates&quot; consciousness in the sense that it shows reduced activation when asleep and destroying it causes animals to fall into permanent comas. I am not certain it has much to do with &quot;regaining&quot; consciousness-- its activation is probably more a byproduct than a cause.</p></div>		</li>
