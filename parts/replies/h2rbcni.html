			<div class="markdown"><p>I would be skeptical of that statement. We do not know in what context &quot;work well&quot; means. Not getting sick? Not getting hospitalized? Not dying? </p>
<p>Also at what threshold? Above 0%? 50%?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Based on the next couple of sentences, he seems to care about hospitalizations and not breakthrough cases that dont cause much sickness, so if he said the initial data shows it working well, its likely preventing hospitalizations so far. I dont get why everyone thinks they are qualified to be skeptical of medical doctors during a pandemic, and the context makes his intention pretty clear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its perfectly fair to be skeptical of doctors within reason. Medical doctors are not infallible just because they have a license to practice medicine. They can have have motives separate from what constitutes good health care. They can make mistakes. Some just plain suck at their jobs. So asking questions, doing your own research, getting second opinions, is all fair imo. </p>
<p>No argument on the rest of your comment though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I may not be a medical doctor but I'm a statistician and I know enough not to trust vague undefined statements without data.</p>
<p>Additionally, everyone's personal tolerance of risk is different, people may value not getting sick with COVID very highly. Maybe someone has children too young to be vaccinated and don't want to risk infecting them. If that is the case, just avoiding hospitalization/death is not good enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From every report I’ve seen the order of importance when speaking about a vaccine seems to be; death -&gt; hospitalization -&gt; serious infection -&gt; mild case -&gt; asymptomatic -&gt; not contagious -&gt; immunity</p>
<p>And so far all of the approved vaccines have very very good protection against the first two or three on that list, from all the variants</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do we have any idea if any of them is doing a good job on the &quot;not contagious&quot; part? I would guess that one is an especially important treshold for the herd immunity part (since you always have some people that can't be vaccinated due to medical conditions but need protection too).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.nj.com/coronavirus/2021/06/delta-covid-variant-does-johnson-johnson-vaccine-work-against-the-new-coronavirus-strain.html" target="_blank">According to this article quoting Scott Gotlieb</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former head of the Food and Drug Administration, said recently on CBS News’s “Face the Nation” that the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine is “60% effective” against the Delta strain.</p>
<p>“The mRNA vaccine seems to be highly effective, two doses of that vaccine against this variant,” Gottlieb said, referring to the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines. “The viral vector vaccines from J&amp;J and AstraZeneca also appear to be effective, about 60% effective. The mRNA vaccines are about 88% effective.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thank being said, I'm not sure what &quot;60% effective&quot; means exactly in this case. </p>
<p>As someone who got the J&amp;J vaccine, there isn't a lot of information to be found regarding efficacy rates and the like as far as I can tell -- at least compared to the other main vaccines. And the information that I do see almost always shows the J&amp;J vaccine to be noticeably less effective. I almost want to get at least one shot of the mRNA vaccines to potentially increase my protection (which should work in theory according to one PhD immunologist I know), but I have yet to see any actual studies on this front <em>with J&amp;J</em> so I'm naturally not planning on taking that route yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heterologous boosting 1 dose Astrazeneca with mRNA appears to be working very well. Canada now recommends this. Small studies show equivalent or superior immune responses to 2 doses of mRNA. Hopefully there will be guidance for J&amp;J folks in the near future.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is the reason there’s so little information is a. It’s been used on less people and limited to the US, and b. It’s efficacy increases over time. There’s been several studies that show t-cell immunity increased to mRNA values 70 days post shot. I really wish they’d be more open and actively researching this vaccine though as many of us feel left in the lurch</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Johnson &amp; Johnson has a lower effective rate because it was be tested in places like South Africa as the variants were coming online, but it is still fantastic for preventing hospitalizations.</p></div>		</li>
