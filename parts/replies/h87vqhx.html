			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a pretty good base, but I'll expand on it a little more. Short answer: it depends, but probably. </p>
<p>There are multiple types of antibodies. With most initial infections, it's primarily IgM (star-like antibody) that leads into equal levels of IgG (fork-like antibody). These antibody levels usually dwindle quite fast. As such, they're not a great metric for determining immunity or not. They are, however, good at determining if a recent infections occurred. After exposure, your body has memory B cells that &quot;remember&quot; how to make antibodies against that specific antigen (piece of the virus essentially). When you're infected naturally, your body produces many different combinations of antibodies that will bind to different parts of the virus or its coat. Each get a memory B cell for them. </p>
<p>Upon secondary infection, the IgG levels increase to greatly amounts and the response is significantly faster. IgM levels are higher than initial infection, but not to the same level as IgG antibodies. </p>
<p>In addition to these, there are also specialized T-cells. These T-cells are able to recognize infected cells and kill them (they're also called killer T-cells). These are just as important as antibodies. Antibodies &quot;slow&quot; viruses down and make them easier to remove, while T-cells &quot;put out the fire&quot; before they spread further. Both this and the previous antibody response are what we call the adaptive immune system.</p>
<p>Damage from COVID is believed to be primarily from inflamation. the renin-angiotensin-aldesterone system is essentially a homeostatic process that controls blood pressure and volume. Angiotensinogen is turned into AngiotensinI by renin. AngiotensinI is activated by the ACE receptor to make angiotensinII. THis is a pro-inflammatory molecule that causes increased blood pressure and contributes to inflammation in the lungs, kidneys, heart, partially intestines, and brain. There may be more but I can't remember them. ACE2 (among other receptors) act to cleave angiotensinII into angiotensin1-7, which does the opposite of angiotensinII. ACE2, because of this, provides a large protectory effect to increased inflammation and damage caused by that. Sars-cov2 binds to the ACE2 receptors to gain entry. It also seems to result in downregulation of the ACE2 receptor, meaning less ACE2 are available to negate the increasing inflammation. ACE2 has a strong protectory effect on the lungs and other organs from inflammation (smokers and older people seem to have a very high level of ACE2 receptors), so with it being downregulated, less receptors means less protection from inflammation. </p>
<p>ACE2 is highly expressed in individuals with significant co-morbidities (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/222/4/556/5856139" target="_blank">https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/222/4/556/5856139</a>) in addition to another receptor <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-88944-8" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-88944-8</a>. High levels of ACE2, presumably, allow easier entrance and infection by sars-cov2. This then leads to a positive feedback loop of inflammation, resulting in the patients poor outcomes. Children, in addition to having higher levels of innate immune cells like phagocytes, also appear to have lower levels of ACE2 receptors in their nasopharynx. </p>
<p>Now, sorry this is long winded, but to the question. Adaptive immunity inhibits the innate immunity (which is a wide spread catch-all immune response) and has a much stronger, more controlled inflammatory response. If the pathogen has been seen before, the inflammatory response starts quicker and stronger, antibodies and killer T-cells activated quicker, and pathogen spread is contained to smaller areas. The stronger the antibody response, the less inflammation and the lower the spread. Upon first exposure, it depends on the viral load and the specificity of the antibodies. If, say, a low exposure to sars-cov2 occurred at first, then you may have less diverse antibodies and the body may not react strongly upond secondary exposure. But if the initial exposure was a high viral load and it translated into a large antibody response, then yes, secondary exposure would be greatly reduced. UNLESS antibodies made in the first round were against a part of the virus that mutated. Unlike vaccines which target very specific regions (in this case the spike protein that doesn't change very much), there can be larger changes to other parts of the virus that render native antibodies ineffective. Although that is still not very common. And lastly, if initial covid infection caused severe respiratory damage, it may lead to increased expression of the ACE2 receptors to decrease inflammation, leading to a higher risk on re-exposure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Random question, does this natural immunity stack with the vaccine, or does it not make much of a difference? Would someone who is fully vaccinated and previously had covid be slightly or significantly more protected than someone who'd been vaccinated but not had covid before?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes they would! Natural infection is an uncontrolled exposure to the virus, while the vaccine is a controlled exposure. Both are exposures to the viral antigens.</p>
<p>But then again ot completely depends on how severe the initial exposure was. Controlled exposure means we know or have a good indication what yje results will be. With natural exposure, it may or may not be adequate enough for durable immunity</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and it's possible that the vaccine will create an antibody that is different than the ones your body created when you have covid. </p>
<p>It's an additional layer of protection as it relates to viral recognition and mutation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So there’s a couple things here:</p>
<p>Some medical authorities have suggested spacing out the vaccine from other medical events so that cause and effect is easier to identify. I.e. if we overlap your COVID vaccination and your COVID infection and you develop a blood clot it’s harder to blame one specifically. </p>
<p>There’s generally been a thought not to vaccinate individuals when they are sick so your immune system can focus on a single thing. Making antibodies. (Although this is relatively speculative and not really backed by much evidence). And generally outside of a few fringe scenarios vaccination is never a pressing thing to get (outside of like a rabies exposure or Hep B exposure). So we have always aired on the side of caution. And some have brought this forward to Covid. </p>
<p>The real answer though is we don’t know how long to space natural infection and vaccination. There just simply isn’t evidence. And most health care professionals advice is based upon their professional expertise. Not on any true science. In recent medical history (in North America at least can’t speak for elsewhere in the world) there has never been a pressing need for urgent vaccination and we just don’t know the best way to prevent COVID. You can particularly see this as there are ongoing studies exploring third shots for protection against variants and for sustained immune responses. </p>
<p>In terms of how long natural immunity lasts to COVID data seems to show varying results. But anywhere from a couple months to upwards of a year. Immune systems are really complex. Admittedly as a pharmacist I have a rudimentary knowledge compared to an immunologist. And most medical textbooks really dumb down the immune system because it is very very very complex with lots of interacting factors. And that is to say how long your immunity lasts to natural infection will also be greatly affected by other medical conditions you have, age, genetics, lifestyle, and potentially factors we don’t really know about yet.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Instead, people who have been infected and recovered within the last 6 months count as immune.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not sure how long the initial immune response lasts. They want to make sure that you're not getting one very long covid exposure and instead getting two different exposures. Multiple re-exposures to a virus increase the efficacy of subsequent responses. Technically 2 weeks should be sufficient, but it's much better to wait at least 1 month to make sure.</p>
</li>
<li>Any other reasons I dunno.</li>
