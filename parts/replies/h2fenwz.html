			<div class="markdown"><p>Lots of reasons. If they were, they'd interact so easily with atomic matter.</p>
<p>Another main reason is conservation laws- charge is quantized (seems to come in integer multiples of a specific amount). Protons and electrons have the same charge, and reactions that produce neutrinos such as beta decay already account for all the charge in the products.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How can we be certain that what we call the elementary charge isn't more like (1 - 10^(-15)) e and the rest goes to the neutrino/antineutrino in the decay?<br />
Is this shown in other interactions, or can it be shown in the math regardless?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So this is a very subtle point, but it can be shown in the maths (at least, assuming right-handed neutrinos don't exist).</p>
<p>The fundamental reason is called <em>anomaly cancellation</em> - there are certain things that are symmetries of the Standard Model (and that's a big deal because the Standard Model is entirely based off of symmetries), that look like they might not survive to the full quantum theory. </p>
<p>For some - global symmetries - that's fine, it just means we have a broken symmetry, which is it's whole own interesting thing.</p>
<p>But if we have an anomalous <em>local</em> symmetry, it means we screwed up. Badly. So for us to have a consistent theory, we need all our local symmetries to be conserved. </p>
<p>There's then ways to show that one of these (the axial symmetry) corresponds to a certain set of Feynman diagrams (interactions), and we need the sum of those to all be 0. But they depend on the couplings (eg. charges) in very particular ways. Importantly, if right-handed neutrinos don't exist (and we don't strictly have any evidence that they do), then there are enough restrictions to put some heavy conditions on the charge of the electron and proton, and you can show that they <em>must</em> be exactly opposite.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are various theoretical extensions of the standard model that allow the neutrino to have a very small charge.</p>
<p>As an empirical matter, you can't be sure that the neutrinos you're seeing don't have a very small charge because there is always a limit to how small an interaction you can detect. But you can place an upper-bound on the charge.</p>
<p>There are an overwhelming number of experiments that rule out any neutrino charge larger than 1 millionth of the electron charge. There are many that rule out anything more than 1 billionth of the electron charge for all flavors. And there are some that go even smaller for particular neutrino flavors. For example, the strongest bound that I know of comes from very precise measurements of beta decay and the neutron charge. From these experiments we find that it must take at least 10^20 electron neutrinos to have the same charge as an electron.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One interesting thing is that if there were a magnetic monopole anywhere in the universe, charge would have to be quantized. While nobody has found a magnetic monopole, it's possible at least one exists or has existed. Presumably the fundamental charge (or 1/3 of it) is the minimum nonzero value charge can take.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other reasons to believe that neutrinos are perfectly neutral. It's possible that charge quantization has nothing to do with magnetic monopoles. Still, the fact that only one monopole has to exist to explain charge quantization makes me fairly confident we won't find any particles with near zero charge.</p></div>		</li>
