			<div class="markdown"><p>If I can tack on to this a bit, if you look at tendon and ligament tissue under a microscope, you see the cells embedded in a rubbery forest of collagen fibers. From my anatomy classes, I remember them looking like fish eyes. The collagen kinda walls off the cells, so they only get oxygen and dispose of waste products by whatever slowly seeps through, where as muscle tissue is full of tiny blood vessels that quickly oxygenate and flush waste from the cells. </p>
<p>I had the unfortunate experience of getting what's known as &quot;dry needling&quot; done to treat tennis elbow once, it's exactly what it sounds like, being repeatedly stabbed with a needle so that the bone and tendon bleeds, which increases blood flow and encourages healing and growth. It worked, but damn was that painful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, tendons are primarily collagen fibers which take around 180 days to “rebuild” if I remember correctly. Muscle fibers only take around 30 days. </p>
<p>Thus connective tissue takes about 6 times as long to strengthen compared to muscle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The blood doesn’t just carry viral clotting factors; the blood carries <em>everything</em> used for repair: the materials, the energy, the hormones, etc. Everything except the instructions, which are in the cells embedded within the extracellular matrix of the connective tissue.</p></div>		</li>
