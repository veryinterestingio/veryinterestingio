			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually uncertainty doesn't need to be considered.  A milliwatt of visible light is a tremendous number of photons per second, and the fact that &quot;rain is made of droplets&quot; is not readily apparent nor even measurable.</p>
<p>But once the intensity gets into a very low magnitude, you run into the scenario of discrete-hits of individual photons.  The quantum uncertainty isn't necessarily a measurable effect here, just common probability of photon quanta hits.  </p>
<p>Like the chance of a sq in plate getting hit by a raindrop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I would argue that uncertainty is analogous to wavelike nature of light. And from that regard is responsible for your lack of perfect collimation. If there was no uncertainty, the objects we call photons would by default be particle-like only and could achieve absolutes - perfect direction and momentum. Uncertainty reflects the wavelike nature of light (though I hate the term as it implies lack of knowledge, not an inherent property of the object). </p>
<p>They really should have called it the complementary principle, as it applies to basic wave mechanics outside of quantum mechanics- signal processing etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm confused at the current top comment's last diagram. I thought that at least after a focusing lens, the &quot;sides&quot; of the beam converged or diverged to/from the waist in a linear way. Does that make sense? </p>
<p>In the diagram above, it's showing more of a hyperbola. Is this true or am I misunderstanding something?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hyperbola.  Here's why.</p>
<p>You've probably seen a diagram like the &quot;stopped down aperture&quot; here:</p>
<p><a href="https://photographylife.com/what-is-focus-shift" target="_blank">https://photographylife.com/what-is-focus-shift</a></p>
<p>This is a &quot;perfect&quot; situation, where the beam angle coming through the laser output photon's angle is exactly sin(distance from center* a constant), so they converge at the same point.  </p>
<p>Rather, whether coming out of the laser emitter itself or a lens, the angle of the photon won't be perfectly in line with expectation.  All are slightly at a higher or lower angle than perfect.  Thus they can't converge at exactly the same point.</p>
<p>The &quot;wide open aperture&quot; shot is not exactly what I'm saying.  I'm saying, that bottom red ray- it's shown passing through the highest point on that green focal plane.  Well, SOME of the rays passing through the bottom point are at a shallower angle from the beam center, and pass through the lowest spot on the green focal plane.  You don't get an <em>exact</em> angle based on where it leaves the source based on radius.</p></div>		</li>
