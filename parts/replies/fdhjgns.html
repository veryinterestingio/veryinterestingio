			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the tranquilliser is a mix of hormones, such as, but not limited to, endorphin, serotonin, and in limited amounts also oxytocin, and we have yet to understand what the (side)effects of these are <em>individually</em>. Let alone collectively and in varying degrees. </p>
<p>Also, as far as I'm aware, you can't just shoot up pure endorphin. You have to shoot up an agent that makes the brain release the stuff. Examples of such agents are morphine, heroin (a more potent form of morphine), and opium‚Äîin other words: drugs with, in turn, major side effects such as practically guaranteed addiction and, you know, the deaths.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, you basically only die because your brain forgets to breathe. Technically speaking, opioids are some of the least toxic chemicals you can put into your body, and I'm not sure there's an upper limit to how much you can safely take as long as you have something that can breathe for you.</p>
<p>The main issue then, becomes the constipation.</p>
<p>Note: If you ever find anyone who appears to be dying of overdose on an opioid and they still have a pulse, you <strong>can</strong> breathe for them to keep them alive until further help can arrive. No need for chest compressions like in typical CPR.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Guaranteed&quot; is misleading. Opioids can obviously be dangerous, but <a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/opioids/opioid-overdose-crisis" target="_blank">8 to 12 percent</a> is far from certainty. That's prescription drugs - obviously morphine, diamorphine (heroin) and pure opium are likely to be different. </p>
<p>That being said, a lot of the deaths are due to, well, overdose. Properly dosed they can have complications (as others have said) but generally not just straight out death. I know that seems silly (and obvious), but when looking at things like Safe Injection Sites or <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/2015/05/the-case-for-prescription-heroin/" target="_blank">Prescription Heroin</a>, it kind of puts the whole &quot;we make drugs illegal for your safety&quot; thing in a different light.</p>
<p>Sorry for the digression.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But is it true? What's the tranquiliser? The one that sends you to sleep is <em>used up</em> through the night, which is why you'll wake up. If your body kept making tranquiliser, you'd just stay asleep.</p></div>		</li>
