<p>If you want to move all your crops, you'd have to sell them at discount. By destroying a sizeable portion of your harvest, you're saving yourself the task of processing and having to move all that extra merchandise for, in the end, a similar amount of profit.</p>
<p>Companies / Corporations goal isn't to create jobs. It's to make the biggest amount of profit as efficiently as possible.</p>
<p>If it involves wasting food, then so be it.</p>
<p>I'm not advocating for these practices. I'm simply pointing out a well established mechanism. </p>
<p>A way to incentivise companies to not torch their fields would be to reward companies generating less food waste. Generally these rewards would be through tax credits. Even then, most of the time, companies torching their fields aren't selling their merchandise locally, they're exporting it to the western world. It's quite hard to tell a third world country to create less food waste when western countries are the ones drinking the Kool-Aid.</p>
<p>As for government backed workers. It wouldn't be an acceptable solution in most countries. Either the workforce is paid by the government to the profit of corporations which would sell the product or the government opens up shop to sell what they moved. (Obviously they'd have to buy to crops from the corporation)</p>
<p>Also, creating jobs for the sole purpose of creating jobs doesn't work in capitalism. The demand has to grow. </p>
<p>The only &quot;kind of&quot; exception to this would be the construction sector. The government can actively control some of the demand in that sector. When we hit a brick wall and the economy is down the drain, giving out shitton of contracts for infrastructure creation / renovation does help. Construction companies will buy steel, alluminum, concrete, stone, wood and bunch of other stuff which is mostly (very soft mostly) made locally. This injects money in the system and all the employees (from the steel mill guy to the trucker lady) receiving their salaries will spend money  in the nations businesses. This helps create demand and ultimately kickstart the economy. </p>
<p>Sorry for that last bit, you got me going. </p>
<p>Essentially, there's an equilibrium in our market. Private entreprises know what to gun for. They'll aim for the best profit / effort ratio they can. The government can't do anything without strongly intervening in the economy. Alot of people don't like when it does. </p>
<p>They're addicted to the Kool-Aid that was poured for them by the S&amp;P 500s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know the exact causes but a few that I can contribute</p>
<p>1: Farmer's insurance to keep prices stables even during a downturn. This is because once a farmer goes down under, that land tends to stop being used for farming = more crops being out during a good economy = less crops. This makes it so most Farmers can survive during a downturn and better during an upturn.</p>
<p>If there is really little demand, and the farmers all flood potatoes into a supermarket (when much of those crops were suppose to head towards hotels and restaurants, or processed foods) it will cause the price of potatoes to drop down dramatically...... this is a bad scenario because all the farmers that depended on potatoes as part of their income will soon find out that once the economy gets back up, the price of their crop will still be very low and not worth growing.</p>
<p>We see part of this scenario play out during the Great Depression when it came to crops.</p>
<p>2: The supply chain has been messed up, places that farmers depend on for income for everything from: Restaurants, Hotels, Supermarkets, and large social gatherings may have been hit. So less trucks of those crops are being needed or used because it is cheaper to burn than to rent a large loading truck to send it somewhere.</p>
<p>3: There are some programs, that takes some of those resources and switch it to a free meal program during the summer (a lot of k-12 students are eligible to just to to a school or local gathering place to receive free food.)</p>
<p>I don't know what other government programs are out there.</p>
<hr />
<p>Basically, keep Agriculture from feeling the effects of price fluctuation due to outside forces like the economy, and prevent current farmland from turning into something else (as once it turns to something else.... there is very little chance it will revert back to a farmland.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed, that has happened with corn. Because there was a consistent surplus of corn (largely due to federal subsidies), new uses were developed for it rather than just getting rid of it. It became HFCS, animal feed, and plastic and ethanol feedstock.</p></div>		</li>
