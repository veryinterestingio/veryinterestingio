			<div class="markdown"><p>If by &quot;stuffed up&quot; you mean runny it's because the hole that's in the corner of your eye is not, as many believe, where the tears come from. It is actually where the tears drain and it's basically the entrance to a tube that runs through your nostril. When there is an excess of tears and they can't drain fast enough you will have an excess of tears coming out of your nose as well as spilling over and running down your face.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Makes sense now! I think mine does get too stuffy though, like it's backed up in there hahaha. I don't cry often but when I do it's like floodgates. I hate it and it makes me angry, like great now I'm crying and incredibly annoyed by my own body. </p></div>		</li>
