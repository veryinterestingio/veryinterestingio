			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm in Zoloft and Wellbutrin, and my libido has never been lower. I have absolutely NO desire to fuck. EVER. </p>
<p>It works for me now because I'm not seeing anyone and I'm so busy with work and school that sex would only be a distraction...but I worry about what will happen after I graduate next year. These meds are actually working for me, with relatively few side effects, and the thought of playing Russian Roulette with a bunch of other stuff is scary. </p>
<p>I basically feel like I have to choose between a sex life and my mental well-being.</p>
<p>EDIT: For those of you saying antidepressants should not be used long term, please understand that, for many people who suffer from depression, the <a href="http://www-psychiatrist-com.ezproxy.uky.edu/JCP/article/Pages/2010/v71e01/v71e0102.aspx?sclick=1" target="_blank">chances of a relapse are extremely high.</a> Many are able to use A.D.s as a way to help them get over a bump in the road, or may be fortunate enough to only experience depression for a short time in their lives. Some are not. </p>
<p>I have had depression for nearly 20 years. During that time, I have tried talk therapy, diet and exercise, and trying to &quot;power through it.&quot; While the former two have become an indispensable part of my treatment, the gaps when I have been off medication (for as long as several years) have only resulted in relapsing and falling back into that impenetrable fog that many of us know all too well. Please do more research before telling someone to get off their medication--you are not their doctor, and you are not them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same. Zoloft. Formerly Wellbutrin (absolutely no effect or side effects whatsoever. Placebo would have been more effective) and Effexor.</p>
<p>Effexor made the biggest dent in depression. There were times I felt downright normal. The sexual dysfunction was mostly anorgasmia (difficulty reaching orgasm - I'm a man btw.)</p>
<p>Most men would say YEAH AWESOME I CAN LAST FOREVER IN BED.  That's not what it means. When I'd reach climax it was like drip drip because I had to kind of will myself to get there. So I went off of it.</p>
<p>The come down from Effexor though. Wow. It was like a scene from trainspotting when I decided to stop taking it. Even if I missed 2 days in a row. It's effective but never stop taking it. It'll wreck you.</p>
<p>Zoloft has turned my sex drive clean off. I can reach orgasm but I have absolutely no interest in doing so. Even basic touching like rubbing my back. No thanks. I have gone so long without orgasm that I've actually introduced prostate problems from it swelling. Crazy stuff.</p>
<p>Nothing's helped get it back. Viagra has a little but it's more mental than physical. </p>
<p>What's strange though is I've developed this overwhelming desire to just look at attractive people. Like wow, her hair is perfect. Nothing perverted just like wow, what a case study in being attractive that person is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Going off Effexor actually destroyed my life. Lost my career, developed a chronic pain condition, got extremely depressed and have never gotten back to the level of functioning that I used to be. Even though I went back on Effexor after about a year off of it. Doesn’t work as well as it used to. </p>
<p>Literally the worst decision of my life. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Coming off Effexor was wild. I started taking meds for depression when I was 13 (I'm 33 now) and have tried a lot of different drugs because nothing really helps. I'd always come off meds no problem, but when I came off effexor last winter...holy shit. I was so tempted to just start taking it again, even though it made me feel very flat, so that I would stop feeling sick. It took close to 3 weeks for the withdrawal symptoms to ease up. I am struggling with depression now but after that (and taking every class of antidepressant besides MAOIs over the years with no relief) I am just not willing to try a new med right now. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are some pretty benign medications that can reduce sexual side effects of reuptake inhibitors. <strong>Buspirone</strong> (Buspar), for example, is an anti-anxiety medication that never really worked too well for anxiety; it can work wonders for sexual functioning though.</p>
<p>It's an off-label use that's not publicized too well because no one's making money off of the patent anymore.</p>
<p>Mention it to your psychiatrist: it's not scheduled, cheap, has a nominal side effect profile, and comes in multi-scored tablets so you can adjust the dose yourself until you start to notice the effect.</p>
<p>You may be ok with the reduced libido without an SO but it may ultimately prevent you from finding one, which is one of the most consistently-proven protections against suicide and certain aspects of depression.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was going to recommend Buspirone as well. I just added it on to Celexa a few months ago, and it seems to be slowly helping raise my baseline mood as well. It's still too soon to say whether or not it's going to solve all of side effects Celexa caused (slight weight gain, etc.) as I haven't reached the ideal dosage my psychiatrist wants me on, but I've noticed some positive effects even only taking 15 mg 2x/day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>dude, you are making me cry.</p>
<p>I've been on Zoloft for 5 years. 18 years ago I went through suicidal-hospitalized levels of depression. Medicated with Lexapro, therapy.. going back to school.. I got better. Went off the medicine. I've had 'relapses' a couple of times between these events, and revisited Lexapro.. but wasn't getting much benefit from it - and the depression never got as bad.. (Actually a few of those instances caused suicidal thoughts too. I know it was the medicine because as soon as I stopped the Lexapro I leveled out back to sanity, again.)</p>
<p>Then my Mom died.. and I saw myself sliding right back into depression.. right into the same bonkers batshit crazy I had been in, in my 20's. Doctor and I agreed, let's try medicine again.. but we decided to try Zoloft instead.. as it's also suppose to help with anxiety. Am sane, for the most part. Now life is just depression with small periods of non-depression.</p>
<p>I have had no sex drive in years. I was kind of contributing it to just now being in my 30's and depression. My boyfriend just asked for some time apart yesterday.. because I don't want to have sex. He's young and has wants and needs he tells me.. and I hurt him because he's perceiving it as me not wanting him.</p>
<p>And no matter what I tell him, he's convinced it's because I'm not interested in him. I am interested. I just.. can't get into it. Obviously not a great explanation from his perspective. It hurts so much because he's otherwise an excellent guy in all respects and I'm lucky to have/had(..?) him.</p>
<p>Fuck depression. Why does it take everything away from me.</p>
<p>Edit: Before I get more replies along the lines of &quot;just give him sex anyways&quot; - we tried that. He needs me to want it, want his body. He needs that emotional connection to go along with the physical.</p>
<p>I even tried to fake it, despite being the world's worst actor. Now when I try even simple hugs and kisses he tells me he feels like it's all pretend. If all he needed was the physical part, I'd be more then happy to let him find a fuck buddy. I'm not opposed to an open relationship, especially if that gives him what he needs. What he needs is my enthusiastic desire to jump his bones.. and I'm damned if I do with the medication and damned if I don't without it.</p>
<p>I mean, it's just hard on the heart to know you're bad for the man you love and you have to let him go.. for his sake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m actually in a similar situation. My wife suffers a very mild depression, and believe a low libido regardless which obviously means I’m cut off. I try not to let it get to me because I know it’s not that she doesn’t love me, is cheating, or that she isn’t attracted to me, it’s just depression but sometimes that voices gets to going and I drag myself down and start overly criticizing myself looking for flaws or ways to fix it because as her husband, that’s what I do. I fix things. And when I can’t, I feel like I’ve failed, even when it’s not really anybody’s fault.</p>
<p>That voice can just start whispering self doubt in your ear and it just kind of tears you down. We talk about it every now and then, but I’ve told her before I’d prefer to go without than faking it because then I just feel like I’m using her and it wouldn’t matter who it was and it almost feels a little rapey. And that’s not true, as much as I’m in to the physical, I need the emotional, I want her to enjoy it with me. Buuut sadly that’s just not gonna work very often at all. Once every few months maybe? Regardless, it’s hard sometimes but that’s my wife so I ain’t going anywhere.</p>
<p>Sorry I can’t offer any sort of advice or solution. Just wanted to share the guy perspective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know exactly how you feel. My most recent breakup was basically the same situation. I’ve recently weened off of my Zoloft and I’m trying life without it for the last month or two, for the first in about 8 years. I’m already noticing a huge difference in drive, but my head isn’t quite right. I’m quite emotional with everything. I’m planning to see the doc to discuss it in the next week or so (soon as I get paid) and I’m in no danger. I just don’t feel “right”. </p>
<p>All I’m saying I guess is, you’re not alone in how you feel. It’s rough trying to balance feeling good in all arenas of life. Just try not to be too hard on yourself if you can. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Neuroscientist here.  This is screamingly incorrect on so many levels I can't adequately address it at this time.  Suffice it to say that whoever gave you this explanation of the neurobiology of depression did not know what they were talking about.  Even if they were an MD.

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't really know exactly what he meant but I may be able to clarify a little. One of the earlier modern theories of depression was called the <em>monoamine theory of depression</em>  or the <em>monoamine hypothesis of depression</em>. Some scientists developed an interest in this herb that Indians had been using forever to treat disease. They isolated the chemical and started using it as an anti-hypertensive. They called it reserpine (like <em>serpent</em>—the herb was called snakeroot). Lo and behold it did wonders for hypertension, but some patients developed marked depression. It was discovered that reserpine depleted neurotransmitters and, so, the theory that depression is caused by depleted neurotransmitters (monoamines) was born. Normal serotonin=normal, low serotonin=depressed. The problem is that there are a crazy amount of holes in the explanatory power of this theory. For one, reserpine itself was (ironically) later found to be an effective<em> antidepressan</em>t. If the monoamine hypothesis (serotonin=happy) were true you'd expect to be able to reliably reproduce certain effects or observations. None of them are really reliable at all. E.g., you can deplete a person's serotonin down to basically nothing and a lot of people don't feel depressed at all. Turns out this theory was a step in the right direction, but an extreme oversimplification of a complex disease. The truth is we don't have a great understanding of depression works or why serotonergic medications work. We know what they do (SSRIs largely stop a protein—SERT—on the neuron from sucking serotonin back into the cell), but we don't know how that aids depression... chances are it's not just by having extra serotonin floating around.</p>
<p>Secondly: SSRIs <em>don't</em> work that well for most people. They save a lot of people's lives, but we don't yet know how to tease out those specific people who benefit from them. For the majority of patients there's only a modest decrease in measures of depression. Those one or two points can be statistically significant (meaning they aren't due to random chance) but the size of the effect is small and, especially recently, there have been calls to reevaluate the widespread use of SSRIs considering the seriousness of the side effects and the inability for anyone to document a meaningful change from placebo in measures of depressive symptoms. If you had a blood pressure medication that caused crazy side effects and only decreased most people's blood pressure by a few points, no one would use it. The dearth of effective psychiatric treatments has left this space where the normal risk-benefit calculus is kinda thrown out the window, unfortunately for everyone. </p></div>		</li>
