<p>The same day I was describing sensory arrangements unusual to mammals, this scientist reported research which indicates humans might be breathing through their anuses (in hospital settings) soon. As whacky as it sounds, it's also poignant because he was inspired to investigate this after watching covid patients around the world struggle to breath amid shortages of ventilators or compressed oxygen.</p>

<p>Also learned that turtles switch between breathing through noses and anuses seasonally!</p></div>		</li>
