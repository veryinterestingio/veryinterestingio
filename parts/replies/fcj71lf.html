			<div class="markdown"><p>Well your main assumption, that it is about the method, and not the person, is wrong. It has been shown in studies, that there is not significant difference in effectiveness between many methods in average, but that there is a significant difference from one therapeut to the next. The biggest influence was, how the patient judged the quality of the relationship to the therapist. So OPs question makes a lot of sense. Aka is a therapeutic approach important at all, or is it better to talk to someone with which the patient can just get along/ open up great</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got the impression OP's question was more about whether there's evidence a licensed pro is actually better at therapy than a random person in a therapist role. Honestly I'd really like to know that too (even if I misunderstood OPs question).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In order to be licensed as a therapist in the US, a person must attain a significant degree of education beyond what a layperson is likely to come upon in the normal course of life.  The degree conferred is generally a Masters of some flavor or another.  They must also spend hundreds of hours as an intern working directly in the role of therapist under the supervision of at least one licensed and experienced therapist.  None of this confers magical powers; instead, it offers the trained therapist two things.  First, they have knowledge of and exposure to the various therapeutic techniques which have demonstrated positive results in studies, as well as knowledge which will assist in diagnosing the would-be patient.  Second, they have significant experience using the training and techniques against a much larger patient set.  All that this <em>really</em> does is make the trained therapist more likely to select and correctly execute useful therapeutic techniques compared to the layperson.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought so too, but I'm also wondering about other variables. Like, do you actually have to visit the psychiatrist to have a benefit from them or can the same value be transmitted over skype or a telephone call, for example? Additionally, if you're reading a book, is there any evidence that that's a better idea than listening to the same material in audio form? What if you were to watch a video where somebody spoke to you (but not in real-time)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another aspect is efficacy versus effectiveness. An efficacious technique produces the desired result in controlled research settings. If that therapeutic effect is preserved when they attempt to implement that program outside of the research settings (in clinical practices), it is said to have effectiveness. </p>
<p>Of course I’m not saying that comparing a trained therapist to a random person would answer that (because that wouldn’t really make sense), but it’s another factor to take into consideration</p></div>		</li>
