			<div class="markdown"><p>While I also want to see research it is interesting that you asked them for citation but not commentator for above claim that.</p>
<p>My point is there isn't enough research in this area and we need to push for more, we take stuff for granted even thou no research support it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Link <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jul/26/rule-patients-must-finish-antibiotics-course-wrong-study-says" target="_blank">here</a>. That's not the original study, it's an article about a study from the British Medical Journal.</p>
<p>According to them, it's only important to finish the entire course for certain diseases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While there is research pointing towards shorter antibiotic courses, it is still best to finish the recommended course of antibiotics the doctor prescribes instead of arbitrarily deciding on a shorter course. The drug may not be finished working even if you are feeling better, and stopping early may lead to treatment failure. So, OP’s friend is still wrong. </p>
<p>This research is already impacting the guidelines. Wait for the science to determine the optimal duration, don’t take these decisions into your own hands! </p>
<p>Also, while I am ranting, next time you see a doctor for an infectious illness, ask if it is most likely viral or bacterial and DO NOT TAKE ANTIBIOTICS FOR VIRAL ILLNESSES! Doctors feel pressure to give people something if they come in sick, which leads to lots of overprescribing of antibiotics.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The study I was thinking of specifically <em>is</em> about quitting when you feel better rather than taking the entire duration, not about the idea that doctors might be prescribing for too long a duration in the first place.</p></div>		</li>
