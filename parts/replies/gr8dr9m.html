			<div class="markdown"><p>u/GeodeathiC Finding a way to differentiate our product without running afoul of FDA by making reference to disease conditions was certainly *a* point of the study, but it was hardly the whole point. We believe in cannabinoids and want to develop a better understanding of the relationship between consumption and effect, but discussions around efficacy tend to gloss over the relationship between circulating blood levels and induced effect. But you can’t feel what you don’t absorb. This study focused on the threshold question of how much CBD do products actually deliver into the bloodstream. As this study demonstrates, traditional oil-based tinctures and isolate-based products are very bad at that, and water-soluble products run the gamut from “much better” to “worlds better” in terms of delivering bioactives into the blood. That’s really important information for someone who’s expecting an effect (whatever that effect may be) from CBD products.</p></div>		</li>
