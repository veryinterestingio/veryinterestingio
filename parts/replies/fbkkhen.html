			<div class="markdown"><p>The last time I drank orange juice, a giant canker sore formed on my uvula and it was the most painful thing I've ever been through. It looked like 1/4 of the uvula was just eaten away or something. I was unable to eat solid food for two weeks and relied mostly on Soylent. Each swallow, burp, sound out of my mouth felt like razor blades.</p>
<p>I still have a picture of that motherfucker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me it was foods, but not very acidic ones. Specifically it's raw tomatoes, walnuts, kiwis and pineapples, and cooked bell peppers. It has gotten better over the last few years, likely mainly because I've started avoiding those foods (except for the exceptional craving for tomatoes because in summer those suckers just get sooo damn delicious...).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thatâ€™s interesting, Iâ€™ve never heard of walnuts, kiwis, or cooked bell pepper. I would have thought it would be raw pepper. The main rule of thumb I stick to is if itâ€™s red, yellow, or orange, thereâ€™s a good chance itâ€™ll contribute to sores.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kiwis and pineapples contain enzymes that break down proteins, eating too much will cause sores in anyone. You may be especially sensitive to these enzymes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually all those are quite common where I live. Walnuts are a nut from a walnut tree; they're sometimes cracked by hand and eaten whole, but are also often added to baked goods, like muffins, chocolate chip cookies, or banana bread. I don't know where kiwis come from, but they're a fruit with fuzzy skin and a soft green pulp inside; they're often served in slices, like as part of a fruit tray. Cooked bell pepper is just a raw bell pepper that's cooked - that one's easy!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Raw tomatoes are quite acidic, same as kiwi and pineapple. Pineapple also has some enzymes that &quot;digest&quot; meat so they worsen mouth ulcers. About nuts, basically they are hard foods so they &quot;scratch&quot; the ulcer superficial area, also worsening them.
So yeah, avoid specially when you feel stressed or run down etc</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I would understand your point about nuts, which is why I can't really eat nice french bread when I have canker sores. But I swear that eating walnuts (specifically) CAUSES my canker sores to appear. I'd eat one and can feel them appearing 5-10 minutes later.</p>
<p>And I grew up with a walnut tree in the backyard - needless to say I had plenty of opportunity to figure this trigger out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I still remember at one specific point in highschool I had no less than 16 of them in my mouth at one time. I was always prone to them, but that was ridiculous. I believe that time that bunch was mainly brought on by stress. It was horrible - couldnâ€™t eat, breath, talk, even swallow saliva without it being incredibly painful.</p></div>		</li>
