Schizophrenia is characterized by the inability to organize thoughts, this leads to the inability to determine what is real and what is not. Sometimes this can manifest as voices in your head, but not all patients affected by schizophrenia hear voices. They may just believe that there's someone out to get them, or there's some grand conspiracy against them.</p>
<p>Regardless, we don't yet have a full understanding of the biological underpinnings of schizophrenia, so it's hard to say what it's <em>caused</em> by.</p></div>		</li>
