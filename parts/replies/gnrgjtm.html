			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this even if you have a heat pump to move heat inside it has to move twice as much heat to bring the temperature from 10° up to 70° as it takes to move the temperature from 100° down to 70°  so even a more efficient heat pump is running twice as much to achieve the same comfort level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see. Honestly I know very little about heat pumps but I figured there must be some reason why nobody uses them in very cold climates</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this even more, the Texas power grid is largely NOT connected to the national grid, making it harder to get power where it needs to go to help ease the strain on the Texas power plants. Currently, the state is a victim of it's own legislation and the people are suffering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn’t totally correct. The peak demand still hasn’t reached summer peaks, so the capacity exists in theory. The bigger issue is that Texas expects its peak in the summer so they plan routine maintenance on many of their coal and nuclear plants in the winter. Some of those plants were offline and unable to respond to the increase in demand. But the demand hasn’t reached summer levels yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really a factor here. ERCOT peak record, as of May 2020, was 74,820 MW in the middle of summer. Their forecast this year, and presumably capacity, is 78,299 MW. Again, this is summer peak load.</p>
<p>So far, our peak winter load record was just beat at 69,150 MW. Plenty of capacity left until over 30,000 MW of supply was removed from the grid as thermal generator facilities failed. That's when the blackouts started</p></div>		</li>

<p>The grid can pull from other close regions, but if all the regions have the same issue then you are stuck without power.  That's all of Texas for a second day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Isn't the issue that Texas' grid is isolated from the others in the region? And wasn't that done, in part, so they wouldn't have to abide by federal regulations which would have required them to winterize/freeze-proof their power plants?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Texas has a separate grid which is interconnected with the other grids by HVDC (high voltage direct current). What this means is that the grid is not &quot;synchronous&quot; with the other grids i.e. the AC voltage doesn't move up and down together throughout the grid and means the AC frequency can vary independently in each grid. HVDC is relatively complicated technology compared to regular old transmission lines so the size of the interconnections is likely smaller than it would have been if Texas was part of another grid.</p>
<p>There are three grids in the US - the Eastern grid, the Western grid and the Texas grid. Historically transmission grids started separately in each city and over time got unified at the state and the national levels. I'm not sure of the exact reason why Texas chose not to integrate, but it is not the case that they separated from an existing grid. I don't think being on a separate grid frees you from national standards - but it may insulate you from the grid operator's standards.</p>
<p>Edit: The Eastern and Western grids are separated by the Rockies and also include most of Canada: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_power_transmission_grid#/media/File:NERC-map-en.svg" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North\_American\_power\_transmission\_grid#/media/File:NERC-map-en.svg" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North\_American\_power\_transmission\_grid#/media/File:NERC-map-en.svg</a></a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does free you from national standards and regulations  as they are not subject to the commerce clause as the power companies are not conducting in Interstate commerce. There was a moment where they accidentally imported from Oklahoma very briefly and it was a big deal because it would have made them subject to the various power acts that Congress enacted during the New Deal.</p>
<p>Its why they prefer to import from Mexico because its a loophole that doesnt let them get federal regulations</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My co worker said this unironically. She said it's a good thing that Texas has a separate power grid because it's their right to secede from the union, etc. Also, she buys into the article that wind power freezing was the major contributor even though it's barely 10% of their power generation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All those natural gas and coal plants work by generating steam from burning coal or natural gas.  This requires close monitoring of water levels, steam flows, and lots of instruments controlling those variables.  Those instruments are prone to freezing up and not controlling properly when it is too cold.  Similar operating facilities in cold weather climates put a lot of effort into &quot;winterization&quot; basically ensuring that stuff won't freeze up when it gets too cold.</p></div>		</li>
