			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, thousands of people who travelled to Florida for Spring Break just at the cusp of a severe pandemic outbreak... the virus doesnâ€™t need to be in an ideal environment to spread when a bunch of morons make such easy environments for it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's thanks to thousands of people packing tightly together allowing for incredibly easy and rapid transmission. You see this a lot with major conventions actually, where attendees have a much higher rate of infection than the average population at that time. The 'con flu' is something a lot of regulars try to prepare for, and bodies like the CDC have been trying to spread awareness about for a few years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about areas that have very dry but hot weather? Is the virus able to transmit easily under those conditions? I am wondering because generally where I live, humidity peaks in the winter and reaches a low in the summer, although I'm probably thinking of relative humidity so I'm not sure how it works with absolute humidity.</p></div>		</li>
