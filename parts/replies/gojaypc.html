			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, in Europe we have a brand name Ad Blue, all trucks and most modern diesels are equipped with it. As far as I understand it’s urea and when exposed to a catalyst, urea converts nitrous oxydes found in diesel exhausts into carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, hang on. For years now I could swear I sometimes get an ammonia smell around diesel cars (when running).
Could this be because of the exhaust turning into Ammonia and not all of it being turned into nitrogen &amp; water before exiting the exhaust?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work at a urea plant, it’s definitely not pee. It’s anhydrous ammonia and co2 put through a multistage high pressure reactor with a specific residence time to form first carbamate, then urea. It’s then cut with water and filtered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>2012, I think. The US started mandating DEF starting in 2013. At least, for my manufacturer, that's when we started. I like it, honestly. I can have a truck idle in the shop all day if I want, and it isn't unbearable. 5 minutes with an older or deleted truck is like hell burning your lungs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't stand the smell of diesel exhaust with the DEF. I love it when it doesn't have it. But I guess that's the farmboy talking.</p>
<p>Also, from my experience, all the emissions stuff (including DEF) has made diesel engines less reliable. The 7.3 powerstroke and 5.9 12 valve cummins were practically indestructible, while I can speak from experience (I work at a Ford dealership) that the 6.7 powerstrokes are in the shop quite a bit (don't get me started on the 6.4's)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Cummins has come a long way for us. We don't really see a lot of issues with them. Typically, we see the issues when someone runs the tank of def dry.</p>
<p>I don't enjoy the smell either, but having a non-def truck running in the shop for a while sucks bad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really does make a huge difference. I work on school busses, and you can come and go out of the garage with them and barely notice. There’s a couple we have that are pre emissions and even with the overhead fans on they stink the shop up just pulling in. There’s also a truck with an old two stroke Detroit, now that thing fucking stinks. Sounds great, but even with the doors open and the fans it still smells dirty as hell.</p></div>		</li>
