			<div class="markdown"><p>Ive read about something similar but I don't think you can put it like that, it's not like we would sleep from 14:00 pm to 18:00 then from 3:00 am to 9:00 for instance. It is natural to think that the main sleep bulk has to be done during the dark hours, because we don't see in darkness. The thing is that there should be no problem with sleeping five hours, then wake up for let's say one hour, check everything is ok, get some water and food, think about next day, back to sleep for 4 hours. ( That's more or less what I've read about it) I guess you meant this, not like sleeping 4 hours of daylight would be much advantage?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We actually did adapt for 8 hours of sleep, more or less depending on age. Ending your sleep at the end of REM stage will make you feel super groggy. How Rem phases is work is that when you sleep you go in and out of REM. The first REM stage doesn't happen until after maybe 20 minutes. You can get a good powernap in. If you nap longer, you will feel like crap UNLESS you time your wake up right after a REM phase ended.</p>
<p>Anyways, each Rem phase gets progressively longer, and we get all of our rem within 8 hours of sleep. During Rem, our muscles grow, our brains are refreshed, ....Many good things happen during Rem, and it is vitally important to get 8 hours of sleep to live a healthy life. </p>
<p>To relate to the post,  this guy probably has a bad schedule. I work 10 hours a day in a warehouse and exercise,  eat a lot, and my sleep schedule is fine. Also, its winter so i doubt many people are getting their correct amount of vitamin D. Most people dont realize that is a huge problem in developed countries. People don't bathe in the sun, and then people end up being depressed, groggy,  unenergetic.</p></div>		</li>
