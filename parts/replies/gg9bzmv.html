<p>Complicated QCD bound states with three valence quarks. The quarks are strongly interacting with each other, and described by quantum field theory. They're not discrete spheres at fixed locations. Their positions are not well-defined.</p>

<p>Similar, although it's even more complicated inside a nucleon. Because non-relativistic quantum mechanics doesn't work very well for studying nucleon structure, you really need quantum field theory.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Although I love reading about physics, it's really hard for me to understand how something that exists and can be measured have a hard-to-define position. How can we not know where is the particle? It's lack of more precise equipment or a physical condition unknown to physics so far?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Up and down quarks have masses of 2 and 4.8 MeV. A proton or neutron has a mass of 938 MeV. This means that almost the entire mass of the proton (or neutron) is not in the quarks, but in the binding energy of the quarks. </p>
<p>When you get down to the quantum scale, human intuition no longer serves to help understand things unfortunately. This doesn’t mean it’s incomprehensible, rather it means it doesn’t make sense in how everyday objects work. Rules are just different on the quantum scale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Before you can answer that question in any scientific fashion, you have to define what you mean by &quot;well-defined position.&quot;  And that opens up an incredible can of worms in its own right; it's really more of a philosophical question than a scientific one.  If you mean &quot;exactly-defined position,&quot; /u/1XRobot is correct, that's not a thing.</p>
<p>I imagine that for your purposes, it's probably easier to work at it via limits.  A single molecule - perhaps even a very large one like DNA, though I'm not sure on that one - is definitely too small.  An object we normally think of as very small, like a biological cell, is big enough for practical purposes.  The answer you're looking for almost certainly lies somewhere in between.  But there's no precise answer, in part because you're not asking a question that has meaning in a scientific context.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look up de Broglie wave length. Massive stuff has negligible wave lengths, for instance entire atoms are quite well-described as point particles, especially heavier ones. An electron, on the contrary, has a de Broglie wave length of about 0.1 nm, which is roughly a typical bond length between atoms. That's a rough measure of how 'smeared' it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on how you define well-defined. If an object is large enough its position is certain enough to where its uncertainty is entirely irrelevant, in which case I'd argue its well defined.</p></div>		</li>
