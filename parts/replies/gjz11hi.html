Frequent urination is a side effect of elevated blood glucose as your kidneys are trying to filter out the excess glucose. Sleep deprivation raises hormones like cortisol and adrenaline which promote higher breakdown of glycogen (stored glucose) in the muscles and liver which keeps your blood glucose higher. In summary, poor sleep elevates blood sugar due to hormones and high blood sugar promotes frequent urination.</p></div>		</li>
