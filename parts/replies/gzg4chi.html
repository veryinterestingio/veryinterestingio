			<div class="markdown"><p>My Catholic grade school used this ridiculous fucking grading system that had literally no rhyme or reason: 2=A, 4=B, 1=C, 3=D, 6=F. And if you got a red 6, god help you. There was a 5 that was rarely used and I can‚Äôt remember what it was for.</p>
<p>I never heard any explanation for why they used that system, and I can‚Äôt imagine they still use it. I graduated from there in 1983.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your parenthetical addition is the answer. The ESNU system - and those similar were more popularly used by schools that graded children than the letter grade system we now know as the &quot;American system.&quot;</p>
<p>At the time ABCDF was gaining in popularity, &quot;E&quot; was already understood to be a top mark. Creating a situation were &quot;E&quot; could mean &quot;Excellent&quot; or &quot;Failure&quot; would have been silly and confusing.</p>
<p>Fun fact: ESNU was originally for evaluating employee performance in the manufacturing of shoes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also silly and confusing: not grading 1-10.</p>
<p>10 = perfect </p>
<p>5 = average/mediocre</p>
<p>Then just come up with a minimum passing grade. It could be a 5 (like you need to be at least mediocre to pass) or it could be lower if you are OK with passing people who have absorbed almost no information in that class.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pencil grades just refer to their hardness, and hence their darkness. Softer pencils produce darker marks, but are more prone to smudging. </p>
<p>Number 2 pencils strike a good balance between darkness and less susceptibility to smudging, making them more favorable for everyday writing tasks opposed to number 1's.</p>
<p>Pencil artists will typically use a large range of grades for various purposes.</p></div>		</li>
