			<div class="markdown"><p>(ECE) Our work cannot answer that directly, but the fact that hunter-gatherer populations were using land across most of these regions 10k years ago does support the potential for this. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know an answer to this this from a primate evolution class when I did a final paper on prefossil lemurs.  Most of these species of lemur, many of which were much larger than extant species, died out about 2000 years ago upon human arrival to Madagascar.  Along with this, many other Malagasy megafauna began dwindling in numbers such as the elephant bird which was the largest of the ratites and by extension all of aves. </p>
<p>Also, this was unrelated to the Malagasy extinctions but there also some very good evidence for the Moa genus to have gone extinct from the Maori arriving in NZ about 600 years ago. </p>
<p>It’s late but tomorrow I’ll pull up some of the references I used from the paper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a section about this in “Gun, Germs, and Steel” by Jared Diamond that suggests that the megafauna that evolved away from humans never gained an inherited instinctual fear of us. So when we showed up they basically let us walk up to them and kill them because they didn’t see us as threatening. (Oversimplification but that’s the just of it)</p>
<p>Seeing as they’re a fantastically efficient source of calories in the wild we consumed them faster than they could learn to run away. </p>
<p>I think that our use of tools makes us uniquely suited as omnivores to feed on large prey. I’m by no means an expert but I can’t remember many, if any, instances of another omnivorous species regularly praying on species significantly larger than themselves. Lacking our presence I think they just never evolved to see the weird little hairless monkeys as threatening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes maybe that contributed. But even without that, predator-prey populations are dynamic, and are often in a delicate balance. Even if the introduction of humans changed that balance only slightly, it would lead to extinction of the prey followed by their specific predators.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans historically are an outlier in that balance. As soon as we discovered fire and created tools we were no longer bound by historical natural equilibriums. We didn’t go extinct because we moved on to agriculture when that food supply ran out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, from what I can tell it's generally regarded as pop social science rather than rigorous historical analysis. I wouldn't put too much stock in what Jared Diamond writes, especially considering the debacle with his latest book.</p></div>		</li>
