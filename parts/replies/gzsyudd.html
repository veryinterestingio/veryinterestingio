			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct.  The process they're describing is binning.  That's not what happens with Intel processors of different families.  Binning is what is used to determine the clock speed of a given chip within the same family.  i3, i5, i7, and i9 all have different memory controllers and other features that make them fundamentally different in physical architecture.</p>
<p><strong><em>To a 5 year old, I would say:</em></strong> Each family of chips (i3, i5, i7, i9) has different features on it that allow it to do certain things, which are physically different than the others.  For instance, on an i3, you might only be able to plug in a graphics card and nothing else.  On an i9, you could plug in two graphics cards, plus a couple of fancy SSDs, and not lose any speed.  This is only one example, but there are a lot of differences in the way these are designed that most people don't understand or care about that make them function differently.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And before even clicking the thread I thought &quot;I bet all the responses will just be about binning, with no one answering the actual question&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seriously, what is it about binning that captured the general Reddit imagination so much? I see it come up in random topics all the time. It's like the one &quot;industry secret&quot; that everybody knows and you'll always seem smart bringing it up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For consumers (because Intel does make $10000 chips for companies)</p>
<p>Intel Core i9-11980HK: 8 Cores, top speed ~5 GHz
Suggested price: $583</p>
<p>AMD Ryzen 5950x: 16 Cores, top speed ~4.9 GHz
$800</p>
<p>For gaming, these will behave very similarly. Having more cores is nice, but at a point, games haven't adapted to fully use 8 in most cases, let alone 16. Top speed matters more. So in a lot of games, a 6-core 4 GHz CPU will beat an 8-core 3.6 GHz CPU.</p>
<p>The Ryzen 5950x barely counts as a consumer CPU. The 12-Core 4.8 GHz Ryzen 5900x has more comparable price to the Intel CPU mentioned above ($549)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So how is binning then used, if not for the i3, i5 and i7 labels? Every online source I find talks about binning when it comes to comparing i3, i5 and i7.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Read my post.  It's for setting clock speeds.  Any source you're reading that tells you otherwise is demonstrably wrong.  The families have entirely different architectures and features beyond raw core count.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but the way they end up varying in core count is by building with more, then subtracting the ones that don't work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a thing that is done in the industry, and Intel has done it too, but on current generation if you are buying a i3 there is a 0% chance you are getting a toned down i5 or i7</p></div>		</li>
