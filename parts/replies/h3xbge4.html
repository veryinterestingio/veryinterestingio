<p>I don’t know about pepper, that might be more of a cultural thing,</p>

<p>Cumin is the most popular spice worldwide. So popularity of pepper is likely a regional thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's still debated if continued high sodium intake has long lasting effects (edit* on cardiac health)</p>
<p>It can increase BP in the short term but if you are a healthy weight, high salt diets shouldn't have any effect. </p>
<p>Of course high salt food tends to be high caloric food too. So trying to cut high sodium foods has a direct effect of cutting a good amount of calories</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The greater issue with high sodium intake isn't high blood pressure, but rather the effects on the kidneys, as they need to work much harder to eliminate the salt. In the short term this can cause kidney stones and in the long term can increase your risks of kidney failure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recall reading many years ago that we need sodium and potassium to generate electrical current to enable the heart to beat and to fuel the muscular system. That the optimal ratio is 1 part sodium to 4.5 parts potassium. So you need to consume more potassium than sodium to maintain the optimal balance.</p>
<p>That's why it's super important to replenish your electrolytes after a vigorous workout (especially a brutal run in the summertime where you lose lots of sodium through perspiration).</p></div>		</li>
