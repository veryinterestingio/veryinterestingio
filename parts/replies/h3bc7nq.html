			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting article. But it seems to be to do with semantics as much as anything else. Even the wikipedia article on &quot;Species&quot; begins with this:</p>
<p>&quot;A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which any two individuals of the appropriate sexes or mating types can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>Same way the lineage of humans goes back to extinct species such as <em>Homo heidelbergensis</em> and others.</p>
<p>At a certain point, an ancestor is distinct enough from a descendent that you call them a different species.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The interesting questions then are how bird-like was the most recent common ancestor and how long ago was it? Also, how many species of bird dinosaur survived the mass extinction 65 million years ago?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first birds came about in the Jurassic period and coexisted with non avian dinosaurs for a rather long time. The most recent common ancestor of all birds probably existed at some point in the Cretacious however. Many of these Jurassic birds has some non bird like features but the Cretacious common ancestor would have seemed very alike a modern bird in most ways.</p>
<p>We ultimately don't know exactly how many birds survived the mass extinction, but considering neoaves seems to have divesified at least a bit before then it's most likely more than a few.</p></div>		</li>
