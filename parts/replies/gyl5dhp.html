			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe it's not what the OP was asking, but I've always thought it strange that salt seems to be the only food we mine. Sure, sugar can crystalize, but it comes from an organic source. It's not a geologic process.</p>
<p>Edit: I suppose you can make the argument for water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Saltpeter or Potassium nitrate tastes pretty decent (kind of salty) on meats but it does mess with your body, so the obvious reason we dont use once informed. </p>
<p>Potassium permanganate - sweet purple &quot;drank&quot; when mixed in water, one of the easiest catalysts to make things go boom is somewhat edible </p>
<p>Potassium Perchlorate - somewhat salty but not terribly great to ingest although takes a fair bit of it to mess you up if diluted in water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's actually an urban legend in the military that they mix saltpeter into the food in basic training to keep recruits' schwanzes from doing the normal thing in the morning that schwanzes tend to do, and making it awkward in front of the drill instructors.</p>
<p>In actuality, men under severe stress just tend not to have that happen at all, because the subconscious brain is all about surviving before procreating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm gonna piggyback off this comment because nobody actually answered the question.</p>
<p>Salt depolarizes membranes and increases neuron sensitivity. This means that it makes the rest of your taste receptors easier to activate, and catalyzes reactions with their designated chemicals.</p>
<p>Salt also has its own taste, but this is secondary to its main use as a flavor enhancer.</p>
<p>No evolution necessary for specifically salt, though we did. It would still be effective at taste enhancement even without designated salt receptors, same as any other positive ion.</p>
<p>eli5: salt causes other chemicals to be easier to detect, we like to eat it because of this. It is also vital to our neurons/brain, nerve, and muscle tissues as a raw material, making this a convenient benefit. There are plenty of other crystalline compounds that taste good, and plenty of positive ions can replace the sodium in the salt effect, but salt is abundant and relatively easy to produce.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An additional reason for using Sodium Chloride (NaCl) vs Sodium Gluconate (NaC6H11O7) or other negatively charged &quot;salts&quot; for that matter, was basically, it was the smallest option. Lithium Chloride (LiCl) and Muriatic acid (HCl) are the only smaller alkali salts, and neither are good for consumption.</p></div>		</li>
