			<div class="markdown"><p>Master Control operator here. This is exactly what happens. A lot of national shows are simulcast to different stations. Smaller markets will often cover up national commercials and branding with their own local ones. If it's live, a lot of switching is still done manually, or sometimes break items aren't exactly to time, so it can be tricky to get things to sync up perfectly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I'm surprised that any switching is still done manually. I used to know a guy who was an engineer at a local Portland Oregon TV station. According to him, at the time he retired, almost nothing was done locally. He said it was all automated and controlled off-site at the station owner's network operations center in, I think, Los Angeles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Master Control operators still exist for most larger networks and channels even though much of the operations are centralized. Typically, automation has a playlist for the National feed and a local commercial handoff signal is contained within that. Local stations that sell their own ads (or even different cable or satellite operators) are responsible for syncing with the National feed. Advertisers demand refunds when their commercials get cut off.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There’s still only so much automation can do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a kid, I thought that every company had a guy whose job it was to watch TV and then, when the commercial break started, to press a red button to play their commercial. The first one to press the button won, and the companies that had the fastest guys aired the most commercials. (I figured that's why you'd sometimes see the same commercial air twice in a row.) TIL I was slightly less wrong than I thought.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I still remember asking about this when I did a school tour of a TV station. I was told that companies pay for their commercials to run back-to-back (air twice in a row) so that they got more notice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I talked to a guy when I was in college who said that he was inventing a device that would detect hidden signals in broadcasts to allow replacement of commercials. His example was so a sport's bar could replace commercials with local ads as a secondary revenue stream. Is, or was (mid to late 90's), that technologically feasible?</p>
<p>He also said the CIA used these hidden signals to send messages to sleeper cells, so I always took it with a huge bag of salt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a gizmo that worked off that principle you could hook up to your vcr so that if you recorded a show it would skip the commercials. Although it apparently only worked in japan since Japanese broadcasts usually had an English and Japanese feed, but the commercials were only in Japanese, so the vcr could detect when the English feed stopped and halt the recording</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back in the 1990s it was often a DTMF tone on one of the subcarriers (5.8, 6.2) you could pick up with a home edition C-band satellite dish.  Back then, fiber was not as prevalent and sports games would hire a satellite for the &quot;backhaul&quot; feed to the network operations center.  Depending on where the producer was (to add graphics and whatnot) the commercials could have been inserted in the field or at the NOC.</p>
<p>All this to say, sports bars would catch these &quot;wild feeds&quot; and even possibly get the announcers on hot-mics during breaks!  Your friend's invention was plausible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also they might have more ads queued up just in case something goes wrong with the transition to the show. An ad that is worth thousands of dollars is better than dead air. You're not ever meant to see a blank screen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My father used to do Master Control at a tiny tv station back in the '60s.  As long as I've been alive, anytime a t.v. channel or radio station would play more than a few seconds of dead air, he'd gleefully announce &quot;Dead air!  Someone's getting fired!&quot;</p>
<p>I do the same thing now and my wife thinks I'm a lunatic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worse on radio imo, because you don't even know if you're tuned in properly if you are switching channels. I guess FM radio is less of a thing now, but 10 seconds of dead air on any radio station would make people check their radios. People who stream all day and constantly engage their watchers I feel sorry for, must get saw jaws form talking all the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's generally two different scenarios, and there are exceptions, but we won't go into them.</p>
<p>The first are local affiliates which is your over the air news channel (Fox, ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS, etc). They are given breaks in national programming (around 3 minutes of ad time for each 30 minutes of programming ) that they can sell. Generally they sell that ad time to local businesses but most affiliates have a national sales person who tries to sell to national brands.  They don't cover up national advertising since the affiliate was given that time by the broadcast network.</p>
<p>The second are your cable channels. They sell what are called local breaks to national and local advertisers. The national advertisers get a drastically reduced rate with the understanding that they may be covered in a market by a local commercial. The local advertisers gets the chance to advertise on a cable network without having to pay the national rate since their commercial will only run in the designated market. The cable channel does this because in some cases it's getting paid multiple times for the same air time and makes more money than if they had charged a single higher national rate.</p></div>		</li>
