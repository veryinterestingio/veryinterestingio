			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you can use a classic altimeter as a barometer by setting your known elevation.</p>
<p>If you are on the ground at an airport, most will give you the field altimeter setting (atmosphere press at airport). But if not available, set your altimeter to the field elevation and the pressure indicated in the Kolzmann window is your effective field pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Phyphox is great!  The web site has tons of cool experiments that utilize your phoneâ€™s sensors. I was able to pretty quickly and accurately measure the speed of sound in different air temps using two phones running the phyphox app. And I can verify that measuring height with the barometer totally works.</p></div>		</li>
