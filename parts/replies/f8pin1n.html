			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it works out mathematically like that. The % numbers are an oversimplification and &quot;same gene&quot; doesn't necessarily mean &quot;same DNA.&quot;</p>
<p>Someone who knows the answer to this, please respond. I'm curious too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are multiple different ways DNA can be compared which are often confused or erroneously compared against each other as if they were equivalent.  The three main types I usually see are:</p>
<ol>
<li>DNA that is <a href="https://isogg.org/wiki/Identical_by_descent" target="_blank">identical by descent</a> (e.g., &quot;you share 50% of your DNA with your siblings&quot;).  This is discussing the actual <em>source</em> of your DNA rather than its exact sequence, since of course most of the sequence itself will match with any human.</li>
<li>DNA sequence identity (e.g. &quot;we share 98% of our DNA with chimps&quot;).  Now we're talking about <a href="https://wp.biologos.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/homopangorilla.png" target="_blank">lining the DNA up</a> and comparing letter by letter to see how many match.  However, this will still not account for any large changes that don't affect the DNA sequence itself, such as the fact that humans have one less chromosome than chimps due to an <a href="http://i.imgur.com/otB1X.jpg" target="_blank">ancient fusion event</a>.</li>
<li>Simple presence/absence of orthologous genes (e.g. &quot;we share half our DNA with bananas&quot;).  This one is especially misleading because it only considers coding regions, which make up a small fraction of the genome as a whole.  So humans and bananas do have many genes in common, such as those needed for basic cellular functions in all eukaryotes, but the non-coding parts of our DNA are not factored into this calculation (which would be difficult to even try, since our genome is around 6 times larger than a banana's).  And for what it's worth, the true number is probably <a href="https://nsaunders.wordpress.com/2018/05/09/50-bananas/" target="_blank">somewhat less than 50%</a> in the human/banana case anyway.</li>
</ol>
<p>u/<em>PM_ME_PANGOLINS</em> is most likely referring to the second of these three comparisons, in that there is roughly 90% sequence identity across primates (I don't actually know if that's correct, but it's probably in the ballpark).  However, the 2-3% Neanderthal DNA OP is talking about actually refers to the <em>first</em> of the three points I talked about: what percentage of a human's genome actually originates from Neanderthal ancestors in their family tree.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because of epigenetic markers, or 'tags', the same exact DNA can express itself in different ways across individuals, depending on what tags are present. I believe this is probably what you are referring to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>None of the maths checks out. Maybe they mean of the genes that are currently unique to humans, but not common to all humans, 2% were also found in Neanderthals</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially a lot of dna is a shared with a lot of things since all eukaryotes have a common ancestor who coded for many basic cellular processes that all eukaryotes use. It’s more in the regulation of the same genes that we differ. Protein change is slower than transcription rate changes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the analogy there is like saying that the &quot;complete&quot; code to make both Doom and Microsoft Word from scratch share huge amounts of similarities.</p>
<p>... because first you need an x86 processor, and then you need a copy of MS Windows.  All the interesting functional differences are in what you do once you have that basic functionality.</p></div>		</li>
