<p>Did you know you can kind of select avocados with smaller pits when shopping? Try to avoid the ones that are really big and round (i.e. egg-shaped) and go for the ones that are more pear-shaped. For whatever reason, those big round one tend to have bigger pits. This method works for a variety of produce that carry seeds - essentially, look for the seed carrying area to be smaller and you should end up with smaller/less seeds!</p></div>		</li>
