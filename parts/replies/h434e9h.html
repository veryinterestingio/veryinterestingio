			<div class="markdown"><p>The carotic sinus is the place in your neck where the communal carotic artery splits into the interior carotic artery (ACI) which them goes into the brain and the exterior carotic artery (ACE). What it does is essentially being the blood pressure barometer by using nerves around this blood vessel that give the brain information to keep the blood pressure normal. You hit those and your brain thinks Oh shit this is to high better lower it all down by a lot. Blood pressure drops rapidly brain is not perfused enough, black out</p></div>		</li>
