			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not sure why you’re being up voted. T cells don’t use antibodies, but they do use the T cell receptor, which is basically a membrane bound antibody. They’re a bit different, but antibodies and TCRs are the only proteins that undergo V(D)J recombination.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TCR wouldn't be detected in an antibody screen though. However, if you have a decent cd8 response you are likely an positive as well. People with less severe infections have probably taken care of it with innate immunity, so there's no significant stimulation of cellular or humoral pathways</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So there are two types of T cells. They both use the T Cell Receptor but they have different ligands they interact with as well as coreceptors. Typically we define T cells by its coreceptor which is either CD4 or CD8 (CD = Cluster of differentiation). Helper T cells which are crucial to B cell maturation have a CD4 and interacts with a surface protein call MHC Class II. The short version is Major histocompatiblity Complex Class II is only on professional antigen presenting cells like macrophages and dendritic cell and presents short protein sequences (peptide) found in the extra cellular matrix. </p>
<p>Cytotoxic T cells function differently. We define them by there coreceptor CD8 and it interacts with MHC Class I. All cells express MHC class I. It’s job is to present peptide that is produced inside the cell to survey whether what is being produced is from normal cell processes or erroneous cell behavior. Viral peptide and cancerous peptide are a few examples. When a CTL recognizes non self peptide by its TCR it signals release of cytokines and cytolitic granules killing the target infected cell. </p>
<p>Definitely a similarity to the BCR and the TCR I’ll give you that but T cells don’t change somatically for good reason.</p></div>		</li>
