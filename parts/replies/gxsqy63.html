			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, many things we add to food to enhance flavor also tend to have qualities that slow the growth of bacteria and other microorganisms. Its hypothesized that these became cultural traditions in part because people that used them way back when in their cooking may have gotten sick less often from spoiled food.
This phenomenon is studied under the broader term the &quot;behavioral immune system&quot;, basically saying it's an extension of our self preservation. When I was in my undergrad, one of my professors was researching the connection between the relative &quot;spiciness&quot; of a cultures food and the prevalence of ancestral virus/bacteria/food-spoiling-little-guys. They found historical pathogenicity meant spicier meat dishes.</p>
<p>To connect back to OP's topic, perhaps part of the reason we enjoy the flavor now is because ancestors who disliked it didn't get the chance to pass on their genes.</p></div>		</li>
