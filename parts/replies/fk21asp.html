			<div class="markdown"><p>It just depends on the preference/ knowledge/resources of the person sharpening said blade(s.)</p>
<p>Time between sharpenings is a huge  factor, but you can use diamond plates/stones/ceramics/strops depending on your skill/preference/needs.</p>
<p>Some kitchens invest in a <a href="https://www.worksharptools.com/product/original-knife-tool-sharpener/" target="_blank">Work Sharp </a> which can be worth the money if properly utilized. Others may hire professional blade sharpeners, while most just use dull blades. It happens. </p>
<p>I reccomend any and everyone to try your hand(s) at blade sharpening. It's a useful, inexpensive and relaxing hobby!</p></div>		</li>
