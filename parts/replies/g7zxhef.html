			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably the better question is why are tv remotes still using this technology? The answer, I’m sure, boils down to “cost” but still.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My roku remote connects through wifi, took about 8 seconds to set it up, costs about $12 to replace, and makes a pair of AAAs last about a year.</p>
<p>Edit: it could be bluetooth but they told me it was wifi leave me alone</p>
<p>Edit 2: no, you don't need to be connected to the internet for it to work. Yes, having a remote that actually fucking works, that doesn't need to be pointed at the TV to work, is worth changing batteries once a year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also much easier for third party manufacturers to make universal remotes. Nearly every tv uses the same technology, just different codes</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apple TV remote is bluetooth and I charge it at most twice a year for about 30 minutes. It requires no pairing and doesn't interfere with anything. You are making a molehill into a mountain here</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speed and comfort is one thing. Changing an entire industry. Battery life of the remote.</p>
<p>The downsides of the current system is really not worth the change.</p>
<p>Battery life is a very big issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Battery life is definitely the reason. I have an older Samsung Series 8 that uses RF for the remote and the remote batteries only last a month or so. It was so bad that I now control my TV exclusively through HDMI signals from my receiver and whatever source I'm watching.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same for Fire TV remotes. I think they’ve fixed it a bit in the newer models but my older gen 2 sticks can go through 2 AAA in two weeks or last up to 4 months tops.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I use mine daily. I know I haven't replaced mine in six months because I bought one of the enhanced remotes in April and have yet to swap the batteries on it. I suspect it's about due though. Two minutes a year or whatever to swap out batteries is a small price to pay for the enhanced functionality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the time, it isn’t the IR communication’s fault.  Besides, the remote is broadcasting the command over and over for as long as the button is held down; it’s extremely unlikely none of the transmissions are successfully received.  Rather, it’s the woefully-underpowered ARM microprocessor in the device trying to run the device’s OS with Embedded Java (slowing down over three billion devices!).  My old Blu-ray player took an entire second to react to the pause button on the remote.  One press of the button, and a second later the video finally stops.</p></div>		</li>
