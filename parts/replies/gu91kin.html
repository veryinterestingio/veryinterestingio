			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the information. I am trying to encourage as many people as possible to get the vaccine but I can't do that without being properly informed. My hunch was right then, it's not 0% effective after 21 days it's just <em>maybe</em> minus 1% effective every day or something like that. But it seems like it's just that they can guarantee that it's completely effective up to 21 days, but more studying needs to be done after that point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It could even be +1% effective the first day after. They only really tested 21 days, not more or less.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want to help people become properly informed then be sure and leave out the part about it losing 1% efficacy each day after 21. Obviously you just made that up for this example but that kind of thing is something I can see a misinformed person latching on to even though it's a completely made up part of your example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not even that. It could easily be MORE effective if we wait more than 21 days. We only know about 21 days, as thats all we've tested.</p></div>		</li>
