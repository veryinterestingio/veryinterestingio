			<div class="markdown"><p>There are not pluripotent in the adult, so either you isolate from embryos, either your need to reprogram differentiated adult cells. It's not that difficult, but it's way more risky. That's why so-called induced pluripotent stem cells are mostly used when there is no alternative possible, e.g. used for retina regen in japan. </p>
<p>Most often, you just want to regen a particular organ, so there's no point using pluripotent stem cells which risk creating teratomas, better use adult stem cells also known as tissue stem cells which are restricted to giving rise to the various cell types of the tissue in question. Easier to get such cells (they are in the adult), and safer (e.g. lung stem cells wont grow teeth or testicles in your lungs by mistake).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to what others have said, stem cell treatments are largely mythologized in popular culture. We don't actually have reliable stem cell treatments for most of the things you hear about, and working with stem cells in humans is extremely dangerous. Pluripotent stem cells, in addition to being hard to source legally, ethically, and biologically, have the potential to become anything. Because they can become almost any cell type, they can't be used to predictably grow a certain type of tissue. In fact, a common &quot;check&quot; to see if a cell line is really pluripotent is to form what is called a teratoma in an animal model (most commonly a rat). A teratoma is a tumor made up of multiple types of cells, and they get really weird and gruesome. You can have teeth, eye tissue, and muscle all growing in one large ball of tumor. If we do ever reach a point of quality stem cell therapy we would want to use specific adult stem cells to grow a specific type of tissue, whereas pluripotent stem cells injected into a human would just grow a teratoma, if not cause worse problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is some very interesting information. Just a question, embryonic stem cells are pluripotent right? So then what stops them from forming teratomas. Not sure if this question makes any sense</p></div>		</li>
