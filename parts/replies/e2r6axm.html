			<div class="markdown"><p>Sticking it in baby oil while it is wet just means now you have beads of water stuck to your razer head trapped by the oil that will never evaporate.  Dissolved oxygen in that water will still cause corrosion. </p>
<p>The idea with the isopropyl is that because it is very fluid (as opposed to viscous baby oil) it displaces the water and then evaporates very quickly, leaving the blade completely dry in a much shorter time than just air drying a wet blade.  This means there is much less opportunity for corrosion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting </p>
<p>Can the O in the C3H8O (if somehow kept pure) oxidize the blade? Maybe it's not necessary to remove the blade from the alcohol except when shaving...</p>
<p>Don't you think that shaking off most water droplets, and then giving the head a quick vigorous swish in the oil, will displace almost all tiny h2o Klingons from the blades? The swishing could work well laterally, the oil being viscous, because the blade moves while the oil is inertially resistant.</p>
<p>I guess I'm looking for more convenient way than busting out the alcohol every time. if you could just store your razor in a liquid, like a barber stores combs in the blue stuff, that would be an excellent long-term solution. Better than having to &quot; wash dishes (razor with alcohol) &quot; after every shave.</p>
<p>Unless you know the answer maybe I'll start a 6 month experiment next month, alternate Lee shaving with two razors,  storing one submerged in alcohol, and the other oil. Can you guess a best oil to try? baby, mineral, neat's-foot, olive, avocado, ??</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Somebody just beat me to it. The whole point is to get the water out and the baby oil does not do that. However, like what the other person said, I would just dip the head in a container of it, close the top of the container so it doesn't all evaporate, and just shake it and let it dry. You can actually store it in alcohol as well if you want. There are some electric shavers that I think have that built into the holder as some sort of a system. </p>
<p>To be honest, I don't even bother with the alcohol anymore. These blades last so long but I don't even really notice it. But if I'm good about using the alcohol I can get one to last something ridiculous like eight months.</p></div>		</li>
