<p>Both because you generally don't vaccinate people who are acutely ill and because people are immune for at least 90 days anyway</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Im a little confused by this as someone who hasn't read much about the vaccine... So basically as far as we know right now if you were infected with covid you can expect a 90day immunity and then afterwards there is a real possibility of re infection whenever you get exposed to it again right?</p>
<p>Does this mean the vaccine will have the same 3 months sure immunity and then have chance of re infection too? Since vaccines acts by simulating the actual illness so your body can build defenses against it seems to me that this means you wont have a stronger immunity than you would have if you got covid naturally and your immune system fought it?</p>
<p>If thats the case then isn't there the risk that by the time a big enough number of people got vaccinated in order to archieve herd immunity the first people who got the vaccine will be in the &quot;might be infected again&quot; category? Thus making it harder to reach immunity if impossible alltogether?</p></div>		</li>

<p>With a natural infection, you have the benefit of being exposed to <em>all</em> viral proteins during infection, which may provide broader protection. However, the main protein you want your immune system to recognize is spike protein, which is what the vaccine is designed to produce. During natural infection or the first round of vaccination, your immune system is seeing something brand new and develops a specific and protective response against it (antibodies, T cells). This process of recognition and production of a specific response takes time - approximately two weeks - until everything is at its peak. </p>
<p>As I mentioned, the key here is the second dose of the vaccine. After that initial infection of first vaccine dose, the response essentially plateaus. You have some level of immunity, but it could be better. When you get the second dose &gt;2 weeks later, you’re essentially reminding your immune system that this is something worthwhile to respond to. Rather than only repeating the immune response described above from scratch, you also build upon the last response, increasing the plateau and your level of immunity along with it. The end result is a faster, more robust response after the second vaccination, which by nature will also last longer.</p>
<p>A good way to think of it is starting a brand new hobby, say woodworking. When you first start out, you need to buy a saw, measuring tape, nails, hammer, etc. to build a birdhouse. This makes the birdhouse seem extra expensive and time consuming. But come time to make the second birdhouse, you already have the tools you need. You just need to buy the wood, and maybe some more nails. Much faster, much cheaper...unless you take way too long to make a second birdhouse and your tools rust and become unusable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't directly answer your question, but for one point where a vaccine mimics the virus, that is somewhat misunderstood. It does more or less mimic the virus, but more precisely it mimics a specific feature of the virus, and in this case it might do it in an exaggerated way, so that the body is hyper- aware of one characteristic which could make an immune response even better (or worse) or with different characteristics than from the virus itself. If you get the virus, your body will try coming up with possibly multiple ways of recognizing the threat but maybe not any one particular strong way. With a manufactured virus it can focus on the one pathway we believe is sufficiently effective. </p>
<p>Kind of like if you adopt a dog and his previous owner abused him and wore a baseball cap, he might be aggressive or scared of anyone wearing a baseball cap. That is something he associated with abuse and may have prevented him from worse abuse in that situation, but doesn't serve him really well in your household.  A more effective defense might be if he had been trained to associate actual aggressive behavior like yelling or tone, then a defensive reaction might make sense when an actual threat arose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a real, but very very remote chance of reinfection. If you got COVID-19 and are not immunocompromised your risk of reinfection is vanishingly small. </p>
<p>That being said, while the risk is damn near zero, it is not actually zero. Even if you had COVID-19 and recovered you’d shouldn’t be totally careless.</p>
