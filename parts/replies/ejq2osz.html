<p>i am in the textile industry and awareness is growing, but unless you ban polyester fabrics they will still be made by some manufacturers trying to make a buck.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Unless you find something that both doesn't absorb water and is flexible and is durable, polyester is going to remain a big thing in clothing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That should be wastewater, though. With proper water management and treatment, how much of the microplastics from laundry find their way into the actual water cycle? Is the issue improper handling of the water in some places, or is there some mechanism for that waste to spread that I'm not considering?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are studies around that have found retention rates for microplatics of about 99 % in modern western waste water treatment plants. You might think this solves the issue, until you learn that the dried sludge normally gets disposed of by being spread on farmland.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It seems too small to settle with sediments, won't float with scum, and hard to catch with a mesh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can also buy a mesh bag called a “guppy friend” for $30 for washing synthetic fabrics. You just have to scrape the fibers that the bag catches into the trash every few washes. </p>
<p>Also, I would encourage anyone who reads this to go through each item of clothing that you own and see exactly how much synthetic fabric you wear. 90% of my closet was synthetic and it was a real eye opener.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re right. I only buy natural fiber clothes from secondhand stores for this reason. However, we really need to find a legitimate alternative fiber because not everyone can buy all of their clothes secondhand.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do you wear a lot of athleisure/sports wear?</p>
<p>Almost all of my street clothes are cotton or wool, (though my underwear has some nylon/spandex in the stretchy parts). My sportswear, on the other hand, does include a lot of synthetics and some wool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, I’m really not very athletic. I do have a few pairs of synthetic yoga pants and sports bras. I have synthetic sweaters (both thin/fitted and thick/frumpy), under shirts (long sleeve and tank tops), slacks for work, fitted t shirts, dresses, nearly all of my socks. </p>
<p>I have 2 pairs of jeans which are my only natural fiber pants. I have about 5 t-shirts/long sleeves that are cotton and 2 flannels. </p>
<p>I’m a microplastics researcher and I need to wear 100% natural fiber clothing in the lab to avoid contamination of our samples, so my limited natural wardrobe has been a challenge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The plastics still end up in the trash to be potentially washed or blown away.</p>
<p>Also just wearing your clothes causes fibres to wear and snap off as you go about your business. They work their way through the environment.</p></div>		</li>
