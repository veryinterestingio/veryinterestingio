			<div class="markdown"><p>I hear some people turn the bottle upside down if they have to take it twice a day. So in the morning, the pill bottle is the right side up. You take a pill, then turn it upside down. When you take it after dinner, you turn it over again, so it's right side up for the next morning.</p>
<p>If you do that for a little while, your muscle memory will soon do it for you, and you'll notice something is off if you at dinner time pick up the bottle and it's not upside down (meaning you didn't take your pills in the morning).</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's a lot of health problems in my family, I'm in my 20's and already feel middle aged physically although I apparently still look young enough to be asked for ID constantly, but on the inside I reckon I'm 50. I need every little bit of help I can get.</p>
<p>Yes I'm sober now before someone pulls me up on the username, I know that didn't help my physical health.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Work in what way? Because that's the issue.</p>
<p>If you're eating a well balanced diet filled with a diversity of fruits, veggies, etc, you <em>should</em> be fine, and shouldn't need to supplement. Only reason in that case would be some kind of condition (a very common one is anemia), and at that point your doctor will prescribe to you the proper supplements you'd need.</p>
<p>However, if your diet is all over the place, and you don't eat enough fruits and vegetables, a multivitamin wouldn't hurt. Even then, I'd both actually make sure I am not getting enough vitamins and minerals by getting checked by a doctor, and first attempt to fix my diet. </p>
<p>If you think a multivitamin will magically make you healthier, if you're already ok health wise, then no. The answer is no. All you're doing to making expensive pee.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're vitamin or mineral deficient, yeah, but you aren't likely to be vitamin or mineral deficient in a developed country. </p>
<p>If you want to take a multivitamin, just take one every few days instead of every day. There is some research indicating that daily multivitamin use with no preexisting deficiencies can cause small health problems in the long-run.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vitamins come in a lot of different forms that have wildly different efficacies, and many of them require a carrier like a fatty acid to be absorbed properly. Even the same form of vitamins between brands will have unpredictable actual contents. Regulation is sadly basically non-existent in practice. There is no one ‘good’ brand, and the best you can do is pigeonhole a individual vitamin/brand combinations that are good. There’s websites out there that test off the shelf vitamins, but many of them require payment. </p>
<p>If you just take a random vitamin on an empty stomach, for the most part you aren’t going to get a whole lot of benefit. OTOH, some vitamins have a limited ability to be absorbed due to the other minerals your stomach contents. For instance taking a large amount of calcium &amp; magnesium or zinc at the same time, means that the magnesium or zinc will not be easily absorbed well or possibly at all depending on the quantity of calcium. It’s always good to be careful which ones you take at the same time, and when you take them. </p>
<p>People’s bodies also differ in their capacity to transform vitamins to forms usable by your body. I have a defective folate enzyme that is unable to effectively manufacture methyfolate. Taking a (rather overpriced) prescription supplement has a very obvious qualitative effect on my mental state, but most people would just be throwing away their money on it.</p></div>		</li>
