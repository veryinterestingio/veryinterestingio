			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes the pressure difference when the tank is near empty makes it trigger prematurely. Cars also have a charcoal canister attached to the fuel tank vent that scrubs the fumes vented from the tank. If it gets plugged or the exhaust on that canister gets plugged that could do it too. Usually pumping by hand and filling it slower for the first couple of gallons would get rid of the problem for me.</p></div>		</li>
