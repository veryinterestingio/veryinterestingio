			<div class="markdown"><p>This can <em>also</em> reflect instituional resistance to change within the bureaucracy.</p>
<p>For example, the people working within the bureaucracy can be resistant to changes, because they don't think the changes reflect how things are 'supposed' to work (note: this applies to all bureaucracies).</p>
<p>For example, when Mitch Daniels became the governor of Indiana, among other things, he wanted the BMV (DMV for most other states) to work better.  The person he appointed to run it made a lot of changes to their processes and systems.  There were complaints from the employees because 'that's not how we do things' and 'they just don't understand', but now most things are done online, and when I have to go into a license branch, I'm quite surprised if anything other than a 'behind the wheel' driver's license test takes more than 20 minutes to complete (and other than the actual test itself, that only takes about 20 minutes).</p>
<p>The people there also seem to be much happier. I know I'd be happier if I didn't have to deal with people who were angry at a long wait to see me all day, every day.</p>
<p>...and contrast that with the poor employees at California's DMV.  You're lucky if you only have a four hour wait when you go to a license branch, there.  Worse still, it is incredibly difficult to make an appointment at the California DMV, you often have a wait of an hour or two even <em>with</em> an appointment, and the scumbag legislature recently passed a law to make it illegal to hire someone to make an appointment on your behalf!</p>
<p>I pity the poor folks who work there. You'd have to pay me a fortune to do that job.  They should hire the person that revamped the BMV here to work on their systems and processes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is mostly it what can be called the &quot;deep state&quot;. It's less a super-organized sinister cabal pushing an agenda, and more an entrenched layer of civil servants who are there for life, don't change with re-elections, and have their set ideas of how their agency/the country as a whole should be run. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>When a president elects policies that run contrary to their beliefs, they oppose them and don't cooperate in executing them. That opposition can take different forms: malicious compliance, &quot;red tape&quot; (please fill out these 10000 forms before we can start), following processes to the letter, delaying / de-prioritizing it, not sharing information etc. etc.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It then makes sense why this is a worrisome prospect to have a class of servants in the government who stay there and can effectively decide if a new policy will be implemented succesfully or not</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem though, is that you can't realistically have those people change every time an election cycle swings by. Either because two/three steps down results in needing to replace tens/hundreds of thousands of people, or simply because wiping out the institutional knowledge on how to do things every 2-4 years at such a wide level would cause you more problems than you are trying to fix.</p>
<p>It would be roughly the equivalent of saying &quot;Alright, we elected a new President. Fire everyone at the FBI and fill the posts fresh to keep out the unelected people from doing stuff counter to how the new guy wants.&quot;. Sure, the new group will perfectly fulfill the new president's will/orders...after they figure out how to actually do their jobs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just remember, there are poor people who think socialised medicine is bad for them and a flat tax structure is good for them. The amount of people who go all in with a political party because of agreement about one or two social issues is nuts, especially when that parties economic policy is shit for them</p>
<p>I have no problem with poor people, I have no problem with Republicans. But poor Republicans are dumb</p></div>		</li>
