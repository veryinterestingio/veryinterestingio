<p>Prevention - most simply, use glass or ceramics instead of plastic. It‚Äôs better anyway, will go in the oven, will go in the microwave, easy to clean, no roughness on the surface that germs can get stuck in, don‚Äôt get scratched by knives, generally amazing stuff. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This, only be sure that whatever glass receptacle you use is actually safe for use in the oven/microwave/dishwasher - not all glassware is made to withstand the heat/temperature changes, and losing a meal to exploded glass is no fun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A good tip for anyone reading, pyrex is a brand not a type of glass (which it was once regarded as). There is borosilicate and non-borosilicate pyrex cookware. The non-boro variety is drastically more likely to shatter due to temperature differences. My personal tip though, just grab an enameled cast iron instead. All the convenience of glass, all the strength and heat retention of cast iron. La Creuset is sweet for sure, but there's a ton of great off brands out there that are a few hundred dollars less</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on when the Pyrex was made too!</p>
<p>Modern Pyrex is soda-lime glass, which doesn't deal with changes in temperature well. It can still be used in the oven/microwave, but you're supposed to have it mostly full with food (which will help transfer heat and evenly heat up the glass).</p>
<p><a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-pyrex-glass-controversy-that-just-wont-die-1833040962" target="_blank">Older Pyrex, produced before 1998 has a good chance of being borosilicate glass</a> (look for the old &quot;Pyrex&quot; logo with uppercase letters) which is much better at standing uneven heat distribution. It is actually more brittle though so don't drop it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two kinds of Pyrex in the US.  The old, original Pyrex uses all capital letters, PYREX.  That stuff should be good to go from oven to counter or refrigerator.  The new, inferior (of course) Pyrex uses lower case letters, pyrex.  I wouldn't trust that going from one temperature extreme to another.  If you want the <em>real</em> upper case stuff, you need to haunt thrift shops or maybe order it from Europe.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At one point I was completely broke after my PhD funding ran out and I was signing on for the sole, I had spent a long time using some leftover meat bones to make a stock so that whatever I cooked with it would taste nice and have more nutrition than just rice and salt (which is what a lot of my meals were). I put it in a &quot;kilner&quot; jar, but realised that there was a little spill on the lip. Rinsed it in the sink and it immediately shattered under thermal stress, sending my food straight down the sink.</p>
<p>I think my reaction was just to sit on the floor of the kitchen and cry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bleach will remove all odor and color from plastic.</p>
<p>Source: am a professional chef and have worked in kitchens that wash and re-use plastic containers that have all sorts of lingering stains and smells.</p>
<p>Edit: Who‚Äôd‚Äôa thunk I‚Äôd get so many upvotes for bleach?</p>
<p>Edit 2: I‚Äôd also like to take this opportunity to rail against the uselessness of those namby-pamby do-nothing environmentally friendly household cleaners such as Seventh Generation and the like, and thank COVID-19 for forcing them to get serious about actually doing something like, idunno, kill some bacteria. That‚Äôs right folks, just because you spritzed your countertop with a sandalwood-and-lemongrass scented cologne and dragged a sponge across it doesn‚Äôt mean it was CLEAN!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. According to Google, plastic is non-reactive with bleach. Also, dilute your bleach, do not pour straight bleach onto your Tupperware. It‚Äôs unnecessary and wasteful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No moreso than bleach just sitting there. The main concern is just making sure it's cleaned off properly. Throwing it in the dishwasher on the top rack after a bleach will take care of that if you're concerned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, someone commented to me about hydrogen peroxide working because it oxidises the lycopene and makes it polar - so it then dissolves into the water. </p>
<p>That‚Äôs how bleach and water work :), it‚Äôs also why bleach changes the colour of your clothes. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that's accurate, or at least, the primary mechanism of bleach is that it destroys certain kinds of double bonds. The length of chains of these double bonds (conjugated pi bonds) affects the wavelength of light the molecule absorbs. The goal isn't necessarily removing the (former) molecules but changing them to a form with a different appearance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another important note:  tomato sauce is cooked, usually with an oil.  This causes the lycopene to ‚Äúfree‚Äù up more, and oil helps transport it to the plastic in the dishwasher. </p>
