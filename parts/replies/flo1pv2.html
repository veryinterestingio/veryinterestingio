<p>Everyone talking about non-money assets and stock prices should GTFO and let people answer the real question.   The stock market and home prices are not relevant here - that's econ 101 stuff.   Money supply is actually much more complicated than most econ 101 types think.</p>
<p>The best explanation for this is actually on YouTube by Ray dalio, and it is about as ELI5 as you can make it.   Superb video on the topic. </p>

<p>Yes, the video does also discuss asset prices and economic fluctuations, but you will see that at the core, the role banks and the fed play in money supply is critical.</p>
<p>If you haven't discussed reserve requirements, you haven't explained how &quot;money&quot; can disappear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I should have put that in the ELI5- debts are also wealth.  You loaned someone $100K and you plan to eventually get that back as money, on schedule, and more as interest- if times were normal.  But, the borrower goes bankrupt, and that wealth disappears from your portfolio.  And you cannot pay your own mortgage loan and the bank takes your property, at a loss.</p>
<p>All that borrowed money that counts as wealth- no money disappears, not the banknotes.  But all that wealth-as-debt disappears as the system crashes.</p></div>		</li>
