			<div class="markdown"><p>Couldn't even play Mad Max because of the garbage camera. Making a quick left turn? Here's a great view of the driver's side door for about 2 seconds before we slowing pan over to let you see what you're about to crash into.</p>
<p>Sadly that seems to be common in many driving games and why I'll pretty much always go for bumper cam if its an option, yunno, so I can actually see what's in front of me.</p></div>		</li>
