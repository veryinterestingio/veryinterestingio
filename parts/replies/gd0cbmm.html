			<div class="markdown"><p>So basically, if a book is 348 pages long, they will buy a sig with 350 pages and leave in the spares?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More like your 348 page book will be printed and assembled as 22 different 16-page signatures, so it will be 352 pages, with some blank. </p>
<p>There can be any number of signatures, but each signature will always have a number of pages that's a multiple of 4. This is because you get 4 pages from each sheet. If you fold a sheet of paper in half, you'll make a little 4 page booklet, with a front and back and two inside pages. Fold two pages together and you've got an 8-page signature, 3 -&gt; 12, 4 -&gt; 16, etc. </p>
<p>These signatures are sewn, glued, or otherwise affixed into the spine of the book in order, in whatever quantity is necessary to print the book. For cost reasons it's generally best to use equally sized signatures for the entire book, so all 8s, or 16s or whatever.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Seriously, even Ben Franklin printed books this way. I’ve been to his printing shop and this is exactly what they showed. All the steps necessary to make a book.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of, yeah. But they're usually in multiples of 8/16/32/etc (like another commenter mentioned). So it'd probably be something more like 352 pages, with 22x 16-page signatures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It may be important to point out that the folded pages aren't cut completely apart from each other.  Some of the folds remain within the binding.  So every blank page is actually still part of a printed page.</p>
<p>On a related topic, I remember getting a big, blank page related, laugh from my boss on my first job out of college.</p>
<p>I was at an engineering firm, and we had technical documents that would include extra pages, to land major section headings on a right-side page. The extra pages would say, &quot;This page intentionally left blank,&quot; which I thought was pretty silly.</p>
<p>So one day I was in his office, reviewing a document with him, and a short time after I left, he realized I'd forgotten a paper on his desk. He looked at it and saw, &quot;This page intentionally left on your desk.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends what kind of binding it’s using actually. When books are perfect bound, the spine side of the book block is ground down and glued, so there is no real separation between signatures anymore. </p>
<p>And I’ve also seen the “this page was intentionally left blank” on some full interior PDFs. They aren’t the final interior file, but a “search” pdf, though I have yet to ask what in the world that means/is used for lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;This page intentionally left blank&quot; is used to show the final user that the blank page wasn't a misprint, that there isn't some critical information missing because it was accidentally left out.</p>
<p>I remember some technical documentation that came in binders (3-ring or otherwise), and was corrected/updated by shipping out replacement pages to all the owners. If there was a new procedure for doing something, you might get a set of 4 leaves with the instructions &quot;Replace pages 3-45 through 3-52 with the new pages 3-45 through 3-52&quot; or however it would be phrased. If the new procedure was only 6 pages long instead of the original 8, then the last new leaf would be blank, except for the page numbers. Those blank pages might stand out as strange and a possible printing error, except for the statement that it was intentional.</p></div>		</li>
