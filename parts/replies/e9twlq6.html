			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe that your reflex responses such as pulling away from something hot doesnt require signals to reach brain and is instead controlled by ganglion, so height shouldnt matter much. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomic_ganglion" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomic_ganglion</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. The autonomic ganglia carries nerve fibers to smooth muscle and glandular tissues, not skeletal muscle. It is not involved in movement of limbs.</p>
<p>In a reflex, the signal travels from peripheral receptors (for example, nociceptors in the skin) along afferent fibers to the spinal cord. In the spinal cord, the signal is integrated, and quickly returned along efferent fibers to a skeletal muscle.</p>
<p>If the limbs are longer, it will take more time for the signal to travel from the periphery to the spinal cord and back. Therefore, the reflex will be slower. Other factors, such as myelination and nerve thickness, matter as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So does nerve thickness mean more bandwidth?</p>
<p>Or more resistance?</p></div>		</li>
