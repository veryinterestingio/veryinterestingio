			<div class="markdown"><p>Came here to say this.  Your comment should really be #1.  Way too many armchair physicists in this thread making this an issue about relativity when it was perfectly well known in classical theory that light waves exhibit momentum.  </p>
<p>ELI5 version: charged, massive particles exhibit changes in momentum when interacting with light just like how massive particles exhibit changes in momentum when interacting with each other.  Since momentum is conserved, the implication is that light must have momentum too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since you seem to know what you’re talking about, can you explain the statement “black holes are so dense they even pull in light?”</p>
<p>I thought gravitational force depends on mass (Gmm/r^2). So how does it affect light which is massless?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mass distorts spacetime.  You and I perceive this distortion as the force of gravity, but that force is simply our motion through spacetime being constrained by things like the chair you're sitting on, or the floor you walk on; take those away and you're in freefall.  You wouldn't feel the force of gravity, but your motion would still be distorted by the mass distorting the spacetime you're passing through.  That's why astronauts in orbit around the earth are weightless, even as they move in a circle around the planet.  Take away the planet, and they'd still be weightless, but just travel in a straight line (ignoring the sun and other planets, the Milky Way, etc.).</p>
<p>Anything moving through spacetime (people, photons, neutrinos) is subject to its distortion by mass.  When photons pass close to the sun, their path is bent as a result of this distortion (which is predicted both by Newtonian mechanics and general relativity, though the latter predicts roughly twice as much bending as the former).  In the case of a black hole, anything passing close enough (within what's know as the Schwarzchild radius) enters a region within which spacetime is so distorted there's simply no path leading back out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gravity technically doesn't act <em>on mass</em>. In relativity, gravity is curved space in a non-Euclidean geometry, which means forwards = towards center mass for any kind of particle. That formula is a simplification which sums up the gravity from two massive objects combined, IIRC.</p>
<p>Also since light has momentum it also exerts gravity! But it's a very tiny tiny tiny amount. But in theory it allows for a kugelblitz, a black hole created from nothing but photons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure.  </p>
<p>For this question, we <em>do</em> need to invoke relativity.  Believe it or not, what follows is a short version of the answer:  Newton's Law of Gravitation is only part of the full story of gravity (and an approximate one at that).  In GR, space-time is considered to be a medium and everything in the universe is always moving in a straight line through space-time.  (Ex, when you are sitting on your couch you are moving &quot;forward through time&quot;).  The presence of mass (mass-energy) warps the space-time medium, causing it to curve.  The straight lines that things are following then are no longer 'straight' but are geodesics, the analogue of a straight line in a curved space (think about what is the shortest path from NYC to Hong Kong by plane).  Light, by virtue of moving through space-time, also follows geodesics.  So when space is curved, the path of light is also curved.  ​</p>
<p>Pertaining to black holes: By concentrating more and more mass into smaller and smaller areas, the extent that space is curved is increased.  GR prescribes solutions where, for sufficient mass-energy within a small enough radius (the Schwarzschild radius) there is sufficient curvature of space that all geodesics which enter the region (event horizon) never provide paths out.  What happens inside the black hole then is speculative.  For a while for an inside observer, it seems no different than being outside, excepting strong tidal forces.  But at the 'singularity',  GR expressions exhibit singular behavior (infinities) which, in physics, often means that there are pieces of the puzzle missing in the theory.
Additionally, Hawking radiation predicts that black holes are not truly black, in that some mass-energy is ejected from them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Light exerts pressure on pretty much everything.</p>
<p>Deep space satellites have to account for it in their guidance, navigation, and control. </p>
<p>It's not noticeable on Earth because the pressure is miniscule (I'm talking micro pascals).</p>
<p>You also get radiation pressure when objects emit light. The Yarkovsky effect, for instance, is when you have a small object that rotates slowly enough where the sun-facing side emits energy once it faces away from the sun, causing a net force to accelerate the object.</p>
<p>Solar sails are a potential propulsion system for space exploration.</p></div>		</li>

<p>By the way, for anyone else that sees this, the relevant portion of the pdf starts on page 16.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. Was looking around for the ELI5 because I was thinking, &quot;Wut? Light has momentum?&quot;</p>
<p>But I remember hearing about solar sails and radiation on satellites causing thrust, so now it makes sense why that works.</p></div>		</li>
