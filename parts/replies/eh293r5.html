<p>Believe it or not, a lot of these fuzes are actually extremely simple.</p>
<p>/u/23569072358345672 wrote about the FMU-139 in this thread, and most bombs I've dropped use a simple FMU-139 electrical fuze with a Mk-122 safety switch.</p>
<p>To arm the fuze, the jet simply sends different voltages which tell the bomb what fuze setting to use (e.g. 5.5 or 10 sec arm time, low drag or high drag, delay explosion or instantaneous).</p>
<p>It gets sent over a wire that is longer than the wire on the safety switch wire. The safety switch inhibits any electrical signal from reaching the fuze... unless said safety switch wire is pulled.</p>
<p>So when you pickle the bomb, the bomb falls free and pulls the safety switch wire first which then allows the circuit to be complete and the fuzing signal sent to the bomb in that split second the longer wire is still connected to the jet... allowing the bomb to enter an armed state as it is falling free and clear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 139 is a relatively outdated fuze, which operational units try not to use unless we're completely out of 152 Universals. I appreciate the information, just rest assured this is without a doubt my bread and butter knowledge base. I'd be happy to teach an impromptu  lesson on just about any munition we employ in the USAF if anyone in this thread would like.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've dropped both, and we were going through 139's like crazy in OIR. (Of course, I'm not surprised the Air Force gets to put a FZU and 152 on everything, gotta love dat Air Force $$)</p>
<p>Neither of them are as complicated as people make them sound.</p>
<p>Now the actual programming that goes into a modern guidance unit for a modern bomb - unlike say, a shitty old Paveway II - that's a different story</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve actually been wondering about the mechanics behind ordinance like this, especially when/how it gets targeting information, so this is really interesting. I’m surprised it doesn’t just use metal contacts and something akin to an RJ45 to relay data, although presumably a lot of this tech predates modern data communication methods like that. My question is, what happens if the safety wire gets corroded or severed somehow during flight? Does it arm itself or are there safeguards against that. The choice of a negative feedback safety is interesting to me, and while I know jack shit about the system, my first thought is it could be dangerous under the right circumstances</p></div>		</li>
