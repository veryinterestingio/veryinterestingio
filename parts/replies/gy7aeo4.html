			<div class="markdown"><p>Wealthy individuals usually bind their assets to various structures, such as holding companies, foundations, trust funds etc. Some are locally established while others as u/germanfinder pointed out are at offshore locations or countries that provide beneficial tax rates for specific types of entities (Marshall islands, Cyprus, Lichtenstein etc) By having such complicated structure allows them to take advantage of laws and eventually avoid to some or all extend taxes.</p>
<p>Such structures usually require a lot of money to setup and maintain (lawyers, accountants etc)</p>
<p>At the same time there are various tax schemes which are specifically created for the ultra rich such as the non-dom status.</p>
<p>Tl;dr it requires a lot of money to avoid taxation, which is why most of us cannot afford to do it</p>
<p>Edit: fixed, not evasion, avoidance; tax evasion is illegal</p>
<p>Edit2: disclaimer since this comment blew off. I’m not providing any financial advice or advising anyone on how to pay less taxes. You should always be in full compliance with the tax code of your country/ state and speak with a legal advisor if the matter interests you</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just that it costs a lot of money. For most regular folk their income comes from an employer who will send a W2 to them and the IRS at the end of the year, so even if you ship your money offshore the IRS still knows you owe tax. Same with brokerage/savings accounts which send 1099 forms. If you can get your investment principle into an offshore account and manage it all then you could potentially avoid taxes on any gains, though foreign banks still do report to the IRS, and you've still got to repatriate the money for you to spend it at some point (and that's why tech companies have billions of dollars stuck in foreign accounts.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not quite &quot;rich people hiding money in offshore account&quot;. This is simply a tax avoidance tactic called <del>transfer pricing</del> IP offshoring (as corrected by a reply). It’s mostly legal (unlike rich people making a secret back account). This simply &quot;shifts&quot; the profit from high-tax countries to friendlier tax jurisdictions (within the EU, profits can be shifted from France/UK to Ireland/The Netherlands/Luxembourg). Note that they are still liable for US corporate tax which is levied on <del>global profit</del> (seems like the TCJA may have changed this)</p>
<p>As other replies have added. while this can optimize foreign tax obligations, this merely defers their US taxes if the parent entity is a US company.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don’t get to move IP offshore for free. You are taxed (via transfer pricing principles) on the value, including future value, of what you’re transferring. And to the extend you use the IP in the United States, you’re not doing yourself any favors; it’s most useful on the IP used in other countries. And even then, if the IP holding company is beneath/owned by a US person or entity, the most you’re doing is deferring the tax. The best method is to “invert” — putting a new offshore company above the US company, where that offshore company owns the US company as well as the foreign-use IP.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are selling digital goods, the accounting is far from straightforward. For example, Sony sells PS5 in France for $500 a pop at $0 profit (or even negative since they lose money on console sale). In this case they would rightly pay zero taxes. </p>
<p>Then they sell games on the PS store. Assuming these are third party games (not published by Sony) and for simplicity not made by a game studio/publisher in France, Sony would then take a 30% cut. </p>
<p>In order to figure out the corporate tax Sony owes to France (in addition to VAT but that is straightforward), you have to calculate 'profit' Sony has made in France. How do you calculate the 'cost' of this revenue? Is that revenue from the 30% cut pure profit? How do you subtract the R&amp;D, marketing, etc cost that Sony US / Sony Japan has spent building the PS5, the PS store and so on?</p>
<p>What if you are an American company selling things to France without having any French presence (just you in the US shipping packages to French buyers). How much taxes do you owe to France?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This does not work in 2021 (and hasn't for some time). If you set up an entity in any major offshore jurisdiction to do that, you require 'economic substance' - i.e. physical presence and employees and local expenditure, demonstrating that you are actually working on your IP in the jurisdiction rather than parking it there. That is why Google, Apple etc. all have thousands of employees in Ireland, why there is a thriving tech scene in the Cayman Islands, why there are so many insurers physically located in Bermuda.</p>
<p>Edit: to be clear: I am talking about the rules in sophisticated offshore jurisdictions like Cayman, BVI, Bermuda, etc. I’m not talking about Belize or Panama or places that do not have a modern legal framework for international entities.</p></div>		</li>
