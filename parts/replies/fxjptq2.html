			<div class="markdown"><p>We’re just not doing the right kind of tests. The only kind of test that will tell you prevalence is a prevalence test. </p>
<p>We’re doing the equivalent of gauging support for the Democratic Party at a DNC rally.</p>
<p>Proper polling, sampling, is done all the time in politics. It needs to be done here too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We are doing the right kind of tests for finding out of symptomatic people have COVID, which is the testing that matters now to provide proper treatment, contact trace and save lives.</p>
<p>Longer term and for broader informational purposes, other studies are useful, but the data we have now is vital as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Prevalence testing would useful for determining how close we are to achieving herd immunity, which would be important to know if we were anywhere close to achieving that. </p>
<p>The current testing protocols are important for the treatment of individual cases, as well as to do contact tracing to help us learn how the virus spreads.  At this point in time, that's a much more valuable use of limited testing resources than prevalence testing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But that’s the thing. It’s a provable mathematical truth that contact tracing cannot possibly work with community spread. </p>
<p>Even if you miss one out of every ten contacts, which is probably an order of magnitude off, that one contact will overwhelm your nine within a week. </p>
<p>The whole endeavour truly seems pointless. Though I agree it’s useful for triage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also. You’re wrong about the purpose. Prevelance testing will tell you how many people have the disease, which is what most people erroneously believe the current numbers represent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also read a report that said 4X was a initial low and was expected to be much higher.  I don't have the source. Sorry.  So, that report and this seem to line up the same.</p></div>		</li>
