			<div class="markdown"><p>When I worked at a design firm there was a potential client that wanted to build an app (???) or device that would allow you to charge your phone over bluetooth. </p>
<p>They came in and I along with another engineer spent an hour giving them a crash course on the basics of wireless power transmission. I showed them that with a great bluetooth signal and a distance of 1m it would take about <em>80 years</em> to charge an iPhone. That's assuming zero power loss from the battery over all that time of course. </p>
<p>Also explained why the dozens of megawatt microwave transmitters hanging in grocery stores to let you charge your phone in your pocket were not a great idea. </p>
<p>But to their credit they took it in stride, were super grateful that we walked them through it instead of just laughing and saying &quot;no&quot; like other design firms, and ended up hiring us for a more reasonable product they pivoted to.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's usually how it went. I'll never forget the guy who wanted effectively a transparent iPad that was thinner, lighter, more powerful, and would only cost $200 for each prototype. Of which he wanted 50 within 6 months of hiring the firm. </p>
<p>Of course the firm was run by shithead scammers who took his money initially instead of saying &quot;sorry this isn't feasible.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
