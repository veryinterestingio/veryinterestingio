			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that's true. PCR can amplify even tiny amounts of virus, so you don't need much. Depending on the course of infection, virus might be found deep in the nose, or in the mouth. I think it's more about where virus is most likely to be found in most people infected, rather than quantity.</p>
<p>Comparisons have found saliva tests to be about as good as NP tests.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Saliva is definitely inferior because of all the enzymes present in it. It very quickly degrades DNA and RNA. It is an acceptable sample type, because a strongly positive person will still show up as positive, however, just nowhere nearly as good as a nasal swab.  A low-titer positive can easily be missed if you test saliva.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Enzymes that degrade naked RNA will not affect RNA properly packaged in a virus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I have mentioned in <em>every single post</em>:</p>
<p>Actual comparisons find saliva and NP tests to be comparable in sensitivity. You don't need undamaged virus, you just need the fragment of RNA that will be amplified.</p>
<p>Folks: science requires you abandon your beliefs when actual data shows them to be wrong. Saliva-based tests are, at worst, a few percentage points less sensitive.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You're agreeing with who you're responding to. You're saying that the swab is taken deeper in the nose because that's where the virus is most likely to be found, implying that there is more of the virus there in higher concentration compared to other parts of the body downstream of the saliva flow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, I am not. I am saying that virus in one person may be present in saliva but absent in the NP, and that it is about presence vs absence rather than quantity or concentration.</p>
<p>Real world comparisons of saliva vs swabs find them to be comparable, regardless of whatever theoretical concerns people can invent.</p></div>		</li>
