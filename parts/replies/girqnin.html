			<div class="markdown"><p>The underlying patterns will still be Hermite-Gaussian modes (with a symmetric Gaussian being the fundamental mode). If you then think of sampling points along curves of equal intensity in the ideal case, you would expect the distribution of intensities to follow an exponential distribution instead of being just one value</p>
<p>Edit: This <a href="https://www.laserfocusworld.com/home/article/16548019/laserspeckle-reduction-technology-boasts-minimal-size-and-low-cost" target="_blank">article</a> shows a good illustration of a beam with speckle vs a more ideal beam. Both have Gaussian envelopes, but the speckle beam has noise from the interference effect. A Gaussian beam doesn't vary much near the center, so the probability of sampling a small section near the center of the beam will go as P(I) = exp(-I/<I>)/<I> where <I> is the average intensity near the center.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm having a bit of trouble visualizing this, though am very familiar with a speckled laser beam. </p>
<p>Are you saying that if I samples random spots within the 2D circle that is the beam to measure the intensity of and plotted that intensity as a function of radial displacement from the center of the circle, I would get a decaying exponential?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you model each scattered wave as a vector with unit amplitude and random phase and then sum and take the square (intensity being the square of the amplitude of the electric field) you will get a random number.  If you do this a bunch of times, the random number you get will have a negative exponential shape.  i.e. you'll get something less than unity most times, but sometime you can get a really big number.  This is the dark and light spots you see.</p>
<p><em>Edit</em> not intensity across the beam, random intensity changes.  Also, each speckle forms an optical vortex.  It is really freeking cool really, and very useful.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speckle_pattern" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speckle_pattern</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This description is true for an ideal plane with infinite extent, but /u/Suta--Purachina is asking about modes of a laser beam which are much more localized than something like a radio wave</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Shining laser on different surfaces will result in laser's reflection on the second surface spread in different ways.</p>
<p>Sometimes this spread's speckle will get really extreme and obvious as it gets wider, other times speckle almost disappears and looks smooth like a regular light.</p>
<p>edit: I've been doing this with a green laser that has a visible beam at night, if you're doing it with red laser pointer you might have a harder time spotting this, but it is there if you know what you're looking for.</p></div>		</li>
