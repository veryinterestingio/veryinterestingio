			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also the Gulf stream, north Atlantic drift, and Labrador current. the Gulf stream bring warm water up the eastern seaboard, turns out into the Atlantic at the boundary between it and the Labrador current, and the goes across the ocean to warm much of Europe. The Labrador current brings cold Arctic water south, cooling Greenland and the waters off the Atlantic coast down to Massachusetts.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Greenland wasnt getting an equatorial stream north, the air that hit europe ice cooled the air, and warmed the ice, causing it to melt over a few thousand years.</p>
<p>That loss of cooling changed the earths temp, and slowly started warming, which caused a shifting jet stream over 5,000 years, and giving us a more current wind model today</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you have any citation for the above? That doesn't sound like any theory I've heard of.</p>
<p>It also would seem to run directly counter to their ages. The Laurentide Ice Sheet was around for some 100,000 years, with only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnes_Ice_Cap" target="_blank">a tiny remnant</a>. The Greenland Ice Sheet has been around in one form or another for at least 10 million years - 100x longer - and has persisted through many dozen glacial-interglacial cycles.</p>
<p>That would suggest there's some mechanism separate from the glacial cycle that's responsible for Greenland's permanence, specifically <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031018213004215" target="_blank">topographic uplift and the resulting orographic precipitation</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, I'm not sure your answer gets the thrust of the question. What I think OP was asking: Given the massive ice sheets that existed in Western and Eastern Canada, down in the US; also over Scandinavia, east into Russia. and in Siberia; and Lastly all along the Andes down to Pantagonia -- all those major ice sheets melted, some on the same latitudes as Greenland. Why did they melt and Greenland didn't?  Will also have to say, the ice sheets in Patagonia are still quite extensive, although rapidly melting now. You could consider it a sort of mini Greenland, which also did not melt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heat transfer. </p>
<p>Imagine hot air from your campfire on a cold night. A wind picks up, and the heat starts blowing north.</p>
<p>People right in front of the fire to the north will feel the heat the most, people 50 yards to the north will not feel it at all.</p>
<p>And people feet from the noeth facing person will get little heat, as its all heading north with the wind.</p>
<p>That, on a planetary scale, but the fact the heat moves changes the winds that blow it</p></div>		</li>
