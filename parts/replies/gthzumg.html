			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps, but the primary function isn't really to set up act 1.  </p>
<p>The only thing that ties across is Leia's message (and the droid carrying the message).  The first words of the message are &quot;help me,&quot; so we didn't really need to see her under attack in order to understand that she was sending out a distress signal.</p>
<p>The opening is primarily just to get your blood pumping.  We're about to spend 30 minutes hanging out with a whiny farm boy, and occasionally cut away to visit an evil corporate board room.  It's gets a bit boring, so the promise of laser battles will help keep people engaged.</p>
<p>(for the record, boring isn't bad in this context.  Starting with a boring life gives plenty of room for excitement to grow)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah... no.</p>
<p>The purpose of a prologue is to set the context for the story. It sets up far more than just the message. We get to...</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the setting - space ships, space battles, rebellions and empires</li>
<li>Meet the dragon - Darth Vader makes an appearance, we'll learn why he's important in Act 1 as the killer of Luke's father</li>
<li>Meet the inciting incident causers - the droids and the Princess - all important in Act 1 for getting Luke to leave his old life.</li>
<li>Understand what's at stake - cruel regime, tyranny, hope.</li>
</ul>
<p>Getting the blood pumping is only a small part of what that prologue did.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Mrs Doubtfire</p>
<p>It falls pretty perfectly into the 3 act general description</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A good example, though my preferred example is either Star Wars, or Jurassic Park.</p>
<p>In JP we have the same early action bit, like in Star Wars, to get everyone excited right away.  (Dino in transit eats a dude.  &quot;SHOOT HER!&quot;)</p>
<p>Act 1 is all about bringing scientists to the island and learning the basics of the park.  It's a bit longer than a typical Act 1, because there's a lot more &quot;normal&quot; to setup. We've got freaking dinosaurs.</p>
<p>Act 2 starts when <del>Nedry</del><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9_8YxDQYCo" target="_blank">NEWMAN</a></strong> kills the power in the middle of a hurricane, and everyone needs to GTFO.  Act 2 is all about figuring out how we're gonna get the power on, how are we gonna get outta here, where is everyone??  There's a lot of confusion and a lot of learning, and trying to form some kind of plan. </p>
<p>Act 3 starts when Ellie turns the power back on (alternatively, you could say that Act3 starts when Sam Jackson reboots everything).  This is the point where we have a plan, we have the tools to execute this plan, now we just need to <em>do the thing</em>.  From here on out, it's just a mad-dash to the finish.</p>
<p>Edit:  Of course, the whole Act Structure is a guideline, so there are plenty of ways to interpret it.</p>
<p>You could say that everything on the island is part of Act2, and the inciting incident that transitions us from Act1 into 2 was Hammond being all like &quot;I've got Dinosaurs, wanna see?!?&quot;  But that doesn't feel correct to me, because there's no real conflict or mission at that point.  Or maybe the tropical storm is the thing that propels us into act 2, because really, that's what forces everyone to leave the island.  Nedry screwing with the power just made it all more complicated.</p></div>		</li>
