<p>Also, the Hubble can in principle image the Earth, as its KH-11 cousins do. However, it is not designed for tracking the Earth, so when it points at earth (which it did occasionally for calibration), images would be <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2016/03/viral-photo-does-not-show-earth-from-hubble.html" target="_blank">streaked</a> due to its quick orbit.</p>
<p>To control direction and remained fixed on target, it does use motors. Specifically, reaction wheels, but they are basically electric motors with weights on them. Hubble also interacts with the Earth's magnetic field to bleed off some of the reaction wheel energy, which is a really neat trick.

			<div class="markdown"><p>The minimum focusing distance is probably less than the nearest object to the telescope.  It uses gyros to position itself.  When orbiting the earth, the telescope will remain pointed at the same orientation, so there's no need to &quot;lock on&quot;, unless the telescope is actually pointing towards a target on earth, in which case the telescope (now spy satellite - which is where Hubble's design came from) must rotate to stay pointed at the same target while travelling in orbit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory, yes but point in time back to which you can peek would be limited to the moment ypu set up the array anyway( since you cannot overtake light that already left us)</p></div>		</li>
