			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah but what about calculation that requires more than 2-3 sig figs?  You can't just invent a computer/calculator that only support 2-3 sig figs.  Most likely they stored that as in an 8 byte memory (it's called a double in IEEE standard). It has 15 decimal sig figs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but they don't save anything by not filling the memory location.  If the calculate works using 64-bit numbers, they might as well use the most accurate representation of pi in that format because it'll take up the same amount of space either way.  (For example, <code>3.14000000</code> takes up as much space as <code>3.14159265</code>)</p></div>		</li>
