			<div class="markdown"><p>We are swamped with high calorie processed food that is often hard to put down. Best advice, I think, is to stick to some basic principles: avoid ultraprocessed foods (anything with an ad campaign and long list of ingredients), try to increase protein and/or fiber intake which helps you feel full on fewer calories. Try to eat whole unprocessed foods (shop around the perimeter of the supermarket â€“ produce, butchers, dairy, etc)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're still partially stuck in the false paradigm foisted on the US, and through influence on many other places, by the grain and sugar industries. The truth is that fats are not bad (apart from trans fats of course) and it is <em>that</em> food group that makes people feel satisfied; and what people should be avoiding is sugar (and to a lesser extent carbs if they want to lose weight). If you can't bring yourself to say clearly that the 'official' belief system for decades was just plain wrong then how do you expect anyone to take you seriously?</p></div>		</li>
