			<div class="markdown"><p>One more type of bank: custodian banks. These guys are the plumbing of the banking industry- they process and clear cash movements and trades between banks, process payments on behalf of their clients, and provide other financial services and even administrate some ETFs. These banks only serve other financial institutions and do not take retail deposits.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I believe they're called &quot;systemically important&quot; not &quot;structurally important&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No stupid questions, that’s why you’re on ELI5! We sell services. Big institutions will outsource their fund administration services, accounting, financial reporting, that sort of stuff to us. We charge fees to those institutions. Additionally, for things like administrating our proprietary ETFs, we charge very small fees to investors who purchase them, maybe 25 basis points of the investment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speculation means to take a risk position, often with no other motive than profit and with the underlying thesis that you will make money doing so.</p>
<p>Example: when an airline company buys oil, they are doing it for their regular operations, or they might be doing it to hedge against future price moves (they want to buy at what it is now because they are worried it will be more expensive later). However, if a bank bought oil, and then stored it in a warehouse to sell later, that's speculating. Clearly they don't have a use for the oil and are just buying it because they assume it will be worth more later.</p>
<p>Speculators sometimes get a bad rap but they are useful because they add liquidity to the market and make it easier for others who want to participate to do so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to give away hard copies of The Dictionary of Finance and Investment Terms (Barron's Business Dictionaries): if you move into a job in the finance industry it’s still handy. And I’ll warn you that “what constitutes speculation?” Can get into philosophical and legal discussions. </p>
