			<div class="markdown"><p>Damn. It's weird how the human body is so complex you'd think the brain would know not to release chemicals when you stop drinking or use other drugs. Like &quot;oh he didnt drink vodka for 3 days I better stop releasing chemicals&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It typically takes longer than three days if you're there.  It's about two weeks before you feel like you can sleep sober.</p>
<p>His analogy works well for describing the process of letting the fat kid down slow.  Say you're at about a fifth of vodka a night and you're trying to sober up.  You can't just quit unless you check into somewhere that can care for you.</p>
<p>You yave to taper down.  So the night after you decide to quit...you have to drink 3/4's of a bottle.  Maybe for  few nights. Then half a bottle.  Then a quarter bottle.</p>
<p>Then one night you run into a few friends and you go on a two day bender and you're back at a bottle a night and have to start all over.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because it takes time to change something as complex as the body, plus the body assumes that whatever conditions have been the norm for the long IS the norm.  The alcoholic has been on constant alcohol for so long that to the body that IS normal and it no longer is adapated to funtioning without it.  I takes time to change back and won't do so until it is obvious that the norm has changed.  Otherwise, drinking alochol once would trigger your body to adapt to it and it would adapt back the second you were sober, making you sick for days every time you took a drink. The body only adapts to long-term coniditions and as far as it knows, being without alchohol is a short-term thing for alcholics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At 3 days you're in the clear, for the most part (danger wise) . Hard core alcoholics go into shock and can (at high mortality) die if they aren't in a hospital. The delirium tremens and all that. I know someone who couldn't walk, write their own name, or barely speak for almost 3 weeks after they stopped. Your whole body shuts down, it's terrifying. You've been on a system depressant for so long the lid coming off sends the firing mechanisms through the roof and you get over excited into seizures and a host of other things.</p></div>		</li>
