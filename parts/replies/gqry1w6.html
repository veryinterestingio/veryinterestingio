			<div class="markdown"><p>Did you read your own links?</p>
<p>The first one from 2002: &quot;Conclusions... ...However, it is possible that disulfiram-like reaction can occur in some subgroups and by other mechanisms than the inhibition of hepatic ALDH.&quot;
It literally only included 12 men in the study and the conclusion even states that it is possible but it just didn't happen in the 12 patients that participated. </p>
<p>The second link from 2002 was... nothing. It simply stated that they looked into some of the cases and the authors of the cases assumed it was a fact and listed it as such without evidence to verify or even debunk that it was a reaction. </p>
<p>Checking out the related articles and articles that cite the ones you linked also provide no information. They are all basically saying that there have been reported cases but no wide ranging study has actually been completed to verify results. Why? because it is already assumed this is a known potential reaction when patients report this happening. Even the studies trying to prove that it doesn't happen are small and non-specific and provide no evidence that actually debunks the original claim.</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31598109/" target="_blank">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31598109/</a> you can also look at this one that is from 2019 discussing a case with this potential reaction. </p>
<p>Either way, it is a complex issue and there have been too many similar cases to simply dismiss this potential reaction especially since it manifests to varying degrees. Also, it appears the main disagreement or confusion or doubt about the reaction isn't that it happens or not but rather how it happens or what the mechanism is. If you worked in pharmacology, you would see that the mechanism of action for most medications is not entirely clear. When looking at the mechanism of action and potential reactions, it is not an exact science as there are a million different variables in the real world that you may not even know about. It could be some random protein that is produced in 1 in 1000 patients that hasn't been discovered yet but it interferes with the medication and alcohol and causes this reaction. We just simply do not know but there have been enough cases to still warn people about the potential reaction so they can either avoid it or be aware of what is happening when/if they experience symptoms so they can get the proper care. Trying to 'debunk' cases without sufficient evidence to prove that it never happens may actually cause more harm than good if it causes a patient to dismiss their symptoms and not seek care that may be needed.</p></div>		</li>
