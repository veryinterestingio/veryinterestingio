			<div class="markdown"><p>In college I found that the most effective way to actually get some benefit from homework wasn't from doing it the first time (after all, no instant feedback means I have no idea if what I did was right or not) - it was to go through it again after it was returned to me, and then actually re-do the homework assignment now that I &quot;know&quot; the right answers/way to do it. </p>
<p>The trouble is that all that follow up action on homework is never taught to students or ever encouraged. It's just &quot;do this homework, turn it in tomorrow.&quot; and then the next day &quot;Okay now forget about the homework you just turned in, I've got another one for you to do tonight.&quot; The constant &quot;new material - new homework&quot; never encourages the review process, which becomes even more critical as difficulty increases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had an awesome professor in college who changed the format. Homework was to read the chapter and go over his notes to get a basic understanding. Then we would do the actual problems in class and go over them as we went. This was an engineering class with a lot of math.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think ALL of my engineering courses were taught this way. But to keep it 100, even when I read the chapter by myself it all went over my head. But I always grasped it when my professor demonstrated it to me.  Guess my reading comprehension is ass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's just no time allotted for review at all, it sucks. I definitely learn more upon having been told the answer and trying to apply it, than struggling through homework on my own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I teach high school and one of the best things I've seen this year to help students with this is a retake of the test in a group setting immediately after the students take the initial test.  They get in groups of three and take the test together, so they talk through each question and compare their thoughts and decide as a group what the best answer should be and why.</p>
<p>The kids look forward to it and I've seen my test scores go up quite a bit this year, even though the material hasn't changed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And it allows you to get feedback sooner because depending on your proficiency you can tell when the method you’re using isn’t going to lead to the right answer, and you won’t have to waste all that time working it out the whole way just to be told that it wasn’t right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's very much this for me as well but it also highly depends on what subject the homework is on (and your particular study/learning style). I did my first two degrees in engineering and I'm currently working on my MBA. With engineering, I completely bullshitted/copied the homework until I needed to study for the test. That's when I basically re-did the homework properly and did extra problems over and over again, then passed the test. If you have the solution manual, you can literally practice problems, find out what you're doing wrong, and keep at it until you get it right. Every step you did wrong, you know not to do that anymore. That's how I passed engineering.</p>
<p>The MBA is a different animal. I can't &quot;practice&quot; my homework anymore and I largely find the homework kind of a waste of time. A lot of studying is just &quot;you know it or you don't&quot; which is a bit frustrating for me. Re-doing homework just seems like a waste of time now. I'm doing great overall but fuck, I miss math problems.</p></div>		</li>

<p>My gen-eds were so annoying because of precisely the frustrations you're having with your MBA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that is part of it and another part is that a small amount isn't bad. There is a reason apps like duolingo want you to spend 5-15 minutes a day studying. But homework generally isn't 'do these 2 problems' so much as 'here are 50 nearly identical problems that only slightly increase in difficulty' meaning you end up hating it and instead of learning how to get to X you memorize the formula for an hour then when you finish it you tend to forget.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, this. I had a friend in high school who only did enough problems to be sure he understood and refused to do the rest of the homework. He got A's on every test but had a B-C average because the homework was such a big part of the grade.   </p>
<p>Good news is he did very well in college.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was also this kid in high school when it came to math. The first day of class, I'd use the syllabus to figure out the grading weights on homework/tests, then calculate what percentage of the homework I had to do to get a B average after I aced my tests. I'm actually pretty good with math, I just hate doing the same type of math for 2 hours straight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the reasons that homework assignments in college for math courses abruptly switch to only the questions that have answers. It's not about getting it right, it's about knowing you got it wrong quickly so you can figure out what happened.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yep. Doing a whole assignment wrong means you got a lot of incorrect practice and no idea what you did wrong (and until the test no incentive to figure out what it is). If you learn early that you are doing it wrong you can get in some actually useful practice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I often give my students the answers in high school, for that very reason. The point is how to find the answer, and to get practice, and what use is it if my students struggle unconfidently towards an answer that might be wrong using faulty methods?</p>
<p>It doesn’t work in all circumstances. In a lot of high school classes the concepts are sufficiently simple that there isn’t a lot more than just the answer in the first place. But for advanced classes it makes a lot of sense. Doesn’t really help copying either because I don’t even look at their answer, only the work, and we go over it all in class anyway.</p></div>		</li>
