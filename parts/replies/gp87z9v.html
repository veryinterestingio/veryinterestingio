<p>To this excellent answer I'd only add: &quot;...and different surface treatments and coatings.&quot; As you note, there are a very large number of knobs that one can turn to adjust wetting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to this, cleanliness is involved here in a pretty significant way as well. Oil, such as oil from people's fingers, can make surfaces more hydrophobic. So it's possible that differences in frequency of cleaning are a significant factor here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiL6uPNlqRw" target="_blank">This video</a> on cleaning solutions has good demonstrations of how different solvents and cleaning methods can make a large impact. Starting at the 6:20 and the 11:05 mark it shows how water will bead up on glass and metal surfaces that have been cleaned with a solvent and a cloth, but still left some invisible residue behind. After cleaning with an oxidizing solution a metal bowl can be wetted without any breaks in the water sheet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great point. I once heard a story at my old fab that a recurring photoresist adhesion problem was ultimately traced to delivery trucks parking (illegally) next to the air intake several floors below, with concomitant hydrocarbon contamination to the entire ventilation system. Undetectable except for a very surface-energy-sensitive process.</p></div>		</li>
