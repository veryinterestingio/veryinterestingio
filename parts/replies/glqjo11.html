			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically these days there (w/Li-On), there are two groups of Laptop Battery camp: 1) One with a 50-80% charge limiter on BIOS/hardware, 2) Ones that don't</p>
<p>The oldest OEMs to always have this feature is: Lenovo (Power Manager), Sony (VAIO Battery Life Extender), and usually Dell (Command - Power Manager) they have been doin it consistently from 2005-7+ upwards.</p>
<p>Then it started going mainstream on 2017+ Samsung (Bat. Life Ext), ASUS (Bat. Health Charging), Microsoft Surface (Kiosk Mode/UEFI switch), etc..</p>
<p>Literally.. with non-replaceable battery these days the best option is:</p>
<p>1) Keep it plugged-in at 80% charge cap.
Then way worse options like...
2) Plugged at 100% (it will bulge)
3) (The Worst) Draining between 40-80% (you'll lose battery capacity and bulge probably in 1 year)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did the same with my 2018 MacBook Pro - left it docked almost 24/7, occasionally taking it out for the odd lecture which required it. The battery has now inflated to the point where the laptop can rock back-and-forth when placed on a flat surface. The battery life has effectively halved, too. </p>
<p>The thing is literally a ticking time bomb, which is great. Can't afford the repair fees as a broke student so I'm just sorta hoping it doesn't explode in my sleep.</p>
<p>EDIT: 257 count cycles out of the recommended 1000.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The inflation is from lithium turning into gas and it's very likely to be slowly leaking. It's not good to keep that around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The key part in this is the 80% Max capacity.  Lenovo's battery manager does a great job of this, not just charging to 100% all the time.  Mine does the same, cycles the battery below full charge to not over-stress it.  My Thinkpad W530 is 7-ish years old (???) and it will still go hours on the battery when needed (which is rarely)</p>
<p>My rule of thumb for Lithium batteries is to keep them between 30% and 80% as much as possible.   Has worked well for my cell phones and laptops.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm always berated when I say this, but it really does help. Unplug at 80-90% especially when wirelessly charging, avoid letting it go below 25%, and don't charge overnight. Just retired my old OG SE with 92% capacity, hoping / expecting my new 12 mini makes it just as long on its original battery.</p></div>		</li>
