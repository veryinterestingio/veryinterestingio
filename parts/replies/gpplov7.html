			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, a Palm Tree isnt actually a tree. They dont have seconday growth, one of the main caracteristics of trees.</p>
<p>Edit: Another fun fact.</p>
<p>If you place a nail in your average tree, after some years, the nail will be in the exact height you placed it, HOWEVER, if you place it in a Palm tree, after a few years or less, the nail gained some height.
My professor told me this 2-3 years ago in Introduction to Siviculture.</p>
<p>Edit2: If Palm trees arent trees, what are they?
Most trees belong to the Class Dicots (meaning the seed has two embryonic leaves), however Palm trees belong to the Class Monocots (meaning its seeds only have 1 embryonic leave) making them more closely related to Grass (Poacea family) or orchics (Orchidaceae family).
What they are isnt universaly decided aswell, however, i like to consider them as <strong>Thick Grass</strong></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This actually depends on who you ask! Secondary growth (meaning that the trunk gets wider every year) isn’t a universally-agreed upon requirement like stem/trunk persistence (trunk doesn’t die back in the winter) and height (20’+).</p>
<p>When I was introduced to this debate in my forestry classes, my professor at the time said that a good rule of thumb for tree identification is that if it’s real tall and looks like a tree, it’s a tree.</p>
<p>That was a decade ago and I work in HR now, so it’s possible there have been developments in tree classification that I’m not hip to.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Thank you for the mental image of the kind of dude so exhausted with pedantic debates that he birthed that gem. I can picture him at any social gathering talking about any topic and feel like his answers will be varying shades of “if it looks like it, then it is it” retorts</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And the top answer addresses this VERY indirectly.</p>
<p>It's when the tree's genetic history of forming shapes says &quot;hey, all my ancestors split into branches at the same height as I am now, and those ancestors left me genetic instructions to do the same. If they survived long enough to make seeds that gave birth over the generations to me, well, I guess it must work! BRANCH FORMING GENETICS! GO YOU!&quot;</p>
<p>It was enough of the blends of conditions to be a working solution, and so the trees in that line followed the same blueprint that helped them determine when to split in order to have enough odds of survival... to actually survive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At a cellular level, what’s the difference between the last cell that was part of the whole trunk and the first cell that’s part of a branch? What information in the cell changes at time of mitosis that differentiates the two kinds of cells?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would argue that it is also very much environmentaly influenced. </p>
<p>Lets take 2 offshoots from a tree (so same genetics), one planted in the open field (so sun all around) and one planted in a plantation / forrest (so sun only directly from above since around are other trees)</p>
<p>The one planted in the open field will branch early in development since it can reach more sun without investing more resources into the trunk.</p>
<p>The one planted in a plantation / forrest will not get much sun and so has to grow its trunk longer to reach the canopy and will only then split.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fractal math! It’s much easier to encode splits in DNA that way, basically “split when x conditions are met” rather than coding for each split individually. Also it’s been found that the fractal equations that dictate how a tree branches produce the exact same ratios of branch thickness:distance between splits that are expressed in the forest of trees as a whole (ie tree thickness:distance between trees).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct. That is a different interpretation of OP's question. I chose to read it as &quot;hey, if a tree grows to five feet, why does it choose to start making branches?&quot;</p></div>		</li>
