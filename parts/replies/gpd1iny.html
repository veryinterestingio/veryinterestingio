<p>Crab expert here, back in 2011 I had run in with crabs and have studied them ever since. Me and my pals have had hour long debates about this subject for years. Unfortunately from my experience I never got up close enough with the crabs I had to make an informed decision whether they were spiky or smooth. They cleared up after a month of cream from the doctor though</p>
