<p>Gotta remember that the earth is supplying heat from the other side and an equilibrium happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is it. Go down ten feet into the Earth on a summer day and you'll  feel cool. Go down one thousand feet, and it will be unbearably hot. Go down far enough and there's nothing but molten rock. So if there's a mile thick ice sheet, that heat has nowhere to go, and it melts the underside of the ice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn’t true. I live in Detroit and we have salt mines 1200 feet down that sprawl for
Miles and the temperature there was fine. We went down there on a field trip.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a common misconception. Ice insulates better than air, but it's not a thermal insulator. Common ice has a thermal insulation coefficient about the same as basalt and other types of rocks. Somewhere around 2-3  w ⋅ m−1 ⋅ K−1  depending on the temperature.</p>
<p>And since the inner parts of Antarctica has had an average temperature of somewhere around 220K for the last 15 mio. years, the heat of the earth beneath the ice sheet has had plenty of time to be conducted away through the ice.</p>
<p>Now, Since the antarctic mainland has no volcanoes or hot springs, what keeps the temperature up in the range that allows liquid water below the ice, is the pressure from the ice sheet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I find interesting is if the ocean was deep enough (60 miles) there would be a different type of ice that does not float. Since there are so many different types of ice/water depending on pressure and temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not sure I understand this argument of pressure raising temperature. It is true that the melting temperature of water goes down with pressure, so ice will melt if pressurized (rather than the usual reverse that happens with most compounds where increased pressure leads to solidification).  If there is a pressure effect, it might manifest as melting but not as heating. </p>
<p>The temperature change with depth through a glacier is mostly a steady-state situation, and the target temperature on the cold end is that of air at earth surface (average annual temperature).  If heat is flowing upward (which it is, this being the earth), the steady-state is a somewhat linear increase of temp with depth (distance from surface).  There is no warming involved from pressurization, it is simply a retardation of heat flow, the very same reason that the interior of the earth displays a geothermal gradient.  Any pressure-induced heating, if it occurred, has long ago been attenuated out of the system or used to melt ice back when it occurred (there is no &quot;New&quot; pressurization; those glaciers did not just pop into existence overnight).  </p>
<p>The thermal gradient won't be a step function from hot side to cold side when dealing with homogeneous materials.  It is a very standard case of the heat equation through homogeneous medium.  hot on one side, cold on the other, and decreasing T the entire way from hot to cold (except at the moment of addition of snow or ice, which does have a lag in warming up to steady-state).  Well, glacial thicknesses are effectively constant over the time frame of the system so we can ignore the punctual event for most purposes.</p>
<p>Maybe I misunderstood your point?</p></div>		</li>
