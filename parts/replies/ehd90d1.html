			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and to add to this for anyone on a budget and honestly the most effective way is steam and diatomaceous earth.  </p>
<p>A $40 steamer enabled me to steam/treat my upholstery, mattress, and the baseboards along the walls.  I did this every few days for a couple of weeks while I had a light dusting of diatomaceous earth on the whole apt.  </p>
<p>It is non-toxic, you can eat it, but when dusting you shouldn't inhale it.  It's small pieces of shells that act like glass on your lungs, especially bad if anyone has asthma or similar.</p>
<p>One last thing I did was store all my clothes/linens in plastic trash bags.  White for clean, black for dirty.</p>
<p>After two weeks of this they were gone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mom did the same thing, bought a steamer and used a decent amount of diatomaceous earth. She also put the bed posts into these little saucer type things to keep the bed bugs from being able to crawl up into the bed, and bought mattress bags for the mattresses since they like to live inside those. It was freaky sealing them up and seeing dozens of the little fuckers trying to make their way to the topside of the mattress.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Strange. I have never heard of ants eating bedbugs. Roaches on occasion(they prefer rotting/discarded food) and spiders definitely depending on the size and species, but never ants. What kind of ants did you have?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds eerily similar to an experience I had with a bad infestation of spiders. </p>
<p>I was living in a charming attic apartment in a recently rehabbed and flipped house.  The attic had previously been all rafters and exposed beams - standard attic.  Throw in some plumbing and drywall, frame out some closets, sand the floors, refinish them, call it a studio apartment, and put renters in. </p>
<p>Come to find out there were spiders.  And the spiders scuttling across the floor at night and crawling into my clothes hanging in the closet were none other than Brown Recluse.  Yep, those Brown Recluse.  The ones that can cause necrotic flesh (literally skin rotting sores).  My boyfriend didn't believe me.  I captured one.  I googled the images.  He stood down.  </p>
<p>I systematically covered the floors in double sided tape.  In front of every baseboard in the house.  In various patterns elsewhere.  For the first two to three months we'd wake up to find dozens of them wriggling themselves to death every morning.  Dozens.  Of all sizes.  Big fat granddaddy ones.  Small baby ones.  It was a spider fucking holocaust in there.  (I couldn't break the lease or afford to move, and the tape method was showing results. We would rip up the tape and put down new tape.)  </p>
<p>After a couple of months the spider capture died down.  We'd catch one or two a week.  </p>
<p>Then lo and behold, we got hit with a vicious infestation of roaches.  The big, fat, don't give a fuck, flying in your face roaches.  The evil ones that scuttle into the the middle of the plate you just sat down, and sit there and laugh at you.  The ones that know killing them will bring out other roaches to eat their squishy remains faster than you can go get a paper towel to clean it up.  Those kind of roaches.  </p>
<p>Welp, turns out we'd found the food source that had been feeding all the goddamned spiders.  And once we'd annihilated the spiders we'd destroyed the predators that kept the roaches in check. </p>
<p>I still don't know which was worse, the spiders with venom that could eat my flesh, or the relentless fucking roaches.  The lease finally ended.  </p>
<p>Props to you for figuring out the ant infestation was key to tamping down on the bedbugs, and choosing accordingly.  I don't fucking blame you at all.  I'd do the exact same thing.  </p>
<p>Edit: Oh shit, gold? It was worth it everyone! I mined my spider trauma for Reddit gold! /s</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would just break the fucking lease.  Forfeit security if you must, but I bet that you could get somewhere with a decent lawyer that this place was uninhabitable.  A few bugs, maybe.  Not brown fucking recluses.  Imagine renting a room and then a week later you discover and Indiana Jones type snake pit exists in the walls and venomous snakes all over the place.  No.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I rented an apartment in Orlando, right on church street... our first floor was bug bombed, and it sent every German cockroach imaginable upstairs. They were in our fucking freezer. Nothing stopped them. We bleached fucking everything, and they would constantly be everywhere... one night I woke up because I heard my cats food dish MOVING. So I walk in, wiping the sand out of my eye, flip on the light and a proverbial SEEEEAAAAA of German cockroaches swarms out in every direction. I’m talking at least 3-4 square feet.</p>
<p>I LOSE my shit instantly— I dump bleach on the floor, threw on some kitchen gloves and just start cleaning everything down. I threw out all of our food (we were poor and it was a huge hit), stayed up smoking cigarettes, and fighting them even on the couch. Walked to Publix, grabbed 6 bug bombs for a studio apartment; grabbed the cat, and bombed that place to shit. Came back 12 hours later, bombed it with 4 additional cans, and then a week later, repeated the whole thing.</p>
<p>We basically lived in our car for four days that month... fun times. And honestly, they were still a presence. Even ruined my computer at the time. I live in Washington state now, where you barely even see insects, but sometimes I still imagine them crawling on me. The experience definitely traumatized me...</p>
