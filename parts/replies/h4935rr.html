			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems to me OP is asking whether CTE and Specific Heat are related. I can’t see why they would be, but I guess you could chart a list of materials with CTE on one axis and SH on the other and look for a line or correlation of some kind? I would think it’d be coincidental but it’s an interesting question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its used a lot in engineering period. Temperature is nearly always a consideration. The change from ambient winter lows to summer high temps is enough to cause drastic changes. Its why expansion joints are needed in roads and bridges. If you dont allow movement and growth/shrinkage there would be enough stress to cause failure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're certainly right to point out the variance of temperatures in use requiring the allowance for movement in different materials used for bridges, railroad tracks, etc. </p>
<p>It's also important in  mold-making for cast metals.  Patternmakers would have to account for the coefficient of expansion of different alloys and make their pattern larger to account for &quot;shrinkage.&quot;  For example there was (for grey cast iron items under about two feet in length) a patternmaker's  scaled rule called a <em>1/8&quot; per foot shrink rule</em>; on it, a &quot;foot&quot; actually measured  12 1/8.&quot;    For some cast steels and zinc the shrinkage is greater and a <em>1/4&quot; per foot shrink rule</em> was needed.</p></div>		</li>
