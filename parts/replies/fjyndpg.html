<p>No, the epicentre is the point in the surface directly above the hypocentre. The hypocentre is the part of the fault which slipped the most, ie. the origin of the earthquake. It’s not so much ‘averaged’, but triangulated using the data from various seismic stations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, I realise I’m talking quite generally here, so could you expand on that a bit? I thought that for a specific earthquake, the hypocenter will always be where the maximum slip occurred <em>for that event</em>. I know that fault surfaces pictured as nice neat oval shapes on a plane are highly idealised, and that real fault surfaces have more variable geometries, but I would have thought the maximum slip is still only at the point of rupture. Perhaps there are other previous earthquake hypocenters on the fault which have made other parts of it more displaced overall, and that’s what you meant? Or the way there can be more than one maxima on a fault surface due to fault growth and linkage? Or are you saying that the largest degree of slip along a fault surface from a single event is not necessarily at the hypocenter of that event?</p></div>		</li>
