			<div class="markdown"><p>I too struggle with mental illness, especially at night. Even hallucinations and paranoia get worse as the day goes on. My mom works as a nurse so I've heard of sundowning before and I've wondered for a long time if the mechanism there is the same. I sincerely hope someone is looking into this as a research subject, I'd be very interested in knowing the results.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you know of any studies confirming or even just notably speculating about it? I've tried to find actual literature on it but it must be fairly obscure. It's hard to find studies on Alzheimers sundowning too for that matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and IMO after living with my mother for quite some time who has dementia, I think sundowning has more to do with lack of visual stimulus than anything else.
During the day the sun lights up our world, and the dementia patient relies on the moment to exist. At night, less stimulus, less information to live in those moments.
I tried going to the movies in the middle of the day with her and she would sundown even though it was 2pm.
Your brain constantly pulls in information from around you, but if there is a lack of information to process it allows the brain to fill in the blanks on its own. If there is some mental illness, what's filling in those blanks is filling in with &quot;bad&quot; or a lack of information. </p></div>		</li>
