			<div class="markdown"><p>I was truly ambidextrous. When I was in kindergarden I fell severly behind because I was learning how to write letters with both my left and right hands. If the paper was centered I would write with my left hand until a mid point amd then use my right. I had to go to occupational therapy for a long time and I believe I was held back from kindergarden so I could develope right hand dominance. Apparently being right handed is easier to grow up as. Also, I was completely unaware of my brain functioning  peculiarly. Until the therapist sat down a d pointed out that I wouldnt even draw a straight horizontal line without swapping hands. It didnt even register that I was doing so.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm a righty myself and we don't tend to notice it but the world is pretty much designed for us. Scissors, can openers, computer mice, car ignition. Anywhere something has to be designed for one hand or the other, the default is for right handed. Left-handed alternatives can be a fair bit more pricey.</p></div>		</li>

<p>ETA: In video games, the right fork in the road advances the plot, the left is either bonus stuff or you end up in the wrong place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard of this. It's the only thing I do not attempt to teach my daughter to do with both hands. It's just not worth it. Especially in a world where writing is becoming less and less important. Sorry to hear about your experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cool that your daughter is ambidextrous. I'll just note that writing by hand is actually still critical for children in early stages of literacy development. It helps them internalize the relationships between spoken and letter sounds, as well as the process of representing language in written form (transcription). </p>
<p>Studies have shown that this is more efficiently developed through one set of pathways, so parents of ambidextrous kids should definitely support their child's development of a single dominant hand for writing! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that never made sense to me, since my writing hand is undoubtedly a lot stronger than my left hand.</p>
<p>this is also funny in bboying (breakdance), in america, it’s standard for right-hand people to use their left hand/arm as the one where the weight sits. in europe, at least in some parts, we do it the other way around. this confused a lot of americans teaching workshops. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with you, and haven’t heard this theory described that way before. What I have heard of was described as the Hammer and Anvil, with your dominant hand being the hammer (and not incidentally as far as strength goes, performing throwing motions), with the non-dominant hand being the anvil (which I understood to mean being useful for holding things that the dominant hand worked on.) It seemed pretty plausible to me.</p></div>		</li>
