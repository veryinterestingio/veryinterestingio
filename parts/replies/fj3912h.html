<p>The pupils dilate and constrict to control the amount of light that enters. But think of the eyes as lens. It is the same as when you use lens to focus sunlight onto a point. It burns. Light is electromagnetic radiation. It is basically energy. Your eyes dilate in the dark to compensate for lack of light. But when you suddenly go into a well-lit area, all that light is concentrated onto the retina (which is close to the optic nerve), all that energy from the light stimulates the optic nerve, and increases the temperature, activating pain receptors. The eye responds to this by constricting to prevent/limit the damage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but also no. The retina and the nerve do not have any pain receptors. That’s why going blind is generally painless in all instances. In macular degeneration, your cells are literally slowly dying and it is completely painless. In glaucoma, your optic nerve is slowly dying and most people don’t even realize it’s happening until their doctor tells them or they’ve already experienced significant field loss. </p>
<p>The “pain” is more the sensation a person feels when their iris is trying to constrict quickly and from sensory overload. This sensory overload sometimes spills into other senses (like cranial nerve I) and can cause you to feel other sensations like the need to sneeze.  And yes, while the eye/brain will generally attempt to protect itself by quickly constructing the pupil and making the person feel uncomfortable, causing them to want to turn away, there are no actual pain receptors in the Retina/nerve.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the right answer. You do not feel pain when you are exposed to light bright enough to damage your retina, which is why you shouldn't stare at the sun during a solar eclipse. You will only realise you have irreversibly damaged your vision when it's too late.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Going blind in macular degeneration and glaucoma are slow processes that involve the glycation of proteins or oxidative damage of proteins, and consequently nerve death. These kinds of damage are not the same as burning.</p>
<p>While the retina or the optic nerve do not contain &quot;pain receptors&quot;, the surrounding components like the dural sheath and blood vessels do.</p>
<p>&quot;The optic nerve does contain trigeminal afferents (not within the nerve, but within blood vessels, and dura) which cause pain associated with optic neuritis and arteritic anterior ischemic neuropathy&quot;.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why is it that when there’s super bright light (getting out of the car on a sunny day for a hike), you have to squint with both eyes for it not to hurt, but if you close one eye suddenly the other eye is ok with being all the way open?</p></div>		</li>
