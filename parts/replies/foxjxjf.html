			<div class="markdown"><p>I might be wrong or might have wrongly interpreted what Eric said. But from my understanding, it's not only the geometry you draw, but also the tools you use to draw that geometry. </p>
<p>According to him there are 10 tools that are used to draw our 4 dimensions and those 10 tools combined with the 4 dimensions create the entire universe.
Which is why i think it is important not to forget the tools because if anything about any 1 of those tools gets changed we don't get THIS universe.</p>
<p>Edit: <a href="https://youtu.be/QmZf4DA61Xk" target="_blank">Here's</a> a clip from JRE of him ELIcollege the theory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't that slightly backwards? That is we have 10 tools that allows us to draw maps to our world.</p>
<p>The world/universe in which we live is as it is. And we have these tools now, to understand it and make our maps of it. </p>
<p>The great clock maker had his/her/its tools and maybe we'll discover better math to describe the undescribable at a later date?</p>
<p>Edit.
I've not missed the point that our math did not create this universe or any other. The math <em>describes</em> it, regardless of how brilliant the minds are that have now discovered it. And I'm neither religious nut nor pleib - I've a bs in mathematics. So, I'm glad the math blows your mind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you've missed a small point here. </p>
<p>These tools are not just some things that already existed before the universe was created.</p>
<p>These tools basically represent degrees of freedom for the dimensions that could have been/are in the universe.</p>
<p>Imagine you're drawing a graph, you pick up a scale and a protractor and draw it right?
Now imagine you have to create the scales, the protractors etc, 10 such tools but the universe doesn't exist. How do you create them? Where do you create them? When do you create them?</p>
<p>I suggest watching the clip in my comment above and watching <a href="https://youtu.be/Z7rd04KzLcg" target="_blank">Eric's full lecture on YouTube</a>. It's fricking mind blowing.</p>
<p>Edit: And from my understanding, these tools are basically these utmost fundamental things that create our universe and it's properties like gravity or atoms or electrons or dimensions etc. I don't however understand what these fundamental things are. It's so mind numbingly complex. Kudos to Eric for developing this theory for over 30 years.</p></div>		</li>

The ramifications of the words in this passage can't possibly be understood without understanding the math, beyond what you've described here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gross simplification:</p>
<p>There's a thing called the Lagrangian, which encodes all the physics into one variable. Its basic parts are kinetic energy (moving objects) and potential energy (energy that could be made into kinetic energy, such as a boulder hanging from a rope, cut the rope and the builder starts moving).</p>
<p>This Lagrangian allows us (with a set of equations) to extract the complete behaviour of the system just by knowing kinetic and potential energy.</p>
<p>But the Lagrangian is not unique: for any system there isn't just one Lagrangian, but (infinitely) many. This means we can transform the Lagrangian without altering the physics.</p>
<p>Whenever the physics stays constant under a certain transformation, physicists say there exists a symmetry under that transformation. And associated with every such symmetry is a conserved quantity.</p>
<p>The physics of a system is constant when we rotate it. It is symmetric under rotations. The conserved quantity that is associated with this is called angular momentum.</p>
<p>The physics of a system is constant even if we move the system 5 meters to the right. It is symmetric under translations. The associated conserved quality is called momentum. (This isn't intuitive and the maths is hard).</p>
<p>The physics of a system is constant under something called an electromagnetic gauge transformation. The conserved quantity is electric charge.</p>
<p>This is the foundation of gauge theory. From these symmetries we can derive things like photons and quarks and all the other elementary particles that describe our universe (except for gravity). Explaining how that works is quite mathematically involved though, which is why this stuff is usually final year bachelor/masters content for a physics student.</p></div>		</li>
