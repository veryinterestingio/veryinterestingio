			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an excellent answer, it depends on the type of mutism. If it's psychological, particularly as other vocalizations are often triggered by separate brain signals (they activate a different bit of the brain) the person may well be able to groan or scream or cry. If it's due to a physical impairment in the vocal tract, it would likely have wider ramifications for vocalizations in general as well as speech.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a little like asking if an amputee can punt a football. Some can, some can't. </p>
<p>Aphonia is inability to make voiced sounds. A guy who has some minor swelling for a few days can have aphonia, and a guy who lost his lower jaw can have aphonia. </p>
<p>Sounds like 's' 'f' 'p' <del>'b'</del> are voiceless. You don't need vocal cords to hiss or pop. Some people with aphonia can make unvoiced sounds, some can't. </p>
<p>Whispering is constricting your glottis instead of oscillating it as you would speaking normally. Some people with aphonia can constrict their glottis, some can't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. You whisper with your vocal cords. Not having vocal cords whisper (and using subsequent forceful breath) usually doesn't have the capacity to form more than one syllable.</p>
<p>Source: took vocal lessons and this is what my voice teacher told me about whispering and why I shouldn't do it. It causes a lot of strain and can even damage vocal cords. It's better to simply speak in a deeper voice since less energy is required (and thus less breath and ultimately less volume) to make those sounds.</p>
<p>Edit: I may have been wrong! Read the comments under this reply for a more detailed explanation of what happens when you whisper!</p>
<p>Edit 2: it seems I was correct! You do use your vocal chords to whisper. You may not make them vibrate, but they <em>are</em> used!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m no expert but I’ve had a run in with paralysis of the vocal cords through my newborn. </p>
<p>With as much as I’ve been able to look up, it’s possible to make speech recognisable but if you have ever lost your voice by inflammation you’ll know it’s not easy and very draining since you are using</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Sore muscles </p>
</li>
<li>Other muscles not used to having to work to constrict the vocal cords to make up for the difference, you might even notice that you get sore all through your neck and into your shoulders as even your gross muscles try to make up for it. </li>
</ol>
<p>So you can see why that will make you not want to talk or during development you basically chose not to speak at all, it’s just too draining to be lifting weights just to say thanks or mummy and daddy. </p>
<p>Another way that you can tell your gross muscles have an effect is to pull your shoulders right back and try a deep voice then try with your shoulders hunched forward. You’ll notice one is a lot easier then the other but imagine doing that to form a sentence or just a few words 100 times a day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There has also been a rise in a severe motor planning speech impairment which is neurologically based called apraxia.  It used to be rare but now has been on the rise over the past few decades for some reason just like autism.  Without intensive appropriate therapy the children are unable to talk, and some remain essentially nonverbal and rely on augmentative devices.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://news.psu.edu/story/358761/2015/05/27/research/autism-and-rare-childhood-speech-disorder-often-coincide" target="_blank">recent study</a> from Penn State found  64 percent of kids with autism have underlying apraxia which is why they are nonverbal.  <a href="http://www.debtsmart.net/talk/index.html" target="_blank">This page</a> shows an example of how kids with apraxia speak my son is Tanner on this page  I run a children's nonprofit and this is some parent friendly information about apraxia  My son Tanner was diagnosed with oral as well as verbal apraxia which is even more rare than apraxia -<a href="https://pursuitofresearch.org/2017/02/03/why-more-should-know-what-oral-apraxia-is/" target="_blank">this is a page</a> why it's important to know the warning signs of oral apraxia from my blog.</p>
<p>Please don't assume though that if someone can't talk they can't think -this is a <a href="https://vimeo.com/ondemand/latetalkersfilm" target="_blank">short film</a> my nonprofit had put together   I co authored the book The Late Talker and have been outreaching for 20 years now -so if you have a child you are concerned about I may be able to help answer questions  My both boys have overcome their special needs and are completely mainstreamed today -there is so much hope today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To extend on why deaf usually don't speak is... We learn by imitating. They have no reference, but most importantly they have no feedback. They don't hear themself, so can't correct themself.</p>
<p>Some succede to speak with the help of someone who do hear. In this case, the one that hear tell them what is wrong, and how to possibly fix it. And they try to do it, and remember it.</p>
<p>Like, &quot;Na&quot; and &quot;Ta&quot; is the same thing in your mouth. They could try to mimic perfectly what they see... Someone that can hear will immediatelly notice that something is wrong, because they didn't opened or closed their nasal cavity (or whatever is the real term). Someone that can't hear will never know. In fact, they won't even know that the way you open/shape your mouth change the sound! They can, however, learn to speak somewhat normally with the help of someone that can hear.</p></div>		</li>
