<p>So it'ss true we use calcium to unlock Troponin from it's position atop Tropomyosin which effectively blocks myosin filament crossbridges from attaching to actin filaments when we don't want them to (muscle relaxation). There's no concrete evidence to suggest that massage as a recovery technique removes 'excess calcium' that the sarcoplasmic reticulum didn't reuptake. (Reuptake occuring as a result of our CNS signalling the muscle to relax).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My apologies for the lack of clarity. I hope my little analogy about the gate makes it seem clearer. It's completely reasonable to not understand it in the way I originally wrote it. </p>
<p>It's not that important anyway, I just wanted to provide some background information for people to Google search or be able to follow my thinking. In it's original form, what I wrote probably seemed like the scientific jargon that the original replier was probably hoping to bamboozle somebody with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do just want to throw out there that a lot of the reason there isn't much scientific backing to massage is because there aren't that many studies done related to massage. Most of the ones I've seen try to show that massage is more beneficial/ reduces more stress than just seeing a psychologist... there aren't a lot of studies done for the clinical/therapeutic side of things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree, I think people need to be careful when they say there is 'no evidence' as this is generally that there haven't been enough 'good' studies to determine effectiveness. It would be very difficult to get funding to do a proper RCT on massage benefits when generally the same pool of money covers things like cancer, epilepsy, dementia ect... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No evidence and no conclusive evidence mean different things. You can find journal articles that will support literally anything you want. It's the equivalent of the whole &quot;thisiswhatithink,nowtellmewhyimright&quot; search meme. </p>
<p>However the point of my post is that it's inappropriate to post false scientific claims when there's no solid (note I used the word solid) evidence to support them. </p>
<p>Meta analysis usually aren't conducted unless there's a somewhat reasonable amount of high level research done in an area. They simply wouldn't get the green light if they had nothing to analyse. They're the highest level of scientific evidence and hold up well when critiqued.</p>
<p>I do agree that more research should be done on massage and other recovery techniques. I'd love that to happen. But just because we're missing the money to research something doesn't mean we should make false scientific claims in order to further something like massage (like the post which my post was in direct response too - since deleted?).</p>
<p>Anecdotally there's many reports that show people love and respect massages for their benefits. Let's leave it at that, anecdotal reports of benefit. In time with less contradictory research we'll be able to hopefully get a clearer picture. ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One major issue with scientific studies of massage is that they have found it difficult to conduct a double blind study of any kind. After all what are you going to use in place of a placebo?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would love to see studies of Eastern vs. Western, as well as studies using devices that measure muscle tension (if real ones exist, not just silly gimmicky machines), or a before/after performance such as a participant lifting as much weight as they can before a massage and then again after.</p>
<p>Another big issue is that every therapist has their own style and pressure is entirely subjective, so it's hard to regulate what is being done during a session. Therapists usually pull from their toolbox, not stick with one style for a massage, so someone who has neuromuscular training would give a different massage than someone who has structural training.</p></div>		</li>
