			<div class="markdown"><p>To piggyback on this great answer, another interesting and related question is: Why doesn't water burn?</p>
<p>The ELI5 answer is: It's already been burnt. Water and CO2 are products of &quot;rapid oxidation,&quot; also known as burning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, it's like asking why ash doesn't burn.</p>
<p>So, something to think about.  Adding Oxygen and getting it to chemically bond is 'burning'.  So you when you 'burn' the Hydrogen in the presence of oxygen you get water.</p>
<p>So splitting water in to H and 0, that's 'unburning' it - right?</p>
<p>Additionally 'rusting' is just really slow burning.  Because you are adding oxygen to the iron.</p>
<p>So can you 'unburn' rust?  Yes!</p>
<p>Think about what's going on with this video with the 9 volt battery and thumbtacks</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a valid question though what does it mean for a substance to be considered &quot;burnt&quot; is it just oxidation? Does that mean ash is fully oxidised if not can we oxidise (&quot;burn&quot; it further) what is it about oxygen that makes it something not burnable</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, you can burn it in a fluorine atmosphere, if &quot;burning&quot; doesn't strictly mean &quot;exothermic reaction with oxygen&quot; to you. In fact, you can burn almost anything that way, even some noble gases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, for example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine_trifluoride" target="_blank">chlorine triflouride</a> is extremely reactive. It can burn glass and ashes and in one spill, it burned through <em>30 cm of concrete</em> and <strong>continued to burn through 90 cm of gravel below that</strong>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did know that it's possible to &quot;burn&quot; water, but if you're doing it in fluorine that would mean you're basically making hydrofluoric acid, HF, right?</p>
<p>I don't know what the rest of this reaction looks like‚Ä¶I know that O and F will not combine so that means you're getting some oxygen product and possibly some fluorine product too? The layperson question I would have about this reaction is: Is it exothermic? If yes and the products are lower energy than the reactants, this is at least akin to burning (even if we don't want to call it burning proper). But if it takes energy to create these products, net, then I'd say it's more akin to splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen.</p>
<p>It seems unlikely to me that any equation with HF as a product is going to be exothermic because isn't HF like the king granddaddy of reacting with stuff, making it a super high energy compound that wants to immediately slide down the energy curve at the first opportunity?</p>
<p>(Is this making sense? Chem isn't my thing.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And piggybacking on this comment I would like to clarify some stuff on the original well-described comment.</p>
<p>Hydrogen is so reactive, it will easily burn in air, without needing pure oxygen (air is approx. 1/5 oxygen) to produce water. </p>
<p>Since, the other major gases (N2, Ar, CO2) won't react with H2, normally, this will produce almost entirely water (accounting for trace amounts of other stuff). Equivalent to burning carbon to get CO2.</p>
<p>Also, you don't need a perfect ratio to get a reaction. You will just be left behind with water and the thing you had more of (compared to the ratio)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, for example the space shuttle main engines. The upside is that hydrogen is a much more efficient rocket fuel than &quot;gasoline&quot; (in practice highly refined kerosene aka RP1) but the downside is that it's harder to get a lot of thrust and the tanks need to be much bigger (which means heavier) for hydrogen and also a lot colder so that it doesn't evaporate. </p>
<p>In the last few years we see companies (spacex, blue origin) using methane engines that seem like a decent middle ground between efficiency, weight and thrust. Also for spacex there's the added benefit that it should be doable to produce methane on Mars from carbon-dioxide and water.</p></div>		</li>
