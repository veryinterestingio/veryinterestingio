			<div class="markdown"><p>There's an increase in both, but plasma volume increases more than red blood cell mass, so you still see that relative hemodilution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, 500 ml is lost after the first 24 hours of natural child birth, up 1000 ml after a C section.</p>
<p>Pregnant women have increased blood volume. It’s mostly from the fluid-retaining effects from high estrogen. It is there to better support the uterus but also to support other organs having more stress during pregnancy, such as the kidneys. Once those hormones go down, the body doesn’t hold onto as much.</p>
<p>The extra blood is likely eliminated.. the red blood cells get circulated out in time, broken down by the spleen and excreted. Extra fluid peed out and lost during lactation as the hormones change.</p></div>		</li>
