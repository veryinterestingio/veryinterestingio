			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't require massive amounts of electricity.</p>
<p>They're built using superconducting electromagnets. The materials used to make the wire for the magnet are only superconducting at very low temperatures, hence the need for liquid helium cooling.</p>
<p>Once the magnet is &quot;energized&quot; at installation, this initial electricity will flow with basically 0 resistance in the wire indefinitely, without any external power source.</p></div>		</li>
