			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank god that 25% worked on my boyfriend. So blessed they had 5 shots of narcan to get him up and going to be able to get him to the hospital. Literally witnessed his lips and fingers turn blue. I just wonder how much of a timespan he had before he wouldn't be with me anymore. It really felt like 5 minutes of them doing CPR and whatever else along with the narcan. Blessed to have got him home in time and realize what was going on ‚ô°</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So glad to hear he pulled through. His situation would be an example of where CPR is often very effective and lead to excellent outcomes if started quickly, because the underlying problem is very reversible (the narcan rapidly restores his breathing and thus oxygen supply)</p>
<p>Hope he is doing better now! üôèüèª</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Damn I'd love to have you as my doctor, very empathetic, so nice to see people like you online! I wish you the best on your journey! And he is doing excellent, no real concerns other than a tiny bit of memory loss that he had previously. He was in the ICU for about a week, most stressful time of my life! I can't even imagine what you have to see from day to day, and it's so nice to meet an actual hero! Saving lives is so honorable and I wish I had a reddit award to give you, but I'll have to resort to an upvote for now (:</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So is a heart attack specifically when the heart <em>stops</em> or is there some warning before that it is about to stop? My uncle had a heart attack last year, and he told me that he had the crushing chest pain and drove himself to the hospital, which he said was a 20ish minute drive. Then the doctor put in 4 stents and said he was 95% blocked. This doesn't seem possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The term &quot;heart attack&quot; is how we explain to laypersons when the blood vessels feeding the heart (coronary arteries) become significantly or completely blocked and the heart muscle's pumping function is compromised. When the heart &quot;stops&quot; it is called cardiac arrest, and you are literally dead at that point (even if resuscitation/CPR is underway).</p>
<p>A heart attack (known as myocardial infarction) <em>usually</em> does not cause the heart to stop completely if a person seeks medical attention in a EDIT: VERY timely manner; it is an emergency. But because different vessels feed different parts of the heart often with some overlap, they may not kill you immediately. What is important to understand is part or all of the heart muscle is under stress and not pumping as effectively as it should and will eventually fail. Depending on the degree of blockage (and therefore degree of oxygen deprivation) of the region of heart muscle fed by the blocked coronary artery, some or all of that region of muscle can die permanently and become scar. Imagine you are at the gym doing dumbbell curls and you do a bunch of curls and are starting to get fatigued-- the muscle is still functioning but the work it can do (lifting the weight) is impaired. That is what happens when the heart muscle is getting insufficient oxygen. Finally, certain vessels feeding the heart are more critical than others. Two in particular can kill you very quickly if they become sufficiently blocked (the left main coronary and/or the left anterior descending artery) because the former feeds many subsequent branching arteries while the latter feeds a large part of the left ventricle that pumps blood to the rest of the body.</p>
<p>When someone is having a heart attack they may have chest pain like your uncle but its also not uncommon to have minimal or vague symptoms like heartburn, nausea, dizziness, cough or shortness of breath. For this reason it can be very challenging for doctors especially in emergency departments or outpatient offices to rule in or out whether someone is or isn't having a heart attack. EKGs are tests showing how the electricity of the heart is working and can often show abnormalities in heart attack but can also be subtle or normal. When the heart muscle is in distress due to lack of oxygen, they can &quot;leak&quot; out certain substances into the blood that we test for and can be an important clue that something is wrong and needs further testing. Ultimately, if we suspect a heart attack, the patient has a procedure where contrast dye is injected into the heart chambers that light up the vessels in a way you can see if they are blocked or not. If this shows they are blocked, the same procedure for injecting dye allows special cardiologists to insert a &quot;stent&quot; to literally help stretch the vessel back open so blood flow to the muscle can be restored. </p>
<p>95% blockage is definitely something that a person can survive - it depends how healthy your uncle is and which vessels were blocked. I've seen plenty of 99 and 100% blockages too. Many factors are involved in whether that can cause the heart to stop or not, but I think this is a good place to stop.</p>
<p>Hopefully this answers your question but if not I can clarify further!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes...but that isn't what I said.</p>
<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code> &quot;the chance of successfully reviving someone <strong>who later goes back to a normal life</strong> is somewhere around 25%&quot;</p>
<p>CPR success is defined by ROSC (return of spontaneous circulation), or in other words, the heart was successfully restarted. Indeed, that is an important outcome because the person was resuscitated, but says nothing about the downstream consequences of cardiac arrest in the first place.</p>
<p>Every single cell and therefore organ in the body was deprived of oxygen, nutrients, and waste removal for as long as CPR was <em>not taking place</em>, and was only <strong>suboptimal</strong> when CPR <em>was taking place</em> (chest compressions are not a perfect 1:1 replacement of the lost heart pump function).</p>
<p>Unless cardiac arrest was witnessed and CPR started <strong>immediately,</strong> and ROSC was obtained in the first 3-5 minutes, you are almost guaranteed to have serious and likely permanent damage/morbidity to other organ systems. Anoxic brain injury (i.e. vegetative state or serious loss of higher brain function), ischemic/dead bowel, kidney failure, shock liver/acute liver failure, multiple rib fractures and possibly hemothorax (blood in the chest cavity - due to trauma from the chest compressions) are all extremely common following a successful but prolonged resuscitation.</p>
<p>Depending on the patient -- their age, underlying health problems, what caused the cardiac arrest among many other things -- I often stop CPR on average after 12-20 minutes if we are not successful because it becomes medically futile. Even if we manage to get a pulse back after that, it's pointless because that person will either arrest again or never be the same. I've led a CPR team for 48 minutes on a young otherwise healthy man in early 20s because he's young, and we really really really tried to salvage him for his parents after a terrible infection damaged his heart. However, if it's Grandma in her late 80s with underlying cancer or a ton of medical problems I usually call it off after 10-15 minutes, sometimes much less, to preserve what little dignity they have left. CPR is a terribly traumatic process for the person receiving it and requires judgment when you are potentially doing more harm than good.</p>
<p>Here are some sources to back up my claims about the (meaningful) success rate of CPR in case you are interested (disclaimer they are all in medical jargon):</p>

<p>Here is one from mainstream news without jargon, quoting a study in Journal of Emergency Medicine that you won't be able to read without paid access or without an institutional subscription (if you do have access, the study is linked at the end of the article): <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-cpr-expectations/cpr-survival-rates-are-lower-than-most-people-think-idUSKCN1G72SW" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-cpr-expectations/cpr-survival-rates-are-lower-than-most-people-think-idUSKCN1G72SW" target="_blank">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-cpr-expectations/cpr-survival-rates-are-lower-than-most-people-think-idUSKCN1G72SW</a></a></p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Hope this helps clarify my point. I believe very much in CPR and do everything I can to revive someone, especially when the underlying problem causing it can be reversed. But, in context to that last article I linked, I deal with so many families and loved ones who think this is the end all be all and if someone dies (e.g. from advanced illness, cancer, catastrophic organ failure) we can save them with CPR and it is just not true.</p></div>		</li>
