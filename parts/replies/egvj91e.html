			<div class="markdown"><p>You've got some good point, but friendliness =/= openness and I think that's what OP meant.</p>
<p>I'd lived in Sweden for 10+ years, I can definitely agree with OP's points. Although the interactions are friendly, they're much fewer between people than in more socializing communities. You would be very surprised to see strangers randomly start talking to each other in Sweden.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My friend and I have never experienced the level of straight rejection of social interaction that we experienced in Gothenburg, Sweden.  9/10 people at the bar we tried to talk to would turn to look at us (probably to see who we were) and then almost immediately turn their back and continue what they were doing.  The only people we ended up talking to for significant periods of time were friends of the Swede we were staying with and other foreigners.</p></div>		</li>

So I guess it's a cultural thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's rough, even more so than I'd think was the norm. Was there many people than you tried talking to? Could be just a few that reacted this way.</p>
<p>Either way, Swedes are very helpful when you ask them directly about something, it's just interactions that don't have a specific subject that get weird and there is little connection, or so has been my experience so far.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it's very common for North Americans to complain about the lack of respect that many Europeans, Middle Easterners, and Asians have for personal space compared to us.  The American punk rock band the Vandals have a song about it.  If I'm at an event like a concert that requires it, it's no big deal, but in any situation with enough space it's odd when people still stand close.  Most European countries have more than enough space to maintain arms length rules, but some cultures still stand close for some reason.  Flabbergasting for Canadians.</p></div>		</li>
