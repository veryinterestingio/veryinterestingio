			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun exercise: go through a list of famous scientists of the last few centuries and look at how many of them have literal noble titles attached to their names. I can think of two off the top of my head: Lord Kelvin and Louis, duc de Broglie. The pool of potential scientists has gotten distinctly wider.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't know about de Broglie, but Kelvin was not a lord at birth. He was born William Thomson in Belfast, and was knighted in 1866 after he overcame the problems with the first transatlantic telegraph table, and made a Lord some 16 years later. He did almost all his work before he was made a Lord.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, not everybody who knows mandarin is a mandarin teacher. What about the 80 year old chinese woman who moved with her family and barely speaks english? She can't teach you. Her kids that do the translating still aren't formally trained to get another person familiar with a language. Where the hell do you even start? It's not just easier for a guy in Japan to find a person who speaks both Navajo and Japanese, it's easier for him to find programs written in Japanese to introduce him to another language in an effective, helpful manner that might actually result in him being able to speak and interpret Navajo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think Newton was knighted after becoming famous or after his death:</p>
<p>Isaac Newton came from a family of farmers but never knew his father, also named Isaac Newton, who died in October 1642, three months before his son was born. Although Isaac's father owned property and animals which made him quite a wealthy man, he was completely uneducated and could not sign his own name.</p>
<p>Isaac's mother Hannah Ayscough remarried Barnabas Smith the minister of the church at North Witham, a nearby village, when Isaac was two years old. The young child was then left in the care of his grandmother Margery Ayscough at Woolsthorpe. Basically treated as an orphan, Isaac did not have a happy childhood.</p></div>		</li>

Whether it's 'Land of the Lotus Eaters' apathy into oblivion or 'culling of the herd, especially the idiot part', or a combination of both, something about humanity seems to &quot;need&quot; war to survive.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Conflict drives innovation. Do you think we would have invested as much in space travel if we hadn't been trying to outdo Russia?  Just look at all the products we use every day that originated from the world wars.  I'm not advocating for war, the shit we've been in recently has been more greedy power grabs than a fight for survival.  But damn if an actual threat doesn't get people thinking and investing in more creative ways, instead of going with the safe option that satisfies shareholders.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd tend to disagree, while more information was available the number of people who were properly educated even up until the 1950s and 1960s was minimal.</p>
<p>I would rather point to industry, more specifically transportation. Back in the long yesteryears if you wanted to do anything you had lug materials over mountains and across rivers and hire cowboys and whatnot. Took months or years and there was always the threat of bandits. Eventually the steam engines were invented and improved to the point that rich people discovered if they laid some tracks and started a transport company they could make a killing. Eventually this technology spread across the world and since we now had a way to transport goods quickly and safely towns and settlements started popping up further from the established ones throughout the world. This led to an explosion in population and a good number of people getting a tiny bit smarter and more educated than they already were, but not by much. Now since stuff was more spread out more resources were more easily accessable, leading to more currency making it's way around and leading to people with money doing stuff and investing in stuff that would make them more comfortable. Big factories were produced to deal with the huge influx of new materials and to use some of the new population that had exploded by now. Now more places were seeing more money in them, along with more poverty and power, all of which was usually controlled by one or two people or companies, eventually different places equalized stuff in different ways (Roosevelt with his trust busting is the one I think of) and now more people started getting educated. This made a cycle of people selling things, someone improving that something so they could sell more of it, people figuring out ways to make it cheaper, and that repeated.</p>
<p>Boom. Technological explosion.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Compared to the 1800's? Or the 1600's? Your definition of &quot;properly educated&quot; might be a bit extreme.</p></div>		</li>
