			<div class="markdown"><p>It can. I gave a really general form that applies to a whole bunch of things. A capacitor being one of them. </p>
<p>I was thinking about the energy stored in the electric double layer based on the ion distributions when I wrote it. It has to do with the ion distributions near a  charged surface in a solution. (I'm a chemist)</p>
<p>For example, If you put a positively charged electrode in salt water, the Na ions are repelled and the negative Cl ions are attracted. Diffusion tried to fix this and the resulting balance is called an electric double layer. </p>
<p>Exponential decay of the charge density and the potential as you go away from the wall is a good approximation. Incidentally, most surfaces end up slightly charged when put into water  so electric double layers are all over the place. </p>
<p>Come to think about it, electric double layers do have an associated capacitance...</p></div>		</li>

<p>Doesnâ€™t the potential energy of a charge distribution in a dielectric material show up in every intro to E&amp;M textbook, or am I confused?</p></div>		</li>
