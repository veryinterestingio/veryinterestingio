<p>If you have acid reflux overnight, that will cause a deeper voice in the morning as well. Also mucus coughs after eating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I started IF to see if it would help after basically sleeping upright the last 2 years (always had acid reflux since high school, but it had gotten really bad recently). After a few weeks of not eating past 4pm I have all but stopped dealing with it. No carbonation either, just drinking water, ESPECIALLY after 4pm. I may splurge and have a soda with lunch or something, but otherwise none. </p>
<p>I can sleep flat on my back now and even on my stomach without waking up choking on acid every night. Its drastically increased my sleep quality. Also I've been counting calories and have lost about 20lbs in the last 3 months or so, and I'm sure that had an effect on it as well. But I was able to sleep on my back before I had lost much weight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ymmv, but I got rid of my reflux by exercising regularly and eating fairly healthy (almost no fried foods). I also eliminated almost all added sugar. </p>
<p>I was actually underweight when I had it, but getting into shape seemed to help a lot.</p>
<p>I still can't drink root beer or bacardi Limon, but I very rarely get heart burn from food anymore.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wait really?  I've never dealt with the actual symptoms of acid reflux in my life but I've also pretty much always had mucus coughs while/after eating, especially fast food...</p></div>		</li>
