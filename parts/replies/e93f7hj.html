			<div class="markdown"><p>From BB: A lot of fact-checking positions are word-of-mouth (particularly in the magazine world) and they are often -- though certainly not always -- entry-level journalism jobs. Fact-check work is also typically freelance and remote, although there are rare cases where it is staff. </p>
<p>One of my personal goals is to create a public match-making site so that potential researchers / fact-checkers can find jobs more easily, and media outlets / authors can find folks to hire. </p>
<p>Some fact-checkers are also freelance journalists, and they do fact-checking to fill in their workload. I know others who are full-time fact-checkers and have made a business out of checking at podcasts, for several different magazines, or for book authors.</p>
<p>As for the day-to-day for a science editor, it depends on the publication and the specific role. For me, as a part-time editor at Undark, my hours are  a mix of reading pitches from freelancers, asking them follow-up questions, assigning stories, reading drafts of those stories and working with the writer to get it into shape, sending near-final stories to Jane and the rest of the fact-checking team, helping pick art for the final piece. Depending on the writer and the story, there may be several rounds of edits. I might ask, for example, for more sourcing or a clearer explanation of a concept. Or, the edits may focus on structure, to make sure we're framing the story in a way that is clear/fair/accurate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for all the useful information! </p>
<p>Follow up question, how would I search for a remote freelance fact checking job? Contact the media outlet directly and ask if these positions are available or is “fact-checker” a searchable job title? </p></div>		</li>
