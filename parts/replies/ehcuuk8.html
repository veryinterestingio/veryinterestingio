			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, earth curvature doesn't really have a large effect unless your distances are very long which tends to not be the case as distances shot will usually be shortened. Unless the required accuracy for a project is very high most of the time it won't matter but it does make a difference</p></div>		</li>
