			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a little confused.  Can you go more in depth into a few things for me? </p>
<p>How is a debt on one company's balance sheet is not by definition an asset on the creditor's?</p>
<p>Maybe I misread your comment, but &quot;nobody was seriously holding that debt as an asset.&quot; just doesn't sound correct to me.  Is credit card debt not by definition an asset of the credit card companies?</p>
<p>For student loan debt, isn't the asset that can &quot;pop&quot; future earnings of those in debt?  That's why people go into student debt, as an investment - the ROI is supposed to be increased future earnings.</p>
<p>Don't Bubbles &quot;pop&quot; when a material percentage of those in debt are no longer able to reasonably fund their debt service?  That was my understanding, but based on your comment it looks like you believe it has to do with the value of assets that secures the asset backed debt?  I thought it had more to do with cash flow evaporating than valuation.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>EDIT:  If it helps, I'm approaching this from an accountant's view.  You seem to be coming from investment banking, so we might be using different definitions of assets and liabilities.  If that's it, can you explain the difference between what you mean by an asset, and an accounting asset?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There needs to be enough size to matter. Yes, CC receivables are an asset to the holder; however, if it’s 0.00001%, who cares? Keep in mind that I’m very small dollars (relatively speaking) mortgages default all the time; it’s just not enough to matter. </p>
<p>In the student loan example, the SLABS constitute about 1.2% of the market; even if 10% ‘zero default’ (eg full default and zero recovery) it’s just not enough to matter bc those SLABS are spread out and hedged. </p>
<p>It’s the size/concentration that matters. In the case of the 08 crisis, the big banks had <em>huge</em> percentages of their ‘safe’ capital tied directly/indirectly to the mortgage mkts, and then an even bigger percentage in their risk capital. I’m probably getting this slightly wrong, but I think it was Merrill that had ~25% to 30% of their capital base in either mortgage loans or derivatives ties to mortgage loans. AIG had like 70% of its reserve book tied to the mortgage market. </p>
<p>Bubbles pop on the asset side, not the debt side. I scream this all the time about the 08 crisis. In 08, the failure in debt service never happened - this is how the govt made so so much money. The bubble popped bc people FEARED that the loans wouldn’t perform, so ppl sold them in mass, driving down the price. </p>
<p>You have a bank with $50 in assets (held debt, such as CMBS), $45 in debt (callable accts, etc) and $5 in equity. Ppl freak out, and sell down the $50 in CMBS, so suddenly it’s worth $44, and the bank is in technical universal default - <strong><em>poof</em></strong> - it no longer exists. That’s why 08 happened in about a 60day span - as CMBS liquidated, the banks weakened on the asset side until their equity slivers disappeared. Then the govt stepped in to issue ‘safe’ treasury debt and swap w the ‘dangerous’ debt. The Big Short is a lie; the banks weren’t selling dangerous shit to other ppl. The banks believed in the shit - that’s why they were holding it as assets. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A/R is an asset and the loans you owe someone else are assets on their books as A/R. The previous commenter is correct about this. I think the confusion is a matter of wording - you say &quot;held as assets&quot; but it sounds like you mean secured debt: debt with a capital asset as collateral which can be remarketed to recover a portion of the losses if the borrower defaults on their obligation. </p>
<p>Mortgages are secured; a home can be foreclosed on and resold to recover losses on a bad mortgage. Credit cards are <em>generally</em> not secured - the only recourse a cc company has on bad debt is sending you to collections and ruining your credit.  Federal student loans are also not secured <em>and</em> extremely difficult to discharge in bankruptcy, so there's nothing for them to repossess and remarket to recover losses, but there's <em>also</em> very little threat of having to take a total loss on the loan.  I'd argue it's that second part that makes student loans not a bubble, not the fact that they're unsecured. Since you can basically hold a borrower responsible until the heat-death of the universe, they're pretty low-risk, especially if you're buying them for pennies on the dollar (as most do).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Accountant here, it sounds like they mean collateral, not assets. So secured debt. Not sure how secured debt is a requirement for a bubble though, I also would assume it's more to do with the risk of cash flow evaporating. </p></div>		</li>
