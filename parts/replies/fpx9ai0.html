			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh. That's possible. It usually happens when something sad happens that should make me cry, or when certain songs come on. I'll feel like I'm aboit, and right when it feels like the tears are about to spill out, I feel something kind of click and the sensation just vanishes. I've tried listening to this one song that can reliably do this to me and TRYING to cry to jt and this happens every time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What has been working for me to trace back my emotions is mindfulness meditation. My experience is not quite as profound as yours, but if I feel like I want to cry, I can concentrate on the emotion to where it's stems from. After a numbers of times, I have an understanding of the pattern of what caused it and how I will react to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a similar issue when I'm upset that I'm wondering if someone's response will be able to answer. I'm struggling with a lot atm and sometimes I really, really need to just cry and cry... I'll cry for like 5 seconds really hard, and then stop and can't for a minute, and then it will repeat. It's frustrating.</p></div>		</li>
