			<div class="markdown"><p>Somewhat. The clothing deteriorates a bit just from wear. In addition, the friction from washing the clothes also deteriorates the clothing. Some of the fuzz is carried away by the water that exits the washer or the washer's filter. Some of the fuzz clients to the clothes.</p>
<p>Machine drying will create more friction and will help to filter out the fuzz. If you line dry it, you won't accrue fuzz created by friction in the drier, but there still will be fuzz from the friction in the washer. This fuzz will remain stuck to the clothing, and some will blow away in the wind during the line drying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Jeans most likely. I get red lint when I do my towels. Jeans are coarse and more likely to snag (for lack of a better term). That's why a lot of people hang their jeans to keep the from fading.</p></div>		</li>
