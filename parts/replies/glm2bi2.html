<p>“Evolution has no foresight. Complex machinery develops its own agendas. Brains <em>cheat.</em> <strong>Feedback loops evolve to promote stable heartbeats and then stumble upon the temptation of rhythm and music.</strong> The rush evoked by fractal imagery, the algorithms used for habitat selection, metastasize into art. Thrills that once had to be <em>earned</em> in increments of fitness can now be had from pointless introspection. Aesthetics rise unbidden from a trillion dopamine receptors, and the system moves beyond modeling the organism. It begins to model the very <em>process</em> of modeling. It consumes evermore computational resources, bogs itself down with endless recursion and irrelevant simulations. Like the parasitic DNA that accretes in every natural genome, it persists and proliferates and produces nothing but itself. Metaprocesses bloom like cancer, and awaken, and call themselves <em>I.</em>”<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every time I listen to music I'm tapping my feet or arms or fingers to the drum pattern, or even grinding my teeth to it (no clue how to explain that one). It's something I've always done as I started playing drums at a really young age, but stopped for a long time and still did/do it. People often tell me to stop and say it's annoying but I just start up again after 30 seconds without even thinking. Even when I'm not listening to music I'm constantly making up and playing drum patterns.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I started playing drums at a very young age, and I also play along to music by “grinding/tapping” my teeth! I’ve never really spoken to anyone else about it because it’s hard to properly explain it.</p>
<p>I have to constantly focus and stop myself from doing it so I don’t damage my teeth because surely it’s not a good thing. I’m also constantly playing along with any music I hear either on tables or the steering wheel, and it’s usually without even realising it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There really isn't legitimate debate on whether or not they exist. They were directly recorded from in monkey brains. You might be thinking of:  there was for some time a question as to whether or not they existed in human brains, because their existence in human brains was only inferred from neuroimaging studies, which can't really tell us about individual neurons. However, there are now direct single unit recordings from human brains demonstrating the presence of mirror neurons. </p>
<p>As for the role they play in empathy, imitation, and all the other things that have been attributed to them, that is an area of lively debate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's actually theories that this is HOW we think, that the &quot;currency&quot; our brain uses is proprioception and interroception.(The sense of position of our limbs and the sense of state of the body like hungry cold or hyped) so it makes sense that musicians understand music via proprioception. Theoretically every thing we learn has to somehow be connected to a sense for us to understand it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I started reading &quot;The man who mistook his wife for a hat&quot; this week and there is a story in there about a lady who had infected spinal fluid fuck up her nerves and she lost all proprioception and couldn't keep track of her body parts unless looking at them. The description of her limbs just flailing around uncontrollably was equal parts sad, terrifying and hilarious...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to have a ferret who had a stroke. When I talk about him I say he was paraplegic just for simplicity's sake. </p>
<p>In reality, he could move his limbs from the &quot;waist&quot; down, he'd just lost proprioception in them, so he couldn't walk. At first he'd stagger around like he was drunk, but then he obviously couldn't go very fast. After a few days of that he started dragging himself around on his belly, but that irritated his stomach so I had to start lubing the ferret to keep it from getting infected. I had to clean him several times a day because he'd make a mess over himself every time he went to the litter tray. After a few weeks of that he learned to tilt his hips to one side as he &quot;ran&quot; around, and the layer of fur protected him from irritation. He never got as fast as he used to be, but he still got up a fair bit of speed, especially on hardwood floors. Little dude got totally ripped in his shoulders and front legs. </p>
<p>For the next year until he died of the heart failure that gave him the stroke, his back legs never stopped &quot;running&quot;.</p>
<p>He actually started taking his first steps again only a couple of weeks before...</p>
<p>(We tried to make him a ferret-sized wheelchair, but he hated it because it made litter trays and manoeuvrability difficult. And yes, he did learn to poop without use of back legs - healthy ferrets back into corners but he worked out how to poop and &quot;walk&quot; at the same time so he'd leave it behind him, it was kinda neat that he worked out how to do that! Saved me giving him a sponge bath several times a day, too.)</p></div>		</li>
