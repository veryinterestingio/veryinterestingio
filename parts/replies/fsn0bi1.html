			<div class="markdown"><p>There are people like me who suffer from misophonia. The sound of eating doesn't just bother me... it can basically trigger my flight or fight response where I need to physically leave or I start getting angry or shudder in disgust. It's just an overhwhelming feeling of negativity towards the sound. Doesn't matter whether their mouth is open or closed. Sucks when you're just trying to eat some tortilla chips with your girlfriend.</p>
<p>Edit: Changed taco to tortilla. I have realized the error of my ways.</p>
<p>Edit #2: It's amazing how many people responded to this comment. Sorry if I did not respond to you. Thank you for all of the suggestions.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It still tortures me that i got the urge to hit my grandmother. I don't want to hit anyone, even less so family, even less so elderly family. The sound was just... The sound...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My poor granny didn't had the opportunity of receiving a proper upbringing, and she MAKES SO MUCH DAMN NOISE eating (cuttlery, glassware, slurping, dentures shifting around, clicking mouth sounds, sorbing through and loudly wiping her nose, <em>so much burping and retching</em>, etc.), It makes me mad, like I feel the impulse to punch a wall. I simply learnt to excuse myself and do something productive while she eats (finish cooking, start cleaning dishes, etc.), and have my own meal standing in the kitchen or sitting at the edge of my bed once she had finished eating and invariably fallen asleep.</p>
<p>It's my problem, not hers, so she shouldn't have to stand my disgust and bad mood.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think that's all of them for me. Eating and throat clearing are the worst and make me want to be violent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about this. Speech isn't just one frequency, especially considering the differences in pitch of peoples' voices. I would also think that that logic would imply that many musical instruments would hurt as well, when they are played in the pitch range of a voice.</p>
<p>Edit: after some quick googling, the relation to speech seems to be an untested hypothesis. It very well may be a correlation but not a causation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This right here. As far as I can see, this post is total bunk, or at least is incomplete. There are so many things in this world that occupy the frequency of human speech but aren't human speech, so even if that was part of the reason nails on the chalkboard bothers us (which is still an &quot;if&quot;) that wouldn't be the whole story.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a range of frequencies. Musical instruments often sound painful when played badly - an out of tune violin, for example: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyM0tBmFSYI" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyM0tBmFSYI" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyM0tBmFSYI</a></a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that there's some other quality of the sound other than purely the frequency range that causes it to be so bad. I guarantee that white noise filtered to only include that frequency range would not sound that bad. There's something else going on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny enough my dog will react really badly to badly played violin and start crying, howling, and yelping until it stops. If you start playing it nicely she just tilts her head back and forth. I think you're right and maybe the dog is hearing what you're talking about where played badly it sounds distressing but normally it sounds...normal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, I am pretty sure it is not remotely similar frequency. Frequency = pitch, and voices generally have a much deeper pitch than the high pitched scraping sound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fundamental of human voices is low, but there are tons and tons of harmonics that are actually perceived louder than the fundamental due to the fact that our ears are more sensetive to those frequencies. </p>
<p>A lot of music has <em>a lot</em> of low end cut out of the vocal and it doesn't suddenly sound less human. The fundamental is really not responsible for a large percentage of the overall frequency spectrum that we perceive for human voices. </p>
<p>Not to mention, our hearing is most sensitive around the midrange regardless. Whether that evolved from needing to hear human voices or not doesn't change that fact, which is still relevant to the question</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And that explanation doesn't at all apply to me. My reaction isn't to the sound itself but the thought of touching my fingernails to it myself. It causes a visceral reaction that's just a small taste of what happens if I accidentally brush my nails over a chalkboard or any similar surface. I dread changing my car tabs because a license plate, especially a dirty one, is the same texture.</p>
<p>When that happens I'm fucking ruined for up to an hour. My mind and body don't feel right. I want to crawl into a hole and die until the feeling passes. It feels like all my organs want to jump out of my skin. Hearing the sound makes me imagine it and causes a smaller scale episode.</p></div>		</li>
