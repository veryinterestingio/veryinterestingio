<p>Short means you never had to show up at practice after a growth spurt and relearn how to do your routine because now you can't do it the way you used to.</p>
<p>Did you see the 2000 Sydney vault controversy where the apparatus was set up two inches too low? Now imagine it's just your body that's suddenly two inches too long because you grew a lot one summer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Different sports have different body types that are ideal. Gymnastics involves a lot of balancing and tumbling. Short people have a lower centre of gravity and can make tighter rotations when tumbling and turning.</p>
<p>Tall and lean people make better competitive swimmers because they have longer limbs that move more water with each stroke. Excessively muscled people would expend too much energy since muscle is heavier than water.</p>
<p>There's really a lot more to it than that. Ideal body types for sports deal with height, musculature, limb length, cardiovascular capacity and so on.</p>
<p>And having an ideal body type can be a great advantage. In the 80s an Australian sports institute did a talent search where they tried to find teenagers with ideal body types for certain sports and train them.</p>
<p>They found that 16-year-old Megan Still had a perfect body for rowing even though she never rowed before. About six years later, they coached her to Olympic gold.</p>
<p>And since body types really matter, so do genetics. Kenyans have a genetic disposition to body types that make them fantastic runners. It doesn't mean every Kenyan is a potential Olympic winner but their genes do produce a noticeably larger number of above-average runners.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spinning and doing flips, etc. is easier when you are shorter. Same for divers. There is also an strength-to-weight ratio thing that favors smaller people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Found out the same about dancing a few years ago.  My large-breasted friend was pushed to stop being a ballerina.  She got it so much she eventually lost interest.  It really sucks but she eventually got over it and became a veterinarian so sheâ€™s happy now.</p></div>		</li>
