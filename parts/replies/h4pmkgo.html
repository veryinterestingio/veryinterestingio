<p>If you using a mouse in excel, you'll never reach your final form.</p>
<p>Its probably a bit of a myth of them actually taking away the mouse, but a proper analyst will take pride in completely avoiding use of the mouse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Other then for faster scrolling I'm not sure why you would need a mouse. Everyone knows a good coder never comes back to previous lines! You just write more stuff to fix the bad code. (It's programming humor in case someone gets cranky)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Scroll lock is another key that exists almost solely for navigation of spreadsheets. If you are in Excel and you turn on ScrollLock you can use the arrow keys to move the screen without losing the cell that you're in so you can pan up and right to see columns/rows you may be missing but still be able to type in your selected cell. Again, just a key that exists almost solely for improved navigation in spreadsheet programs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scroll Lock existed before spreadsheet applications. Scroll lock would prevent text from flowing off screen as more text was output to the screen.</p></div>		</li>
