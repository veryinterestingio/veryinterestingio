<p>Making it even harder, &quot;plastic&quot; encompasses a broad variety of materials and if you don't separate your #1 plastic from your #2 or #6 you don't get plastic you can reuse at the end, you just get mush with uncertain properties</p>

<p>That’s one of the biggest issues with PET plastics, which are one of the most commonly recycled types. PLA (which is actually compostable) will often get thrown into the mix, as the average person won’t be able to tell them apart without looking at the markings (which few do). This can make the whole mixture into unusable plastic trash.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have (wherever you're from) different bins for different plastic?
I'm from Germany and I'd say we have a quite good recycling system but I never thought about separating my plastic. Should I start it? If yes - how?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on if there are different bins to accept different kinds of plastics. Assuming it's done the same in Germany as it is in the US, there's a number on, usually, the bottom. <a href="https://ecostrategiesgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Plastics-Symbols-2.jpg" target="_blank">It looks like this in the US.</a> The different numbers are different kinds of plastics, which is why they need to be grouped accordingly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In most of EU, PET-bottles are recycled at the store, and the bar codes on the bottles will decide if its an accepted bottle or not.</p>
<p>For plastics in the trash bins, there are usually signs and labels <em>which</em> kinds of plastic are going to the &quot;plastic&quot; bin.</p>
<p>Sometimes there are a &quot;hard plastic&quot; and a &quot;soft plastic&quot; bin, still with signs and labels which is going where.  </p>
<p>Some plastic items that doesn't fit either description and doesn't have either markings should go to the &quot;other&quot;/&quot;burnable&quot; bin.  </p>
<p>Complex composites, items made of several types of plastic or other materials are supposed to go with bulky waste.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add on to this, making virgin plastic is cheaper than going through the process of cleaning, sorting, and recycling it only to end up with a slightly inferior product (as you so brilliantly put, the inevitable couscous). And there’s not only contamination from foods and other plastic types, but even the dyes to get a green Sprite bottle and the adhesive used to stick the label on a soda bottle adds to those impurities. It’s not a process people are jumping to invest in because it’ll save the earth but it will ultimately lose money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good answer but I'd focus more on the economics. Aluminum is cheaper to recycle than to extract, because of how cheap petroleum is to mine, crack, etc., it is cheaper to make new than to recycle. Mechanical is cheaper but doesn't make high quality recycled polymer. Chemical is more popular in Europe and generates essentially good as virgin, but expensive and uses highly caustic chemicals.</p></div>		</li>
