			<div class="markdown"><p>Two issues with this</p>
<p>1) by enabling a low resistance runoff you could decrease blood flow to the higher resistance capilaries im the limb</p>
<p>2) you can cause what is referred to as high output heart failure, this is seen in dialysis grafts that get too big</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iâ€™m curious too and just wanna make sure I got this.. so before the blood hits the end of the artery, it would have gone past multiple arterioles, venules and capillaries. The blood then flows through these and goes back to the heart through the veins?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure.  Keep in mind that any major arterial vessel is carrying blood for the tissue that is downstream of that point.  Everything upstream of that point was already fed off that branch through the capillaries that connect back to the venous side.  So the blood in a major vessel at any given severed point is no longer necessary.  For example, if you sever an arm at the elbow you'd cut through the brachial artery, which is fairly well sized at that point, but all the blood it's carrying is intended for the forearm and hand, the biceps/tris have already been fed.  So long as you close off the artery and vein the upper arm will continue to be fed through the existing system.</p>
<p>I would assume that some of those systems will expand a bit (arteriogenesis) since the options for fluid flow have been reduced substantially.  But it shouldn't have changed that much upstream of the injury.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes. an artery isn't a sealed tube that goes to an end, becomes a capillary then returns as a vein. as an artery heads down your arm, it is giving off lots of arterioles along the way. those arterioles become capillaries, then venules, then enter a vein. so up and down the entire arm, blood is being exchanged between arteries and veins via a network of capillaries.</p></div>		</li>
