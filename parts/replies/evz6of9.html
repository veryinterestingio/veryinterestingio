			<div class="markdown"><p>To keep it sterile? A proper antiseptic would do as good a job, if not better. Having a high salt gradient in the solution you are soaking it though can also draw out water from the pus/inflammation build up, which will help relieve pain, as well as killing most bacteria present.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Getting in the salt water for hours playing within 2 days it cleared all the way up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Filling a bowl with an antiseptic would be fairly expensive (on a casual basis) compared to some epsom salts in a tub and fill with warm sink water. Also, much of that antiseptic is wasted since its not in direct contact with the skin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Salt water will dilute pus and other junk while killing most bacteria. </p>
<p>While an antiseptic would mostly just kill what is there, but since you just apply on top of whatever is there you ain't removing anything.</p>
<p>Often a combinaison of both is better: soak, dry, apply.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eventually yes. The cells of your skin are excellent at retaining water - that’s one of the reasons you have skin, to keep your tissue fluid from leaking out - but water will always move towards the highest salt concentration eventually, and dry you out and mummify you. Sugar can do the same thing. A friend of mine works at a sugar mill and they regularly pull completely dried-out animals from the vats. Mostly birds and possums that fall in by mistake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true about sugar. WARNING: graphic story ahead</p>
<p>When I was in my very early teens, I used to go spend a couple of weeks every summer with my uncle who was/is a large animal veterinarian. This particular summer he was in Milton, FL - a rural area outside of Pensacola. We were on a farm call for a cow in distress, but the specifics were not given before we got here. When we arrived, we found a cow with a completely prolapsed uterus in a cattle hold. To say the least, I was pretty disturbed by the scene. My uncle, being the quick thinker and very pragmatic, determined that in order to get the swelling down and get the uterus back inside the animal as quickly as possible before permanent damage had been done, rushed us to the store and bought several pounds of crystalized white sugar. We worked together to pour the sugar onto the prolapse and reduce the swelling, all the while working the uterus back into where it belonged. Finally after about a half hour of coating, scraping and pushing, we finally got that bugger back in. I asked at one point why we didn't use salt, and he mentioned that the salt would have damaged the tissue far more than the sugar did. I actually have some pictures somewhere of the prolapse and him pushing it back in. </p>
<p>tl;dr: sugar works very well as a dessicant, and is safer to use on living tissue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;Interesting&quot; question is if it would be appreciably accelerated in comparison to our normal environment of unsaturated air.  After all, water will happily leave skin for the air as well.</p>
<p>As long as you have a supply of fresh water to balance it against, it should probably be fine.</p></div>		</li>
