			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh man. This definitely doesn't explain it to someone like they are five, but it's finally a correct answer. </p>
<p>The top comment is &quot;we hit the metal to push it into place&quot; and it's actually quite wrong. </p>
<p>Thanks for being correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aha yeah i definitely got a little caught up in my explanation. Top comment actually has it backwards, you want to increase the free energy of the material, not reduce it, which is the opposite of what happening in the box of nails analogy</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, question when it comes to casting vs, say, hammering out a bloom or something.</p>
<p>I'm under the impression that casting steel is much harder than casting, well, cast iron. In the case of traditional blacksmiths, that would mean if you're casting a shape you would have a much higher carbon content that you actually want.</p>
<p>I think this has to do with how molten steel will absorb carbon in the air, but I'm not sure?</p></div>		</li>
