			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn’t the domino falling even be different even on earth depending on elevation? Like I know it would be a <em>tiny</em> difference, but if someone is defining difference as a trillionth of a second or something, couldn’t you even say humidity? The amount of friction it encounters in the fall would have to change it right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What they said, but I'll also chime in to say that the time a domino takes to fall probably has error bars on the scale of milliseconds.  If you make a very precise automated rig that pushes the domino over with the &quot;exact&quot; same force (well, +/- 1 mN), same direction(+/- 1 urad), same position (+/- 1 nm), and you do it in a vacuum (+/- 1 m\^-3), you can probably shrink that scale down to microseconds.  The differences you can measure are limited by the errors in your experiment, and your total error isn't the sum of all your errors, but the product of them.  It's going to be impossible to reduce the errors enough that they won't drown out the difference something like elevation might have.</p></div>		</li>
