			<div class="markdown"><p>With Neanderthals and Denisovans, sure but Homo Erectus, not that we know of (recently). I didn't mention Neanderthals because there's some debate over even classifying them as a different species given we interbred so much and so often.</p>
<p>EDIT: There are some claims about Homo Erectus admixture but as far as I know, none of that was conclusively shown through DNA evidence. However, there's no reason to think we wouldn't have been compatible so we probably would have been able to produce offspring.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to an article I read recently ( and if I'm remembering correctly) , they've also identified some genetic markers that there may be a third currently undiscovered relative that may have interbreeded with us as well. My understanding was that while mutations or other factors may be the cause, another spieces was the most likely candidate. There was also something about how the markers were in a much smaller percent of our population than markers from the other 2, so it may have a more localized event. I may be misremembering, or have misunderstood something, so if I'm wrong feel free to correct me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Genetics is weird, considering Chimpanzees and Bonobos share 98.8% of the human genome and I've read Neanderthals and Denisovans may have been around 98% (but depending on sample, may have been 99% and contained human genome, so hard to call). I remember there was some Mule effect, when the male donkey and female horse produces a sterile child.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Animals can interbreed with animals of the same genus</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is it just me, or is this kind of an unsatisfying answer? Humans made up the concept of a &quot;genus&quot; based on a definition that's useful to us; it feels more like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Being put in the same genus means you can interbreed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What's the genetic reason? Is it something about chromosomes? Is it too complicated to ELI5?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Often new species are generated within a genus because of some physical barrier, such as the Congo river separating bonobos or chimpanzees, over time differences will accumulate that can prevent interbreeding.</p>
<p>Chromosomal changes, such as rearrangements or fusions are examples of such changes.  For chimps and the homo lines for example, the first two chromosomes present in the human-chimp common ancestor species fused in the human line - creating a quite large chromosome 1 and resulting in the homo lines having having 1 less pair of chromosomes than chimps or the most recent common human-chimp ancestor. So these chromosomes can no longer line up properly during zygosis (fusion of sperm and egg).</p>
<p>Portions of the chromosomes can also rearrange so its definitely possible to have species within the same genus which cannot produce viable zygotes - so I donâ€™t think genus alone is sufficient to declare two species can interbreed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>These things are directly related though - animals are classified into the same genus because they're very similar, they're very similar because they share a common ancestor relatively recently, they can interbreed because they're similar.</p>
<p>The more recently two species share a common ancestor, the fewer differences there are in their genetic code</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thee can be multiple reasons two species can't interbreed. There are official words for these terms but I can't remember them since this was like 6 years of schooling ago for me. They can be roughly grouped into two categories: pre and post zygotic. </p>
<p>Prezygotic means that the reason happens before the sperm meets the egg. Postzygotic means that the reason happens after the sperm meets the egg. </p>
<p>Prezygotic stuff can range from the species not existing in the same period of time or place, to stuff like penis doesnt fit in vagina. </p>
<p>Postzygotic would be chromosome/genetic stuff. Stuff like the sperm doesnt contain the proper characteristics to interact with the egg, orthe child can't survive past 1-2 weeks after the sperm meets the egg due to rejection or womb environment</p></div>		</li>
