			<div class="markdown"><p>The chemicals that we associate with spicy food bind to receptors that our body associates with heat or acid. It's safe to assume that the reason some people react that way is because the GI tract is under attack. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mainly because the capsacinoids that cause the spicy flavour work on most cels, not just taste, this is why pepper spray works. It also works on the cells in you GI tract. In many people this does nothing noticeable at all for reasonable amounts of spice. In some people, especially those with pre-existing things like gastroenteritis or other conditions that cause increases sensitivity or inflammation, you body decides that it wants to get rid of it as fast as possible.</p>
<p>Oils and grease is interesting though, might imply that you have a problem with lipid digestion, you might want to speak to a doctor about that.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Bile from the gallbladder is involved with this, and gallbladder problems aren't that uncommon, especially in older adults.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chewing gum is basically you tricking your gut into thinking it is eating so yes, your body just knows you are chewing so the stomach gets the acid going while the rest of you makes space.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Partially true partially not. It’s a lot more complex than your statement- one of the larger contributors are receptors in the stomach itself - stretch, chemo (lipid, amino acid, pH, osmotic pressure) as well as in the duodenum, as well as other sections of bowel.  This is particularly true of gastric emptying - so while sensory inputs from the mouth and brain are somewhat triggering bowel motility, they are not a main driver - they are more the start, and the body needs further input to really impact motility. </p>
