			<div class="markdown"><p>The best sleep I have ever gotten was when I had mattresses that were soft enough that my body sinks down a bit, but then firm enough to hold and support me there. It was like being hugged firmly by a giant marshmallow. I always slept on my back, and I have NEVER been a back sleeper.   </p>
<p>One of the mattresses that achieved that was actually a cheap air mattress that I got, and I kept it partially inflated. Ohh it was so good</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you can afford it - foam mattress on an adjustable base. Trust me.</p>
<p>Or bodies are biggest in the middle and air mattresses always stretch some so we sink in the middle. It puts us in a natural zero g position and relieves all the pressure points.</p>
<p>Best thing I've ever purchased (after my bbq...) is that combination to sleep on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We own a very stiff foam mattress with a thin layer of soft memory foam on top, and the whole thing sits on an adjustable base.</p>
<p>It's amazing. The top layer sinks in far enough to fully adapt to your shape and spreads out the weight enough to evenly rest it on the stiffer parts of the mattress.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iâ€™ve found as a side sleeper that I want a firm mattress with a good pad on top. The bit of sink helps me stay comfortable with my shoulders, while also supporting my core and hips which I used to have problems with. </p>
<p>I want the firm mattress because I need the support, and being extremely broad shouldered, the right pillow height is 2-3 pillows of varying thicknesses</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a fellow side sleeper, I would suggest a body pillow. It really helps my top leg get into the right position so it's not pulling my spine in a funny direction. They're really comfy to hold, too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Highly recommend the really big c-shaped pregnancy pillows for side-sleepers.  Especially if you have bad knees. Game changer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've got stupid broad shoulders and was always a side slapper.</p>
<p>You're dead on about the - I have a toper on mine as well.</p>
<p>A couple things -</p>
<p>If you can possibly gain yourself to sleep on your back, you will be so much happier long term - a mattress can help, but it's really hard to get good even support on your side.</p>
<p>Is stupidly hard to do.. I bought a movement base to help keep me on my back.</p>
<p>If I can't convince you to try that, get two extra pillows (in not a fan of body pillows, but YMMV) wrap your arms around one and hug it close. This keeps your shoulders in line and will help keep your arm from going under your pillow which is really hard on the shoulder long term. Take the other pillow and put it between your upper legs. This straightens the hips and helps keep your body straight.</p>
<p>It'll take months to get used to it, but you'll appreciate it.. And since we spend 1/4-1/3 of our lives sleeping, it's worth the effort.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Am also side sleeper but sometimes sleep on my back. The few nights a year my body will let me sleep on my back is the best sleep I ever get and waking up feels a lot less like turning on some kinda ancient robot.</p>
<p>Side sleepers, if you can switch, do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing to note: back sleeping is associated with more incidence of night mares. (Source numerous web articles) I read an article I cannot find right now that hypothesized that we feel more vulnerable on our backs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's amazing how much more enjoyable your life is with a good night's sleep.</p>
<p>I have a fantastic set up at home, but spent well over half of the last 4 years in hotels for work.</p>
<p>I hear a lot of people always tell me that they love hotel beds.</p>
<p>Hotel beds suck and anyone who says that legitimately needs a new set up at home.</p>
<p>Sleep well!</p></div>		</li>
