			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing that many people are surprised to hear is that it is recommended to change your case every 3 months. It's important to keep both your lenses and your case clean by cleaning with solution. There are other tips here: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/contactlenses/protect-your-eyes.html" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/contactlenses/protect-your-eyes.html" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/contactlenses/protect-your-eyes.html</a></a> </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't it wasteful and bad for the environment to use a new plastic case every 3 months? Why not just sterilize one case and reuse it?</p>
<p>Also, I found that the cases that come with contact lense solutions hold more solution than the cheap flip top cases I can purchase separately that work just as well. I found I go through less expensive solution when I don't use the case that comes with the solution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cases will usually have a thin antibacterial coating on the inside that wears off with all the rinsing. Rule of thumb is change your case with every new bottle of solution (which is why most bottles purchased come with new cases)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Remember that 100 companies account for something like like 70% of worldwide emissions. A person reusing a small piece of plastic for 3 months and needing to swap it at that point for health reasons, is really actually pretty good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No risk(no, all CL have blinding potential)
All lenses are the same(no, highly specific/fit to the patient)
if the lens doesn't have correction(&quot;plano&quot;) it can be safely dispensed over the counter(No, ALL lenses are medical devices and must fit the contours of your eye=proper base curve)
one size fits all(no, must fit the contours of your eye)
Sleeping/napping/swimming in CL are OK(No, these greatly enhance risk of blinding infection).
Saline(or even water) is the same as disinfecting solution(No, you should NEVER use anything other than multipurpose soln or peroxide soln to disinfect.)</p></div>		</li>
