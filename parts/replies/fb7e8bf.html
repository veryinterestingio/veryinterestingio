			<div class="markdown"><p>Anything that involves getting dizzy is the vestibular system. Even when you’re drunk the alcohol influences the parts in the vest. System thus making you dizzy. </p>
<p>Its a very tough organ to understand but its definitely one of the most interesting ones</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I learned all about the vestibular system this summer. I tripped and fell earlier this year and a few months later couldn’t stop feeling lightheaded. Went to a neurologist and turns out my vestibular system was all out of whack and had to be recalibrated. Took a few months of physical therapy (of which I was very skeptical) but it fixed me right up. Pretty bizarre.</p></div>		</li>
