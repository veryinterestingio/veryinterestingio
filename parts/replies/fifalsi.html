			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't fully agree with you, since one of the big advantages of apoptosis over necrosis for a multicellular organism is the avoidance of membrane rupture. The content of the cell is then compartmentalized into many small apoptotic vesicles that can safely be digested by macrophages and other phagocytes without causing inflammation by the release of danger-associated molecules of the cell.</p></div>		</li>
