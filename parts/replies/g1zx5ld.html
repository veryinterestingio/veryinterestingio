			<div class="markdown"><p>They really don't tho. The above answer is not correct. Pilots are specifically advised not to descend. People have died doing so. Wiggling the wings is also not recommended. Orbit the area and notify ATC or call on the emergency frequency. Squawk 7700 if appropriate. I've heard the recommendation to flash the strobe light. Keep the people in sight until a) you pass the effort onto search and rescue b) you are directed to do otherwise by ATC or SAR c) Until continuing to do so will compromise the safety of flight. The chaps on the ground may not know you have spotted them, but that doesn't matter. *edit More info <a href="https://imgur.com/a/WETLxqH" target="_blank">https://imgur.com/a/WETLxqH</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>7700 would not be appropriate in this scenario. 7700 is for emergencies and this is not. There also isn't a need to stop in the area and look. One, so they can simply tell the controller something like &quot;back about 10nm there was a small island and seemed to be a giant SOS sign blah blah blah SAR should check out the coordinates‚Äù. There will probably be at least two crew members in the cockpit so they have more than enough to communicate and find out the coordinates at the same time.</p>
<p>Edit: I should have been more clear. Yes, it is an emergency for the people on the island, but not the aircraft.</p></div>		</li>
