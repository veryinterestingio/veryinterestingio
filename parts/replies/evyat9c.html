			<div class="markdown"><p>Russian and other Slavic languages also have a distinction between animate and inanimate masculine nouns in some forms.</p>
<p>And modern Swedish merges the masculine and feminine, while still having a distinction between these and the neuter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just curious, what do you call the a/an distinction when it comes to English?  And was there ever such a distinction for &quot;the&quot; previously?  I know that &quot;thee / thy / thine&quot; are basically different usages for &quot;your&quot; and aren't actually related to &quot;the&quot;.  </p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>An apple.</p>
<p>A pie.</p>
<p>An apple pie.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The a/an distinction is actually a relatively recent development. The indefinite article &quot;an&quot; is originally from Old English <em>ān</em>, meaning &quot;one&quot;. Over the centuries, people started dropping the -n in front of consonants for ease of pronunciation.</p>
<p>Old English still preserved the gender system, with the definite article taking any of four forms: masculine <em>se</em>, neuter <em>þæt</em>, feminine <em>sēo</em>, and plural <em>þā</em>; the þ is pronounced with a th sound. (Actually, there were several other forms of the definite article, since Old English also had a complex case system which has since been mostly dropped, but these are the standard nominative forms.) Modern English &quot;the&quot; comes from the masculine <em>se</em>, while the word &quot;that&quot; derives from the neuter <em>þæt</em>, and the word &quot;she&quot; likely derives from the feminine <em>sēo</em>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I would guess this is more about ease of talking. Using 'an' before another vowel sound prevents a double glottal stop, which is more effort to speak.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The French call this a liaison, which is the pronunciation of a final consonant before a word beginning with a vowel. Though usually the consonant is already there in French, just not pronounced.</p></div>		</li>
