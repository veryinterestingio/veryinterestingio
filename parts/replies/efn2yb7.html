			<div class="markdown"><p>$20k? Blimey! I remember my mum getting a Mac at work back in 1988 or something. With a LaserWriter II. Thing weighed about 2 tons and cost more than the Mac. And had a more powerful processor!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In commercial graphic arts, if you wanted to create an ad or a page of a magazine, you'd create the original, a &quot;mechanical paste-up&quot; made of all of the individual components. So you'd paste (or cement or glue) the headline, text, footnotes, etc. onto a sheet of heavy paper or lightweight board. After you lined everything up, you'd shoot it with a &quot;copy camera&quot;, which would not only produce a single copy but, because of multi-angled lights, would eliminate all of the inevitable shadows of the individual pieces. And you could enlarge or reduce everything as part of the process.</p>
<p>Copy cameras could be absolutely huge, since the focal plane might have to hold a 16x20-inch piece of photo paper. The camera back would be inside the darkroom while the rest of the camera would be outside. I once saw a copy camera that must have had an 8-foot long bellows, probably held 20x30 or even larger paper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A place I worked at in Buffalo had a huge copy camera bought from a defunct print house in LA. Thing was about 20’ x 20’ on the camera side and about the same on the darkroom side. We used it for exposing very large screens for screen printing fir the exhibits trade. Thing was about 100 tears old and still worked perfectly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I started trimming negatives in the darkroom of a book printing company. After getting that down it was off to strip flats for production. When Mac’s, drum scanners and imagesetters came along things changed pretty rapidly. Up until a couple of weeks ago I was a production analyst for a printer manufacturer. It’s pretty wild how far things have come. </p></div>		</li>
