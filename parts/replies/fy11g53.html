			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. One of the main points I try to emphasize is that it's not just others who fall for mis/disinformation. Even really smart people can get fooled, either because they're moving quickly/not consulting their prior knowledge or because they don't personally have any relevant prior knowledge to contradict the claim. </p>
<p>I'm a big fan of Mike Caulfield's SIFT method for identifying false claims:<br />

<p>When I'm personally presented with a new piece of information I try to first pause (make sure that I'm actually thinking about the truth of a statement and not just if I want to believe it ), and then I think about the source (who's posted the information and do they have relevant expertise/1st hand knowledge) and finally google it.  True information will often be reported by multiple news outlets rather than just one and a quick search for the headline/key claim will also often surface relevant fact-checks or debunks if it is false. A search can also help identify if the source is trustworthy.</p></div>		</li>
