			<div class="markdown"><p>You can just continue refinancing the loan and making the minimum payments on it. Since he has so much money, he poses virtually no default risk to the bank making the loan so he could get a super low interest rate. Super rich people tend to use a lot of strategic debt like this</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's another way that &quot;big loans&quot; are different from the loans you and I would get. Likely, these loans are &quot;balloon&quot; loans, meaning they come due in full (borrowed amount + interest) at some future date as a lump sum, no monthly payments. They may also have interest only payments (usually due annually or semi annually) with the borrowed amount due at maturity.</p>
<p>This is easily managed by borrowing more money. As long as his stocks continue to appreciate in value (or he keeps getting more) he can continue to borrow more and more money, essentially keeping the loans open forever, and financing the interest due on previous loans into the new loans. He could never ever actually pay a single cent of cash back on those loans if he plays his cards right, he'll be dead by the time those loans get paid off.</p>
<p>For an interest only loan he could alternatively simply sell a small number of shares periodically and pay the interest with that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As long as the shares keep going up, he never has to repay the loan.  </p>
<p>If his shares do tank, and assuming the banks go after him (Which they almost never will unless Amazon is looking like it will go bankrupt), he can sell some and pay off the loan. Or more likely he will just sell some assets that he purchased with the loaned money. Because assets hold their value better, he will usually come out ok.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The opposite can happen. I sold stock options at the height of the dotcom boom to put a down payment on a house.  Then the dotcom bust happened.  So I had vastly reduced assets and a huge capital gains tax bill due the next year.</p></div>		</li>
