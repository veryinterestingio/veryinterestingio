			<div class="markdown"><p>This is all correct but largely misses the point.</p>
<p>Cortisol is released in tiny amounts for just about everything from missing a meal to getting cut-off in traffic. Stress hormone is a great name for it but isn't applicable in every situation.</p>
<p>The simple answer is that your body shuts down your digestive system when not in use.  </p>
<p>The feeling of hunger is more closely linked to a hormone called ghrelin that triggers appetite. Ghrelin spikes at the times you normally eat, not when food is eaten. Like your body is prepping for the food. </p>
<p>So, ghrelin will spike at your normal feeding times and make you hungry. But after so long without use, your digestive system isn't ready to receive food.  </p>
<p>Sipping some water can help wake up your digestive system.  Fun fact, ghrelin is released when when your body has learned to expect food. This is how Intermittent Fasting adherents aren't feeling hunger pains during their 16+ hours fasts everyday.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ketosis is just a state your body is in where you are using fat for energy rather than glucose. Your body does this when you are not providing it a sufficient source of glucose through carbs/surgars. So you're choosing to operate off fats instead of carbs/glucose, fats are broken down and ketones are a byproduct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. Some weight gainers claim to increase your own production but it's snake oil so far. Medical studies could help but so far only fringe science.</p>
<p>Eating at the same time everyday without fail could conceivably cause higher ghrelin spikes at those times but that's a guess.</p>
<p>If lack of appetite is a health issue look for the cause. Chemo is one. Depression is another. Talk to your doctor. </p>
<p>Exercise should help.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am apparently slowly evolutionary developed because I can eat very rarely, in fact stressful periods have proven an ability to devour nearly all calories for a 48 hour period in an interval of only a couple of hours. I don’t even suffer any negative effects from living this way, as my body’s number one talent apparently is blood sugar regulation. </p>
<p>I also have 27 bones in my foot (one too many) and as of right now i can’t walk until i’ve had surgery to remove the excess bone. Slow evolution has its pros and cons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You still have the hunger pains that tell you to eat though.</p>
<p>And yes, this is helpful because it retains energy even in starving situations. If we went into a diabetic coma or became completely lethargic after not eating, that would be bad. Instead we are provided with extra energy to seek out the food we need.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This happens to me, too. If I sleep in on the weekend, laze around, and don't eat until the afternoon, I feel <em>so</em> sick and weak and always end up throwing up that meal. If I eat something -- even just a piece of fruit or heck, a candy -- as soon as I get up I'm 100% fine all day.</p></div>		</li>
