			<div class="markdown"><p>They will because 1) other ways to tell how old things are agree with this way, and 2) telescopes allow us to see stars in the past and the little bits inside get old the same way the little bits today do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the Earth's atmosphere, rays from space hit carbon atoms and change them into heavier carbon atoms by adding neutrons to them. But the heavier carbon atoms tend to break apart over time, shooting out neutrons and turning back into regular carbon atoms.</p>
<p>When a plant grows, it sucks fresh carbon out of the air and makes the carbon into part of itself. Animals that eat the plants also get this carbon inside them. Once the carbon is inside them and no longer fresh, the heavier carbon atoms tend to break apart. The longer the time that has passed since the plant or animal lived, the more of the heavy carbon atoms have broken apart into regular carbon atoms.</p>
<p>Because the heavy carbon atoms tend to break apart at a certain speed, we can look at the proportion of heavy vs regular carbon atoms inside old animal skeletons, old pieces of wood, etc, to figure out how old they are. But this only works if the carbon atoms break apart at a certain speed <em>all the time.</em> If the speed was different thousands of years ago, then we might be confused into thinking that things are younger or older than they are.</p>
<p>The OP is asking how we can be confident that the speed at which heavy carbon atoms break apart has actually been the same for thousands of years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Radioisotope dating is normally done by comparing the ratios of isotopes of particular elements.  For an igneous rock, we would just assumed that the materials have only changed at a nuclear level since the time that the rock solidified.  For a sedimentary rock, you would have to look at the cement that binds the particles.</p>
<p>All dating has to be compared to other methods and with a sample group.  If you were looking at tree rings, you would have to look at cores from the same species of tree from the same stand.  Whenever we look at cores from the ocean floor, or ice, or any other drill site, we usually compare several cores for continuity.  </p>
<p>If you were to look at a particular rock, we would also want to be able to look at material from the same environment that formed at a known point in time.  That's a bit easier if you're in Hawaii and can go find a melt from last weekend, but a large record of contingent data will enable researchers to use much older reference pieces.  If multiple methods point to the same ballpark range, then confidence rises.</p></div>		</li>
