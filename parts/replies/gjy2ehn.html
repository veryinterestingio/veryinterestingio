			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but way too many responses are too complex to a lot of posts on here.</p>
<p>Praising the good, simple ones with easy comparisons is necessary, to hopefully encourage others to hold their answers to the same integrity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The original of the saying &quot;explain like I'm five&quot; comes from an episode of The Office where Michael tells Oscar to &quot;explain this to me like I'm five&quot; and Oscar uses the example of a lemonade stand. So I think it is supposed to be literal, although the subreddit can go off on its own route</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, might be going off on a bit of a tangent here. I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm going to phrase this right, but what is more important to the structure of the paper? The paper is fibers, the fibers are particles, and at some point the particles are molecules. Looked at it from that perspective the paper itself is basically an illusion. It‚Äôs a construct of the sum total of its parts that hides the nature of the parts. The scissors are separating fibers when they cut, but is that separation really happening on an atomic or molecular scale? It would seem not. The cutting of the paper would seem to be more of mechanical unraveling of its structure. So what would it take to cut the paper at a molecular or atomic level? Lasers? Magnetism? I‚Äôm very over tired from a long day while typing this so my mind is a bit all over the place. I‚Äôm just spitballing as ideas and implications leap to mind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Atoms quite litteraly sit in bowls. The &quot;grape in a bowl&quot; analogy has a direct correlation with the &quot;atom in the potential well&quot; physics reality.</p>
<p>The force that holds things together at a molecular level is defined by the electric fields of the molecules that make it. There is a &quot;well&quot; where atoms can &quot;snap into&quot; other atoms, and molecules can &quot;snap into&quot; other molecules.</p>
<p>Water molecules are made from two Hydrogen and one Oxiyen atom. In this case, the Oxygen molecule has three sets of <del>wells</del> electron shells, the first set can hold two <del>grapes</del> electrons, the second can hold two electrons and the third can hold six electrons, however the Oxygen molecule only has eight electrons, so there are two electron shell slots available where electrons can fall into. It so happens that Hydrogen has a single electron shell where two electrons can fall into but it only has one electron, so one Hydrogen atom can share its electron with an Oxygen molecule, then another Hydrogen comes along and fills the second available Oxygen slot and tada! you've got a water molecule.</p>
<p>However, Hydrogen atoms can also share electrons with each other. In that case, you get a Hydrogen molecule (H2).
The same can happen with Oxygen molecules (O2, the stuff we use to breath)</p>
<p>When you take water (H2O) and pass electricity trough it, you are quite litteraly kicking the hidrogen atoms so hard that some of the Hydrogen atoms ate kicked away from the water molecule they once were. Then, if that unstable Hydrogen atom finds another Hydrogen atom, they can &quot;fall into each other&quot;, share electrons and form a Hydrogen atom.</p>
<p>These are molecular bonds called &quot;Covalent bonds&quot;, because the molecule is held together by sharing electrons in the valence shell of the atom.</p>
<p>There are also Ionic bonds, called so because two atoms or molecules are held together because one is so bent on getting all the electrons it needs that it just takes them from another atom, then both get attracted because one is electrically negative and the other one is electrically positive. Table salt is an example!</p>
<p>The third common kind of bond is the Van der Waals forces, these exists because of wacky quantum physics, but put simply at a certain distance two molecules can be in equilibrium, if you pull them appart they attract each other and if you push them together they repeal each other. This is what lets geckos stick to glass!</p>
<p>Another kind of bond is a Hydrogen bond. Since a Hydrogen atom that has &quot;fallen into an atom&quot; no longer has full use of his electron, the side oposite of where the electron is now has an electrical positive charge. If you hold it next to a molecule with an electrical negative charge they attract. This is what gives liquid water it's shape!</p>
<hr />
<p>When a scisor cuts trough paper, the celulose that makes the fibers that make the paper can either move to the side or get trapped into the moving scisor blades. </p>
<p>If the fibers move apart from each other, the forces that held two fibers together are being broken, and the weak bonds (most probably VdW and hydrogen bonds) are being broken.</p>
<p>If the fibers are cut, then the celulose chains that make the fibers are being cut apart, and these celulose molecules are held together by covalent bonds. You are &quot;kicking a celulose so hard that if falls from the celulose bowl it was into&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol! Thanks! I‚Äôm going to have to read that a few more times, but I believe I get the gist. Getting into quantum mechanics is always making things more complicated. I have an 8 yo that loves asking me questions that take us down these roads. Sometimes I can answer, sometimes I say I know there is an answer but I don‚Äôt know it, and sometimes I have to admit that he has me totally stumped. That‚Äôs always the last resort.</p></div>		</li>
