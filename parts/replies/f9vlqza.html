			<div class="markdown"><p>That...might be the most convoluted dumbest way to classify something ever. </p>
<p>If these tiny lead balls were the size of the diameter of the shotgun barrel, how many would it take to make a pound? That's what we're gonna call this ammo type. </p>
<p>I must be missing something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, that is correct. The lead balls you measure with are far larger than the ones you actually shoot with. I'd guess this stroke of genius happened in some kind of armoury where there were lots of lead balls of different sizes laying around.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It was more like &quot;How many musket balls can I make per pound of lead&quot;.</p>
<p>Guns got better and new technology obviated the old methodology, but the terminology remains valid.</p></div>		</li>
