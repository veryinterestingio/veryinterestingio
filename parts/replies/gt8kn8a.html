			<div class="markdown"><p>This is similar to the aperture in cameras, right? I recently started learning how to manually focus a camera lens and found that the smaller aperture possible made more things come into focus even though they are at different distances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly.  It's depth of field.  The camera (or lens') diaphragm lets you adjust the size of the aperture.</p>
<p>The f/ number of the aperture is the bottom of the fraction of the proportion of the size of the opening to the lens' focal length, so for example, an aperture of f/4 is a hole 1/4 of the focal length - on a 200 mm lens, that'd be a 50mm opening.  (Well, the equivalent to a 50mm circle; diaphragm blades make not-quite-circular openings, usually hexagonal.)</p>
<p>The human eye works the same way (physics is physics).  And by making a small hole with your hand, your hand is acting as a diaphragm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not just similar. It’s exactly the reason why aperture works the way it does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another example are aperture sights on guns where the rear sight is a disc or ring that you look through.</p>
<p>It makes aiming a gun more accurate (but also tends to make aiming slower.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does, but it's not really correct.</p>
<p>A pinhole works because light travels in straight lines and putting it through a tiny pinhole means that you are basically only letting a small angle pass through, which makes it less blurry.</p>
<p>A lens, on the other hand, &quot;corrects&quot; the angles by refraction, so that they all meet up at one place (or &quot;focus&quot;). As you said, a smaller aperture gets more rays in focus than a big one, but the reasoning isn't quite right.</p>
<p>If you have a small enough aperture, you don't even need a lens at all - which is how pinhole cameras and camerae obscurae work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The pinhole effect us what's responsible for camera obscurae.  I agree.  But you can sharpen the focus of a lens by limiting the abberation associated with lens shape.  Take a magnifying glass and use it to project an image on the wall.  The edges will be soft.  Cut a hole in some paper that is 1/2 the size of the lens and place it right on the glass.  The image is better focused and you've not changed the angle of the incident rays.  That's what happens when you make this small aperture in front of the lens in your eye.  That it can be done with a very thin screen indicates bringing things closer to paraxial approximation isn't the most important part.</p>
<p>If you set up a pinhole on a laser table, then you're focusing the beam and placing your aperture at the focal point.  This allows you to cut out the &quot;unfocused&quot; portion so down the line you have a more parallel beam.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, the setup you described in the last part can be used to manipulate images too, via spatial filtering.</p>
<p>Let's assume we have two identical lenses with focal length <em>f</em>. I'll represent lenses as L, the pinhole as P and the initial and final images as I and I' respectively.</p>
<p>I&lt;-----<em>f</em>-----&gt;L&lt;-----<em>f</em>-----&gt;P&lt;-----<em>f</em>-----&gt;L&lt;-----<em>f</em>-----&gt;I'</p>
<p>The setup above will result in I' being identical to I but with a low-pass filter applied. If you use a pinpoint rather than a pinhole, you get a high-pass filter. Using slits can limit the filtration to one dimension or another. If you use a series of parallel slits (or rings) you can do very interesting things, like increasing resolution.</p>
<p>The reason that this works is that the light intensity at P is a 2D Fourier transform of I, so by removing certain components, you change I'.</p>
<p>In terms of the rest of your post, I completely agree.</p></div>		</li>
