<p>Tbh the irony of ELI5 is that most children cant read at 5. So whatever the average age of readers of this sub is, is the actual age.</p>
<p>ELI20 doesnt roll off the tongue though</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It's beyond the realms of any-year olds really. Quantum mechanics is such a fucky subject that it exceeds the general knowledge earned through age and can't really be applied to this subreddit. </p>
<p>Even some quantum scientists are perplexed by QM - for example, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcqZHYo7ONs" target="_blank">Quantum Venn Diagram Paradox</a>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm pretty sure I could read at 5, I didn't know what half the friggin words meant but I think I could pronounce them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are exactly as evolved as our eyes. There isn't some magic tech tree of biology, their eyes have had as long to develop as ours have. It just so happens that there really isn't enough evolutionary pressure to develop eyes, and insects are really slow to <del>mutate</del> evolve.</p>
<p>Edit: They might mutate faster, but de facto many insects look very similar to their ancestors millions of years ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, I'm not sure on the specifics of it but a lot of insect species look almost identical to their ancestors millions of years ago, but the same cannot be said for other animals. It's more likely that they are just too successful to evolve that much at the macro level, but they can evolve and adapt rapidly when something doesn't work.</p>
<p>If someone who knows more about this wants to weigh in I'd be super interested.</p></div>		</li>
