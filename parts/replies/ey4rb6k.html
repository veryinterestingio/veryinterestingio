<p>Also cost. Food manufacturers want low cost flavors. I call this &quot;the triumph of mediocrity&quot;. They cut production/ingredient costs until people eventually stop buying the product. So consumers are faced with cheaper and cheaper flavors that taste worse and worse.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sometimes it isn't about cutting costs, but it can be a factor. Sometimes it is the only option. You cant make strawberry milk shake with strawberries (well shelf stable UHT) but the cost of the ingredients means the consumer won't buy because it is too expensive.
Sometimes, no matter how many strawberries you put in, you cant taste it - so strawberry flavour can boost it.</p>
<p>American tastebuds tend to be sweeter than English, which is far sweeter than Chinese. From experience working with products for the chinese market they tend to like food a lot less sweet and the flavours I would use tend to be overpowering.</p>
<p>Sugar and salt are by far a bigger problem than the flavours. Want to reduce the cost of your flavours, put sugar in it. Too salty - dump a tonne of sugar in it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Flavours popular here in NZ may be different to America. Cultural preferences for example. Americans love cherry flavours, Brits like black currant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Part of the reason Black Currant isn't that popular in the United States is because growing them commercially was restricted/banned for much of the 20th century due to concerns about spreading disease to other plants. </p>
<p>It's no longer illegal to grow on a national level but is still restricted in some states, and there is still very little grown domestically.</p></div>		</li>
