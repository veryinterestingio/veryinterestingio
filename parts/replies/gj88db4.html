			<div class="markdown"><p>Studies suggest the calves obtain some of this flora during their birth from the mother's birth canal. Keep in mind that mammals drink milk for the first few weeks or months of their life. So the calf doesn't have to be able to digest grass right away.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that all complex organisms have gut flora, including us. Maybe not as specialized as a cow and other grazers do but they are essential to our health.</p>
<p>And not just in your gut really. Your body contains so many bacteria that they outnumber your own cells ten to one. They're much smaller than your body's cells so they don't outweigh you. But the average adult human still contains several pounds worth of bacteria.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Calves are born with an immune system that has no programming. Colostrum the first milk that calves drink (which needs to be consumed in the first few hours of life) has all th anti-bodies to local pathogens that the cow has come into contact with. Colostrum gives the calves immune system the instructions to fight these pathogens. They drink milk for the first 3 months of their life before their rumen develops and they take on solids (vegetation) they do mimick their mums and eat vegetation from an early age but they can't digest it. Soil and vegetation contains lots of good and bad bacteria and they are constantly exploring the world through their nose.</p></div>		</li>
