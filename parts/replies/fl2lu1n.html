			<div class="markdown"><p>Continuing off of this, a method for fat I remember from my food analysis class involves crushing up a food, potato chips in this case, and mixing them in a solvent, I think we used hexane, maybe ethanol? that better dissolves fats. After dissolving all the fat in the solvent, we could separate out the solvent and take the weight. The weight gain is the fat content of the chips. </p>
<p>The ash content, or everything that isn't water, fat, protein or carbs, is actually determined by literally incinerating the food until everything is burned up.</p>
<p>Carbohydrates are determined by figuring out the amounts of everything else and subtracting from the total content of food. Whatever is left is carbs. </p>
<p>This method of analysis is known in the industry as proximate analysis. The calories can easily be determined from this by addition and multiplication. Fat is 9 calories per gram, protein and carbs are 4 calories, and alcohol is 7 calories.</p>
<p>As for vitamins and minerals, I don't know the specifics for each one, but scientists know the chemical makeup of each vitamin or mineral, and subject the food to various chemical reactions to isolate that specific nutrient.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ever food and every test is developed differently but you will always need an extraction buffer or solvent of some sort to isolate your analyte from crude material.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So, inedible carbs such as cellulose count as well as starches and sugars?  That could account for a lot, like half, no?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And that is generally done via HPLC (high pressure liquid chromatography).
The majority of b vitamins are water soluble, so extraction can be a simple as shaking a ground mixture of it in acidified water (e.g. if you're wanting to see how much vitamin B1/B6 is in your cornflakes). Sample prep depends on the vitamin &amp; the matrix (type of food) it's in.</p>
<p>HPLC - remember that experiment where you stuck a black dot of ink on a coffee filter, sat the bottom of the paper in water and watched with amazement when it magically got split into multiple different colours? Well think of HPLC as a more sophisticated way of doing that - all the different chemicals in your extracted food (dot of ink) interact with the media in the column (coffee filter paper) so all travel at different speeds. You then use different methods of detection (usually UV/IR for vits) to see the different things that have been separated out. You run a reference sample through first of a known concentration, which shows you where the peak is for that vitamin and how big the peak should be for the amount you put in... Then you compare the unknowns from the food to that to determine the amount.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Belongs at the top, not the bottom.  The crude nitrogen method is the reason that melamine was put in foods by some unscrupulous Chinese producers, years past.  While inedible (and toxic), it raised the N numbers in test results.  The vague results of the crude nitrogen test are also why the listed protein and absorbable protein can differ widely on many foods, and indirectly why animal-sourced foods have more absorbable protein than most plant-sourced foods.</p></div>		</li>
