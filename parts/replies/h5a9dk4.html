			<div class="markdown"><p>This gold thing doesn’t even really work. The truest store of value is owning the means of production, the factories and infrastructure that produces everything that we buy.  The people who own the means of production are immune to inflation and benefit from it because they’re selling the very things increasing in price. The uber rich dont like deflation cuz they buy everything with debt and they’ve rigged society to be based on massive amounts of debt, while deflation causes all their assets to become “underwater”. Then there’s the fact they don’t want people in masses, to be able to save their way to eventually becoming competitors to the wealthy classes. </p>
<p>By the way I’m not for class warfare. There’s really nothing we can do about this. The ruling class controls everything and always will because it’s in our nature to worship them in all the ways that give them more power - such as by supporting culture to give up our personal responsibilities to powers which they control in the name of safety nets and stabilization. Any attempts to take from the rich in mass will backfire against the entire middle class.</p></div>		</li>
