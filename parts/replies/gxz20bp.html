			<div class="markdown"><p>great video, but led to another question at one point the narrator states </p>
<p>&quot;inside the event horizon space and time are so broken that real time travel is possible... ... if anything could escape it could create all kinds of time travel paradoxes and issues that break the universe&quot; </p>
<p>how does time travel become possible (other than time slowing so if you got out you'd be far into the future bit)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>why would it break the universe?</p>
<p>what is a broken universe?</p>
<p>thanks!</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/KePNhUJ2reI" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/KePNhUJ2reI</a></p>
<p>A &quot;broken universe&quot; in this sense is one in which causality is broken. Backwards time travel causes this to happen (the famous <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandfather_paradox" target="_blank">grandfather paradox</a>)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Causality could be completely fucked up, which means our perception of time and reality is completely wrong.</p>
<p>There is interesting video about it by PBS, too lazy to find it out, can't remember the name but basically..try imagine two observers. One is falling into black hole observing reality from his point of view and second observer is looking on first observer, falling into black hole.  Both observers has clock on their neck other observer can see.</p>
<p>From perspective of second observer, first observer will just fall slower and slower closer to event horizon he is. Also clock will show different time. On clock of second observer it can take days and weeks before one second tick on first observer's clock. And when first observer reaches event horizon, from perspective of second one, it just freeze there..forever. No motion or clock tick.</p>
<p>However from perspective of first observer, situation is quite different. As he is closer and closer to event horizon, everything around him is just in fast motion, on his clock 1 second tick but years will happen around him, he can observe it on clock of first observer. And in moment he reaches event horizon, weird thing happens - he can experience eternity in a single moment. Time outside of black hole is going infinitely fast. Not only he sees everything what will happen, but apparently, he also experience everything what already happen - in a single moment. It's really mindblowing.  </p>
<p>Observer behind event horizon exists in this weird dimension, where all time exists in one point, so what would happen when he will try escape it? Where and especially when he will appear? In presence? Future? Past? From his perspective, there is no past, presence and future, there is just infinite time collapsed into this dimension.   </p>
<p>On PBS, they said black hole is not just some hole(object) with huge gravity, but also set of all events what happen...and all events which will happen in the future. It's quite paradox.</p></div>		</li>
