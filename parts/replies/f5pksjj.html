<blockquote>
<p>Conclusion In a large analysis of older Americans insured by Medicare, no relation was found between rainfall and <strong>outpatient visits</strong> for joint or back pain. A relation may still exist, and therefore larger, more detailed data on disease severity and pain would be useful to support the validity of this commonly held belief.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And you wrote that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>they rarely complain about increased pain when it goes from stormy to being nice out</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe because the pain goes away when the weather gets nicer?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The title of the study is literally, &quot;Association between rainfall and diagnoses of <strong>joint or back pain</strong>: retrospective claims analysis.&quot; The study aimed to investigate pain and used outpatient visits as a data source. It's explained in the methods:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We identified outpatient visits according to Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System evaluation and management codes 99201-99205 and 99211-99215. Our primary outcome of interest was whether a visit included an ICD-9 (international classification of disease, ninth revision) diagnosis code for a condition reflecting joint or back pain: rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, spondylosis, intervertebral disc disorders, and other non-traumatic joint disorders. We restricted our analysis to visits to general internists (primary care doctors who completed residency in internal medicine), as opposed to other physicians who may treat patients with joint or back pain, such as orthopedic surgeons, family practitioners, and rheumatologists. We focused on general internists because they most frequently treat patients with joint or back pain and may be better able to see patients at short notice compared with specialist physicians.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that if a true relation between rainfall and joint or back pain exists, patients might be more likely to either acutely seek care from their internists for these conditions during rainy periods or mention these symptoms when seeing an internist during a previously scheduled outpatient visit (ie, a visit booked weeks to months in advance) that happens to occur during a rainy period. In this latter case, the internist may include a joint or back pain related diagnosis on the insurance claim. As it may be difficult for patients with acute joint or back pain during a rainfall to schedule an appointment with their internist on the day symptoms begin, our approach considers the possibility that patients mention joint or back pain to their internist during a previously scheduled visit that happens to occur on a rainy day. In addition, we assessed the association between rainfall and joint or back pain at both day level and week level, the latter analysis allowing for the possibility that appointments with internists could be booked within a few days of a rainy day if not on the rainy day itself.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That still supports my point. The survey compares weather with visits (where diagnoses of back or joint pain were recorded).  It does not compare weather with all occurrences of pain.  Absence of evidence is not conclusive evidence of absence.</p>
<p>As my extract indicates, the authors themselves stated...</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I have thought as well. I know numerous people who claim that storms coming cause join pain or even migraines. But none of these people complain about a trip into the mountains that causes a much more rapid change in pressure and temperature aside from ear pressure if someone is congested and has difficulty popping their ears. A trip from 4,000 feet to 9,000 feet in elevation in 45 minutes is a much more rapid and extreme change than a typical storm blowing in and also typically a significant temperature drop.</p></div>		</li>
