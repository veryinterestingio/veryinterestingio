			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because AC is functioning as both an air cooler and removing humidity from the air at the same time. </p>
<p>There's a very good reason why the population boom in the Southeastern and Southern US came in the latter half of the 20th century: because that's when AC became prevalent and relatively cheap.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, weirdly, putting on an undershirt will help. I moved from England to the Caribbean, and spend most of my life sweating like a cornered nun, but was told about this trick, and it really works. Uniqlo make some nice ones that I like.  </p>
<p>Similarly, if it's really cold outside, a thin underlayer really helps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, I work in the tropics and I stay cooler wearing trousers, a long-sleeved shirt, and an undershirt than I do wearing less.</p>
<p>The cloth helps to adsorb sweat and wick it away to evaporate, rather than pooling on the skin.</p>
<p>Of course, eventually everything just gets wringing-out wet from sweat, so when it's hot and humid (as it is right now) there isn't really any escape from it unless you're inside or if it's windy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At 100% RH 98.6F, you're unable to do any cooling.  </p>
<p>Actually the limit is a wet-bulb temperature of about 95F.  This is not just more uncomfortable than anyone would like.  Even if naked in total shade with adequate hydration and not doing any work, the human body cannot survive this environment for a prolonged period.  </p>
<p>The body itself sources a minimum of about 100W just sitting at the keyboard, and has an upper limit of about 100F on its internal operating temperature.  Above wet-bulb of 95F, the heat loss of a 100F human body is less than 100W so it will get hotter.</p>
<p>Some parts of the globe do undergo periods where the wet-bulb exceeds 95F at times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can think of the atmosphere as a sponge, and temperature as the size of the sponge. Big sponges hold a lot of water and small sponges have a lesser capacity to do so.</p>
<p>100% humidity is when the sponge is fully soaked. If the air gets colder at some point, the sponge becomes smaller and you get rain.</p>
<p>(This is a simplified explanation, of course)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sucrose can absolutely spontaneously condense from a liquid if the solubility of the water drops - even due to temperature. In fact, it uses the exact same physical phenomenon to condense as salt would: Brownian motion.</p>
<p>In fact, it's because both phenomenon rely on Brownian motion to condense from a liquid where the solubility has changed that you cannot predict exactly how long it will take for the salt or sugar to condense out of the liquid.</p></div>		</li>
