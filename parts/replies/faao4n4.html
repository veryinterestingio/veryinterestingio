			<div class="markdown"><p>Most bacteria have simple DNA, and can only digest one form of sugar. </p>
<p>Yeast for example can use glucose, and sucrose, but not maltose, or dextrose. </p>
<p>If milk had a high concentration of simple sugars mammary infections, and upset stomach in infants would be common. </p>
<p>Note the higher incidence of cholic among formula fed infants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This comment caused me to do a quick look up. Chemically, yes, they appear the same. Semantically, no they are not the same thing. For the intent of this discussion, they are close enough in properties. <a href="https://pediaa.com/difference-between-d-and-l-glucose/#L%20Glucose" target="_blank">Source</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are both isomers of the same compound. If you think it doesn't matter, i have a business proposal for you... When we are talking about sugars it can matter a hell of a lot, although in this case.. not so much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>they are called optical isomers, you coconut.</p>
<p>well, they are chemically identical other than their rotation in space, so you're half right.</p>
<p>edit: fructose is the isomer. apologies</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeasts are not bacteria. Everything is adapted to its food source. Lactobacillus (a strain of bacteria), for example, consume lactose and excrete lactic acid. It’s why milk goes sour, and (in part) how products like yogurt and sour cream are made.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worded poorly, my bad.  Bacteria and yeasts were two separate thought process there.  As you pointed out, one specific organism can consume it but not all.  And the one you mentioned is not inherently harmful and would win out against other more harmful organisms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your policies, equivocally worded, allow for educated guesses...and the educated guesses I provided are certainly within the realm of possibility. They are not guesses because &quot;I don't know how to explain it.&quot;</p>
<p>Which is certainly better than the completely unsubstantiated answers I see posted all of the time to ELI5.</p></div>		</li>
