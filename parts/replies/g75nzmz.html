			<div class="markdown"><p>This is accurate at least in more recent times.  But I think it still dismisses just how unusual this debate really was.  Even if you just hop back and watch the 2016 debates or 2012 debates - its still hugely different.  I mean Biden tonight called Trump a &quot;clown&quot;, said he was &quot;the worst president in our history&quot;, and told him to &quot;shut up&quot; directly to his face and he was still easily the more civil one on the stage tonight.  Trump was also allowed much more lee-way with overrunning his 2-minutes and various interruption tonight compared to Biden - but Joe did crosstalk some himself as well.  It also looked less like a sporting event than normal because nobody was seated in the crowd.  Please don't let my comment seem like a criticism of your own because its not really - but I'm just trying to add further context.</p>
<p>I think the reason the mics weren't muted is because neither side would agree.  Its a double-edged sword because it could backfire on either person potentially given context.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right.</p>
<p>This debate represents the...culmination of that mentality.</p>
<p>It's been going the direction of performance art for years.</p>
<p>This year they've embraced it.  As you've said, probably at least partially out of necessity.</p></div>		</li>
