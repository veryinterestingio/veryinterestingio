			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s a 90 min sleep cycle, approximately. So 4.5, 6, 7.5 hours are the best times to make up. In grad school of stay up later an extra half hour so my alarm would hit at the sleep cycles. It worked great.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, and never have i ever woken up fresh if i slept over 10 hours or under 6. Soooo, either i have really bad luck, or there's more to it than just at what spot of the cycle you're woken.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What happens if you wake up naturally after sleeping for ages, but still feel tired? I have a tendency of sleeping for 8+ hours, but I wake up naturally (Not from an alarm or noise), yet I still feel tired.
So after the sweet spot 7 - 9 hours, does extra sleep become counter - productive ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add I’ve found the app ‘Sleep Cycle’ to actually be reasonably useful at waking me up at the right time to account for sleep cycles. </p>
<p>It’s not 100% and I’m not sure I believe all the data and metrics it gives you but it’s been so much better than the normal iPhone alarm.</p></div>		</li>
