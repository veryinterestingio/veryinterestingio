			<div class="markdown"><p>An EF4 came through town near my home in 2017, and right through a concrete building. I used to pass by on my way to school. Parts of the building was there but much of it was destroyed, majorly destroyed.</p>
<p>Totally right that if a building is hit, its going down. </p>
<p>That town gets hit a lot, almost every tornado season. Like everyone else said, its just easier to rebuild rather than build concrete. As long as the family is safe, a house is basically stuff. You can get more stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aboveground shelters built entirely from reinforced concrete are capable of surviving a direct hit from any tornado, they're just expensive as hell.   </p>
<p>They have a building on Mt. Washington that just constantly gets blasted by high winds and cold.</p></div>		</li>
