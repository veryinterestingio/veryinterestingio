<p>When flu &quot;goes away&quot; from the North, it's just infecting folks South of the Equator, and it's closely monitored by health agencies while doing it, in order to create effective vaccines for when they move &quot;back up&quot; i.e. the next flu season in the North.</p>
<p>The ones that jump species can be really nasty, 'cause our immune systems haven't dealt with anything like them before.</p>
<p>That's kinda what's happened with SARS-CoV-2, it jumped species and our immune systems haven't caught up yet.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It doesn't need to go that far. It is still spreading among people here, just at a much slower rate.</p>
<p>In high humidity / higher temperatures, the flu virus degrades faster. This means that when someone has it on their hand and touches a doorknob, it has a shorter window to infect people. It is absolutely still around and infecting people, the R0 has just dropped (significantly) so it's hitting a lot fewer people, but that's still enough to reappear in the fall.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This isn't exactly right; they do mutate, but the majority of the difference in the flu vaccine, for instance, has more to do with differences in prevalence among existing strains. Predicting which strains will be more prevalent year to year is very difficult; there is some amount of cyclicity because immunity to flu lasts a bit, so if a strain is very prevalent one year, it might be less prevalent the following year due to lasting immunity to it. But it's not nearly so simple.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and words from chinese experts said that this COVID-19 may be a disease commonly-seen every year, just like the flu season. That's the worst news since the vaccine for it have not yet been developed. Maybe masks will be daily necessities. I just got some from <a href="https://www.epidemiology.amotx.com" target="_blank">AmoTx</a> for going to supermarket could be dangerous for now.</p></div>		</li>
