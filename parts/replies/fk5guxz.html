<p>It used to be harder back when everything was basically vinyl, but technology has really made everything a ton easier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol, tempo matching is easy as shit, you move the pitch fader and match the bpm. Beat matching and counting in the bars &amp; phrases properly is what takes the practice. Real instruments played by someone in the song are never consistent and usually the ones that get away on you.</p>
<p>Only time tempo matching is a task is if the Dj is playing an original record and no software.</p></div>		</li>
