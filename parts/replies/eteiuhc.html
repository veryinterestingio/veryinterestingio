			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes different types of medicines work differently for different people. You will have a period of time of adjustment for your new medicine so you'll likely feel worse before you feel better. But after the adjustment period if you're still feeling gray definitely talk to your doctor. Medicine should help you feel more like yourself, not less.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really depends on the person, and it can take a while to adjust. I'm also on wellbutrin (around 8 years now) after having been on Prozac for a while(which sucked for me) , it took a bit of time but at some point I started feeling like me. Like for the first time, things were falling into place in my mind and emotionally, and like I could handle things. I've never felt dull or grey because of it, in my experience I am way better at experiencing and differentiating between emotions then I was before the meds, when everything felt like this dark blob of feelings. My happy moments are just really pure and sparkling joy which was and still is an amazing experience for me! Hang in there and I hope everything turns out for the better for you! If you have any questions or just want to talk, feel free to PM me :)</p></div>		</li>
