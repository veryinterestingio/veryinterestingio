			<div class="markdown"><p>A few reasons. Air conditioning was invented after the fact. Cold weather can be rough, but it's easier (in the historical sense) to warm up than cool down. It's the same reason that Old Florida is North Florida. Also, tropical diseases and wars with native populations hindered coastal development in the south. Most importantly, though, is New York's geography. You've got a deep, protected natural harbor close to the open ocean and a river that connects (thanks to the Erie Canal) all the way to Minnesota. Y'all were geographically destined to be a metropolis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>same idea behind most of the Pittsburgh region. Look at the city and think if you had a musket that really only shot about 20 feet how hard it would be to attack the city. (And cannons while a bit better still couldn't get over the rivers) you would literally be forced to attack either from the extremely disadvantageous position of a water landing, or the only slightly better position of 'the only land route' (or be stuck in a drawn out siege of the city...in a hostile nation where you have no 'supply lines' at all)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think dude was just fucking with you. It was just a funny question. Why wouldn't every city and location just be somewhere with better weather ya know? Like why didn't they just discover the north slope oil fields somewhere that isn't the arctic</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>New York became what it is due to the large natural harbor formed by the upper bay and the Hudson river, which allowed for the construction of a large port without having to build defenses against harsh weather on the ocean, and making it easier to build defenses against invaders. Same reason that made San Francisco / Oakland what it is. Large natural harbors lead to ports, ports lead to trade, trade leads to wealth and influence, wealth and influence leads to metropoleis. And becoming an immigration hub, but that is beside the point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, so many cities were built due to natural harbors being part of trade or settlement. Sydney, Vancouver, Cape Town, Boston, New York, Charleston, Honolulu, Hong Kong, etc.</p></div>		</li>
