			<div class="markdown"><p>So if Iâ€™m understanding this, then glass has no repetition of order due to some structural reason? If it lacks order is it technically a liquid? Like does it have liquid properties such as viscosity and vapor?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Amorphous solids can be thought of like 'frozen' liquids:  the atoms want to line up in an ordered crystal to maximize their interaction energy, but need to rearrange themselves from the disordered liquid state.  If you cool them down too quickly, though, the atoms don't have time to do this, and get stuck where they were.  This wide distribution of bond lengths and energies then account for many glass properties, like stiffness and brittleness,  and melting behavior. </p>
<p>Below a certain temperature, called the glass transition temperature, the amorphous solid looses its flow and viscous properties, and the bonds no longer have enough temperature energy to rearrange at all.  It is named the glass transition because this is the temperature below which the material breaks in a brittle manner (like the way glass shatters).  </p>
<p>For your example, the relevant properties of amorphous materials are their transformation properties.  Crystalline materials (like water) do not have continuous cooling behavior.  Because all the bonds are the same length, there is a sharp energy (temperature) change on solidification, which is accompanied by a step change in material properties. In the case of water, among other properties, is a large expansion of the specific volume as ice crystals form.  This, and the jagged edges of the ice crystals, can distort and puncture cells, which is generally not a good thing for organisms.  Glasses transition from liquid to solid more continuously (RE: second order phase transformation), and so don't have the shape discontinuities that damage biological structures</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A glass is like if you took a liquid at the molecule level and stopped time with little to no respect for the orientation of the molecules.</p>
<p>A crystal forms with a specific order, all things are oriented in the same direction (roughly, simplistically). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fluids have no order at all and their constituent entities are mobile, amorphous materials have no short-range order and their constituent entities are immobile (when compared to fluids). There is some order in amorphous materials but it gets lost after a few nanometers. Now the reason for the lack of order is the speed with which the molten material cools down. If the process is too fast then the entities freeze at their spots. If the process is slow then the entities will arrange themselves so that the material will show a minimum of mechanical energy. A crystalline state offers this minimum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. Both a single crystal of quartz (crystalline silicon dioxide) and fused silica (amorphous silicon dioxide) are transparent. And the thermal conductivity of fused silica is actually greater than that of quartz.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im giving a general sense of these two structures. Although I'm sure you would agree that fused silica is annealed to some sense meaning that it may have fewer scattering centres. It also very much depends on the mode of conduction. </p></div>		</li>
