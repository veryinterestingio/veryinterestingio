			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm okay with this explanation all the way. I was wary of how the article tried to make it sound like hormonal chemicals were going to leak into your drink if you reused the bottle. The articles I've seen are just very misleading.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You know how sometimes there's that one thing you always thought was true even though it didn't make sense? Obviously vaccines are good and Zika is awful, but this was my one &quot;oh crap maybe I should rethink this&quot; belief. I'm glad I have Reddit to help me not be too dumb about fringe controversial thoughts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plastic bottles do leach over time. They are designed to be single use. We are just starting to learn about the effects of plastics, and when we find a problematic chemical, we usually replace it with something just as bad but less well studied. It's called regrettable Substitution. So far, we've mostly studied these substances in isolation. What we really don't know yet is how this different substances might interact with each other.</p>
<p>Yes, there is fear mongering about &quot;toxic chemicals&quot;, but there is a lot we don't know about them, and we haven't really been careful. Most chemicals management programs are unfortunately reactive rather than proactive, and the burden is on proving these substances are dangerous rather than proving they are safe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should simply buy glass bottles and clean those. Steer clear of plastic bottles as much as possible.</p>
<p>Plastic bottles are designed to be used once, then discarded, preferably within a short timeframe. Cleaning them is possible, but over time the material will scratch or even deteriorate if put in a dishwasher.</p>
<p>It is disputed if chemicals leak from plastic bottles into your drink - however, damaging the surface won't minimize this risk, if there is any. </p>
<p>Glass does not have these risks or disadvantages, but of course the bottles are heavier and shatter easier.</p>
<p>Also pay attention to your bottlecaps, especially metal ones. Clean AND disinfect them, especially if you reuse your bottles for shakes or smoothies etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about reusable “fitness” plastic cups, bottles and shakers? They're not made of PET though, so the material is more durable. But in shakers, you have a metal thingy that helps mixing the contents, and I'm sure it creates tiny scratches in plastic, unless it's higher on the Mohs scale of course.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Flexible Plastic Bottles, there are some like the Nalgene bottles that are meant to be reused, being more rigid they don't tend to have the same issues.</p></div>		</li>
