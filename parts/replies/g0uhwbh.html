			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, a homeless shelter in Boston had a positive rate of 36% and 87.8 percent of them were asymptomatic.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is key.  You're ALWAYS asymptomatic for several days after transmission of nearly any virus.  A follow-up 1 to 2 weeks later to see who ended up with symptoms would be 100% necessary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The word asymptomatic means different things to different people.  Epidemiologists think it means &quot;never get symptoms&quot;, while the general public (and science journalists) think it means &quot;currently doesn't have symptoms&quot;.  There's no point in correcting people for using the other definition; just make sure you're clear what you're talking about and what you're reading about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also wonder about the difference between asymptomatic / presymptomatic and &quot;low symptomatic&quot;, especially with regard to certain populations which might include children and the homeless.  </p>
<p>That is, some people are very in touch with how they feel and generally feel well.  They can tell you when they are &quot;coming down with something&quot; before they have many symptoms because of a tickle in their throat or feeling run down, etc.  On the other hand, children often are not that in touch with their physical feelings or are unable to communicate what their minor physical symptoms are.  Other people just feel kind of crappy a lot of the time because of other life conditions, some things caused by homelessness, others contributing to homelessness.  </p>
<p>I wonder if some of those homeless people had greater than baseline coughs, tiredness, headaches, or digestive issues that they just did not identify as symptoms because at the time they were not known symptoms or because it just blended into the other baseline symptoms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have there been any studies into vitamin D and covid? I remember early on there was some news that the worst affected people were vitamin D deficient but there was no understanding of cause/effect at that time or even if it was just a general &quot;everyone is vitamin D deficient once isolation starts&quot; thing.</p>
<p>I started taking a vitamin D supplement because even if it doesnt help with covid I'm certain I'd be deficient from lack of sun due to winter and not leaving the house, but if it did help protect against covid it would be a good thing to promote for wider use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There have been tons of studies that shows those who have higher mortality rates and more severe covid have low levels of vitamin D and deficient, but it still does not prove that having low vitamin D is what caused the severe case of covid.  What they really need to do is a random trial of those before getting covid and see vitamin D levels and later on, but it very tough to do that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed. Another possible explanation would be that the illness somehow exhausts the supply of vitamin D.  I doubt that is the case, but can't rule out with only correlative information.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious about this too. I remember hearing some theories that black people were more affected by Covid because they produce less vitamin D than people with lighter skin. I wonder if that line of inquiry went anywhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quick internet search led me to a bunch of non academic posts, mostly news sites.  </p>
<p>It seems that there was some new information that came out in early March, here a science daily article: </p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200507121353.htm" target="_blank">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200507121353.htm</a>  </p>
<p>And then later that month a bunch of news companies started posts about how there is no solid data on it. Here's a CNN post:</p>
