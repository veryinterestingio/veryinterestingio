			<div class="markdown"><p>short tandem repeats are not a repeat of a single nucleotide. In fact, one of the distinguishing factors about STR's is that they are a repeat of at least 2 nucleotides, otherwise you couldn't tell where the repeat began and where the repeat ended. That's important for determining heritability and understanding number of alleles and phenotype, which is part of the STR's function. If you had a sequence atatatatat, that's a repeat of the short &quot;at&quot; sequence 5 times. if you had acgatacgatacgatacgatacgatacgat, that's a repeat of &quot;acgat&quot; 6 times. If you just had aaaaaaaaaaa, that's not a short tandem repeat because there's no such thing as a periodicity of one (and it would be impossible for us, let alone something that transcribes DNA to tell the difference between being a string of single a's, a shorter string of &quot;aa&quot;, or &quot;aaa&quot;, or &quot;aaaa&quot;, etc.), that's just a repeat of a single nucleotide which is significant for completely separate reasons. STRs are completely different from poly-A tails and perform a completely different function.</p></div>		</li>
