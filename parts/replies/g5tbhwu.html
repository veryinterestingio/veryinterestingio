			<div class="markdown"><p>I was looking for this. The move from March to January is a good example that it was initially set up for practical reasons, and changed when the reasons no longer existed. I'm guessing we could probably shorten it even further now, but with the current climate it is probably best to leave the 2+ months to sort out issues and to prepare for transition. Something tells me incoming and outgoing administrations from opposing parties don't put country before politics and work together to transition, smoothly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But why is it &quot;better&quot;? And what about the &quot;current climate&quot; makes this the case?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>elections are dramatic media frenzies now. and often full of bad blood or so it seems to me.
give people time to chill out. </p>
<p>also recounts are incredibly complex and frustrating affairs. i work at a board of electrions in an urbanized county. a recount would take a WHILE. certainly more than a few weeks</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I think people are really underestimating the amount of time it takes for a new president to get ready to take office. There’s a ton of knowledge transfer that needs to happen. It can’t just be Election Day on Tuesday, Inauguration Day on Wednesday if you want a smooth transition of power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bush to Obama was incredibly smooth.<br />
Bush even invited Obama to events to meet world leaders before Obama was inaugurated and worked with him on some bailout funds before Obama took office.   </p>
<p>Aside from the Supreme Court issue in 2001, Clinton to Bush was smooth as well (Although apparently there were a lot of pranks)   </p>
<p>Obama met with Trump during the transition period as well, but it was Trump who soured their meetings when Obama told him he wanted to be a resource.  </p>
<p>In fact, every living former President is quite cordial with each other and they have been historically. The only one that none of them will associate with is Trump. </p>
