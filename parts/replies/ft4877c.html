			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes a recent study found out that dark skinned people use the vitamin D more effectively, thats why lower levels arent a problem for them</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was discovered when researchers noticed that African Americans were chronically vitamin d deficient but showed no signs or symptoms of being so. It was further discovered that they absorb vitamin d less efficiently but make up for it by having enzymes and proteins that allow for more efficient use of the lower amounts of vitamin d</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should be pointed out that groups who had other sources of Vitamin D in colder regions typically kept their melanin at the same level as when they first entered the region even generations later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that this doesn't explain why white, which we'd imagine reflects the light away, is worse. The other important thing is to note that if we could see UV light white skin would be translucent and black skin opaque.</p>
<p>So imagine that your inside your house and light comes through the windows. You are one of the living cells, and light may cause you to mutate and become cancerous.</p>
<p>Skin is like curtains on the windows. But they're kind of translucent, cover some but not all light. They look white though, at least to anyone looking. You could see somethings through it, just as we can see some veins, blood, etc through the skin but not clearly.</p>
<p>Melanin is like black paint that makes the curtains blackout (it is more than that, but the example is enough to explain why dark skin protects better). Depending how much you have is how much light passes through. And we don't care about how much light the superficial skin absorbs as it's mostly dead or soon to be dead cells. It's the epidermis (the fully alive part of your skin, that produces new skin cells) that we care about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is also absorbing visible light a side effect or does it somehow enhance the effect? I'm thinking of how glass is very transparent to visible light but can still block UV.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So there are possible things light can do when it hits something. Go through, be absorbed, or reflected. To get to the dna and do harm it has to pass through the melinan, but in stead it is absorbed before it gets there. Is this correct?</p></div>		</li>
