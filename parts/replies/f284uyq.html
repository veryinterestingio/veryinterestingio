			<div class="markdown"><p>There are strong indications that our hands are specifically shaped to be able to punch without suffering significant damage from the punch itself. As in, our hands have evolved to <em>be</em> kinetic weapons.</p>
<p>Edit: <a href="https://www.livescience.com/52562-hands-evolved-for-fighting.html" target="_blank">found the info</a>. And <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23018-human-hands-evolved-so-we-could-punch-each-other/" target="_blank">another take</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What is the evolutionary advantage of having our hands double as “kinetic weapons”? Do other animals feel the damage from our punches(I find it hard to imagine that we could inflict any damage with punches to a tiger) or was it only advantageous in combat with other humans?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The original hypothesis from researchers in Utah was that punching gave males access to mates. However there's no fossil or dna evidence in their findings. They basically used dead arms to throw punches and tested to see how hard punches could be with a clenched/unclenched fist without damaging the tiny bones in your hand. Speaking as a former boxer and someone who has years of graduate-level evo bio, there's a lot that doesn't add up. First, our fists are damaged immensely by punching stuff (particularly other people), clenched fist or not. In a pre-medicine world of our early ancestors, going around busting your hands would, in my mind, reduce your fitness. Second, our hands are fine-tuned, delicate and dexterous results of selective pressures acting on our tool-use abilities. The fitness conferred by tool usage is huge, and it would have been in direct competition with factors selecting for blunt-force objects. You can read their findings youself. It's interesting research, but there aren't many others in the field who think that they have discredited any other hypotheses with their experiments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't be certain but I think you might be thinking a bit too large there, against a tiger a single human without tools poses very little chance for victory but against smaller aggressive animals that might attack a person a solid punch to the side of the skull would probably do the job quite well</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im not very inclined to believe this. If you full force punch a hard surface without a glove (not limited to bone) you will definitely break your hand, most notably and typically the pinky/ring finger bones and the ones immediately connected to them. Many boxers still have tons of hand problems despite wearing gloves their entire careers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was going to say, anyone with boxing experience will tell you hands are not that great. It's why boxers wear massive gloves and you need to wrap your hands just to train. If anything we're better suited to kicking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An attacker is usually not a hard and unyielding surface, though. Most parts of a torso are squishy or springy, and extremities, heads included, will yield. It's still probably not good for your hand, but not at all comparable to a brick wall or anything like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not really inclined to believe this hypothesis. It's fairly contradictory to what I learned in my primatology and archaeology courses. The commonly held belief was that our hands evolved like this to grasp objects. Also the linked article above seems to suggest our hand shape is more of an ancestral trait than something uniquely human and there really isn't a whole lot of evidence that any other primates use a closed-fist punch when fighting. There are also some issues I have with the validity of an experiment that is basically punching a force guage with cadaver parts.</p></div>		</li>
