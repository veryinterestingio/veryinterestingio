			<div class="markdown"><p>The standard model predicts it to be exactly the same (called a U(1) gauge symmetry). The simplest system, antihydrogen (positron-antiproton system), is often studied for differences in it's x-ray spectrum. These differences would indicate new beyond the standard model physics, and would help pare the field of BSM theories, but no differences have been found yet.</p>
<p>The depressing part of the search physicists realize is that, even in an anti-universe, they still wouldn't be getting laid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically the spectra should be identical. That physics girl video has her visiting a lab where they are trying to do exactly that. They are checking whether precision spectroscopy could show a difference and provide a clue about why we have so much matter and so little antimatter.</p></div>		</li>
