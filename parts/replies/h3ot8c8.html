			<div class="markdown"><p>Aluminum rusts so fast it blocks any more rusting. When you weld aluminum, you want to wipe it right beforehand with acetone to try and wipe off as much of the oxidation right before welding. We really can't see any of this with our bare eyes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Process is called 'passivation' IIRC and most (reactive) metals do it. Iron is kind of a freak in so much as its oxide isn't protective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that's because some of the other components in SS react with oxygen before iron can and their oxidation is less disruptive than rust on iron. effectively creating a protection layer.</p></div>		</li>
