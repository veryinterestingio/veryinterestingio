			<div class="markdown"><p>Molecularly speaking, yes. Glass's rigidity makes it brittle so it breaks more easily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. You can break a concrete brick with your arm, and even multiple, when grading for high belts in martial arts. Breaking a concrete brick is a challenge with injury risks, but you're <em>definitely</em> breaking yourself if you attempt to break a solid glass brick of the same dimensions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This answer leaves out quite a bit. Concrete is less stiff than steel or aluminum, but has equal stiffness to a metal like tin, which still rings like a metal. Material damping is higher for non-metals and composites like concrete.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would it be correct to say that materials that compress more have more air in them? Wood and concrete are porous, whereas glass and metal aren't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of yes, but you're kind of thinking about it backwards. It's due to the structure of the materials that result in the 'ease' of compression and the gaps that can be filled with air. Obviously a more accurate and far more complex answer would discuss the strength of the bonds within each material as well.</p></div>		</li>
