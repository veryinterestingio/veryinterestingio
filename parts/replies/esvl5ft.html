			<div class="markdown"><p>It's unlikely. The fault line everybody is watching for the &quot;big one&quot; (which nobody in-state actually does) is the San Andreas fault, which wasn't the source of today's earthquake.</p>
<p>The July 4th quake was caused by a strike-slip fault line over 100 miles north from the nearest portion of the SA fault. This was an uncommonly powerful earthquake whose epicenter was right on top of a small town. It's important to remember that California gets earthquakes nearly daily, they're just usually out in remote regions and much weaker, so only seismologists notice.</p>
<p>Honestly, seismologists have been prognosticating the &quot;big one&quot; from the San Andreas basically since they started tracking seismic activity in the state. It's a silly thing to get worked up over, because it's impossible to predict with any certainty, and when it comes to seismological events the timelines are usually measured in centuries if not millennia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn’t an earthquake caused from the cascadia subduction zone in northern ca, technically be the “big one” for ca? From what I understand those plates can produce a much larger quake (if I’m remembering correctly from my college geology class at Humboldt State University). Or would a major quake on the San Andreas fault still be the “big one” in that it could be more destructive with such a dense population?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The geology of the LA basin would make the “big one” on the San Andreas pretty destructive for the highly populated area. The  cascadia subduction zone  could produce a much stronger earthquake including tsunamis, but yes it is far less populated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You seem to be suggesting that one earthquake can't trigger another one and it's OK as 100km from the San Andreas fault line.</p>
<p>&quot; The likelihood that a big earthquake will trigger a larger event is roughly one in 20, according to Hough&quot; - national geographic. </p>
<p>So a 7.1 earthquake cant cause another one in a fault line 100km away? Ok then why because they are detectable 3000 km away and a better question:</p>
<p>If it was 30km not 100km from the SA fault line could that have caused the big one?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The motion on a fault (or faults) during an earthquake can either increase or decrease the stress on neighboring faults depending on the details of the earthquake and the location and orientation of the neighboring faults. The less complicated version of that answer is, 'it depends'. <a href="http://static.temblor.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/coulomb-4-July-2019-1024x863.jpg" target="_blank">This map</a>, which comes from this <a href="http://temblor.net/earthquake-insights/southern-california-m-6-4-earthquake-stressed-by-two-large-historic-ruptures-8976/" target="_blank">article</a>, shows a preliminary calculation of how this earthquake rupture changed the stress on neighboring faults. Blues equate to a negative coulomb stress change (i.e. reduced stress) and reds to a positive coulomb stress change (i.e. increased stress). You can see that this gets complicated as generally an earthquake will reduce and increase stress on adjacent sections of the same fault. This example is pretty good as you can see that it has really complicated impact on the Garlock, Panamint valley, and Sierra Nevada faults, but has somewhat uniform impact on the Blackwater fault, all because of the details of the earthquake and the location/orientation of those specific fault. In general, increased stress will eventually lead to an earthquake, but the timing of that depends on the total amount of stress on the fault section (especially when thinking about adding stress from another earthquake) and the strength of the fault section (the first one we can kind of estimate through a variety of ways, the second one is basically impossible to determine). You can think of it like this, if an earthquake adds 5 MPa (mega pascals) of stress to a section of fault plane, the time over which this 5 MPa might cause a rupture depends on the current state of stress and the total stress the fault can take. So if the fault will rupture when stress exceeds 100 MPa, the timing in relation to the addition of this 5 MPa  would be very different if that fault section was sitting at 10 MPa vs 95 MPa (along with the background loading rate, e.g. 1 MPa is added every 10 years from plate motion). We can add extra complications like, what if another earthquake happens in a different location that actually reduces stress by 10 MPa on that same section, etc etc.</p>
<p>As a more direct answer, the USGS in its official communications have indicated there is a <a href="https://twitter.com/USGS/status/1146885879446888450" target="_blank">9% chance that this earthquake would trigger a slighty larger or similar magnitude earthquake in the next week</a>. This is based largely on general earthquake statistics as opposed to anything specific to this area or this fault system.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Well, with the occurrence of the Mw 7.1 goes to show that even low probability events do happen occasionally.</p></div>		</li>
