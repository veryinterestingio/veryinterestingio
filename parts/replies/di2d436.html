			<div class="markdown"><p>Right now I love watching them realize where Of Mice and Men is going. It's a hard read because they reflcrt themselves into Lennie and hate what happens at the end but man, it's powerful to see. I always send a note home before we read that one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have an odd Of Mice and Men story. </p>
<p>Like many, we read it in English class in high school but my teacher also played us some chapters of the book-on-tape in class. The copy of the book-on-tape was read by Gary Sinise (Lieutenant Dan in Forrest Gump and the main character from CSI New York). As we went through the book I started to imagine George as being Gary Sinise; I would picture the actor in the various scenarios as they were being presented in the book, etc.</p>
<p>My head basically exploded when after reading the book, our teacher showed us the film in which Gary Sinise actually plays George! I think John Malkovich plays Lennie. </p>
<p>My imagination had come to life and it was crazy to watch the scenes I pictured in my head come to life in front of my eyes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's pretty deep stuff. I always saw my self in the other guy (George?)</p>
<p>And felt frustrated with Lenny for messing things up and then with George for not trying to keep his dream. </p>
<p>How was it for them?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm doing of Mice and Men for my English GCSE right now, and it's a great book. Having studied it in depth, the way the characters are developed and the way of revealing parts of backstory through realistic and fluid conversations makes it one of my favourite books I've read.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can I recommend looking into having them read Enders Game by Orson Scott Card? That was one of the few books I had to read for school that I actually enjoyed talking about. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember doing Of Mice and Men for my GCSE as well!! I had learnt that stuff so well I knew I was gonna get an A* on my English Lit. Then stupid me went and broke his finger playing cricket and had to use a computer for the exam and got a C on that final exam and an A overall ?. The main reason for my comment though is that I only really understood and was able to really appreciate Of Mice and Men after I had finished school and had time to reflect on it (so I'm happy you really appreciate it now)! You know the whole, the older you get, the wiser you get and all that! Good luck with your exam and don't break your finger!</p></div>		</li>

<p>This person just said, &quot;we read it because I make them.&quot;</p>
<p>They also said it's &quot;challenging&quot; for mentally handicapped students. This isn't saying anything about regular students. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the person teaches handicapped people, so it just got upvoted because people went <em>aww</em>. Meanwhile, the rest of the <em>actual</em> responses (the ones that actually answer the question), are ending up more on the controversial/downvoted side. Mostly because many people will never agree with the answer to this question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ironically  my English classes are the reason I went from an avid reader to not touching books for over 6 years. They fostered a dread of reading in me, whereas before reading was all I did.</p>
<p>Though it was the two 5 page papers due biweekly, and not the books themselves that made me hate it. But I associated books too strongly with the rapud fire essay writing to even touch a book.</p></div>		</li>
