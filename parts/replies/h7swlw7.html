			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason I liked my realtor is that she walked us through everything we needed to do as far as paperwork and everything else is concerned. She was knowledgeable about the areas we were checking out and helped us negotiate.</p>
<p>I could have done all of these things myself, maybe, but having an expert to guide me through the process was great. </p>
<p>In your situation, I can definitely see why you felt a bit ripped off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would routinely cut my commission down to 1% for me (to cover my costs plus a little extra) and 2.5% for the other realtor (because that was industry standard) I would make my money on buying my clients house and the loss leader would be selling theirs. I just could not justify taking tens of thousands of dollars from someone just to sign some preprinted, easily accessible paperwork. It’s insane. The realtor in my area has easily sold 100+ homes this year, with an average commission of 40k each pop. You do the math! Homes don’t take months to sell anymore, one week, only accepting offers on certain days, homes are going for 100’s of thousands over asking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Curious why you used a realtor if you were one for so long, and whether you think you got a higher price for your house because of the realtor. </p>
<p>I remember Freakonomics had a chapter about a study in which realtors got 10% more when they sold their own house than clients’ houses, since in the job they’re heavily incentivized to sell more houses rather than putting that time into getting more for each house, but the opposite is true when it’s their own house.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was at tail end of me wanting to continue being a realtor, I had a house fire at my house and just finished rebuilding when I listed it for sale. I was busy with moving (from my temp rental to my new home) and didn’t have the time to dedicate nor drive to do it. Also, listing and selling my self, photography, video, staging would of cost me plus I have to offer commission to the buyer agent. I would have saved 10k of the 56k I paid. Yes it’s a lot of money but with house prices by me it’s a drop in the bucket.
Ironically enough if my wife and I didn’t push my realtor we would of gotten less. She wanted to list low for a bidding war when bidding wars were starting to fade as buyers were getting tired of it. We listed high, got an offer below list. My wife and I told her to sign back to meet in the middle she advised against it. We made an extra 25k by signing back.
Also my house went from 950k in august of last year to 1.3m by March of this year. It’s insane and I don’t know how people afford it</p></div>		</li>

<p>We're seeing prices soar like that in a handful of Canada's major cities right now... except that Canadians' salaries aren't rising to match and their savings can't keep up. A lot of properties are being bought as investments, and rented out to cover their expenses. Hell, you also have a lot of illegal airbnb rentals.</p>
<p>You're wondering how people can afford it. The answer is that they can't. Property ownership is becoming further and further out of reach for ordinary people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, that’s an enormous increase. Good for you holding the line. Do you know if there’s any hard evidence comparing the “list low + bidding war” strategy vs “list high and wait a little longer”? I’m in Seattle and always see things like “listed for 800k, got 1.2M in two days” and I wonder what if they’d listed at 1.3 and spent a month?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My reality was fucking useless. Sent me ads for houses I already told him I turned down. I set up all the appointments. He was literally only used to open lockboxes. 30k commission. Never again. I'll die in my home or sell it myself with the help of a lawyer. No problem paying if he did some work. Did nothing, he deserves less</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My clients would tell me what they were looking for, I’d set up a few houses to look at, get a better feel, then set them up with an automated emailer that sent listings out. 9/10 would just send me listings they saw online because the public system updates faster than the internal auto emailer. So that basically what I did. They send me a listing, I book the appointment, open the door for them, and let them look. They like it, I download the forms, and ESiGN from my phone from the comfort of my couch. I’d close deals making 30-40k in my underwear. It’s ridiculous.</p></div>		</li>
