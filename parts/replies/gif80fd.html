			<div class="markdown"><p>While it isn't the same, one could probably compare the results of one of the online ones with their ACT/SAT/GRE scores. If they are similar to the average correlation I'd say it's safe to assume the IQ score is within a few points or so of what it would be with an official test. </p>
<p>Like, I took a few online IQ tests when I was younger, and they aligned with my standardized test scores, and again recently took one now post-PhD for shits and giggles and it was still within a few points of those two decades ago in highschool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got one of these in junior high because the private school I was at thought I was &quot;developmentally challenged&quot; and was hurting the class average significantly. Since the school had mandatory average to keep up with, they basically told my parents I would be expelled unless they could prove it was their fault and not mine.</p>
<p>In reality, I was just really bored in class. Don't know why I bothered doing the IQ test so well. Maybe I just thought the puzzles and questions were fun. Regardless, I apparently scored significantly high enough on the IQ test that they actually took me back.</p>
<p>Too bad I didn't get tested again once I came back to Canada. I teach now, and after going through my courses it became apparent to me that I might have been a gifted kid (based on my behavioral issues, boredom, and high score). Instead, I got stuck at a low income public school that once again thought I was a lazy, stupid, troublemaker kid despite getting 80s and 90s whenever a course actually interested me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly! An IQ test shows you ability to complete certain puzzles. But what puzzles are good puzzles for showing general intelligence? Spatial puzzles? Word puzzles? Math puzzles? And you can also practice these puzzles and get better at them. </p>
<p>As the original comment said:</p>
<p>>these tests are constantly re-calibrated, for example kids these days are pretty good at some of those compared to kids a hundred years ago, so using the old tests kids would now score something like 110 or 120 on average. </p>
<p>They are calibrated to a certain type of person so IQ tests are all relative but it depends on who you are comparing to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They test all areas, verbal and written. I was tested quite young, I wasn't told what I was doing, or why I was sent to see someone, a stranger (psychologist) in a closed room in the library for 4 hours a day, with breaks, for a week, so I was pretty nervous. </p>
<p>They do stuff like find the missing item in a picture, going from simple (a chair with 3 legs, for example) to extremely difficult. Put the cards in order to tell a story. What number/symbol comes next in the pattern. They test your answers, and you demeanor, how long you take, are you sure of your answer, how do you express yourself verbally over written,  do you give better answers to difficult questions than easy ones, etc. This is important to scoring.</p>
<p>Some tests score differently than others. 130 on one version may be 140 on another. They generally top out around 150, scoring higher is &quot;breaking&quot; the test. The tests must also be unbiased. Most online ones are biased.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is incorrect. They are recalibrated to shift the distribution such that the mean stays at 100, a one-dimensional change like a thermostats altering temperature in response to feedback.  </p>
<p>The problem you’re referring to, of the seemingly infinite number of dimensions of intelligence involving in solving the infinite variety of problem types, is taken into account in the design of IQ tears.  </p>
<p>In essence, it turns out that no matter how widely you vary the questions and their contexts, you find that there is a common factor uniting all of them and that people who score well one one set of questions tend to score well on the other sets of questions.  </p>
<p>The different sets of questions, representing wildly “different” slices of reality context, actually turn out empirically to correlate with each other.  </p>
<p>It’s a pretty profound fact if you think about it. It implies that we actually do have a general intelligence, which makes us more successful in solving <em>any</em> problem across the board, when it is more powerful.  </p>
<p>It goes against common sense, but it’s what the data shows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this. It's also the reason some countries get incredibly bad scores on certain tests fueling racist rhethorics. Ofc pupils from developed countries with regular math lessons score better on a test adjusted for these children.</p></div>		</li>

It's pretty much the best predictor we have for how good your life is going to be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually not really. At best we can claim IQ tests re likely indirectly measuring a combination of factors such as social class, parental involvement and wealth, ect rather than actual intelligence..these factors are all even more strongly correlated to the outcomes you mentioned.</p>
<p>For instance he best predictor we have of health outcomes in the USA isn't genetics, nor IQ test scores but Zip Code.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One  useful thing behind iq tests is being good at one type of thing on an iq test is positively correlated with doing good at other parts.</p>
<p>So when people like me do really well at some parts and extremely poorly at others that was a strong sign of a certain part of my brain having functional failure</p></div>		</li>
