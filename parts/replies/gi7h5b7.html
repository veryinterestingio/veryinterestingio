			<div class="markdown"><p>Near where the moons of my nails are, I pick at the skin all the time. I find dead skin gets trapped underneath and it’s nice to pull it out. I get hangnails and I pull those out too, causing lots of wounds. I know I shouldn’t do this and I am undergoing treatment. </p>
<p>So I’m just wondering if you can tell me anything interesting about my situation health wise. What is actually happening to my skin and nails?</p>
<p>One thing that bothers me like where does the skin end and the nail begin?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The skin you're picking at is called the keratinized proximal nail fold, commonly mistaken for the cuticle. That dry skin you're finding underneath the fold is the cuticle.</p>
<p>I'm not a dermatologist, so I can't tell you anything regarding the health of your nails. You said you're undergoing treatment, so I would ask the person treating you about the health of your skin and nails, unless they're someone like a psychologist/psychiatrist then I'm not sure they would know. My guess would be you're dealing with dry skin and you have a habit of picking. Softening the skin could probably help lessen the itch to pick.</p>
<p>I can suggest you purchase a pair of sharp cuticle nippers (Tweezerman is the best brand in my opinion) to help nip those hangnails instead of pulling them. It can help reduce the parts that stick up that you tend to pick at. I would also highly recommend you purchase some jojoba oil and start using it to help keep the skin hydrated &amp; supple. Jojoba is the best oil to use due to its molecular size being almost identical to that of our own sebum (body oil). Use it when you wake up, at least once during the day &amp; before bed. Ideally, you want to use it after you wash your hands to help replenish moisture, but that kind of consistency comes with time. Start small with 3 times a day (morning, mid-day &amp; before bed). Focus on rubbing it into your proximal nail fold, as this can stimulate blood flow. However, if the person you're being treated by tells you to do something else (if they're a dermatologist and not a psychologist/psychiatrist) please follow their recommendations before mine. If you're seeing a dermatologist, ask them about the suggestions I've made &amp; see what they say. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the info! I am stuck with my grandma's super short nail beds (my thumbs mostly) I bit my nails all my life until just over a year ago (I'm 25) and I thought that lifelong habit contributed to my short nail bed. Now I know at least there is nothing I can do about it to to just have healthy nails with what I got. But I will have artificial nails for my wedding for sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it possible to change the nail bed shape? The middle finger on both hands have very uneven sides meaning the mail bed drops lower on one side of the nail than the other which makes the crescent shape of the nail uneven when it starts to be white. I figured since it’s mirrored on both hands that it might just by genetic. </p>
<p>Also, my index finger nails have zero curve in them and the nail grow flat and straight, is that another sign of genetics?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, you can't change the shape of your nail bed. Both of those are absolutely due to genetics! The smile line (hyponychium), which is where the edge of the nail bed meets the nail plate, isn't always even or a perfect crescent shape. That's perfectly normal! Same goes for the c-curve, or lack thereof, that's genetic as well! Some people have super tight c-curves, other people have more relaxed curves and some, like your index, have none.</p></div>		</li>
