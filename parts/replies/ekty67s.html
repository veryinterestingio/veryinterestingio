<p>So the people alive today have a lot more native DNA. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even today Spaniards by comparison are pretty dark. Itâ€™s very similar to the ethnic Italian population. Spaniards are descendants of Germanic people, romans and north africans. </p>
<p>Canarians (Canary Islands) made up a large amount of the population in the Americas in certain countries. Cuba, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Parts of Argentina, Colombia and many more. For this reason many of these countries either entirely or at least in certain areas speak lowland spanish.</p>
<p>Canarians identify as spaniards but they emphasize their Guanche (aboriginal) culture. The Canary Islands are closer to Africa than they are to Spain.</p></div>		</li>
