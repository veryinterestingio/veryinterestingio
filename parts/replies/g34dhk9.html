			<div class="markdown"><p>Power markets work much like any other market.  People who trade crops like beans or corn usually never take physical possession of the beans or corn. In the end, though, a buyer is expected to have the ability to take possession when the contract comes due. IF a marketer is holding a contract for beans or corn when it comes due, the people who sold the crops are going to want to send it somewhere other than their own silos.  In the end it is &quot;real stuff&quot; that is delivered.  </p>
<p>Like I said in my previous post, all interconnected power grids must be balanced in real time, moment to moment.  Generation must match load (demand).  So, if nobody buys the power you are holding a contract on, the generation seller has still included this power as part of the &quot;base load&quot; generation and entered into a generation schedule that the generation company sold.  Their power plant is going to generate what is called for in the contract at the specific time of day that is specified. If the &quot;trader&quot; who bought the contract doesn't have a plant or other piece of large equipment to use the generation, too bad, he pays for the contract and &quot;loses&quot; the power.  This is a risk in this market that traders should understand going in, but several have been burned bad learning this lesson of the market.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get the futures stuff, that's basically the same as buying stocks. What I didn't get was how the stocks and real time grid power affected each other. It feels like power and ownership of it must move the same way that buying stuff in games does? You don't actually get anything but you're directing it. And if you got power but nowhere to put it, that's a surplus; need power and don't have it, a shortage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the electrons don't care where they're going. You pay for a certain amount of power to be added to the grid and then you're allowed to take that much out. We can't say that power came from the same power station that you paid to add it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Moment to moment is just that.  Every moment matters.  Typically things are scheduled on the top of the hour.  Factories buy power based on their worker shifts and their own production needs.  So generally speaking, in the mornings, some car manufacturers start their shifts at 7am or 8am.  Demand for power increases as the factory assembly lines ramp up.  Steel and other metal manufacturing plants may take advantage of nighttime temperatures and humidity conditions to more efficiently melt and process steel, so their plants will ramp up at 7pm and run peak capacity though the night.  </p>
<p>Commercial customers buy power contracts based on their expected use these schedules make up a component of the generation schedules called base load.  But moment to moment, at any time, a plant may trip offline (protective failure), a lightening storm may cause power outages or a component may fail.  At any moment you may go from having a 30,000 megawatt demand to a 25,000 megawatt demand because of these unpredictable events.  </p>
<p>Generation operators (in most of the US) must be ready at any moment to ramp generation up or down to meet these conditions and balance grid frequency at 60 Hertz.  So, even though a lot is scheduled, moment to moment really means seconds to minutes.  There are other protection schemes like automatic generation control in play that give some flexibility in how quickly a response must happen.  But operators still have to watch it and adjust it constantly.</p></div>		</li>
