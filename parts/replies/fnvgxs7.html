			<div class="markdown"><p>My mom told me this. She had me so scared of the pain that I did chores all afternoon after my booster. </p>
<p>A decade later, I reinjured myself and got a TDaP vaccine at the hospital. I was instructed to rest, which confused me and I asked, &quot;aren't we supposed to move it?&quot; They laughed and told me my mom had tricked me into doing lots of chores.</p>
<p>I confronted my mom and she laughed and told me yes, she made that up.</p>
<p>What's surprising is, it worked! Never got pain when I did chores, but I was a bit sore after the hospital visit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always get the TDaP in my dominant arm because moving it helps with the pain and soreness so I force myself to move it. I feel like you got bad advice at the hospital and your mom was on to something there!</p></div>		</li>
