			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, this is Natalie Beck. I am a certified genetic counselor in pediatric and adult genetics here at Johns Hopkins Medicine. This is a very timely question. Genetic privacy is a topic that is important to us as genetic counselors and we know it is also important to our patients and consumers of genetic testing. Clinical diagnostic genetic testing completed through your genetic counselor or physician is private to your medical record and protected by HIPAA. It is not uploaded into any public databases. Consumers who opt to pursue at home test kits (direct to consumer testing) do so outside of the protection of HIPAA and they may not have control over when, how or where their genomic data may be bought, sold or shared, or used by the test company. Many of the companies generating direct to consumer tests are relatively new and therefore it remains unclear what companies are doing with the data. Some consumers may opt to upload their results from direct to consumer testing to public databases which can be accessed by the general population, including researchers and law enforcement alike to compare DNA markers to determine ancestry/relatedness among people.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your response.</p>
<p>I know, specifically with 23 and me, they then continue to send surveys and such to the patients so the can continue to identify trends.  I'm guessing when you go through your medical provider this is not an option, or is there some system to remove personally identifying information (which sounds impossible with DNA) and only you and your doctor have any way of linking that DNA to yourself?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For starters, the original test wasn't done under a HIPAA covered entity. Second,when you take and submit your data to a public forum, it then becomes searchable to the public. So even if the original data was done under a covered entity and the person to whom the dna belongs, decides to submit it to a public database, from that point forward, it isn't a HIPAA violation. Ancestry and 23 &amp;me do not have to follow the regulations set forth by HIPAA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This might be a bit late to ask, but do you know anything on how this'll work moving forward? Specifically, as commercial companies try to dabble in clinical testing and may come under increasing FDA oversight, do you think this'll change how the data can be used?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To my knowledge, the data's owner had elected to upload it to a webiste that was easily accessible to just about anyone, so I don't believe it was 'private' by that point.</p></div>		</li>
