			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much.  There are a few others.  Weight is pretty important beyond just what you eat.  Smoking.  Once you have significant disease then medications are used. Post AMI most people are put on aspirin.  For people with high cholesterol the statin medications are used.  There is some evidence of other medications for cholesterol management but statins are the most powerful.   Control of blood pressure also factors in to risk of cardiovascular disease though off the top of my head i am not sure if that is through reducing build up or reducing chance of rupture.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Statins are the most studied and used, but are far from the most powerful now! I've been on a few different types of newer drugs, my favorite being the one I'm now now, a PCSK9 inhibitor. Far stronger and early studies show promising for reduction in preexisting plaque buildup.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theres also a theory that chronic high blood sugar can lead to damaged arterial walls, where subsiquent steps follow. So exercise is good along with fiber rich foods (for many reasons). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's kind of true, but have you ever seen an endarterectomy? That is essentially physically removing plaque buildup and it is kind of exactly how you are saying most people visualize it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I googled it too, and it looks... cut off the blood flow to my brain, slit open the main line to remove obstacle, stitch together and hope I'm still the same after blood flow resumes. And, oh, make sure there is no debris left in the system to clog up a part of my brain. Yeah, I would've written down all passcodes and checked that my will was up to date before going in for the procedure, but when it has come this far, the alternatives are pretty clear. </p></div>		</li>
