			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, I'm not understanding this.  Ok you want to launder your 10 mil so you pay an art dealer and bought a painting for 10 mil.  You have a dumb painting in your possession, but your 10 mil is not yours anymore.  The art dealer now has it and it's on his books and he has to pay a chunk of tax on it.  So now what?  How do you get your money back? (Minus the taxes that the art dealer has to pay). Unless the art dealer just slides that cash back over to you but then you're in the same boat as before just with less cash due to taxes</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s not how it works…but I want to add that you might be confusing tax evasion with money laundering.</p>
<p>Laundering money is not about evading taxes. It’s called laundering because you are taking dirty money and “cleaning” it with legal activities. Or exchanging money from illegal activity into a legitimate one.</p>
<p>Tax evasion and laundering are not the same thing.</p>
<p>I’m not entirely sure how it works with an art gallery, but I would guess it would be similar to how laundering is traditionally done. You mix your “dirty” money with legal transactions. For example, a crime boss owns several car washes. He will report more cash income to those car washes than he actually makes with illegal money. Yes he pays taxes on it, but at least he doesn’t have to keep millions or dollars under his bed and worry about it getting stolen, or feds sniffing around wondering how he can afford things beyond his means.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the art dealer needs to be in on it, and would actually just be a front.</p>
<p>the art dealer might have a shop indirectly owned by a guy who secretly organizes a bunch of profitable crimes. he's in direct communication with the art dealer. so this criminal has a bunch of crime cash, then he buys a bunch of art with crime cash (anonymously), then the cash flows up from the art dealer to the owner of the art shop.</p></div>		</li>
