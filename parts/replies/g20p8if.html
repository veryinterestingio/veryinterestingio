			<div class="markdown"><p>It turns out that you can purchase a 406mhz Personal Locator Beacon (e.x. The ACR ResQLink) for about $250-$350 with no service fee and a 5 year battery life.  If you have it with you and have a clear view of the sky, you simply extend the antenna and press the button in a life threatening emergency, and in as little as six minutes a satellite will identify that a signal exists, and in the best cases decode the GPS coordinates of the transmitting device and the ID, which will then get dispatched to someone on land to start coordinating a rescue effort with the most appropriate agency.  It works world wide, and with the newest GPS satellites out which have receivers as a secondary mission, the coverage is getting even better.  It also transmits on 121.50 mhz which aircraft could pick up, and helps with radio direction finding if the GPS signal is wrong.</p>
<p>For people that are out very frequently, the Iridium based Garmin In Reach allows two way texting with SAR teams, as do some of the Spot products that operate on Globalstar's network.  Coverage is shittier and pricing higher but you get more features.</p>
<p>Last week in Boulder County, Colorado, hikers used an InReach or similar device to notify GEOS that they had heard hikers in the area calling for help.  It ended up resulting in a 17 hour recovery mission with two hikers that were cliffed out being winched up to a helicopter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yah, the inReach is a great device, but it's pretty costly both upfront and in terms of monthly service if you're only using it for SAR purposes and only out periodically especially since PLB's have no monthly fees (they're covered in the US by general taxes).  It makes a lot of sense if you are using the mapping, tracking, or texting functions, especially frequently.  You can suspend the inReach service which is nice, and something you can't do IIRC with spot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would also recommend an EPIRB if you don't have one already. They are designed for the marine environment. They also have a hydo-static release which means if you boat capsizes or is taking on water it will automatically be released, float, and transmit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I need to add to this. I am an RCC (rescue coordination center) controller and if you own a PLB or boat version; EPIRB. REGISTER THE FUCKING THING AND KEEP THE INFORMATION CURRENT! PLBs are really good because they are GPS encoded which doesn't rely on the SARSAT satellite to determine your position but most EPIRBs rely on multiple satellites to received the 406mhz signal to determine location. In the mean time I, the RCC controller only has your registration information to work with. So if you have out dated number, or didn't update it when you bought the boat or second hand beacon, we have no idea who/where you are or have an emergency contact to find out where to start looking. I can go for days but ill stop here. You are required to update your EPIRB registration every 2 years. Google &quot;NOAA beacon registration&quot; and it should get you to the right place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Personally I carry it frequently, and you can find areas that are relatively in civilization around here but still have no cell service, and a 20 minute class 1 walk would suddenly become a very big problem if you ended up breaking a leg or something.  But rental can certainly make sense for people that would be occasional users.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's quite the outlier and an extremely unique situation really, and being prewarned and all they where able to change the aircraft operating parameters to aid them. Normally they may as well be birds in the sky for all the help they would be, at 37'000ft your not even in their world of existence they simply will not see you.</p>
<p>To put it another way, at 37'000ft they are 7 miles high. Imagine standing on a hill high enough that you could see 7 miles before the horizon got in the way. You really are gonna need that nuke, because you wouldn't even see a flare.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Super informative comment!</p>
<p>One question: when you say the biggest fire you can make... what if I'm on an island that has like idk 100 trees and a pretty huge beach, so I set fire to all those trees and go to safety on the beach... wouldn't you just think it's a naturally occurring forrest fire or whatever?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A great question and unfortunately, one which the answer would probably be yes, but I like to think you would at least attempt to make the fire look man made. Try and make it on the beach instead so its very obvious and unnatural place to make the fire, even if it has to be a bit smaller. Or combine it with a massive sign on the beach like an X or V.</p></div>		</li>
