			<div class="markdown"><p>you'd be surprised to know that people who mainly consume lamb or goat say that corn fed beef tastes &quot;gamey&quot; to them.</p>
<p>i think its just a matter of what taste you get accustomed to and anything different is considered &quot;gamey&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've yet to figure out what gamey means .  ive had venison, bison, and whatever I just have never noticed something so different that I'd say, &quot;oh that is gamey&quot; .  no idea, I have no comprehension of the word besides what people try to describe it as.  For me it's like describing a new color.  It means nothing to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lamb is almost always grass-fed while most beef and pork are grain-fed. I attribute the concept of gaminess to any flavor that is outside the typical range of flavors found in grain-fed meat. That’s why gaminess has no defined flavor. Some say it’s got an iron flavor, others a grassy flavor, some say it tastes musty, etc...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To me lamb tastes more grassfed (which it generally is) than gamey. The gamey flavor of for instance deer tastes more livery to me.</p></div>		</li>
