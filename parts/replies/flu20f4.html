			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s also how it’s grown for people. Unless you’re rich and buying overpriced “organic” veggies all your food is also grown like that. And no those farms that you mention cannot provide enough food for the planet. The practices simply are not scalable for billions of people. The yields are terrible and expensive when compared to traditional methods. It’s awesome for you if you can grow your own or afford to buy the overpriced stuff but no, it’s not a solution for the planet.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The truth is closer to 'we haven't spent the years and dollars researching and perfecting how to make this scalable to billions of people, but we've begun and were making progress.' More demand for sustainable produce would produce more incentive for agribusiness to try.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Many crops are GMO to increase hardiness and decrease susceptibility to pesticides and herbicides. Therefore, many farmers use a lot of these types of chemicals to increase their yields.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Was this information in one of your sources? I can remember reading that this is a myth, and that GMO crops are usually designed to require fewer chemicals and be more hearty against pests by default. Also that organic farms must actually use more pesticides, because the organic pesticides that they use are less effective than modern chemical technology, while not necessarily being any better for the environment.</p>
<p>Putting chemicals on your crops is expensive &amp; time consuming. Why would farmers buy seed that requires more of that? Their objective is to make more money &amp; charge less, and when the &quot;GMO&quot; label is not going to encourage people to pay more money for the product, like &quot;organic&quot; does. Modern technology like GMO being designed to require more upkeep makes no logical sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some GMOs are designed to need fewer chemicals, some are designed to withstand huge amounts of pesticides. I am strongly pro-GMO, I think they're one of humanities coolest accomplishments and that they continue a tradition of crop modification that's existed for thousands of years, but the way a lot of these companies are run is horrifyingly unethical and bad for the environment.</p>
<p>Edit: so I looked into this a little further and it looks like I'm conflating a bunch of different issues because this is a really complicated topic (shoutout to u/nbarbettini for making me fact check, I appreciate you.) Monsanto is famous for roundup-ready crops, which are designed to resist glyphosate. While it's not used in huge quantities, it's ril bad -- likely carcinogenic, kills good insects as well as bad, and has ramifications up the food chain. The other thing that makes these crops bad is that they're sterile; if a farmer buys seeds from Monsanto once, they can't collect seeds from their new crops to plant new ones, they're forced to keep buying from Monsanto.</p>
<p>Another issue with largescale monoculture crops comes in the form of government water subsidies, which are structured in such a way that if a farmer doesn't use all of their allotment, they lose the whole thing. This encourages farmers to plant water-intensive crops. In addition, the extra water flushes a <em>ton</em> of pesticides and fertilizer into our waterways, causing stuff like the dead zone in the gulf of Mexico. </p>
<p>I stan the hell out of GMOs, GMOs did not cause all this, but goddamn we got a lot to fix.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The only one I'm aware of is glyphosate, and AFAIK it's fairly small amounts. What else is there?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Idk about this, but I do know that it takes more passes over a field to grow organic than it does to grow normal crops. This means more machine hours, meaning more emissions. Organic meat then uses monoculture feed, that has more emissions than non organic feed. And &quot;organic&quot; doesn't mean &quot;chemical free&quot; it just basically means the chemicals used can't be made in a lab. It doesn't even mean the organic chemicals have to be the safer option. Just that they have to be naturally occurring. </p>
<p>Basically it's not anywhere near as black and white as one would think.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did not cite an article earlier, but here is <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/8/e1600850" target="_blank">the main one</a>. You are right that in some plants, particularly those modified to be insect resistant led to a decrease in pesticide use. In most categories, modified vs not-modified didn't show any statistically significant difference in pesticide or herbicide use. For some modified crops, there has been in increase in herbicide use in particular. This leads back to the environmental impact of monoculture crops and gene cross events leading to herbicide resistant wild plants.</p>
<p>It's a trade-off, and it is important to be aware of the existing and potential side effects of the way many places farm.</p>
<p>Crops are genetically modified for all sorts of reasons. Not needing to use as much pesticide is just one way. It is also modified to be resistant to these chemicals that are already in wide use. They are also modified for size or flavor or growth time or nutrient content or many other reasons <a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/genetically-modified-organisms-gmos-transgenic-crops-and-732/" target="_blank">designed to impact human lives in a positive way</a>, and we should continue exploring avenues that are only available from modified crops. There are lots of reasons farmers choose to use GMO seed. For many, it may be an increase or decrease or net neutral on their pesticide/herbicide use on previous non-GMO seed but they have invested in this seed for other reasons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a farmer, we use manure as part of the nutrient package to help replenish the soil. Manure is recognized as an excellent source of the plant nutrients nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K). In addition, manure returns organic matter and other nutrients such as calcium, magnesium and sulfur to the soil, building soil fertility and quality.  </p>
<p>What cost effective alternatives are there?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely! That's one of the reasons it is so important to give animals pasture to graze in. It prevents their valuable manure from collecting in one central location that makes it more susceptible to runoff events. The animals leave nutrient rich manure behind which is crucial to put on crops to ensure and build the health of the soil.</p>
<p>There are many ways to use manure in an eco-friendly way that minimizes the amount of runoff that makes it into waterways. See <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fertilizer-runoff-overwhelms-streams/" target="_blank">this article</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First off, good for you for using manure instead of petrochemical garbage. Second; Cost effective or price effective? The lower price alternative often just externalizes part of the cost onto non consenting third parties downstream. For example gulf fisherman losing their livelihoods to dead zones caused by runoff in the Mississippi River. I’m all for moderate manure use as a plant fertilizer, but high concentration feed lots just have way too much of a good thing in too small of an area. Honestly I don’t think industrial scale monoculture can be done sustainably. Crop diversity, cover crop rotations. and limited integration of livestock rotations are the future in my opinion. Once all the prime land gets corned to death we’ll need to start digging up lawns and get a whole lot more people involved.  #foodcreators</p></div>		</li>
