			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point. I think the hot dog story given in another answer is a pretty good ELI5 of what I said, though I think it should've been framed in terms of the consumer rather than the business. It's the businesses that respond to [expected] drops in consumer demand--not consumers stopping because firms inexplicably close their doors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, I was just talking about this today with my brother's back in Michigan. Ford and GM have both made cuts in anticipation of a recession. Is this not the same as 3, when consumers cut back? </p>
<p>Except amplified, because they're such large companies that then have a ripple effect through the economy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting! I'd say it's the result of #3. As consumers [are expected to] cut back on their spending, companies cut back on production. </p>
<p>But it would be really interesting to know exactly why GM and Ford have cut back though, in this particular case. They're also facing rising labor and material input costs, namely steel, due to tariffs. So for them it's probably a combination of that <em>and</em> lower expectations for consumer demand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not saying it's the result of #3, I'm saying it has the same effect as #3. GM and Ford are cutting spending and &quot;saving for a rainy day&quot;, just like consumers. Except on a larger scale, that then spreads out to their suppliers and onward. Eventually helping spur a recession.</p>
<p>In effect GM and Ford are &quot;consumers&quot; of both labor and parts from their suppliers, so them cutting back is the same as consumer cutting back, but bigger.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And?  Those effects should be ubiquitous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really is that ambiguous. I am using the definition given by the <a href="https://www.nber.org/cycles.html" target="_blank">National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)</a>, that a &quot;recession is a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales.&quot;</p>
<p>The NBER's dating of business cycles is the standard virtually everyone relies on. [Edit: It seems you are right that the media prefers the &quot;two quarter&quot; definition, which is the common textbook definition. But the NBER standard is the one used by economists.]</p></div>		</li>
