Do you mean induce? Also, could you clarify adapting to stress vs &quot;getting used to it&quot; based on the image.      </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As mentioned, an introduced stressor leads to changes in hormone activity. Generally, the changes in hormone activity happen in order to allow us to handle the stressor better. Therefore, I think &quot;reduce&quot; is more accurate, but a better way to put it would probably be &quot;combat the source of&quot;.</p>
<p>Adapting to stress and &quot;getting used to it&quot; is the same thing; &quot;getting used to it&quot; being a more colloquial way of putting it. Could've clarified that in my original post, sorry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok that's what I thought. However there is still part of this I'm unsure of. The image describes a situation of chronic stress where the subject gets used to the stress, and eventually their body is exhausted causing the overflow you mentioned. Is it referring to getting used to as in 'ignoring it', so the damage keeps happening. Maybe it's different for psychological stress vs physical stress. </p></div>		</li>
