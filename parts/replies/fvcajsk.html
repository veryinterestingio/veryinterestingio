			<div class="markdown"><p>That...actually kind of makes sense. Seems fairly plausible you’d do that, in a sort of gentlemanly agreement way.</p>
<p>“Look guys, we want to kill you, and don’t want to die, so we need to wear armour. But it’s too hot for armour. But it’s also too hot for <em>you</em> to wear armour, so you can’t fight either or you’ll drop like flies. How about we fight at night so we can both wear armour?”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it might also be, &quot;we have the shady ground, let the foreign idiots assemble in the open at noon, in a couple hours when they are ready to go, our troops will be rested and cool, theirs will be passing out from sunstroke.&quot; </p>
<p>So it's more about knowing to use the sun as a weapon, and keeping your army stationary in shade during the high heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You freaking idiot..
What's wrong with you? Astronauts don't visit the sun at night?
How is that even possible? Do you even science bro?</p>
<p>There is no sun at night.
They clearly visit the sun in the evening when it's mild and comfortable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. In Iraq one summer it was average of 125f every day. We ran out of water for a day and a half and no one passed out or died. All we were able to do is set up shade and sit down.
When we DID have water it was boiling hot so we never drank a lot.</p></div>		</li>
