			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it is. Mainly. So when wind is blowing away from the coast the waves will too, just takes a while before the wind gas put in enough energy to create higher waves. Simple. Source: did a phd in wave hydrodynamics ;-)  lots of details that I could add but this is the basics.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Too be clear when  /r/sanpou says &quot;it takes a while&quot; they mean distance.  Waves need wind travelling over the water for a distance (fetch) to form.  So the waves won't be large enough to notice close to shore because there is not sufficient fetch to build them over.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also in the ocean, the movement of tides will have some offsetting effects, making it harder for the waves to gain traction.
In most lakes its all wind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but the wind you see at the beach is always much weaker than wind you would see in the middle of the ocean. The waves you see at the beach are often residual from much bigger waves offshore.</p></div>		</li>
