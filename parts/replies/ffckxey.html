			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably just run the air through filters. They need to filter out the carbon dioxide anyway, so there would be a pre-filter for dust. I imagine they have humidifiers and dehumidifiers to keep the humidity where they want it. I would think you want enough humidity to not get static all the time (damages electronics), but not so high that it condenses on cold stuff (and damages electronics).</p></div>		</li>

<p>The air conditioner is also a dehumidier. This hooks up to the water purification system.</p></div>		</li>
