			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe &quot;math&quot; is the wrong word. &quot;Logical reasoning&quot; maybe? If she knows that &quot;plus&quot; means the numbers will be added together, I'd assume she would be able to add 10+4 and 4+10 just as easily. She can't yet do this, so I figure this means she's just repeating memorized facts instead of really adding the numbers. As others here have mentioned, there's really nothing wrong with memorizing like this. But it does make me curious about how accurate research can be on this topic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;+&quot; or &quot;plus&quot; is actually not trivial if it's the first operator you've ever encountered, particularly its commutativity. Looking up a value in memory is easier than performing the operation, if only because doing to more resembles things that the child has already done in the past. As others have pointed out, it's not a huge problem, as they can later use their memorized facts to support their understanding of the operator.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure you'd be pleased to know that an influential movement working in the end of the 1800:s had the explicit goal to derive all of mathematics from logic/philosophy. The short of it is that they failed (GÃ¶del, Church, Turing et alia showed that), but they also managed to advance mathematics, logic as well as philosophy. We are the only known species to make a leap anything like this, even from Euclid's simple geometry (which is already quite advanced).<br />
And yet, I'd argue, that most of the basic facts of mathematics as it is done today was known well before this ostensive failure.</p></div>		</li>
