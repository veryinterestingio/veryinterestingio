			<div class="markdown"><p>My older daughter absolutely would not go to sleep unless I swaddled her as tightly as I could, she also wouldn't fall asleep unless she was on her tummy. So I always had to swaddle her tight and put her on on tummy and then after she had been sleeping for about 5min go back and flip her onto her back. My younger daughter liked being swaddled but always wanted her right hand by her face. So I would swaddle her up tightly but leave her right hand out. She had no problems falling asleep on her back though. So I could wrap her up and be done. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where I'm from (Canada), you are not supposed to swaddle anymore. For sleeping you get a sleepsack, specially designed for infants and gives the feel of being swaddled without the dangers of being swaddled. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I urge new parents and old parents who may be carring for a new baby to research the latest suggested methods for avoiding SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome). They have changed their practices over time. It's always good to brush up on infant/child safety. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Swaddling absolutely does NOT increase the chance of SIDS, provided you lay your baby down on its back. You also don’t want to start swaddling your baby when it’s 2 months old (when SIDS risk is highest), so if you started swaddling as a newborn, you’re good to go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you google &quot;is it safe to swaddle an infant&quot; it comes up with a lot of reading material you can check out. At our prenatal classes they told us that they aren't even allowed to teach us how to do it. The safe alternative is using a sleep sack. We used several as our baby grows, made by a company called Halo. Have a look. </p></div>		</li>
