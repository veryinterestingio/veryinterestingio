			<div class="markdown"><p>Things like, when wanting to have directed questions during a lecture, to not call out individual students for answers. You need to use group activities that prevent anyone from feeling a target for being wrong, so I would do things like, have little groups and they would write their answers on a mini-whiteboard and we'd go around the room and talk about right answers, and if wrong, why it was wrong. Since the answer was submitted as a group of 5 students or so, it spreads out responsibility for the answer and so kids don't feel targeted.</p>
<p>Edit: I just thought of another one. My students would be participants in the testing system, so that I could demystify tests and reduce the stress associated with them. I would actively share my guidelines for what needs to be taught and explain how, this was in texas so they're called TEKS, each of them work. Then the students would do some practice work with me and I'd give them individualized lists of each TEK that were not capable of doing, and explain outside class resources they could use to get a better understanding of that particular thing. All of this in order to make it so that when testing time came, they were far less concerned about the test, because they KNEW what content was on the test, without knowing the answers specifically.</p></div>		</li>
