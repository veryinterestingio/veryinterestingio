			<div class="markdown"><p>Mathematics is just a purer, more generalised way of describing stuff. Makes sense to use it for a new situation (eg alien life) where using a specific concept might turn out to not be accurate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The term of zero sum game is mostly used in games. For example in chess, each chess piece has value. If you take a pawn, that's has 1 cost, your opponent lose 1 cost. Zero sum. </p>
<p>Math is crucial here so that computers can evaluate the overall value of each move.</p>
<p>I think they want to give a different angle of the mutualism for the modern audience which is exposed on a lot of games and AI.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes? I can't imagine why you're having an issue understanding, it was pretty integral to the plot that the Americans offer up their portion of Heptapod B in a non-zero-sum game to get others to offer their portions as well.</p>
<p>The whole movie is about communicating and working with others.</p></div>		</li>
