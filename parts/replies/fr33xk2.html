			<div class="markdown"><p>Botulism comes from what's known as an <em>anaerobic</em> bacteria; it doesn't require oxygen to reproduce. A sealed can at room temperature is a fine place for the bateria (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium_botulinum" target="_blank"><em>C. botulinum</em></a>) to grow. (In fact, as far as I can tell <em>C. botulinum</em> is what's called an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obligate_anaerobe" target="_blank"><em>obligate anaerobe</em></a>, meaning that the cells will straight-up die in the presence of too much oxygen, such as you'd find in the atmosphere.) Those bacteria produce a toxic byproduct, and that's what makes you sick. Their growth also produces a gas, which is why you should never eat from a can that's bulging.</p>
<p>As for how it gets in, it's <em>usually</em> because of improper canning or cooking methods. The bacteria were already in the food to begin with and they weren't successfully killed off before it was canned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So it turns out that if you thoroughly heat any food contaminated with botulinum toxin to ~185F, you can safely eat it (in terms of the botulinum toxin).  At that temperature the toxin denatures and won't actually harm you, however if you allowed the food to cool, it could start to build the toxin again (you need to heat the food over 220F to kill the spores).</p>
<p>This doesn't work with all sorts of food toxins, but it does with some.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, I've personally wanted to know how hearty is C. Botulinum.</p>
<p>For purposes of mycology, there's debate within the community about using an instant pot as an autoclave. </p>
<p>Thing is, there's no easily found thermal death time charts for shit like trichoderma.  I have anecdotal, individual test results that show my sterilization process is viable. But no hard empirical.</p>
<p>C.B. has charts. If I nuke a jar of mushroom spawn at 243F for 2 hours, I'm extremely confident it's good. But I don't have data.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nobody seems to have mentioned this so I'll chime in...</p>
<p>The toxin is destroyed by boiling at sea level temperature... The organism that produces it IS NOT. Commercially canned goods are pressure cooker (boiled at ~250F) to kill the organism. Most botulism cases in food come from home canned goods, not commerical goods. Even after a puncture or ruptured can.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The botulinum bacterium is anaerobic - it does not require oxygen. There are two risks: if the food is not sufficiently sufficiently pasteurized, the bacteria will thrive. The second is that the botulinum toxin may already be in the food, and again if not heated sufficiently may not be destroyed.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It goes even further than that, actually. <em>C. botulinum</em> is an obligate anaerobe, meaning that not only does it not need oxygen, it actually can't survive in the presence of oxygen.</p></div>		</li>
