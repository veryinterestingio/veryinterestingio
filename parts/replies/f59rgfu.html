			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a thread not too long ago (I think in this very sub) where the topic came up of &quot;how much of what I drink has already been peed out by someone else before it gets to me.&quot;</p>
<p>As it turns out, not much (but some!). Because humans haven't been around that long in the grand scheme of things. But dinosaurs? Well the odds of any given glass of water containing dino-pee are much higher since they had a good 189 million year run. We've got some catching up to do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did it take into account that deep water doesn't mix with shallower water, and over the course of a single lifetime, it's mostly just the surface layer of ocean water that's participating in the water cycle? That reduces the total volume of water in the equation by magnitides.</p>

<p>In fact, the important thing isn't that dinosaurs have been around for so long, but merely that there are <em>so many</em> molecules in a glass of water (or a lungful of air) that the odds of some of it having been recycled at some point is pretty much a certainty. In fact, the odds are pretty much certain that not only have you drunk water that's passed through another human, you've almost certainly drunk some water that's passed <em>through you</em> in the past.</p>
<p>(There's a bit of a caveat to this. Water molecules aren't particularly stable, so a single H₂O molecule in your glass doesn't remain that particular H₂O molecule for long; the H and OH separate and reform with other atoms, so the odds of drinking the exact same combination of H, H and O is vanishingly small. However, the odds of ingesting some of the H or O atoms that have gone through your system in water before seems to be pretty reasonable.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always wondered this. How many of the water molecules are stable AS WATER for that amount of time? Surely there's a significant portion of water which is only a few thousand years old, and it used to be air and some hydride somehwere?</p></div>		</li>

<p>While I'm sure some of the water that we drink migrates through the body by osmosis or whatever, and winds up in the bladder and expelled, most of the water we consume gets broken down and used to build cells, digest food, and generally participate in the grand chemistry of life.  It doesn't stay water.</p>
<p>The bulk of the water we excrete is byproduct. It isn't thousands of years old. It was made only hours or minutes ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Argon-39 can be used to <strong>identify water</strong> that recharged between 50 and 1,000 years ago. Carbon-14 or radiocarbon is the most common method used to <strong>determine</strong> groundwater <strong>ages</strong> between 1,000 and 30,000 years. </p>
<p>But water can split into oxygen and hydrogen and then recombine to become water again (or those ions could become part of some other molecule).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I very well could be wrong about this but, since water is evaporated during the water cycle, wouldn't that mean that (aside from contamination already in the air) rain water is essentially distilled?</p>
<p>It's why endorheic lakes (I'm grouping the oceans in with this, btw) are salty. Water evaporates as part of the water cycle leaving behind dissolved minerals and contaminants and bacteria.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes it would, and people all over the world collect rainwater in barrels beside their houses especifically for drinking.  You can even get gadgets that attach to your tent's rain fly to drain the rainwater into bottles so you can have fresh rainwater while camping.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorta. There are other things in the air as well. Sulfuric and nitric oxides for example is an  industrial byproduct and is historically the cause of acid rain. Plus rain is a result of a seeded cloud, where dust and other micro particles allow the cloud to condense into a rain drop. This might not seem like a lot  but the amazon forest is a direct result of the dust coming from Africa. But for the most part, rain is distilled water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on the locale it will be more or less distilled. Areas with lots of pollutants or particulates in the air will cause the water to absorb some of these substances, altering the chemistry. But this is only really an issue around cities and other high density residential areas.  Most places will have clean rainwater.</p></div>		</li>
