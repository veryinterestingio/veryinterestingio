			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about OP, but I use transferwise for US &lt;-&gt; CAD transfers. Incredibly reasonable fees (usually about 13 USD on a 1000 USD transfer) and the money arrives within two days maximum, but usually less than 24hrs</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Using intermediaries is different. The money you receive on the other end aren't &quot;the same&quot; as the ones you sent. The intermediary just have an account in each country, sometimes in each bank in the country as well, and when you transfer money across borders, you are actually just transferring money internally in the two banks - from your account to theirs, and from theirs to yours.</p>
<p>This is possible because the intermediary takes the risks associated with the transfer, and therefore you also pay a small fee.</p>
<p>On a totally separate note, it also makes it hella easy to launder  money in small amounts.</p></div>		</li>
