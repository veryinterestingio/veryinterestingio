<p>iii) <strong>How many times does the number four fit in the answer from (iii)</strong>?<br />
Well, 4 fits into 6 one time because 4 <em> 1 is 4 and 4 </em> 2 is 8.</p>
<p>v) <strong>Add all yours answers from (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)</strong>.<br />
In our example, we get 2 + 6 + <strong>8</strong> + 3 which is 19.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So if the answer to (iii) is 1, why do you add 8 in step (v)? That's the only part of your step-by-step I can't follow. It doesn't affect the outcome but it should be +1 because 6/4 = 1 with a remainder of 2, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, thanks for catching that. It was just a typo and although it wouldn't affect the answer it still was wrong. Thanks! It should have been a 1 instead of an 8. But since 1 is congruent to 8 when modding by 7 it didn't change anything.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, we first have to memorize that the following dates are <strong>doomsdays: 2/28 or 2/29 (if date in question is during leap year),  3/7, 4/4, 6/6, 8/8, 10/10, 12/12, 7/11, 11/7, 5/9, and 9/5</strong>. Now, apparently there are some other, more specific dates, that are doomsdays, like July 4th and Halloween. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>3/7 and 11/7 are not on the same weekday.
July 4th would make more sense...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes they are. 3/7 is 7 days away from the last day of February. July 4th also makes sense. But 3/7 and 11/7 are on the same weekday.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My bad. I read this as DD/MM, not MM/DD. Since this is usually paired like 7/11 and 11/7, it's only relevant for 3/ 7 (March 7th) and February.</p></div>		</li>
