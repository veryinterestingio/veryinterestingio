			<div class="markdown"><p>My wife's lab grown diamonds (for her engagement ring) cut the cost in half.</p>
<p>I had a real sapphire as the centerpiece and smaller diamonds around the sapphire. I knew my wife would care more about the price tag than the &quot;real-ness&quot; of the diamonds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In general, not as much as natural stones, because people have mentally convinced themselves that natural stones are worth more, which is... the whole point of this thread. </p>
<p>But as with natural stones, quality is everything. Synthetic stones can be made flawlessly, or with some imperfections - just like the real thing! But pound for pound, a stone with equal level of perfection will be cheaper in synthetic form than natural.</p>
<p>What you will also find is that natural stones are typically set in more expensive arrangements with more expensive precious metals and a higher total carat-weight of other gems.</p>
<p>For example, at a lot of chain jewelers, they set the lab stones in sterling silver while the natural stones are typically set in gold. They do this because a lot of buyers of lab stones don’t want to spend a lot, while the buyers of natural stones (who are convinced they are better than lab-versions) will shell out more money - which, again, is the whole point of this thread.</p></div>		</li>

Or you can ask. Most trustworthy vendors will know if they’re natural or synthetic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I bought some lab created diamond stud earrings for my gf. I talked with the jeweler in detail about the difference between the two. I don't think synthetic is the right word. These are real diamonds. The only difference being that it takes way less time to create and no slave labor to mine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I bought my fiance a ring with lab grown diamond and emeralds in from an online store. It was about 1/5 the price I would have paid and the level of clarity was about 3 tiers higher than the natural counterparts.
They were also not mined by slaves so that's another plus!</p>

<p>Traditionally the woman kept the ring. It would be worth enough that if her husband/fiancée were to run off for die, she could sell it and look after herself for a little while.</p></div>		</li>
