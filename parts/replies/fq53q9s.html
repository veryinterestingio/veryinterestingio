			<div class="markdown"><p>Two main ways.</p>
<p>I notice a gap in my autobiographical narrative.</p>
<p>There are gaps from a day to six months.</p>
<p>My daughter's or a support worker I trust reminds me. Either I can retrieve some memories or I just need to trust them it happened.</p>
<p>On retrospect my memory issues did make me an easy victim for domestic violence. Kinda easy to gaslight.</p>
<p>Also I take notes and keep a digital calender.</p></div>		</li>

Again, I don't want to make you uncomfortable and I'm sorry if this is too personal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm kind of curious about this too. I've realized over the last 5-10 years that my memory is crap. I find it pretty much impossible to pin down childhood memories and when those things happened. Some people seem to be able to say where were and what they were doing on any particular summer and that's really difficult for me.</p>
<p>I was in a near fatal head-on collision when I was 20 where I lost my eye and sense of smell, and I don't think I ever had the feeling my memory was bad before then so I'm betting that was a trigger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Honey can you pick up some milk at the store while you are out?&quot;</p>
<p>Lots of pages here:</p>
<p>I need to do something.</p>
<p>Wife needs something.</p>
<p>I need to go to the store to get it.</p>
<p>I will stop at store x after my other errands.</p>
<p>It is milk she needs.</p>
<p>I need to take this route to stop by the store.</p>
<p>These are not nessasarily strongly connected, so you might just remember you were suppose to do something but don't recall the rest.  Or you may remember everything but that it was milk she needed so are wandering around the store buying her everything she has ever asked you to get at the store in the past plus some flowers just in case.  But chances are you will finish your errands and drive straight home with a vague sense that you are forgetting something you needed from the store after you finished running your errands but since you can't remember what it was you decide it isn't important. (Forgot wife part and milk part). That is why you are sleeping on the couch.</p>
<p>Edit: I added one more page as it illustrates this best.  If you need to get milk for your wife at the store after you run your errands you will likely tell yourself that you are going to a specific store which will change your route.  After running errands you forget to change routes and that is why you forget to stop by that certain store for that certain thing your very certain wife wanted even though you were certain there was something you were suppose to do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People wonder why my wife and I text each other all the time. 1) we are millennials and hate talking irl. 2) this very reason — I have a shitty memory and our communication is stronger when it’s backed up by a list or a text with that info. It’s worked for 17 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was my interpretation. How can we remember “half” of what we wanted? Perhaps just because they’re separate facts. This allows us to sometimes retain what seems like half when really it is treated as a totally separate detail. </p>
<p>“I remember learning ROYGBIV but I don’t know what it actually means...” additionally, this contrasts episodic memory and descriptive memory, no? Perhaps these are treated differently in themselves </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also you know on page 45 the main character is in the corner shop and on page 47 she’s aboard a submarine, so you can kind of vaguely describe what was on page 46 well enough for someone whose book has different page numbers to tell you what is on your page 46.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You perfectly illustrate why the analogy is bad, as you start thinking about the brain more of as a book when in reality it isn’t.</p>
<p>As books are perfect copies of data, our brains are vastly different on what data is preserved.</p>
<p>Even two people watching the same view from a hill will focus on different things and remember different details about it. </p>
<p>Also what you say mixes in the book analogy with real brains when you say vaguely.</p>
<p>That’s exactly right for brains but not for books. As books are never vague in the words printed.</p>
<p>Our brains however do store “vague” things or things do become “vague” after a while.</p>
<p>The analogy simply asumes a pages is there or it’s not there. It’s never that simple with brains</p></div>		</li>
