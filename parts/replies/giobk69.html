			<div class="markdown"><p>Under time reversal the magnetic field would be inverted, since the magnetic field would be produced by some current which would be reversed.  Since the magnetic field vector and the velocity vector are both reversed the net effect is that the path does not change under time reversal- no need to involve positrons unless you're talking about time reversal on a single particle instead of universally i.e. the whole &quot;positrons could be electrons traveling backwards through time&quot; thing.</p>
<p>Caveat: it's similarly been a while, and I'm speaking classically only.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nicely put nonetheless! Good explanation for why the (normal) Hall effect is not symmetric in time. However I still don't see how specific arrangement of atoms would cause the symmetry breaking and not the magnetic field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And in the case of crystal hall effect the magnetic field comes from the constituent atoms? But then, how does it differ from the anomalous hall effect arising in ferromagnetic materials?</p></div>		</li>
