			<div class="markdown"><p>To give an idea of what Whipple shielding does.</p>
<p>When an object hits another, energy from the motion is imparted in deforming the second object. But not all deformations require the same amount of energy to perform.</p>
<p>Specifically, breaking an object (piercing it, causing a tear, etc) requires more energy than simply bending it does.</p>
<p>As a result, if you have multiple layers of a thin material, an object trying to pierce through this shield must break multiple layers of the material, which will collectively take more energy to pierce completely through than if all the layers of material were pressed together.</p>
<p>This same concept is present in other more terrestrial forms of armor, layers of different metallurgies can present a similar effect. However generally speaking on the ground it is usually more efficient to just make thicker armor rather than building separated layers (IE: An inch of armor with an inch of space and another inch of armor will be better than two inches of armor, but that extra inch of volume all around your tank may add so many problems/complexity that it's just easier to make two-inch thick armor without the space).</p></div>		</li>
