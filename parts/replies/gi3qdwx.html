			<div class="markdown"><p>And it is nothing like it used to be.</p>
<p>I remember installing games back in the day that would install like 50 separate patches after you installed them.</p>
<p>Nowadays, even if they haven't updated the installer itself, they will release megapatches that combine all prior patches.  For all I know, they still apply all 50 patches in order under the hood, but from the user experience perspective, it is WAY better to just click &quot;Yes&quot; once and have a single progress bar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back in the earliest days of online patch distribution, when games didn't have launchers or automatic updater programs included, you'd check for patches on the game website, but then have to go to whatever file hosting website actually had the patches (often not the official game/developer site), download the most recent patch, open the README file to figure out which other patches needed to be installed first, download those separately, and install them all manually in the correct order. </p>
<p>I remember having .txt documents with 10+ step procedures for how to install the most up to date versions of some of my favourite games. </p>
<p>And some games didn't package the patch with an installer at all, you just had to manually replace the required files as specified in the release notes for each patch.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As much as we hate on Day 0 patches these days, at least games get patches and you don't have to hope that they might make an expansion pack that fixes some bugs</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. I remember that.  The patch file would look for the previous patch.  So it would say something like &quot;please install patch 1.05 to continue the installation.&quot;  And if you were a somewhat intelligent but still dumb as shit 11 year old, you would download the 1.05 exe only to be told, &quot;please install patch 1.04 to continue installation&quot;.  And if you happened to be a REALLY dumb intelligent 11 year old, you'd keep flipping that loser card over. 1.03.  1.02.  1.01. ....  </p>
<p>That was if you were lucky.  If you were unlucky, you just had to somehow see the words quickly flash before an auto-window closing &quot;patch 1.05 not found.  Abort!&quot;</p>

<p>The update is meant to update an already unpacked set of files so you can't just run the updater on the installer and get a fresh file you have to rebuild the installer with the fully updated game files but this new installer would need to be tested which takes longer than just releasing and testing a single installer and then releasing and testing each update on the common installer.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a spot in the last book of the Malloreon by David Eddings where Mandorallen, a Mimbrate knight, utters a short sentence, then a massive single-sentence paragraph of such flowery formal prose that it left dozens of other knights (descended from Mimbrate explorers) completely poleaxed with eloquence.  It was definitely longer than this one..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm blanking on the author, and google isn't helping, but some author wrote a short story with deliberately lengthy sentences as a joke.</p>
<p>I want to say Brandon Sanderson or John Scalzi?  The short story was titled something like &quot;The beautiful crisp evening in the middle of winter and the flight of the night dragon&quot; or something.</p>
<p>Anyone have superior memory or google-fu?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good on you, a lot of folks view build engineers are glorified dev testers and think it's as simple as &quot;hitting the build button in VS and then send the bin\debug directory to client&quot; but in reality those folks are likely AP's who have about 2 years in the industry and they view everything from the outside looking in. Compiling code for daily releases from a bunch of different branches and getting everything to play nice is much easier than some make it sound.</p></div>		</li>
