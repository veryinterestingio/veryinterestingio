			<div class="markdown"><p>To elaborate on this, while viral load is correlated to the speed and severity of the onset of symptoms - it theoretically only takes a single virus particle for someone to become infected.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, even the most sensitive tests need millions of viral particles to produce a positive result (remember that viruses are millions of times smaller than cells by volume).</p>
<p>Additionally, unlike a bacteria culture where the bacteria can reproduce on their own in the lab, the virus particles will not reproduce once harvested - they require human cells to infect. So you must collect enough of them in your sample. </p>
<p>So there's a huge threshold difference between what can potentially infect someone and what can be detected in the lab.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This isn't strictly true. Current tests can detect only a few hundred, if even that. The actual interpretation of tests is a little more open-ended, but PCR is extremely sensitive.</p>
<p>Here's one evaluation I saved last month, for example: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7211760/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7211760/</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>Couldn't we get the same test results by blowing our noses into a test kit?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are some comparisons on test results positivity rate between different swab types (Nasopharyngeal, saliva, etc). Sensitivity (ability to detect the virus) is different by the different methods. As of now, nasopharyngeal most optimal COVID testing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This right here. I'm just not down for submitting to such a test. I'll continue to take all the necessary precautions, and if I already have it, well I'm asymptomatic anyway but I still have to work and eat. So all I can do is facemask up and not talk directly at people.</p></div>		</li>
