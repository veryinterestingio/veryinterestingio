			<div class="markdown"><p>The oscillation of the field <em>is</em> the light wave. When you see a certain color, it is because the field is oscillating at a certain frequency. As long as it maintains that frequency, you will see the same color. When the frequency changes, the color changes. In the visible part of the spectrum, red is low frequency and violet is high frequency.</p>
<p>In the crowd wave analogy, a higher frequency means the first person who is starting the wave is yelling more often, causing more yells to move sequentially down the line. A lower frequency means they are yelling less often.</p>
<p>The traveling photon and the oscillating magnitude of the field are two ways of thinking about the same thing.</p>
<p>I am not sure what you mean about flickering. When you see a light source flicker, the source is alternating between emitting and not emitting waves. When it is emitting waves you see the light as on, when it stops you see the light as off, but that is unrelated to the frequency of oscillation of the wave, which you see as the color.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the reply, actually when I was saying magnitude of the field, I was meaning the amplitude of the wave, not the frequency (I reckon I may be using words wrong). Like what does a crest from a trough signify? What I meant about the flicker question was is the light brightest at the crest and diminishes as it tracks lower on the sinusoidal curve? Or is that not related</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Light oscillates in both magnetic and electric fields. You know that electric currents create magnetic fields (that's an electromagnet), and magnetic fields create electric currents (like generators). It's the same with light - as the electric field rises and falls as the wave passes, it generates a magnetic pulse, and as the magnetic field rises and falls, it creates an electric pulse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The changing electric field induces a magnetic field that also changes, which induces a changing electric field... so the EM field is self propagating.  The direction the wave travels is in a straight line, and like the poster says, itâ€™s the strength of the field that changes with time as the wave moves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, yes I can, with a bonus on how polarized sunglasses work.</p>
<p>Okay, so when EM waves are traveling, they have oscillating electric fields. Those oscillating fields are not just the magnitude, though, but also the direction. Now I'm going to leave the Wave analogy from before and say let's imagine a rope that you are shaking. I can shake the rope up and down, or I can shake it side to side, or at some angle. This is linear polarization of light.</p>
<p>Of course, most of the time, the polarization of light doesn't really matter. The energy moves forward until it reaches something like your black shirt or the photoreceptors in your eye or whatever, and the energy is absorbed and it doesn't matter if it had been an up-down oscillation or a left-right oscillation or an angle-oscillation. Also, in general, when light is emitted from something, its polarization is random. So all the light coming from a fire or from the sun is coming in with all polarizations mixed together.</p>
<p>But, let's make^1 a special material. We'll make this material out of glass or plastic, something transparent to light. And we'll add something ordered to this material: a bunch of incredibly thin, parallel conducting strips, like a microscopic picket fence of metal.</p>
<p>See, in insulators (like glass and plastic) the electrons in the material are closely bound to their atoms. But in conductors, like metals, the electrons are free to move about the material when given a slight push by an electric field. When the electric field of the light ray does this, the electrons <em>absorb</em> (and/or reflect) that light ray.</p>
<p>So, if we have these narrow slivers of metal, that means the electrons are only free to move along the lengths of the metal; there's nowhere for them to move in the perpendicular direction. So, if I have a bunch of light where each light ray is coming in with a random polarization, the ones that are perfectly lined up with the parallel metal are going to be absorbed. The ones that are perfectly perpendicular are going to pass through unhindered. What about all the in-between angles though? Well, let's pick one: say one that is almost completely (90%) perpendicular to the metal slivers but a little bit (10%) off. In that case, most of it will pass through, but a little bit will be absorbed. And that large bit that is transmitted will be entirely polarized perpendicular to the slivers. Just like if you have an object that is sitting on the floor, and you push mostly forward, but a little downward as well, it will only move forward.</p>
<p>In other words, this semi-transparent material will take light of all polarizations, and only permit half of it through, and that half will be completely polarized in one direction.</p>
<p>Now for a bonus about polarized sunglasses, remember how I hinted at reflections earlier? Well, imagine you have the surface of some water. We know from experience that some light reflects off of the surface of water, causing a glare. Let's take a step back and think about our light ray again. Normally this incoming light ray has all polarizations (up-down, left-right), and those polarizations are all perpendicular to the direction of motion. Now imagine the light ray coming towards some level surface of water at some angle, like 45 degrees or so. Well, the left-right polarizations are parallel to the surface of the water, while the up-down polarizations are not. It turns out, the light that gets reflected will <em>only</em> be the left-right polarizations. So, reflected &quot;glare&quot; light is polarized.</p>
<p>And that is why polarized sunglasses can help you see through the glare on reflected surfaces.</p>
<p>^1 Note: this is only one type of polarizer; there are others that have different mechanics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a dumb question. When the electrons absorb or reflect the light is it due to the E or the M part of the wave or both. If it's only one part would the other part make it through the polarizer? Also are the E and M parts always orthogonal? If not does that change how the wave interacts with polarizers?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Got a slinky? Have another person hold one end while you hold  the other end and stretch it out a bit. Now, shake your hand that is holding your end of the slinky up and down. That creates a vertically polarized wave that travels from you to your partner. Stop shaking your hand and let it die out. </p>
<p>Now, shake your hand left and right. That is a horizontally polarized wave. Stop shaking your hand and let it die out.   </p>
<p>Now, shake your hand up and left and down and to the right, at a 45 degree angle. That is a combination of both vertical and horizontal polarization , with the vertical and horizontal components in phase. Stop shaking your hand and let it die out. </p>
<p>Now,move your hand around in a vertical circle. That is circular polarization, a combination of vertical and polarized light, with the vertical and horizontal components out of phase by 90 degrees phase. </p>
<p>When light reflects off of water it more strongly reflects the horizontal polarization of the light, so the glare you see on water is more horizontal polarization than vertical polarization. There are materials that more strongly absorb and thus block light that is polarized in the same direction as some alignment aspect of the material.  You can make sunglasses with this material coating the lens,es of some glasses, oriented so that it blocks horizontally polarized light and thus blocks much of the light refleting off of water, reducing glare and allowing you to see things below the surface more easilly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In high school we got taught anything with momentum has an associated de broglie wavelength. Photons form EM radiation and have momentum, no?</p>
<p>If so does the photon's de broglie wavelength refer to actual wave like motion through space? Or is it wave-like behaviour in some other non spatial property again?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Photons do carry momentum, yes.</p>
<p>The de Broglie wavelength for an object with mass is actually derived from the properties of photons, so yes the wavelength of light's EM oscillations is the same as their de Broglie wavelength.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>With one caveat, yes:</p>
<p>Photons can form standing waves, so that they're bouncing back and forth and not moving, in the sense that the peak of the wave doesn't ever move from side to side, it just shifts from being a peak in the electromagnetic field to one in the magnetic field and back again, with this lump staying in the middle.</p>
<p>So there's a spatial pattern, with the width of the whole shape corresponding to a wavelength, but a still one.</p></div>		</li>
