			<div class="markdown"><p>Sex drive is a little different since your desire to reproduce is usually only a bit weaker than your desire to live.</p>
<p>Lack of or low sex drive is usually because aspects of your life are too far off of normal to have a regular desire. It's typically mental (depression/stress) or physical (fatigue/hormone imbalance/stress) and can often be treated.</p></div>		</li>
