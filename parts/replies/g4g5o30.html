<p>Is there any possibility at all that we could get a good vaccine out before the end of the year?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like I said above, the statement from the CDC is generally not agreed upon by the scientific community including Pharma companies, who stand to lose a lot more (trust, brand value) by rushing a vaccine to market. It's unclear to the reason behind the CDC's   communications on this, but from a rigorous scientific perspective, this is highly unlikely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pharma companies plan out clinical trials and milestones, and there is a plan to look at the data in October. The trial will not be over, and there is not internal expectation that regulatory approval will be in place by Oct.</p>
<p>But, if the vaccine is already a clear, unqualified success (effect sizes large, confidence intervals well separated), or, if its clear that there is no chance for the vaccine group to differentiate from placebo (all metrics indistinguishable), or, severe adverse events are reported above a reasonable threshold, we can use statistical modeling (Bayesian uncertainty) to quantify the likelihood of success or failure before all the data is collected. So we'll hopefully know whether to be optimistic or cut losses.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes a lot of sense thank you for explaining. I was always unclear why the timetable was so long and assumed it was because of side effects and not efficacy. Are we getting better at predicting vaccine efficacy in shorter amounts of time? Or is there simply no replacement for double blind studies and time?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! Happy that it made sense to someone!!<br />
The gold standard in scientific studies is always an RCT - Randomized Controlled Trials - which are double blind placebo controls ideally. Vaccines because of the factors above are harder to prove (to quote a mentor of mine - if a vaccine worked, you wouldn't know it because no one would be sick). </p>
<p>Short answer - it depends on what we know about the &quot;Correlate of Protection&quot; for a certain disease. For some pathogens, an antibody response is sufficient, so the correlate of protection is usually a  4-fold increase in antibodies. For others, it may be T-cells - so you'd need a similar increase in T cells targeting epitopes on the disease etc.<br />
There's lots of interesting research into this for COVID rn, and I'm a bit outdated on that. Looks like it may be more on T cells than abs, but don't quote me on that.   </p>
<p>I say the above because once we understand the correlate of protection, we'll get real better at predicting efficacy over time, not sure we're there yet with this one. Till then, no replacement for controlled studies and time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve heard a lot of people say that we don’t know how long immunity lasts for Covid but stories of people being reinfected are scant. You’d think if reinfection were possible this quickly we’d start seeing it more considering how widespread it is. The CDC says you can test positive for up to 3 months but are only contagious for up to 20ish days max.  If immunity to this only lasts for say 6 months, does that mean we’ll need a vaccine twice a year, rather than once a year like the flu shot?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ethically there is not a faster way to predict vaccine efficacy. There is a thing that has been used in the past but has been discontinued due to the nature of the study: challenge trials.</p>
<p>Similarly, a placebo and a drug group are administered, but rather than wait it out and see who gets it naturally, you purposely seek to infect all of your participants. This gives a very quick turnaround on your results but you've now created a very sick cohort and potentially two very sick cohorts if your vaccine doesn't work.</p>
<p>This may not seem that bad with something like COVID-19, but it's exceptionally awful for things like HIV vaccine testing and has been removed from the vaccine playbook for years for good reason.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Considering the long-term negative health effects we are seeing in a significant portion of covid patients I wouldn't actually think that.</p></div>		</li>
