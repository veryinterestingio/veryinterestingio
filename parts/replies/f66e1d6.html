			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct!  So many people do not understand that nearly everything here in the beginning is still here now. </p>
<p>Recycling is very real.  You are made out of the component materials digested by the planet over and over and over, for billions and billions and billions of years.  You might never be &quot;you&quot; again but your bits and pieces will certainly be something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, except the decaying elements, there's less of those around. It could be conceivable there was plutonium or other higher actinides  during the formation of the earth, just at the time scales they would essentially have all decayed out. By extension, uranium mass is being depleted at a higher than normal rate that decay in the form of Nuclear power. There is a finite mass of uranium on the earth but it would last us something like 3000 years of US rates of energy consumption observed worldwide. Then we'd just start burning thorium for another 3500 years of power. Hopefully by then we'd discover fusion, which amounts to depleting hydrogen, but that's ok as 99% of the observable mass of the the universe is hydrogen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.</p>
<p>That being said, energy is dumped into outerspace (as thermal radiation), and recycling is probably more expensive because it requires more energy than digging (but I suspect we could make it much much more efficient than digging by making it smarter).</p>
<p>So there is a steep difference once we run out of mineral deposit, but it is not the end of the world, just the right time to invest in the recycling industry.</p></div>		</li>
