<p>The horizontal axis is energy. Note it requires as much energy to warm the water 100C as it does to melt ice without changing the temperature.</p>
<p>TLDR:
The ice melting is what cools your drink!!</p>
<p>If you put 32F water into a drink and 32F ice into a drink, the ice would have MUCH more cooling effect, despite same temperature difference. The phase change is primarily what cools it.</p></div>		</li>
