			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to clarify, for many of these examples it is not one virus that infects vastly different host organisms, e.g. members of the order Bunyavirales can infect plants or humans, none infect plants and humans. But it's true that many infect both arthropods and a vertebrate host or arthropods and a plant host but not all three.</p>
<p>Often, for viruses that do undergo radical host shifts, they probably do not typically maintain the ability to infect both divergent hosts for long.</p></div>		</li>
