			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait. So all electromagnetic waves are made of photons? And we can only see photons at a certain frequency (visible light)? And the ones that we can't see - can travel through solid matter even though they're the same... &quot;particle&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OOO! I can expand on that last part, as to why a microwave only needs a mesh on the front while while an xray machine needs lead sheets for protection.</p>
<p>When a wave propagates from a source, it goes in all directions. If you mapped out where the &quot;peak&quot; of those waves are at a given moment, it looks like a bunch of evenly spaced, progressively larger rings centered on the source. Whenever these waves encounter a piece of metal, like the walls of a microwave, it generates a small amount of energy on the surface and it gets disapated. If you collect enough of this on a wire, you essentially get radio communication, we just chose a certain band of frequencies since their &quot;safe&quot; yet effective. </p>
<p>If you instead don't want ANY of the wave leaving, you cover the room in metal. A faraday cage. Because photons are particles, this process works all the way down to individual atoms! However, not all frequencies work the same. At the frequency that microwaves function at, the wavelength is such that the mesh at the front is able to stop most of the microwaves but the holes are large enough that the higher frequencies that are visible light can pass through. As the frequency increases, the atoms need to be closer together in order to stop the wave. This can be done by decreasing the space between the conductors. Once you have a solid sheet, you either need a denser material (going from aluminum foil to lead sheets) or increase the thickness of the material  (sometimes by a LOT).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, not quite. Photons <strong>are</strong> the wave. A wave is an excitation in a corresponding field. Think of a calm body of water, a &quot;water field&quot; so to speak. Now disturb the field somehow, and a propagating wave appears seemingly out of nowhere. Similarly, a propagating elecromagnetic wave appears when either electric or magnetic field is disturbed. The key thing to note is that these fields permeate the entire universe, and that's why electromagnetic fields are able to propagate even in the seemingly empty space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, that's the core of my question - what <strong>are</strong> fields? Are they made of stuff? Or do they become &quot;stuff&quot; only when disturbed? What are they when they're not disturbed?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Solid matter can still have a lot of holes (our resolution is quite limited only a fraction of a millimeter). Also the material can absorb the photon and release another photon elsewhere, similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_cradle" target="_blank">Newton Cradle</a> .</p></div>		</li>
