			<div class="markdown"><p>The resolving power of a telescope is connected by the wavelength of light and the size of the aperture (mirror, lens) of the telescope. At optical wavelengths, to get a 0.1m (enough to see a person is there) resolution at 300,000,000m (distance to the moon) you need an angular resolution of 0.1/300,000,000 radians.</p>
<p>Optical light has a wavelength around 500nm, or 0.000005m.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/R/Rayleigh+Criterion" target="_blank">Rayleigh Criterion</a> gives a telescope diameter of about 2km. That would let you see objects that looked like blobs about the size of an astronaut.</p>
<p>The largest telescopes on the planet have an aperture of about 10m. We'd like to build one at 30m, but it's hard to find a place to put it.</p>
<p>100m telescopes are within engineering feasibility.</p>
<p>2km telescopes are right out.</p>
<p>So, no.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However, as you don't need a large amount of light, you could do so with 3 or more small mirrors collecting light, and combine the light from all of them to make the image. But the atmosphere would not allow us to do that on the surface. But from in space it would be possible, although difficult, because you'd have to keep all the satellites in exactly the right spot, because any movement of the mirrors would break this system.</p>
<p>Strangely, the first place we will probably build such a long-baseline optical interferometry telescope is on the Moon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a hard limit to how small of an object a telescope can see. This limit is based on the diameter of the mirror you use and the wavelength of light you are trying to collect.  If an astronaut is standing on the surface of the moon, the <em>very</em> small angular resolution needed to pick them up with a telescope on Earth or in Earth orbit would require the telescope to have a ridiculously large mirror, one impossible to build or set up.</p>
