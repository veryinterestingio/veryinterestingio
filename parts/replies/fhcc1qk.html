			<div class="markdown"><p>Damn I get these.. I call them &quot;hat&quot; headaches because it feels like I'm wearing a super small hat that I can't take off. Cluster headaches are also painful and miserable, I get them as well. Always over my right eye. Sometimes both at once, it's debilitating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cluster headaches are by far the worst pain I’ve ever experienced, and it’s not even close. Torn muscles, broken bones, bad sprains...nothing at all compared to that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having a broken bone or a sprained joint is easy to understand and visualize and most of the time easy to fix. Where as headaches and migraines have not been fully understood for decades. Usually its just we think it may be this or that or something completely different. Ocular migraines that progress to cluster are my worst experience. Little blind spot in the eye, like a void in your vision for a few hours, then it recedes and an hour later comes the jackhammer, light/sounds sensitivity and the inability to even think.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to have a never-ending migraine so ended up inpatient at a headache clinic. There were a few guys there for cluster headaches. One had half his face paralyzed. They had severed a nerve in an attempt to cure them. It didn't, but he said it would have been worth it if it had.</p>
<p>So that's my standard now - is the pain bad enough that I would voluntarily paralyze my face permanently to stop it? That's a ten on the pain scale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had one last weekend. I just finished doing yoga and slowly felt it building. Went home around noon, took an Alleve and laid down. My head was still pounding.  Definitely the worst I've ever felt.</p>
<p>Took another Alleve and had a warm bath. A few hours later, finally went away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds awful. I thought a migraine and tension headache was bad, I experience them maybe once a month or so. My dad gets clusters and its painful to watch him when he has one so I can't imagine throwing a tension headache on top of that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to get these daily. Like constant. So often I was used to them and would have a “hug, my head doesnt hurt” moment when they were gone. Sometimes it was normal throb and I could deal, other times it was so bad I laid in bed.  Thankfully when I lost weight they came a lot less often. It sucked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To follow up on this, anytime a muscle is tight, pressure or stretching is helpful in relieving the discomfort because it signals for the muscle to relax. Thus, relieving the source of your tension headache. </p>
<p>But it doesnt stop there, you should look deeper into why those overactive muscles are tight. For example, the massater is a muscle that can cause headaches for some people who grind their teeth. Frequent massaging of this muscle, which you can feel contracting when your clinch your jaw or back teeth, is helpful for combatting the effects of TMJ.</p></div>		</li>
