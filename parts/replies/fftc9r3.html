			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a note of clarification on EBV.  You don't &quot;catch it again&quot;. EBV never leaves your body completely after the initial infection.  It stays active - your immune system just keeps it suppressed and under control.   So getting it a second time is considered a &quot;reactivation&quot; where your immune system fails to control it and symptoms reappear.  Does not require a new exposure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand a little, EBV is part of the herpes family and remains in the cells in the same way as the commonly known types (the ones that cause cold sores). This is also why it tends to take a long time (sometimes months!) to fully overcome the minor recurrences of symptoms after initially being infected with mono.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, there are known cases of patients still being the host of inactive EBV, that needed a second active carrier to re-infect them again, because the inactive ones were too weak to cause harm.</p>
<p>Technically, we're both correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another great example of this is <del>Herpes-Zoster</del>Varicella-Zoster, aka Chickenpox, which will typically make young kids miserably itchy. Once their immune system fights off the systemic effects, the rest of the virus hides dormant along nerve tracts.</p>
<p>You may never have symptomatic VZ again, but if your immune system is suppressed (major injury, major emotional/physical stress, AIDS, older age, some medications) it'll pop back up. Only this time as an adult it'll be an exquisitely painful rash along that nerve tract that we call Shingles (aka Herpes Zoster). That's part of the reason we suggest getting an VZ booster shot, or shingles vaccine, once you turn 50, to help prevent this.</p>
<p>All this to say there are examples of viruses for which you can develop immunities against, but those may be temporary.</p>
<p>Other similar, but different, examples of these include chronic hepatitis virus infections (C in particular), cytomegalovirus, and even some bacteria like tuberculosis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think another really good example of this is Dengue. The second occurence is typically more fatal than the first. If I recall, I believe it is <strong>because</strong> of your prior immunity that basically results in an overwhelming response causing the more severe second infection: <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2003/06/when-dengue-strikes-twice" target="_blank">https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2003/06/when-dengue-strikes-twice</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dengue is a little interesting, there are \~4 strains of it. Theres a couple of different scenarios  </p>
<p>1: Catch Strain 1, serious illness, not usually fatal. Recover</p>
<p>1a. Catch Strain 1 again, mostly fine, previous antibodies will neutralize it.</p>
<p>1b. Catch strain 2: significantly worse because antibodies that you have to strain 1 HELP dengue infect your white blood cells. This is called Antibody Dependent Enhancement, I'm only aware of this happening for Dengue.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>2: Catch strain 2, without prior exposure to any other strain, serious illness, not usually fatal. Recover</p>
<p>2a. Catch Strain 2 again, mostly fine, previous antibodies will neutralize it.</p>
<p>2b. Catch strain 1: significantly worse because antibodies that you have to strain 2 HELP dengue infect your white blood cells. This is called Antibody Dependent Enhancement, I'm only aware of this happening for Dengue.</p>

<p>Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, this is what I remember.</p></div>		</li>
