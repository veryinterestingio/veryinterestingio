			<div class="markdown"><p>Never thought about it like that. But won't they still stay in the kitchen because it's the only place with food? And I do have pets. 8 cats. I took them out of the house, put the food in the fridge as you said. I however, still haven't gotten the boric acid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a place that I sprayed myself and they moved into the bedroom. They prefer real food but can eat cardboard and other random stuff you wouldn't expect if they need to. Don't get boric acid if you have cats. It can make them sick of they get it on their fur. You shouldn't use regular pesticides either. You need to get roach bait and cut off any other source of food. If you spray pesticides the roaches won't eat the bait. Where are they coming from? If they are coming from behind your cabinets you need to find ways to block it so they can't come in. I had a place where I realized they were coming in a hole from behind one wall and when I blocked it they stopped. It's not easy because they can get through really small spaces but if you are meticulous it will help.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wth! Cardboard? These are truly spawns of the devil. What if I only used the boric acid in small quantities at night when the cats are outside the kitchen? They seem to have nests under the cabinets. I was planning using cardboard but, as you said, they'll just eat their way out. Seeing the situation, it seems like DE is in fact a better solution than boric acid, because I can toss some of it along the floor under the cabinets, so they would have to step on it in order to go out or in.</p></div>		</li>
