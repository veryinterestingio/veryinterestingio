			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the accent no, just the way microphones bungle up the speech to make it sound like there's a bee buzzing throughout their voice (only way I can describe it). Especially noticeable during the presidential speeches re: the moon.</p>
<p>Fun fact, The accent came up in the Netflix series Hollywood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact! Although he's not specifically talking about the Trans-Atlantic accent, the two are related. </p>
<p>Actors back in the day were trained to speak like that for 2 reasons. </p>
<p>1 - everyone was super racist back then, and the fake accent made it impossible to tell if the actor/actress was Irish or Jewish or too Waspy or whatever. </p>
<p>2 - Speakers back then had TERRIBLE bass (which is kinda what OP is talking about), so they adopted the trans-atlantic accent because it's basically impossible to talk like this without raising the pitch of your voice, see. Say, now just you wait a minute, see. Try it now. Talk like Al Capone for a minute and see what happens, see. So, the raised pitches had the added benefit of making the actors easier to hear and understand on the primitive sound systems they were using.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They also say in the video that due to the technological restraints of the time period radio broadcasters/entertainers used that accent as well. Really interesting.</p></div>		</li>
