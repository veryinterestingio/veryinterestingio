			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah in a combustion engine your main &quot;hot parts&quot; are going to be a lot more solid than in a turbine. Engine block isn't going to crack from turning on and off too many times.</p>
<p>Only example I can think of is leaving older motorcycles running for short stops but that's an issue with starters using a lot more electricity than old, small alternators can quickly generate and you could kill your battery</p>
<p>Edit: Totally meant piston/reciprocating engine, as technically helicopter turbine engines are still combusting fuel</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heat cycles are the main cause of all engine wear. Turbine or piston, aerospace or automotive. It doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>This is the same reason that highway mileage is better for your car than city driving. Stopping and starting causes heat cycles.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It takes 6 hours for maintanance for every 1 hour of flight time.</p></div>		</li>
