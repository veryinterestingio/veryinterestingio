			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless you are undernourished already, a fast for several days will be fine. There are many benefits of a fast up to about 72 hours. There is debate on the benefits of longer ones. I've had good luck with 3 day and under fasts. I feel great after and during!</p>
<p>This is a good source!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, there is a civilisation which currently exists, but has attacked every one who attempted to make contact, and we believe them to go several days at a time without food - they’re essentially hunter/gatherers. They’re quite slim and seem to be perfectly healthy nourishment wise</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fasting several days always destroys muscle mass, which may not be relevant for younger people, but is discouraged the older you get, as recovering muscle mass proves quite difficult. There is a great benefit of breaking habitual eating through fasting, but prolonged fasting is always connected to losses in lean muscle mass.
Too lazy to look for the studies right now, but with a few minutes on Google you'll find em, I recommend it to anyone fasting longer periods.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People go to fasting retreats for a supervised fast of 3-4 weeks. The only people that have had major issues are type 1 diabetics (don’t fast as a type 1 diabetic). The health benefits reported are very interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep.  But, as I mean to point out in my post, those people are generally eating normally and will have natural reserves in their bodies where they can handle it.  If you're severely malnourished in the first place, going on a 3 week fast is going to have end results that are much different from someone who had a nutritionally-diverse diet before they started their fast</p></div>		</li>
