Depending on where you are in that large state, my recommendation is to ask one of my colleagues at Texas State to make a presentation at your school.  There is a great forensic anthropology program there, with multiple forensic anthropologists.  My colleague Kate Spradley runs a wonderful program identifying undocumented border crosser decedents, especially those buried in potter's fields across Texas.  If you can persuade someone to do a face-to-face, ask them to bring props.  I've always had a better response from 8th graders on up if I brought actual skeletal material.</p></div>		</li>
