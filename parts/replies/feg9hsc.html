			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the same. For many companies their debt payments are greater than their revenues. However it's not about revenue when you have a company like Netflix or Amazon. It's about leverage and assets. As long as people keep investing money in your company you will be able to make payments and keep growing the company. Eventually you will grow the revenue base enough to cover debt payments and make an actual profit, or you will simply get bought out.</p></div>		</li>
