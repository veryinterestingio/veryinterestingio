			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually all states will be there: uncut (prolly several states like relaxed and supercoiled), plasmid cut in one site and cut in both sites. To make sure the majority is cut in both, use the optimal conditions, like specific buffer, incubation time and temperature. If you want only one size to be cut you can aim for a buffer with less then 100% efficiency and/or less incubation time. You get the information on buffers etc. from the suppliers homepage or catalogue. In any case it is recommended to purify via gel electrophoresis, to get your specific linear molecule.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Restriction endonuclease reaction times suggested by the vendor are usually grossly in excess of what is required. A good gauge of how long you need to cut your DNA is &quot;how long do I need to go and do that other thing I want to do, have lunch, go for a beer, or a general not come back to it?&quot;</p>
<p>A few enzymes supposedly have nonspecific &quot;star activity&quot; if you leave them to react for too long, but I've never personally witnessed it. I think modern buffers are optimized to avoid this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Check out <a href="https://dnalc.cshl.edu/view/15476-Mechanism-of-Recombination-3D-animation-with-with-basic-narration.html" target="_blank">this awesome animation that shows a restriction enzyme binding to and processing across a plasmid</a>. It shows EcoRI reading the major groove as it processes, binding to its target, and cutting. </p>
<p>It helps for demonstrating exactly this kind of intuitive sense for how EcoRI will associate with strands in a sequence and architecture-independent way, process until it finds a target sequence by spinning around the major groove face of the base pairs, and cutting. It will likely do this first, and more efficiently, with the circular DNA given that both the association and cutting can be rate-limiting - however commercially available restriction will all work just fine for a second time on the linear DNA created by the first cut.</p></div>		</li>
