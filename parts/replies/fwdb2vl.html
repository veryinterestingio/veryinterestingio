			<div class="markdown"><p>It may still be too early to tell, but we do know that COVID-19 has a mechanism to check for copying errors and correct them. This might slow the evolution of the virus.</p>
<p>This is a mixed bag. For one thing, it means that immunity is likely to stick, but it also means the virus is unlikely to evolve to become less lethal (which most viruses do because being lethal is not good for a virus's long term survivability).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't have to. If a certain mutation is less lethal it has a higher chance of spreading since it's not killing its host. Over time this will lead to greater survivability of that version. It's basic survival of the fittest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do people take flu shots every year? I don't think i have heard of anyone doing it. I know that people with immune diseases or otherwise weak resistances do it, but i have never heard of a healthy person doing it. Most people took the one for the avian flu, but since then i haven't heard of a new one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Flu shots are created every year. In the US, 38% get their flu shot and almost 42%/year in the EU. </p>
<p>I’m in Canada, where it is mandatory for healthcare workers and anyone else caring for the elderly. It is also highly recommended that seniors get theirs (I believe 70% do here). We can walk into any pharmacy and get it for free.</p>
<p>Everyone should though. Influenza kills hundreds of thousands globally each year. We can help protect those that are vulnerable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What country do you live in? I live in Sweden and have been moving around a small bit. But even so i have not heard about people taking shots for regular flu's. Last time i took a flu shot was roughly 10 years ago i believe. I am soon going to take some shots fpr TBE however, as i live in a risky area, and that the disease is life threatening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is because most coronaviruses that humans contract cause minor symptoms we call the common cold, or were short lived outbreaks such and SARS and MERS. In either case, there isn’t a good reason to invest billions for a vaccine.</p>
<p>While you are right that a vaccine is not certain, the economic cost of this pandemic has been astounding (trillions). As a result, there is an unprecedented amount of research money and effort worldwide being poured into the creation of a vaccine. </p>
<p>In fact, there are multiple vaccine candidates in phase III trails already and one approved for military use. We may see mass production as soon as fall, and it is likely ordinary citizens will have access next year.  </p>
