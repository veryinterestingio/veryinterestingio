			<div class="markdown"><p>MHW also has some severe lag, if you're in Europe and playing with Japanese guys, for example. People running in place, monsters suddenly warping or lacking animation, getting booted from sessions, all that good stuff.</p>
<p>So it's really not as lag-free as OP makes it out to be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea I was gonna say, one of the reasons I gave up on that game was the matchmaking was so frustrating/didn’t make sense. It was never consistent when you could and couldn’t play coop</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From personal experience I can say that PS4 and PC are completely different.</p>
<p>On PS4 I kinda stopped playing fast, because I could barely find people (mostly just Japanese guys where I had horrible lag) and just jumping into hunts was sort of what I loved about the game.</p>
<p>On PC I never had connection troubles and can always find numerous hunts from the weirdest monster, to the most popular and the loading times also put it on top for me.</p>
<p>If you started on PC, I think there were issues after launch for quite some time, but it's pretty good right now and giving it another chance might provide you with some fun. Especially with Iceborne finally coming next week.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I was just thinking about this. Most of the time I'm fine, but every once in a while I'll load into a server and the lag is intense</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Monster Hunter did have some synchronisation problems and lag in the mobile console versions (Nintendo 3DS, PSP) back in the days. Also it seemed like they only synchronised the big monsters and just let each client handle the small ones on their own. In my playgroup there have been lots of situations in which a small monster (mostly those damn Bullfangos) ran straight into our group while we were gathering on the same ressource spot and run one of us over while on the other devices the small monster was nowhere near us. Their deaths were synchronised tho, was pretty funny when you suddenly saw the death animation of some small monster somewhere in the distance while your hunting buddies hunt thin air</p></div>		</li>
