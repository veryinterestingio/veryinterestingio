			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure we have a clear answer. Because of the mechanism they use, as long as the footpads haven't begun decomposing and the environment doesn't become too humid, they'll probably still remain attached. They have muscles in their feet that &quot;peel&quot; their pads away from the surface by rolling the digit inward. Without that operation, their footpads effectively remain stuck to a surface.</p>
<p>So a rough estimate is, as long as there's still a foot and a surface that adheres well enough. Probably days or weeks at the low end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was a kid I visited family in Texas. One morning there was a gecko on the kitchen window.

			<div class="markdown"><p>clearly not for the study, but i am not 100% on what OP was imagining here &amp; it isn't like some things like a barnacle or some types of snails where it will stay a long while after death</p></div>		</li>
