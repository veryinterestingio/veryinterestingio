Alas, unless we start eugenics projects, we're doomed (doomed, I tell you) to stay addicted to reddit - or it's new and more addictive competitor that'll turn up any day now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe a relevant analogue to this is to think about independent eye movement rather than just blinking as a phenomenon. We look left or right with both eyes and this has worked for us. But that doesn't mean under some condition, moving our eyes independently couldn't be better.</p>
<p>Take chameleons who have independently mobile eyes. Something about their history made this trait favorable enough for the gene to survive and get passed down. So it's possible for strange mutations like this to happen and if circumstances align (e.g. not only does a critter have the independent eye gene but the critter's genes produce a brain that can process these) - the trait to spread.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was actually wondering about that after I posted it. I guess the question is the degree to which it can adapt! Ability to interpret is different than being able to interpret efficiently, usefully, etc. So for example, I think it'd be an interesting experience to stick a mirror that redirects vision of one eye to the left and see what happens, how people adapt to the &quot;new vision.&quot; Wouldn't be surprised if someone tried this somewhere.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Was also a thought of me.</p>
<p>More a conjecture, but I think it is also very important for our stereoscopic vision that both eyes has a synchronized blinking. If not it could be a lot of work for our brain to compensate it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember wondering once, if you took a baby and made it wear a hood all the time that blocked its vision ahead in such a way that it physically could never see the same thing with both eyes at the same time, would the baby learn to move and focus its eyes independently?</p>
<p>Just another one of those thoughts you have, which is immediately followed by the thought &quot;Wait, what? Why would I ever think that? Holy cow, what the fuck is wrong with me?&quot; Oh - it's only me who gets those thoughts? Great...</p></div>		</li>
