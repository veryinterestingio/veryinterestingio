			<div class="markdown"><p>Montane lakes are fed mainly by snowmelt. So, they do have inlets that can flow heavily, there just aren't any fish above them naturally. Cold water also holds more oxygen and there is less decomposition occurring in clear (oligotrophic) waters, which consumes lots of oxygen in more nutrient-dense systems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gyrinophilus is correct. Other sources of oxygenation include eckman transport (wind-driven upwelling) and seasonal overturning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Went backpacking in the Sierra Nevadas about 20 years ago (I forget specifically where, but federal land), and the rangers basically said it was open season on fishing for however many trout you wanted using whatever bait you wanted above a certain elevation. All those streams and lakes were stocked many years ago and they now wanted them gone to protect the local amphibians.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The stocked populations aren't necessary as a food source, though. On top of that, a lot of introductions, like brown trout, are non-native invasive species that imperil native species through hybridization and competition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and consider that in many places it is actually the US Forrest Service that is stocking these fragile and remote lakes in order to create a revenue source through fishing permits</p></div>		</li>
