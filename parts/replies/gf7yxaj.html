			<div class="markdown"><p>I asked on another reply, from someone in the porn industry, but you might be better suited to answer this. As a woman, sometimes when I am close to orgasm I suddenly feel like I need to pee. Is that kinda what squirting feels like? I do have sensory issues, so I might be confusing it if it's a similar sensation. It always makes me stop and go to the bathroom for obvious reasons. lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha, Iâ€™ve had that feeling before! So honestly, I donâ€™t know if that is squirting, mainly because every time Iâ€™ve squirted it has taken both of us completely by surprise. It kinda seems like it might be related? But I have had that feeling many times without squirting too so that makes me unsure what it means. I also get a sort of about-to-sneeze feeling sometimes leading up to orgasm (?). Really need some scientists to dig into this and tell us wtf is going on in there! XD</p>
<p>Edit: oh also I have tried INTENTIONALLY squirting when I get that feeling before to see if it would work, literally by bearing down kinda like while peeing, and it did NOT work. I have never been able to do it on purpose. Go figure that one out! lol.</p></div>		</li>
