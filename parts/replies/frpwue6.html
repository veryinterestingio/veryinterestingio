			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Hardly any stars that we can see with the naked eye have any observable differences. </p>
<p>However, I think of the most interesting examples is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillars_of_Creation" target="_blank">The Pillars of Creation</a>. It's a famous telescopic object in the Eagle Nebula, but is theorized to have been destroyed 6,000 years ago by a nearby supernova.</p>
<p>Since it is 7,000 LY from Earth, we will witness the destruction in roughly 1,000 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically yes. But Realistically... no. We're talking about optics the size of celestial bodies to be be able to focus on such small details from such vast distances. A civilization would need the ability to strip mine whole galaxies to build such a construct. And at that point it's more realistic to just clone new dinosaurs on a planet of your choosing, lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What do you mean theoretically yes? Teleporting could never go faster than the speed of light, so you could never pass the &quot;previous&quot; photons in order to turn around and see them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Handwaving away technical constraints (i.e., is it realistic to build such a mirror?) is one thing, but as soon as you start saying things like &quot;and we could teleport&quot; you're just waving a magic wand; faster-than-light travel is not possible. Full stop. You may as well just suggest we watch the dinosaurs by traveling there in our time machine. It breaks the purpose of the thought experiment.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Much of our night sky is probably long dead and gone, but because of how vast the distances, we wouldn't see the deaths of celestial bodies for eons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>None of what we can see with the naked eye is &quot;dead and gone.&quot; The death of a star is a very long process, a process which takes much much longer than the dozens, hundreds, or thousands of years it takes for their light to reach us, and very few of the stars we can see are anywhere close to the stage where we can say they might pop any day now. Even the stars in nearby galaxies are mostly still fine.</p></div>		</li>
