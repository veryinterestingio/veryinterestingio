			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to go to a camp that fostered orphan wombats. They were mostly brilliant, letting the kids carry them around and just generally being adorable. However, at least once a camp theyâ€™d suddenly be a dozen screaming teenagers because a wombat had wandered into their cabin, was causing havoc and head butting anyone who got in its way.</p></div>		</li>

<p>(so, ..... the sign said not to stick your fingers in his cage, so i -being a very clever 11 year old- kicked off my thong and nudged him with my toe. did you know wombats have a very strong jaw and dont like to let go? i do. at least since then.lost the nail on my big toe, along with major bruising. it took a lot of screaming to get an adult with steelcaps to 'negotiate' my release from his vice like grip. i still dont like wombats)</p></div>		</li>
