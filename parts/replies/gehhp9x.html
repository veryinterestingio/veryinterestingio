			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention that energy is concentrated and reflected many times by the metal walls of the microwave oven. If you took off the walls of an everyday microwave oven and put food several feet away you will get some heating but it will be slow and spotty. You might melt something already close to its melting point, like a bar of chocolate. In fact, that's how the microwave oven was invented – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_oven#Discovery" target="_blank">a radar engineer noticed a chocolate bar in his pocket had melted</a>!</p>
<p>It would take a lot more energy and time to make that microwave dangerous at any reasonable distance. Although safety should still be kept in mind and the microwave should be shielded.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is possible but we're talking about extremely focused weapons with very high power levels. Even then the power falls off over distance at a very quick rate due to absorption by water vapor in the air and the spread of the beam:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Denial_System" target="_blank">Active Denial System</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ADS works by firing a high-powered (100 kW output power) beam of 95 GHz waves at a target.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a much higher power and frequency than a typical microwave oven which would be at 1.4 kW and 2.4 GHz. Not only that but it's in a focused beam so that power is concentrated in a relatively small cone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. It's basically a &quot;heat ray&quot; as far as people are concerned, except it heats all of you evenly and really confuses your bodily functions and makes you feel sick and like your skin is super hot. It's not lethal unless you literally cook yourself by standing right in front of the antenna, since non-laser microwaves dissipate like a flashlight does, so the power at a distance is much lower than right next to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>its also worth noting that they operate with so much power in comparison that even with all the shielding any nearby 2.4ghz wifi radios will be subject to massive interference (sometimes to the point where they do not function at all) while the microwave is running.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Distance plays into this as well. Yeah you can feel the heat of a 100W lightbulb if you hold your hand right next to it, but if you’re more than a meter away you probably won’t even be able to feel the heat. Not to mention this is several orders of magnitude more power than your home router uses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed. The power per unit of surface area drops with the square of the distance. So being 4 meters away from the wifi router (or lightbulb, for that matter) means you'll only get 1/400th of the heat you would get at just 20 cm distance (assuming the power is radiated spherically, which with routers may not always be a good approximation though).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't even matter if it's in a sphere or not. Any beam that's not constrained by a waveguide of some sort will have some amount of divergence. The falloff of intensity will still follow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law" target="_blank">inverse square law</a>.</p>
<p>This excludes other effects such as adsorption by intervening material, which will be in addition to the divergence.</p></div>		</li>
