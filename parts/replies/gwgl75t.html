			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha, thanks. I do actually have a PhD in math but my comment above is more or less the full extent of my knowledge of music theory. So it should be layman-friendly, as I am very much a music layman.</p>
<p>You'll notice I didn't actually answer the question of why our 12 note scale is divided into 7 white keys and 5 &quot;in-between&quot; black keys, and that's because, uh, I don't have a goddamned clue. Someone else can explain that to us all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nothing you said is wrong, but you explained it starting from results and moving to causes, which doesn't explain *why* things work as they do.</p>
<p>In physics classes that deal with sound and the underpinnings of music theory, the basic tool used to explore these things is a &quot;monochord,&quot; meaning &quot;one string.&quot;  Like a guitar with only one string.</p>
<p>If you pluck this string, it will vibrate at a particular frequency, depending on its stretchiness and its length. To make the math simple, I'll say we have one that vibrates at 10 beats per second, or 10 Hz.</p>
<p>Now, because of the way things vibrate, if you pluck the monochord and put your finger halfway down its length, it will become effectively two strings, both vibrating twice as fast, so 20 beats per second.</p>
<p>You can repeat this with your finger at 1/3 (30 beats per second), 1/4 (40 beats per second), and so on.  If you film it with a sensitive enough camera, you can actually see that when the string vibrates untouched, it *also* vibrates at 1/2 its length, 1/3 its length, and so on, all at the same time.</p>
<p>So we have recognized a phenomenon, we need to name its parts.</p>
<p>From a physicist's point of view, each possible note that the monochord can produce is a &quot;partial&quot; -- 10 Hz is the &quot;first partial,&quot; 20 Hz is the &quot;second partial,&quot; and so on. Musicians, who came to this separately, call 10 Hz the &quot;fundamental,&quot; 20 Hz the &quot;first overtone,&quot; 30 Hz the &quot;second overtone,&quot; and so on.</p>
<p>Now, to make this work, I have to assume what I'm trying to prove. This is a bit of intellectual dishonesty that no music theorist can escape: God, or Nature, or whoever, made physics, but music theory is entirely a human product.</p>
<p>So.  Take the C major scale: C D E F G A B C.  If you start with a really low C, like the lowest C on the piano, the pitches in the overtone series wind up being closest to these:  C C G C E G B* C D E F* G -- with them all being recognizably those pitches, except for B* and F* which are way off.  You may notice that B and F are significant pitches in C major, and that's not accidental.</p>
<p>From this we can figure out how to tune pitches.  C to G is partial 2 to partial 3, and so the frequency ratio is 3/2.  G to C is partial 3 to partial 4, and so the frequency ratio is 4/3.  C to D is 9/8, D to E is 10/9, C to E is 5/4.... we should be able to work out any pitch from this, right?</p>
<p>Well, that's where it gets complicated.  Put on your helmet.</p>
<p>If I start with that low C and go up by octaves, every C note is going to be a power of 2 times the frequency of that low C.  If I start with that low C and go up by fifths (C to G), then the pitches are C-G-D-A-E-B-F#-C#-G#-D#-A#-E#-B#.  And B# is the same as C, right?  </p>
<p>Um. Well, NO, actually.</p>
<p>C to G is a 3/2 ratio.  C (to G to) D is a 9/8 ratio, or 3/2 times 3/2, divided by two to get the octave lower. C-G-D-A is a 27/32 raio, or 3/2 times 3/2 times 3/2, divided by four to get *two* octaves lower. And so on until C-B# is a (3/2)\^12 ratio.  My calculator says that's a ratio of 1.0343 -- that B# is actually *higher* than C.  WTF?</p>
<p>That discrepancy is called the &quot;Pythagorean comma.&quot;  Pythagoras tried to work out the correct mathematical tuning for Greek music, and found out that you can't stack any number of pure perfect fifths and get the same note. This was considered an awful awful secret, never to be divulged to anyone not prepared to understand it. </p>
<p>This really didn't become anything but a theoretical problem for musicians to argue over until people started building organs.  When you've got a choir, they're going be lucky to hit the right notes anyway.  String instruments can be re-tuned; brass instruments can add a length of pipe in the middle.  But an organ - it has thousands of pipes, and several of them are going to be F# pipes, so you have to pick a frequency and settle on it. So musicians started thinking about music differently, and worked out ways to make music transposeable.</p>
<p>There were a lot of steps in between.  What r/wintermute93 lays out is a tuning system called &quot;equal temperament,&quot; which is more or less the solution that everyone has agreed on: you divide the octave into 12 half-steps, and then the notes line up equally well and equally badly in every key. </p>
<p>But the reason for the placements of whole steps and half steps where they are comes from the physics of sound, and equal temperament is just one solution that takes what we get from the overtone series and tries to systematize it. People came up with the scale first (well, arguably, with the pentatonic collection first), then named the notes.  They recognized that E to F and B to C were smaller steps than any of the others, but that just seemed like the way things naturally happened.  It took millennia of physics and people wanting VERY LOUD ORGAN MUSIC to impose all the unnaturalness on top of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My wife, an experienced and qualified musician, has tried and failed to teach me, with my tin ear, stuff like this. Somehow things like &quot;these sounds at different pitches are the same note&quot; just don't work in my head. To me it's &quot;oh, low and high notes&quot; and that's about it. Maybe someday I'll post an ELI5 to ask: how come some people can hear the complexities of music, and to others it's just nice sounds?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But I don’t think this actually answers why we skip B# and E# in the notation. That seems like an arbitrary decision made ages ago. Like why not call F E# and proceed from there? Or even further why isn’t middle C called A and a full octave range goes from A - G with every note having a sharp except G?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, it is a standard that was developed ages ago, when the parameters of music were very different. Music was modal rather than tonal, meaning a very different set of scales was used, and the &quot;major&quot; scale covering the octave C-C was not the &quot;default&quot;. The crucial thing is that music theorists didn't start with 12 arbitrarily defined pitches and name them with flats and sharps. Instead, initial divisions of the octave used seven notes based on the ratios described above (2:1, 3:2, 4:3 and so on). The accidentals (sharps and flats) serve a different purpose, so their naming is subservient to the naming of notes that more directly served commonly used modes. </p>
<p>As an aside, B# and E# are used in notation (as well as C flat and F flat), but only in certain contexts, and the pitch on an equally tempered piano is identical to C and F.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. The top answer totally misses the whole point of the question. We could name the notes in an octave A B C D E F G H I J L K and we wouldn't even have sharps or flats to skip. The reason we have sharps and flats is because of how the western music system was developed through history and we haven't had a good reason to go to a total overhaul to create Music 2.0 yet.</p>
<p>It's like asking why is A = 440Hz? It wasn't always. It's just accepted now as a standard.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Except it’s not. It’s standard in the US and in parts of Europe, but some places are using 444Hz. And if you’re playing some Baroque music it’s not uncommon to move everything down a semitone, so that your A sounds as a concert pitch G#. Other baroque music goes the other way, and your A will sound as a concert pitch A#. For some classical period performances people are going down a quarter tone.</p></div>		</li>
