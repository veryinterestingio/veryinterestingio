			<div class="markdown"><p>Some cities have done exactly that, actually.
I don't know if they still do.</p>
<p>I did live in one city where, when doing construction, they would put out the pylons and stuff every night (IIRC usually about 8pm), work until dawn, and then pack up the pylons to reopen the lanes (or as many lanes as they could).
Daytime traffic was minimally affected.</p>
<p>It was very cool.
Also very expensive.
I recall hearing that road construction costs were more than doubled because of it.
Hiring overnight workers is very expensive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s also cases where cities have like redirected highways and stuff, all in a night. I’m sure it’s expensive but in cases like that it’s probably worth it to have the highway open for rush hour.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dad is a bridge inspector mainly in New England, and he's had repeated night work assignments in order to accomplish this exact thing. He worked on one of the major bridges in Boston for a couple of weeks straight one time, and he had to work from 9 pm- 5am so that people wouldn't be inconvenienced during the work day. </p>
<p>Recently he also had to work early on a Saturday to inspect a highway that involved doing a double-lane closure which would be hell to do during the work week.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here in SoCal most major freeway work happens at night, during the day as well but when it comes time to close most Lanes always at night.
Rush hour in the LA/SGV area is BAD</p></div>		</li>
