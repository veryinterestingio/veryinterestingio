			<div class="markdown"><p>Very cool!  Cypress is an exotic wood in my part of the world.  I’d guess it has similar properties to red cedar.  Cedar produces natural pesticides that slows fungal growth and discouraged bugs.  </p>
<p>Cedar is a lovely wood, but it isn’t as strong as many other woods so we don’t use it structurally</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the style of wall construction and the wood that is used varies from region to region.  But in Canada the most common way at the field of the wall (big, wide, wall area with no windows or doors), is built in layers</p>
<p>The wood studs (framing).  They hold the building up.
Plywood is attached to the outside.  Plywood keeps the studs from twisting and makes the frame rigid.
Building paper, tyvek or some other water resistant but vapour permeable (breathable) sheet or coating is attached to the outside.  This is the first layer of water protection.  It’s breathable to let damp wood dry.</p>
<p>Vertical Wood strips 2” x 3/4” or 50mm by 20mm approximately are attached to the outside, over top of the building paper.  This is really specific to the area I live because it rains a lot and wood is fungus food. </p>
<p>Siding is nailed onto the strips.  This makes what’s called a rain screen or a drained cavity, where water that gets behind the siding can drain away and air can circulate to help everything dry out.</p>
<p>This is the easy part.</p>
<p>Keeping wood dry is actually much harder where the building gets complicated - windows, places where balconies meet walls, complicated roofs - these all become spots water can leak in.  Designing this is way beyond what I can explain in Reddit.</p>
<p>This style of construction is also changing because of a desire to improve energy performance of buildings.  We are paying much more attention to how air leaks out of buildings, and how we can add insulation cheaply and effectively.</p></div>		</li>
