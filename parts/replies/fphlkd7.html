			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends. Ceasing to perform elective surgeries has undoubtedly led to many deaths as well. That cessation was due to the response to Covid-19, but not actually caused by Covid-19. That makes assessing some of these numbers even more fraught.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s actually the value of using excess mortality. It shows the death toll from indirect consequences as well. </p>
<p>(Which of course might not be exactly what you’re hoping to measure, but if you’re only wanting direct deaths you need the sort of extensive testing which we don’t have.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the other hand, there are causes of death that will likely see a decrease in this situation (car accidents, other contagious diseases like the flu, etc.).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn’t less people die if less elective surgeries, since elective surgeries are to fix non-life threatening issues - but conducting surgery always carries inherent risk, and people do occasionally die from elective surgeries, especially surgeries on the the elderly aka hip replacements etc</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's great for getting the total impact of a shift in situation, poor for understanding where the impacts came from.  Alot of the knock-on effects of COVID + lockdown are not actual COVID deaths, and the average person does not differentiate properly when discussing things in common parlance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So this leads to a high amount of quickly spreading misinformation that direct deaths from Covid are higher than they actually are.  I think it's important to understand that good data for scientists and good data for your average civilian are radically different things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This right here... If there were no other extenuating reasons why people would be dying at a higher rate, then you can pretty much pin them on Covid-19 with a high degree of confidence.</p></div>		</li>
