<p>This is convenient for us to notice at this point, visually, but I'm assuming scientists figured this out through actual calculations?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup! Although in the context of just the spherical harmonics, it’s mathematicians that figured this stuff out, not scientists. Specifically, the spherical harmonics are the solutions to <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%27s_equation" target="_blank">Laplace’s equation</a> in 3 dimensions, which give us the shapes we see. These shapes aren’t just restricted to orbitals, but can also be seen all throughout nature, from quantum mechanics to astrophysics. We know the orbitals take these shapes in atoms because we can verify these predictions experimentally, and the shapes yield predictable outcomes which we can also verify.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, these were all the expected results of calculations, and then were confirmed by experiments on actual elements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for going into the standing waves portion. I feel that is a huge part of learning orbitals that no one really goes into, and it really helps to explain the physics behind orbitals better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IMO that’s why Griffith’s Intro to Quantum Mechanics is so good. It really builds on the standing wave and particle-in-a-box ideas. But quantum is a semester course, chemistry classes don’t have that time so they gloss over most of that.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit: Also see 3 and 6 or is it just a perspective?</p></div>		</li>
