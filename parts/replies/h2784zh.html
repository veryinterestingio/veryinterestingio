			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, when you think of tea nowadays most people think of looseleaf teas either in a box to put into bags or pre bagged.</p>
<p>Tea and other herbs used to be (and some still are) pressed into bricks to aid in transporting. Letting the herbs dry allowed them to be ground into a powder form to.more easily be compressed and save space when transporting it. Then you could shave off a bit of the brick and make yourself tea.</p>
<p>I'm vastly under explaining the complexity of the the process, but it's one of the factors to how we got to where we are in regards to teas and herbs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, when you put the dried herbs (or fresh) in hot water, the heat disolve the oil in the herbs and is easier for your body to take the benefits of it</p>
