			<div class="markdown"><p>Im working shifts so avoiding not sleeping is not always possible.</p>
<p>The rhythm is like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Day 1: dayshift, 12 hours from early morning to evening</li>
<li>Day 2: nightshift, 12 hours from evening to early morning of day 3</li>
<li>Day 3: free (im coming home early in the morning of this day)</li>
<li>Day 4: free</li>
</ul>
<p>Between the day and the night shift there is a 24h break, between the night and the day shift there is a 48h break.</p>
<p>I can handle the rhythm and i quite like it. I'm working in this system for about 2 years now. However i'm not sure how i should sleep after the night shift. Sleep until noon to not mess up my circadian rhythm too much and not lose too much of the day, or sleep into the afternoon to get 8 hours of sleep? Is there any advice or suggestions even with how little we know about all this? Currently i try to get up at noon, but sometimes my body says &quot;not today!&quot; and i will sleep well into the afternoon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand it might not be possible, but really your job should have you work just dayshift or just night shift, swapping after a couple of weeks if they need you too. It’s very bad for your health to be switching so frequently. If you’re happy and well rested then well done, but that’s not great business practice</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At least here in Germany the recent (10-20 years) guidelines given by medical professionals go exactly against that. No more than 3 night shifts in a row and fast rotation. This way you don't get thrown off your rhythm as much and can enjoy you free days. It's also be supposed to be better for your social life since you don't have weeks at a time blocked from doing stuff in the evening.</p>
<p>I talked with a lot of other shift workers. The ones working in systems that keep you on one shift for a week at a time seemed the unhappiest to me. The problem they have (and which i can totally see myself having too) is that it takes a few days to get adjusted to your new shift. Once you are used to getting up early: Late shift. Non adjusted you still get up earlier, get tired early. once you adjusted to that: Night shift. They are constantly trying to get used to the shift they are in, but dont get into a good rhythm. Also: almost no social life during late and nightshift weeks.</p>
<p>I have my 4 day rhythm, which works nice. I can do stuff with friends on every day except night shift. Sure night shift can be a bit annoying but as a night person i have little problems with tiredness during the night. After that i sleep (as i said, as long as i need) and its almost like i never left a normal rhythm. No tiredness and fatigue during my wake hours, no constantly adjusting to the schedule i should be in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had not quite the intense 12 hour work shift as you, but I experienced the same thing after night shift. I had that schedule for nearly 9 years and I found that the best thing I could do was just listen to my body. If I woke up at noon, that's great, if I woke up at noon but my body was like, &quot;nah man, we need sleep today&quot; I would just keep sleeping. Everytime I forced myself to wake up to maintain a schedule, I had a bad sleep and it affected me negatively when I would be up. I stopped fighting it and everything in my life got better and then I was able to kind control it a bit better. I seemed to be able to almost call it before I would go to bed then I could plan my day on what kind of sleep I was gonna have. Not all the time, but it made life easier. </p>
<p>As far as scientific evidence and adverse effects it has on your health, I don't think missing any sleep is physically good for you, but sometimes it's a mental thing too. I don't see anything wrong with a healthy balance of both. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Research &quot;biphasic&quot; sleep cycles. I've done it before without noticing any day-to-day detriment. In fact, for your lifestyle it might actually be more healthy than the alternative. It's important for you to have a rhythm, but if you can't meet the traditional rhythm (8 hours of continuous sleep per 24 hours), you can probably work something out that allows you to maintain the same time between sleeping (like how monophasic has a regular 16 hour gap) and still make it to work. I used to do 3.5 hr sleep, wake 3 hr, 3.5 hr sleep, wake 14 hr. You don't have to limit yourself to a 24 hour schedule.</p>
<p>Pros: </p>
<ol>
<li>It makes it much easier to time your sleep for a wake-up at the end of a sleep cycle.</li>
<li>You do get full sleep cycles, so you I think you should benefit from the &quot;brain cleansing&quot; mentioned in previous responses.</li>
<li>If you're a morning person (like me) you get two fresh resets per day instead of one</li>
</ol>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It takes some getting used to.</li>
<li>I've read that your second sleep cycle is better for you than the first one (most people go through two cycles per night). I haven't actually seen data to back that up, but it's something to consider.</li>
<li>If you have trouble falling asleep, you'll have to do it twice. That might be wasted time for you depending on how long it takes you to fall asleep.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your reply. I read about biphasic sleep when i started working this schedule but couldn't really get into it.</p>
<p>I'm pretty much a night person and often it takes me some time to get to sleep when i try to sleep at a specific time. I also like my lazy mornings so there is not much productivity gained from waking up at 8 vs waking up at 11.</p>
<p>Anyone else: It wasn't for me, but you should at least think about it if you are also working some weird schedule.</p></div>		</li>
