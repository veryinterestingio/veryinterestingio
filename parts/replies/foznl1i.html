<p>Brain cancer survivor here. I have IBS but didn't have it before the chemo. I asked my oncologist if there's a connection and he just shrugged. The drug was Temodar. 3 doses * 3 days per month for 12 months.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is chemo therapy not like literally carpet bombing your entire body with radiation in the hopes it kills the cancer before it kills the person?</p>
<p>I thought they legit just blasted your ass with radiation until the cancer went into remission or went away completely, so wouldn’t <em>everything</em> be targetted?</p>
<p>How does it specifically target GI cells?</p>
<p>Edit: I have been lied to</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re thinking of radiation therapy. Chemotherapy uses chemicals (chemos). It’s basically the same idea: target the cells as best you can and hope you kill the cancer before you kill the host, but since were using chemistry here we can target the medications to react with certain enzymes on different types of cells etc</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Radiotherapy is very much not the same idea, at least not anymore, as far as I can tell. It's <em>much</em> more targeted - rather than dosing the whole body, it can be set up so that multiple beams of radiation can converge on where the tumor is so that there's not as much damage in the path of any individual beam, for instance. Or simply placing a sealed source nearby/into the tumor. The closest to chemotherapy is probably systemic radioisotope therapy, where a radioisotope can be attached to a particular molecule that the tumor is known to take up or that will attach itself to the tumor (or outright be an isotope of an element that will be taken up, in the case of the thyroid and iodine-131).</p></div>		</li>

<p>It doesn't. For one, chemotherapy and radiation are two different things. </p>
<p>Chemotherapy involes injecting certain chemicals into the body that kill rapidly dividing cells. Any rapidly dividing cells are attacked, not just cancer. That's a big reason why people lose their hair during chemo. Hair cells are rapidly dividing. As are your GI cells. A lot of people experience skin and nail damage during chemo as well because these cells are rapidly dividing. Anemia is another one due to the blood being full of rapidly dividing cells. </p>
<p>Radiation therapy is generally very targeted. They just shoot a beam of radiation at specific areas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chemo therapy and radiation therapy are separate treatments often used in conjunction. If modern chemo is the carpet bombing, then radiation therapy is the precision air strike lol. Modern radiation therapies have advanced to be able to target tumorous areas fairly precisely. Though, of course, still not without risk to surrounding area. </p>
<p>The poster above is stating that due to certain similar characteristics of the mentioned GI cells and cancerous cells, the drugs used in chemo therapy tend to affect them as well</p></div>		</li>
