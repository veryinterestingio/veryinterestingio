			<div class="markdown"><p>From a trajectory perspective, Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich will be launched into a high inclination orbit (66 degrees) that covers 90% of the world's oceans. Sentinel-6 will trail the most-recently launched sea level-monitoring satellite, Jason-3, by just minutes! This will allow the Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich and Jason-3 spacecraft data to be used by the scientific community together. - M.W.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The satellite has high-resolution capabilities which mean that scientists will be able to monitor the ocean closer to the coasts than they could with previous sea level missions. Researchers will be able to track features, including small coastal currents and eddies that pinch off of larger currents, such as the Gulf Stream. - S.C.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sentinel-6 has a unique altimeter that for the first time brings Synthetic Aperture Radar technologies to the series of satellites that have flown in this orbit.  This means that the measurements will be more precise compared to the previous missions allowing us to determine sea level rise with reduced uncertainty.  We can also process the data to give measurements every 300m along the satellite ground track which compared to previous missions is a major improvement in resolution.  The mission also includes a Radio Occulation sensor that measures vertical atmospheric humidity and temperature profiles in the atmosphere that are used by weather forecasting services all over the world.  Since the altitude of the orbit is higher at 1336 km than many earth observation satellites flying at \~600-800km, we include a radiation environment monitor on the spacecraft.  - C.D.</p></div>		</li>
