			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I forget the details. Maybe something about needing to be in the vicinity to do the killing, or something.</p>
<p>I suppose if he was going to kill his wife, he'd first leave the house in front of witnesses, and drive around, then come back when she'd be asleep, to kill her. Then drive off to rack up more miles, and 'return' from the trip next day, surprised to learn of his wife's murder by an apparent burglar.</p>
<p>There was some detail about him being aware that the person he was supposed to be meeting on his trip would not be home, so there would be nobody to say that he <em>didn't</em> go on an interstate drive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lets say he drove half the distance to X already to kill the victim and dispose of the body. Actually driving to X would increase his mileage by too much</p></div>		</li>
