<p>Edit; the containers end up being very small. From my understanding all of the spent containers world wide from the entirety of the nuclear era could be lined up on a f00tball pitch with plenty of space left to go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds a lot easier than it is going to be, isn't it? The core is melted, its substance has merged with concrete and metal and whatever else was under the containment vessel. Just think of that Elephant's Foot - that will not fit into anything without cutting it all apart.<br />
But cutting it will create huge amounts of radioactive dust which no one wants.<br />
So yeah, eventually the pieces will end up on containers - but that's the easy part. Getting it in there is the interesting bit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends is the answer to that question. If it's fuel assemblies etc it'll be buried deep underground after being encased. The encasement might be vitrification, stainless steel  cask and then copper cask for example. The burial site will be geologically boring. This will ensure it's gone for a very very long time, a million years+ would be a safe bet. Waste that is highly radioactive will make up only a small portion of the total waste though. The bulk of the waste will be only slightly contaminated and will still be buried but not in expensive facilities.</p>
<p>Chernobyl is awkward because everything is mixed and a mess. Radioactive materials are generally fairly easy to deal with because you don't mix things up. You actively keep your difficult to handle high level waste to a minimum and away from your low level waste, etc, etc.</p>
<p>The lowest levels of waste from nuclear sites are either not contaminated or so minimally contaminated they just go in regular landfill. I believe they limit the sites they use but that's more out of paranoia than any real risk.</p>
<p>What you have to realize is that even Chernobyl, which is about as bad an accident as it's possible to have, will only generate a small amount of waste to deal with compared to, let's say, a coal fired power station. I pick a coal fired power station because the waste ash is probably <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/coal-ash-is-more-radioactive-than-nuclear-waste/" target="_blank">more radioactive</a> than most of the stuff that will come out of Chernobyl and we just dump that on the ground.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The plan is for the entire power plant to be decommissioned now that the other reactors at the site are shut down (yes, Chernobyl kept operating as a power plant even after the accident...)</p>
<p>But, they have to clean up this portion of things before they move on to the, by comparison, rather conventional deconstruction job.</p>
<p>It should be noted that Chernobyl's reactor design didn't have containment buildings around the reactor as do every other modern reactor design in the world; there was nothing more than some thin concrete walls between the reactors before - nothing like the huge and thick walls that can survive airplane crashes and the like at other reactors.</p>
<p>In various documentaries, you can see how they shored up the wall and hallway between the reactor rooms with lead sheets and more concrete, but that's basically it...</p></div>		</li>
