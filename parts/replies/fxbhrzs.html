			<div class="markdown"><p>For car engines.
For large marine engines. They put the cylinder diameter in the type number. Thus wen talking about a &quot;wartsila RTA 42&quot; engine. It means a 42cm diameter cylinder. But it can be  6, 8,9 in line or V12, V16 configuration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All <em>cylinders</em> combined. The cylinder is the hole in which the piston moves up and down, driven by the explody gas. And technically, it is the volume swept by the piston in the cylinder from one extent to the other times # of cylinders. </p>
<p>You can have a massive 4 cylinder engine where each cylinder has 2-3 L of displacement for 12 L total, or you can have a 12 cylinder engine of 12 L total (each cylinder is 1L each). There are advantages and disadvantages for each - large ship engines (which aren't turbines) are large cylinder engines, but they don't rotate that fast - shaft speed isn't that much of an issue for them, they just need the strength from massive displacement. Small cylinder engines run faster (usually) but downsides include complexity, timing (the order the cylinders are fired in and the mechanisms to keep them in sync) and gearing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add the opposite example, current Formula 1 race cars are 1.6L V6 engines so .27L per cylinder. They turn probably 10 times as fast as the ship engines and about 2.5 times as fast as the average road car. Depending on the rules of the season, they make between 800 and 1200 horsepower. Out of 1.6L.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sum of all the cylinders.</p>
<p>The number or cylinders matters because it's another method of getting the same amount of power. There isn't actually anything stopping you from building a single cylinder 1.4 liters big as long as it's made from material that can withstand the demands put on it, such as the amount of energy it contains when the air-fuel mixture is ignited. This would also affect some more complex aspects of the engine, such as compression ratio and energy conversion.</p>
<p>Multiple smaller cylinders impart the same energy by providing smaller amounts of energy numerous times in the same cycle. A single cylinder only performs work once per rotation: when the piston is in the up position to compress the air-fuel mixture and the spark ignites it. That explosion pushes the piston back down and the piston's momentum rotates the camshaft and crankshaft one full rotation, at which point the cylinder compresses and ignites again.</p>
<p>The second, third, fourth and so on other cylinders ignite in sequence before the first cylinder has completed a full rotation. So the engine gets four pushes per rotation instead of just one.</p>
<p>You can think of it like tetherball. Tetherball is a simple schoolyard game. In it, a ball is tied via a rope to the top of a pole. Two players stand on either side. The object is to strike the ball until the rope is wound completely around the pole. That is essentially how an internal combustion engine works: it gets one push per rotation because you can only strike the ball once each time it comes around, and the amount of energy you impart into the ball determines how quickly it will come back around. But imagine if the second player wasn't competing against you. Imagine that the second player is actually winding the ball in the same direction as you. You only need to hit the ball half as hard to get it around the pole to the second player, who perpetuates the rotation by hitting it too. That is the relationship between the cylinders on a multicylinder engine.</p>
<p>Making an engine with multiple cylinders has a few advantages. It reduces the load on each cylinder, so the engine wears better. It also enables us to build engines out of weaker material such as aluminum instead of having to use something like hardened steel, so it keeps weight down.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It's once every 2 rotations.  Suck, squeeze, bang, blow.</p>
<p>Suck: piston goes down and pulls in air (crank rotates 180)</p>
<p>Squeeze: piston goes up and compresses air (180 again)</p>
<p>Bang: fuel/air ignite pushing piston back down (180)</p>
<p>Blow: piston goes back up pushing the exhaust gas out (180 again)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally, a larger displacement means more power per rotation, which is more or less equivalent to torque.</p>
<p>The simplest way for a small engine to produce as much power as a bigger one is for it to turn faster, as less torque at a higher speed can be equivalent to an equal amount of power. This is how motorcycles produce a reasonable amount of power from small engines. This comes with some engineering hurdles and often decreased lifespan, though. </p>
<p>Modern engines may use turbochargers, which push more air/fuel into the engine to be burned, and other technologies to maximize the performance from any given displacement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Slight technical correction. Displacement is not the same as combustion chamber volume.    Displacement is actually the amount of volume displaced by the piston through its full stroke (times number of cylinders)</p></div>		</li>
