			<div class="markdown"><p>Just come to the desert of the Western US to see uncountable examples of river, creek and stream beds full of nothing but rock, and sand.  Some are seasonal, and flow only with melting snow in the spring.   Many others may not see enough water to flow for years.    </p>
<p>The dangerous ones are those that flow briefly but swiftly in response to heavy precipitation over distant higher ground only to unceremoniously soak into their own streambed and vanish after a few miles.   In under a minute, these can go from being dry to filling with a debris choked wavefront several feet tall â€“ that's you'll hear before you see.  The waters rise rapidly after the logjam passes before cresting and beginning their gradual fall.  By the next day puddles and mud are the only evidence anything happened.  And the same stream bed 10 miles farther down will have never received a drop.</p>
<p>When long lasting slow moving heavy rain hovers over such a watershed, what I just described can happen simultaneously over a vast area with mountain runoff filling countless dormant creeks, leading to dozens of dry or season streams which being to overtop their banks before emptying into the few large deeper swifter river channel.  The uncertainty and rarity of flow in some of these channels has pitted nature again highway engineers numerous times during the last 50 years during which several massive highway and interstate freeway bridges built over bone dry land ultimately failed when the right storm came.</p>
<p>And yet most visitors find long, seemingly expensive bridges over a bunch of rocks and dirt amusing.</p>
<p>TL; DR  way off topic, but I couldn't stop.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Associated trivia; artificial ponds, canals and cisterns were made water-tight by lining them with puddled clay. The clay was worked with water until it became pliable, similar in consistency to potters' clay. Manually puddling clay was said to be like the labours of Hercules, very hard work.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's really interesting about the shape of the clay particles, I didn't know that. Do the plates always lie flat like cornflakes would, or can there be situations where they get turned differently, like the way layers of rock sometimes do? It seem like they might almost be able to act like pipes if the conditions were right.</p></div>		</li>
