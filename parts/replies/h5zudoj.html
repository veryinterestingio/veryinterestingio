<p>From the little research I did, they do last a little longer.  Carp and tilapia last about 20 days, trout for 15, cod and salmon for 8 and mackerel and herring for just 5.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The enzymes (little proteins that facilitate metabolic processes)  are constantly breaking down your tissues, while other metabolic processes rebuild them at about the same rate, it's called protein turnover. It's needed because old tissue will perform worse, and sometimes the body needs to change the way it's arranged (like if you are training, or have a new pair of shoes and get calluses.
It's a dynamic equilibrium.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because without those enzymes, the food you eat would leave your body in the same way they entered. As we are made of the same things we eat (proteins, fat, carbohydrates), the enzymes break our food into its base components, so that we can absorb them. The only thing preventing those enzymes from breaking us down is that they are usually contained in places that have protections against those enzymes, or they are simply turned off using biochemical signals.<br />
When we die (or because of some diseases) those protections stop working, and the enzymes work briefly, until they also break down because of temperature or pH changes (they are very susceptible to such changes).</p></div>		</li>
