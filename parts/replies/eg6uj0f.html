<p>It only says that they did a study of whale bones and found widespread oteonecrosis. The author suggests heavily that it could have been due to the bends, but if there was a scintilla of evidence as to the cause, I missed it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was the first I could find, but I've seen others that also indicate pocket marks and other telltales of the condition within the joints of deep diving mammals.</p>
<p>One of the key factors in whether someone gets the bends or not is how long they spend exposed to the compressed air. A free diver only spends a few minutes at depth, not enough for significant quantities of nitrogen to dissolve into their tissues.</p>
<p>Whereas whales are spending upwards of 90 minutes at depth, exposed to the compressed air in their lungs. There's no reason to believe they would be immune to the bends.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's an interesting idea. Like the other poster, I had been taught in school that the bends only comes from breathing compressed gas. </p>
<p>Science does advance, and we do learn new things. But then too, some researchers will jump to conclusions. Discovery of cold fusion and cosmic background radiation are cases in point.</p>
<p>That Woods Hole article, jumping straight over the evidence to blame the miliatry and Big Oil, has all the hallmarks of motivated reasoning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An interesting point on whales is that there's actually been an increase in whales dying due to surfacing quickly after hearing submarine sonar (I believe the assumption is it's either really loud and the vibrations hurt or they're scared). There are multiple fields of research that involve trying to develop new techniques for submarine navigation and awareness that will be less detrimental to marine life.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sonar in question won't be coming from Submarines... For them, the term &quot;The Silent Service&quot; is absolutely apt. Sound is death, so they make like a hole in the water. Instead, the loud sonar is coming from surface vessels, and is used for a variety of purposes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the sonar is an active system set up in certain areas to detect submarines.  It is a naval system and in areas that it covers can generate very loud noises under water.</p>
<p>Edit-
** I stand corrected, the undersea installations are passive systems, it is active sonar emitted from surface ships and also underwater drilling that are being blamed for beachings!</p></div>		</li>
