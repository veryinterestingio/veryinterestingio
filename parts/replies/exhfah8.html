			<div class="markdown"><p>Studies seem to show that storing and rinsing your lenses in water are the most risky behaviors, but showering isn’t risk free. The biggest things you can do to reduce your risk of infection are to not sleep in your lenses, keep your lenses away from water and don't top off (add new solution to old solution in the case)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't mind putting in my contact lenses after my morning shower, but I feel like taking them off to shower in the middle of the day is exposing them to more microbes because I am touching them with my fingers when I take them out and when I put them back in again. </p>
<p>I realize it isn't free to have them exposed to water from the shower, but is it even ideal to take them out?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back when I first started wearing lenses in the 90's it was recommended to rinse the case daily with cold water.  Is this still considered a safe practice if it dries fully between uses?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>100% not, any source of water contains bacteria and microbes which are the source of infections. </p>
<p>The only fluid you want to keep your contact lenses in are commercial solutions.</p>
<p>Props to Dr. Cope for this great thread.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same. I’m -7 and I have had contacts for 17 years and I’ve always worn them in the shower. Sometimes I don’t if I wear my glasses that day but I don’t like not being able to see what I’m doing.</p></div>		</li>
