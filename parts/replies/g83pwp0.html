			<div class="markdown"><p>Hydrogen fuel cell-powered cars are currently being deployed in the United States and more so internationally. The major constraints are the high cost of fuel cells, high cost of hydrogen, and lack of infrastructure. The U.S. Department of Energy and industry are conducting significant amounts of research on lowering costs of fuel cells and increasing their durability as well as decreasing hydrogen cost. There are Federal and, depending on the state, state incentives to support hydrogen infrastructure deployment. </p>
<p>For the second question, I believe it is asking about a hydrogen range extender. This is where a small electrolyzer is installed in the car. The electrolyzer is powered by the alternator. The electrolyzer produces hydrogen and oxygen, which is fed into the combustion chamber. For this to work at all, modifications to the engine and emissions systems are required, which are illegal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where is it that messing with an engine is illegal?  Where is it that messing with an emissions system is illegal?  In my state after the car is a certain age the car is exempt from emissions testing and modifications are perfectly legal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure where you live, but the US Federal government has laws against tampering with any car's pollution control system whether it is required to be tested or not.  Exempt from testing doesn't make modifications legal, it just means you won't get caught.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What is the main cost of hydrogen cell except the PT Catalyst obv?! And in what form is hydrogen used as a fuel and why is it costly?!</p>
</li>
<li>Sorry, but I'm not asking about it complementing the engine thru alternator, can it indivually work as a power unit?! By connecting it to a battery. </li>
</ol>
<p>And for the illegality, I don't know if the current design would work for the hydrogen fuel engine so there would have to be new designs. And the emissions are just oxygen, water..nothing that is polluting.</p></div>		</li>
