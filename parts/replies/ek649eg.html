			<div class="markdown"><p>The point isn’t to not have a credit card. It’s to pay off your credit card. Racking up debt to prove you can handle it will not increase your credit score, but that’s a surprisingly common belief.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>same thing happened to me recently. i actually even had trouble getting my first credit card because i had no credit histroy and zero debt. </p>
<p>i ended having to work out a deal with my bank where i gave them a $500 &quot;deposit&quot;, and they gave me a $500 &quot;loan&quot; which i payed off over 6 months with the &quot;deposit&quot; funds (with no interest, thankfully). then after i payed it off i was finally approved for a credit card. it was quite a silly ordeal </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Elderly guy at work that I'm friendly with.</p>
<p>Was staying late to finish some stuff, and he was too. We start chatting, topic turns to personal finance.</p>
<p>He tells me he wants to give me a good piece of advice, because he likes me and used to work as an accountant. I have 7 credit cards because I'm addicted to always having the best cash back, and I have all 7 set to auto-pay off my entire statement balance every month.</p>
<p>His grand advice was to turn off auto-pay at least once a year on all of them, and only pay the minimum, to help build my credit. His reasoning was that if you never let the credit card companies make some money off you, they put you on a &quot;bad list&quot; and cut you off from their best offers. But if you gave them a couple dollars every 12 months or so, they treat you better.</p>
<p>I told him I don't think that's how it works.</p>
<p>He laughed and told me he's been doing the grind since before my dad is born, but I should do me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because of bad information. I have a credit score of over 800 and only ONCE have I paid interest on my credit card because my overdraft protection kicked into my empty savings account instead of my full one.</p>
<p>It's true that you need credit cards and other credit stuff to build a good credit score, but <strong><em>PAY THEM OFF</em></strong> every single month. Creditors want to see someone that pays their bills.</p>
<p>So for me, what that looks like is I have an Amazon card, an AmEx Blue Cash Everyday, and a rewards Visa card for places that don't take AmEx that gives me points to another place I like. Amazon card is ONLY used for Amazon purchases and stays locked up. Everything else - <strong>EVERYTHING</strong> - goes on the other cards. Gas, groceries, clothes, whatever you would normally buy with cash or a debit card - put it on credit. If you normally keep a check register, keep using it with your card purchases. </p>
<p>Then this is the key part - if there's something you <strong>really</strong> want but don't have the money for it - <strong>DON'T BUY IT</strong>. Wait til you have the money in the bank, then put it on the credit card. And make sure the card is set to automatically pay in full every month. </p>
<p>I make hundreds of dollars per year doing this. Free money to me. It literally costs nothing.</p>
<p>Bonus points: It's more convenient that carrying cash. It's safer than carrying cash or debit - debit cards don't offer the same protections as credit - If someone uses your card number for something you didn't buy, you can dispute it and it's gone immediately. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because you have to have credit history, and to have that, you must continue revolving your debts/payments of debts. Otherwise, if you don’t use any credit for a period of time, you won’t be developing any credit history during that time, which means creditors have nothing to judge you on when determining if they should give you credit.</p></div>		</li>
