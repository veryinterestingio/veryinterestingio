			<div class="markdown"><p>In an homebrew RPG a friend was running, our party had an entire session devoted towards crossing this ocean after showing up from the multiverse. We, nearly ageless characters, were on the beach and spent weeks/months/years(?) developing the relevant skills and items to create a boat that we could traverse the ocean with.</p>
<p>Finally we land on the other shore, which we know is the right shore but we're not certain if the area we need to go next is north or south of us.</p>
<p>So then one of the other players says &quot;I can handle this, I just reach into my magical pouch and pull out my gyrocopt....GOD DAMN IT!&quot;.</p>
<p>He'd forgotten he had a magical gyrocopter that could have just transported us all across the ocean, sitting in his inventory.</p>
<p>To be slightly fair, after having visited a dozen different universes that each had unique physics/magic systems, our inventories were HUGE lists of strange items. Some of which we didn't even know what they were, but hey. This mug is glowing, that's probably meaningful somehow. Better keep it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, almost all of those are Marine Corps birds, and they have notoriously bad maintenance. The two Air Force mishaps were one pilot stretching the CV-22 to its limit in extremely dangerous conditions and one where the pilot literally flew through another's prop-wash which is a huge no-no in the flying community. If you remember Top Gun, that's effectively the same situation as the one that killed Goose.</p></div>		</li>
