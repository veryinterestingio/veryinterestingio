			<div class="markdown"><p>I like this. I teach on a part time basis (the class is pass/fail based on effort) and E for effort makes a lot of sense. Someone who is putting in the effort but still failing just needs more individualized teaching methods. Someone who isn't trying needs an intervention, something bigger is going on in their life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldnt want to be the teacher that decides that though. They can look pretty similar and have very different methods of intervention. A student for whom outside complications/trauma prevent them from submitting work at all would get an F, but same with a student who tries it, but is anxious with their performance and is not responding to the learning style, and is afraid to hand in 'bad' work, when they need the attention of somebody getting Es. A student who is a good at using natural smarts to game the system might get an E when in reality something is preventing them from applying themselves to learn actual new material, but it can look very similar to someone trying their best and just not getting it. Engagement issues can be extremely difficult to decipher just by looking at work, especially in the virtual time</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I kind of felt like there’s 3 groups of teachers; type A personality people that are judgy and don’t care about the well-being of their students and almost get this sick level of pleasure and satisfaction of the control they have over the students they teach, the other group of good teachers that actually recognizes the needs and situations of their students and tries to work with them (you will learn in this class), and the third group that doesn’t give a fuck and marks everyone present, hands out As on homework without even checking if the student turned it in (probably only teaches at the school so they can coach the sports teams). There are obvious outliers but most teachers hover around the range of one of these groups.</p></div>		</li>

<p>At the college level, it's entirely possible (even if not common) for someone to be just naturally unable to understand the concepts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would’ve thought E could mean “exempt”, as in a student who didn’t qualify to get the credit but also didn’t actually <em>mathematically fail</em>. But judging from the thread that’s just a rationalization I made up for why I never saw E on any report card ever.</p></div>		</li>
