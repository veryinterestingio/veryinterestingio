			<div class="markdown"><p>A formal crossmatch should take 30 minutes if the screen is clear. As soon as I have a blood type, I set up the screen and do the immediate spin crossmatches while that's incubating. The blood type takes 5 minutes and often that's what we'll go with in an emergency while the antibody screen is running. The goal is to switch to appropriate blood type quickly and figure out the antibodies as you go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The request takes 5 minutes to enter, the lab tech takes 5 minutes to get there, the blood draw takes 5 minutes, labelling the specimens and documenting the draw takes 5 minutes, the lab tech takes 5 minutes to get back to the lab, setting each sample in the right part of the test kit takes 5 minutes, the actual test itself takes 5 minutes, the lab tech takes 5 minutes to enter that info into the hospital information system (HIS), etc.</p>
<p>Everything in the hospital is &quot;only a 5 minute test&quot;, and everyone wants it done NOW. The reality is that getting anything done is a process, so the turnaround time from request to being actually done is 30min-1hr.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The A, B, or O types, and the negative or positive classifications are just based on 3 antigens out of hundreds of possible ones found in the blood. Why nobody talks about those other types? Are they just not important for transfusions, and if so, why?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those three antigens (A, B, and RhD) induce a much stronger reaction, so they're usually the only ones that matter for a simple blood donation.</p>
<p>The other types do definitely matter in certain situations though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm simplifying a bit here, but a couple of reasons.  1.  Unlike ABO, D (the positive and negative) and other antigens require a prior exposure to cause a transfusion reaction.  Either a prior blood transfusion, or women can be exposed when they are pregnant, as they are exposed to the fetal blood via the placenta.  2.  The other antigens don't always cause a major transfusion reaction.  It can be a big deal in people who are transfused often.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those three are very important in making sure the body doesn't have a immune reaction to the blood. The other antigens become much more important in organ transplant scenarios where it's hoped the organ will be in the recipient for a substantial amount of time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Patients who rapidly lose blood are given O negative blood (O negative is considered the universal donor)</p>

<p>Technically O negative is the universal cell donor but not the universal plasma donor (which is instead AB positive).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be good to donate if you're AB+, but you would donate plasma, not blood. You have to go to a facility with the correct equipment that separates the plasma from the whole blood. The whole process takes longer than donating blood but is needed for many different medical scenarios.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, as AB+ plasma is greatly needed for trauma resuscitation and emergent settings where there is no time for a crossmatch</p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CrateDane" target="_blank">CrateDane</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely. As they're generally transitioning from using whole blood to more often using plasma, AB+ donors are probably becoming very valuable.</p>
<p>Plasma donations take longer than blood donations, but you can donate more often. It takes 45-50 minutes when I donate.</p></div>		</li>
