<p>Sometimes you'll see a heavily edited video as the broadcast is going to commercial break, kind of a highlight reel of the last period, inning, etc. I don't have much experience with that but as far as I can tell, that is done with video editing software (Adobe Premiere, etc.) and played directly out of the computer or done with a much more advanced level of replay equipment.</p>

<p>Those clips before/after break are most likely EVS clipped replays with CG graphics placed over it live (not pre produced). Premiere or any other non-linear editing software would take too long to edit and turn around in time for air prior to the break. EVS machines record video that can be replayed and edited almost instantly.</p></div>		</li>
