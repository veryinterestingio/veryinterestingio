<p>Physical insight into the process may be gained by imagining that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle" target="_blank">particle</a>–<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiparticle" target="_blank">antiparticle</a> radiation is emitted from just beyond the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon" target="_blank">event horizon</a>. This radiation does not come directly from the black hole itself, but rather is a result of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_particle" target="_blank">virtual particles</a> being &quot;boosted&quot; by the black hole's gravitation into becoming real particles.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" target="_blank"><em>citation needed</em></a>] As the particle–antiparticle pair was produced by the black hole's gravitational energy, the escape of one of the particles lowers the mass of the black hole</p>

<p>It's kinda sorta but not really like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casimir_effect" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casimir\_effect" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casimir\_effect</a></a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>so hawking radiation relies on the concept of &quot;quantum foam&quot;</p>
<p>basically, quantum variation can sometimes generate pairs of charged particles where they shouldnt be, the universe will take some energy in a vague region and say &quot;this energy is actually two particles with opposing charges&quot;.</p>
<p>these particles sometimes appear at the very border of escaping the black hole, and rather than recombining into nothing, one escapes and the other one falls in, allowing some mass to flee the black hole. </p>
<p>with large black holes, this is extremely slow, because the distances involved make these perfect pairs really unlikely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why specifically large black holes? Wouldn't there a large one just have more places on which those perfect pairs can spawn than smaller ones? </p>
<p>Also, the Swarschild radius scales with the mass. So would the volume scaling with r\^3 and the area scaling with r\^2 mean that the heavier the black hole, the longer it takes to evaporate?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe it's a dumb question, but from what i've understood the hawking radiation is due to an anti-particle appearing inside the event horizon while the particle appears outside of it, so it seem that le black hole loses mass, but what if the particle appears inside the event horizon while the anti-particle outside? shouldn't the mass of the black hole increase? or is there an explanation on why one of the two phenomena is more likely to happen than the other?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why wouldn't these areas of large-scale hawking radiation just spread across the universe like all the other stuff did that didn't go through a black hole first, and thus go unnoticed? Or does that just take too long? But does too long even have a meaning in such a universe?</p></div>		</li>
