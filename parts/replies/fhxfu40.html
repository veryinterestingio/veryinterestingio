			<div class="markdown"><p>To add onto your last point, it‚Äôs also possible for a person to be conscious during anesthesia however their entire body will be shut down and it will look like they are unconscious. This means that they will feel every single thing that happens while unable to do anything about it, like scream or open their eyes.</p>
<p>This is extremely rare though.</p></div>		</li>

The feeling of a splinter that went in too far and is lodged somewhere it's not supposed to be, the feeling when a joint dislocated and it doesn't hurt yet but you know your anatomy is messed up, strangers rummaging around in your guts...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should know that your heart is a dead give away for panic, even in this state. The doctors will notice something is wrong long before anything serious happens üôÇ Even if they don't realise exactly what happened they are unlikely to proceed with the surgery with unexpected and erratic heart activity.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I didn't feel a thing despite being partially awake. Or at least I don't remember if i felt anything. Whole body felt super lethargic and fuzzy at the time. I drooled a lot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My experience of Versed isn't really like forgetting. It's more like everything is hilarious, including pain. Anything including pain triggers the same sensation as if I just heard a joke--like the moment of realization + slightly unexpected, with the added benefit that I super don't give a shit about what would normally be a really unpleasant sensation. It's a thing, for sure.</p></div>		</li>
