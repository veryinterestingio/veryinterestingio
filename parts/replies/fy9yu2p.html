			<div class="markdown"><p>To piggyback on this, using clocks was not a common thing for society until train travel made it important for everyone to agree on exactly what time it was.  For most humans, dawn, morning, high noon, afternoon, dusk etc was as precise as they needed to get in their daily lives.  </p>
<p>Of course the existence of clocks and the keeping of exact time goes way back, my point is that the practice of keeping time didn't concern everyone until recently.  Kind of wild to think that running our lives via a clock is such a universal experience today and the vast majority of humans who ever lived would have never had the thought 'hey do you know what time it is right now?'.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yep. And most people lived an agricultural life. So you'd track time by animal behaviour too. You'd get up with the birds, or at the cock's crow. You'd wait around in the evening until the cows came home. And you'd know that it was midday because only mad-dogs and Englishmen would be out in the sun.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's really not that bad. This would be perfectly readable even without the minutes printed. </p>
