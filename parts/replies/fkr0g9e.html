			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for asking.  That was my childhood friend Frederic Delano Grant (we've been pals since age 4 in nursery school.) He went with me to Kitum Cave.  In point of fact, I dedicated The Hot Zone to Fred Grant.  So I hope he did get the credit he totally deserves.  Fred didn't go inside the cave.  He would have done so but I told him no way, you stay outside!  I didn't want him to be infected.</p></div>		</li>
