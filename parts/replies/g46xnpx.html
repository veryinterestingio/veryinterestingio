			<div class="markdown"><p>We've just seen a picture of the first vacuum Raptor engine - the nickname 'Vactor' has been coined and I think it will stick - and unlike most other vacuum optimised engines, it uses regenerative cooling too. This makes sense, because each will be packed close to 2 other vacuum engines and 3 sea-level engines, inside a cowling, so radiative cooling won't work.</p></div>		</li>
