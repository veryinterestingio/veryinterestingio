			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if more robust testing gives a more robust estimate of prevalence and thus more accurate case fatality rate estimates. In locations where it is difficult if not impossible to know the actual rate of disease in a population, ie places where testing was slow to roll out, withheld because of limited test availability or restricted by mandate, the disease has expanded well beyond what can reasonably be accounted for by limited testing, more disease = more sicker people and more deaths. In this case limited testing will far over estimate actual case fatality rates. Germany was proactive in early testing, identifying more cases early giving a better estimate of the actual denominator in the case fatality rate.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That is an explanation given today by the president of the RKI at the press conference of chancellor Merkel. There's a high chance that Germany has a very low rate of undetected cases running around because our randomized samples so far haven't shown any prior undetected cases (we conduct those to keep track of influenza, seen <a href="https://influenza.rki.de/MapArchive.aspx" target="_blank">here</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only does it give a better estimate of mortality and morbidity, it also allows isolating people with known infections so that the number of people they spread it to is reduced somewhat.</p>
<p>To get a better (but still crude) estimate of mortality now, it makes more sense to divide deaths until today by total number of cases ~21~ <em>18</em>* days ago.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>21 days is too long, plenty of people die before that so you would overestimate the rate. The three deaths were all from people who were not known cases 21 days ago. Ideally you take the cases that were found 21 days ago and determine how many <em>of these</em> died, but I don't know if that information is publicly available (and it's too early as well, 21 days ago Germany had 15 cases or so).</p>
<p>South Korea's new case numbers go down, in a week or two we can take their case fatality rate as quite reasonable estimate.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Federally mandated paid sick leave (up to 6 weeks consecutively paid in full), meaning people have less pressure to still go to work if they think they may be sick</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can stay sick virtually as long as you need. The employer just has to pay everything up to 6 weeks out of their own pockets.</p>
<p>After that the health insurance pays you &quot;Krankengeld&quot; (sick peoples' money) that amounts to 60% of your last monthly income for 72 weeks.</p>
<p>Also in that period it is very hard to fire you. Only if it is 100% clear that you have a bad prognosis and are likely that you cannot work in your current job anymore. But if you just had a bad car accident that takes a year to recover, but have a prognosis of full or near-full recovery? You cannot get fired.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are of course correct - although the 60% is not entirely accurate, it's a slightly sliding scale with a cap at something approaching 3000 Euros per month for a longer-term illness...</p>
<p>In any case, I was giving a simplified version as, regarding COVID-19, the average hospital stay is about 3 weeks, so well within the timeframe where one would be paid in full still directly by the employer. Still, I appreciate your expanded answer, and hope people who are curious will still find it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Policy question: Is Krankengeld the equivalent of Disability in the US - if you can never work again, is it 60% of your last monthly income, or is it some other number?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm, i am working in our German office, and we have a liberal work-from-home policy already in non-corona times, now I am ordered to work from home unless I specifically need physical access to stuff in the office.</p>
<p>Our US branch had just introduced remote-working, allowing it on dedicated days (mostly fridays). Now they also roll out remote working due to HQ mandating it for the German offices, but I wonder whether they would have actually set up the tech for that (VPN gateways, etc.) if the German offices hadn't pioneered that within the corporation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work for a major health insurer in the US. We have VPN gateways set up and almost the entire company uses either virtual desktops or virtual computers for their work, meaning they don't rely on the physical computers in the office. They previously did not have a work from home policy, but have adjusted that in response to COVID-19. I personally have worked from home for the last 6 days as I have a cold/cough. They are trying to figure out how to address call centers though, as they can't just close them since people need them for a variety of things. This company isn't the most forward thinking in terms of perks, but as a fortune 200 company, at least has the infrastructure in place to protect most of their employees while still providing services needed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I've experienced the opposite at the companies i've worked at.</p>
<p>Home Office is tolererated for a special circumstances and a day or at most two a week if you negotiate well.</p>
<p>It is changing, yes, but slowly.</p>
<p>Corona is boosting this at my current employer, but we also need to expand bandwith if eveyone would work from hom at the same time.</p>
<p>And supply equipment like monitors etc.</p></div>		</li>
