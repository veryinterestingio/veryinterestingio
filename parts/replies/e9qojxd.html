			<div class="markdown"><p>I was in the same boat as op. My best friend at one point started to drift toward the conspiracy theories. I was a physic student so it really bothered me. At first, I was a bit angry about those stupid ideas. But then I realized I had to teach him what I'd been taught because my friend didnt had the chance to get the education I had. So at that point I started to question his theory, without anger or making fun of him, but genuinely trying to make him come to the conclusion it was bullshit by himself, only by providing support and information and when asked, explaining why I thought this theory was bullshit.</p>
<p>It actually worked pretty well and one can say my friend is not in the conspiracy theory boat anymore (even though he still come to me with video or stuff which bothered him to ask me what I think about it).</p>
<p>So yes, try to make him question himself on those theory, be kind, never make fun of him for beinbg &quot;dumb&quot; or uneducated. I think my friend trusted me, that was a HUGE part of bringing him outside those views.</p>
<p>edit : I must add that he had doubt, he was not batshit crazy about conspiration. Some things he heard and rode instilled doubt into him. So we're far from a mental condition which I agree is a big part of conspiracy theory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a way to help guide people to a more complete understanding of something. It's one thing to accept that something is true. It's something else entirely to understand <em>why</em> something is true.</p>
<p>I think there are a lot of people out there who are simply wary of accepting other people's authority.  The Socratic method helps deal with that power dynamic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My physics class was very Socratic, and to this day is my most favorite class to have attended. Why don't more professors teach like that? I imagine it's not ideal for all curricula for some reason I don't know. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is how good skeptics approach people who believe BS (called 'woo' by skeptics). Just by asking questions and being intrigued in the claims. It is often useful to be versed in the science and the woo to know what questions to ask to expose the biggest  flaws. Questions in the format of &quot;Can you explain to me.... I dont think I'm getting it&quot;, or &quot;I'm having difficulty reconciling [woo claim] with [science claim], can you explain? &quot;. Also never 'straw man' their argumant (purposefully misinterpret what they say to be weak or rediculous) 'iron manning' is a better approach (giving them the benifit of the doubt at every possible tern), if you can do that and still poke holes you come off as much more credible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that's a good way to handle this.</p>
<p>Most conspiracy theories relay on uninformed people and try to soak them in with scientific words used in the wrong context or draw false conclusions off of legitimate experiments. The only thing that can actually help change the view is to address the root of the problem and explain the faults of the conspiracy while making clear what the actual conclusion should be. This is especially true in things like perpetuum mobile stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can not reason someone out of a position they did not acquire through reason.</p>
<p>This is why the Socratic method of teaching is so very important.  The teacher points out the flaws in the position through &quot;innocently&quot; asking questions.  This is important, so that the learner feels they have taken on the role of the teacher rather than being challenged on their belief system.  Challenging the belief system makes the argument emotional rather than intellectual.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We have a strong  competitor for first evidence of (securely dated) copper smelting from the Vinca culture in what is now Serbia <a href="https://archaeologynewsnetwork.blogspot.com/2010/06/serbian-site-may-have-hosted-first.html#utz2BfHlhX42GAqQ.97" target="_blank">https://archaeologynewsnetwork.blogspot.com/2010/06/serbian-site-may-have-hosted-first.html#utz2BfHlhX42GAqQ.97</a></p>
<p>And sorry to push the dates back, in this thread of all places but we have evidence of lead smelting from 8000 years ago from Yarim Tepe in what is now Iraq. We also have possible evidence of copper smelting from this same location and time period. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great explanation, but you seem to have started a trend in this thread that many others are aping. You're conflating a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fringe_science" target="_blank"><strong>fringe</strong> scientific theory</a> with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory" target="_blank"><strong>conspiracy</strong> theory</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You make a valid point, but there still are conspiratorial elements. It seems like OP's friend not only holds a belief in the fringe scientific theory, but also that there is a conspiracy to withhold this information from the public. </p>
<p>If, for instance, I accepted this idea about an ancient advanced civilization, but acknowledged that the evidence had not been found, and only believed that it <em>would</em> be found one day, I would be a fringe science theorist. This is a bit more than that, I imagine. </p>
<p>Edit: Particularly relevant - this recent crater discovery in Greenland which brings some verifiable evidence to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younger_Dryas" target="_blank">Younger Dryas</a> theory, which up to this point has pretty much been a fringe scientific theory!</p></div>		</li>
