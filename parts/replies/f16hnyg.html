			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel ya on the taking gabapentin. Only I'm &quot;just&quot; on four at night (three 300s and one 400) and two in the morning (one 300 and one 400). But dang, I can only manage to take three of the 300s at a time, I can't manage all 4 pills. That's a legit skill you have going</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add onto what you said, there is also something called &quot;pill esophagitis&quot; where certain medications can actually induce that hard-to-swallow feeling. Just off the top of my head, some of those medications include iron, bisphosphonates, some antibiotics, and maybe potassium? Not sure on that last one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought that was when a pill actually does get stuck in your esophagus, at least for a while? That happened to me once with doxycycline. It was Not Fun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dispense doxicycline frequently at the pharmacy and we have to put on the label to remain sitting upright or standing for at least 30 minutes after taking your dose for this exact reason. Forgot what it's called exactly but doxicycline is notorious for getting lodged in the throat and can cause massive problems such as a) you aren't getting your antibiotic dose properly and b) it can cause pretty serious damage to your esophagus in a number of ways.</p>
<p>Edit: another medicine with the same C&amp;A label of sitting upright is alendronic acid (used for osteoporosis). Also the damage that can occur to your esophagus is conveniently called esophagitis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It hurts so bad when that happens! One time I was being an idiot and took my Zoloft laying down. It ended up burning my esophagus, and I wound up in the ER because we had no idea what was happening. They had me take a shot of this numbing medication and that helped, but I couldn't believe a little pill could cause that much pain!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, this seems notorious for causing it- I wonder why moreso than other medications. Iâ€™ve been on it for months and (knock on wood) no issues, though. I think eating after taking it helps.</p></div>		</li>
