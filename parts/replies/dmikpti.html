			<div class="markdown"><p>My thoughts on this. When I was a kid and frustrated with my computer, it's not like I thought &quot;when I hit the keyboard with my hands I will knock tiny mechanical parts into place!&quot;</p>
<p>It seems to be more likely a primitive reaction where we hit the thing bugging us.</p>
<p>It just so happens that there are also times where a good smack will provide a temporary fix (the example I liked in the thread was hitting an old TV). But I think we hit it because we're frustrated and when it works we are rewarded and apply that technique to other electronics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My roommate once couldn't stop laughing while watching me play Skate 2 (I'm quite good at the Skate games), when I couldn't get this specific line done for a challenge. I had to do three unique grinds after three unique flip tricks, rail to rail after each trick. I would either accidentally do a trick twice, or bail off the rail. It must've taken me 30+ attempts and by the end, after each try I was just so steamed I was flipping the bird at my tv, trying not to break stuff but wanting to so badly. The fact that my best friend was lying on the ground laughing his ass off didn't help. </p>
<p>Biting, I have yet to get that urge.</p></div>		</li>
