			<div class="markdown"><p>Bonus question: In a water birth, if the baby is born underwater, does it wait to take its first breath after they raise it out of the water or is it going to try to breathe and potentially drown if they don’t get it out soon enough? Can the baby theoretically just live underwater forever if it never breathes air (and isn’t ever separated from the mother, I guess)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some people believe that somewhere along our evolution as simple primates, we lived most of our lives in water.  That's how that instinct was formed.  Look up the water ape theory.  It's pretty interesting.  Lot's of other supporting evidence as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, because the placenta is birthed shortly after the baby, and that's the connection between mom's bloodstream and the baby's.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How come the mother doesn't bleed to death when pushing out the placenta? If that is responsible for connecting both bloodstreams, I'd expect there would be a LOT of bleeding involved when you get rid of it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The baby will naturally wait until it's obove water to take it's first breath, to a point.  Generally you want to get it up asap,  but sometimes the baby is tangled in the cord, or the mom has a short cord, and they cant get it up right away, somehow the baby just knows not to breath, probably due to still feeling water pressure.  Obviously the longer the baby is underwater the greater the risk of it inhaling the water.  I'm no expert but I am married to a midwife and also my kids have had waterbirths.  One of which was stuck underwater for like 30 seconds (felt like 2 hours) and there was a slight panic unwrapping the cord, but he came up and breathed and started crying like normal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same happened with my third kid. The cord was round his neck and the midwife had to untangle him without him breaking the surface so he wouldn't take his breath underwater. It was very quick, like a few seconds. His mum didn't even realise until afterwards, mainly because I distracted her to give the midwife a moment.</p></div>		</li>
