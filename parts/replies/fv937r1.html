			<div class="markdown"><p>The crows dropping nuts to get cracked by cars reminds me of a similar phenomena where I live. </p>
<p>The crows by my Condo know that one of our units always has a puddle on the sidewalk in the summer. The AC unit is constantly running and the condenser leaks a hell of a lot keeping that puddle constantly filled. They find stale bread usually by the In N Out down the street and bring it to our puddle and drop it in there to soak up the water and soften up. Then they eat it. I always see a group of 3 or 4 of them doing this every summer without fail. Clever little birdos.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Crows are smart. Several years ago I heard a story on the radio of a guy who saved a crow that was stuck into a piece of string. Months go by and the guy comes back from work and parks his car on the other side of the street. The wife with their toddler was in the front yard and the kid run towards the father, while a car was coming speeding down the road. Exactly before the kid was able to run in front of the car, a crow dived at the baby's head and the baby stopped scared and that saved his life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked at an ice cream place once, and I watched our local crows bring stuff like bread to drop in puddles of melted ice cream.</p>
<p>The couldn't eat the fallen ice cream because their beaks are poorly shaped for drinking thin puddles, but they could drop absorbent food from the nearby McDonalds, KFC, and Taco Bell to get that sweet fatty goodness off the ground.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not so much the word recognition, as it is the logic of which letter pairs form words that astounds me. The other things you mention are simply learning shapes, but the ability to detect nonsense words is something extra. They’re better at it than our great ape cousins.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah... scientists do these things a lot... i'm starting to think that we need an overhaul to the scientific naming of living beings to more closely reflect our knowledge of nature. </p>
<p>It just doesn't make sense anymore that we call dinosaurs lizards and birds something completely different from therapods. Or name a family after a genus like is the case over here. </p>
<p>But i guess something like that wouldn't be possible.</p></div>		</li>
