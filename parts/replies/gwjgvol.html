			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, this is why I have to take antihistamines at night to counter my hyperactive immune system... It gets so active at night it jolts me awake without intervention as I near anaphylaxis just from being alive.  A dozen trips to the E.R. and years of testing to figure that out. . 25mg of diphenhydramine before bed is enough to control it... Really crazy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had no idea what allergies were...until I turned 43. Now I feel so bad for the people that had to live with this curse from Satan himself, their whole lives. My nose runs during the day, then at night, when it's time to go to sleep and breathe from my nose...it clogs. I live in florida, so the trees are constantly dishing out just as much spooge as they can. It's a nightmare.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's entirely possible they are using cetirizine with diphenhydramine to control what happens at night. I have a friend with MCAS (which sounds very similar to what the previous posted described) and they have to sometimes take Benadryl on top of both an H1 <em>and</em> H2 inhibitor because their response gets that bad, and, welp, it's better than going right to the Epi.</p>
<p>I personally take an H1 &amp; H2 (Zyrtec and famotidine; used to be ranitidine, which worked better for me) inhibitor daily to avoid hives myself, but have taken Benadryl on the rare occasions when they've broken through anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Diphenhydramine and Pepcid are the only ones that work for me, unfortunately.  I gave each alternative a month before getting back to the old H1 &amp; H2 blockers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Histamines are linked to your circadian rhythm and high levels come in at your nocturnal peak. The immune system is much more active when we are asleep and and rest.</p></div>		</li>
