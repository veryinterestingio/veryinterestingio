			<div class="markdown"><p>We actually use it in my lab were we do some Schlieren imaging. It will disperse and get spread throughout the air and dissipate eventually. Just walking around and the AC really stirs it all up. </p>
<p>It is interesting though, because they tell us if there is ever a fire don't crawl on the ground (as you are supposed to because of the smoke), because a SF6 tank may have been damaged in the fire and you wont be able to breathe. You have to crouch. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is actually a very simple way to do it and I have done it myself!
It's not as spectacular, but it works fine. I'm on mobile now, but you just need a small mirror (like 2cm by 2cm or something) and sunlight. You put the mirror somewhere and shine the sun in a dark place. Get in front of the wall where the sun is being projected and light a match or do science.
Seriously, it's that easy !</p></div>		</li>
