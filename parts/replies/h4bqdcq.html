			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I was thinking to answer the question too. Human and wild animals have quite different perceptions of &quot;long and healthy life&quot;. Like if a cheetah gets liver cancer, it might just lie down and die. No-one will try to make sense of it, do research on it, and work out why it happened.</p>
<p>I see a similar difference in the amount we invest in healthcare for ourselves and for our kept animals. Almost every species of animal I've seen in a zoo, at least one of them has cataracts. It's just seen as &quot;one of those things&quot;, in animal care, wheras in human's our expectation of good health demands that it's treated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats the real answer. To add, we also have an industry built around selling various health products and diets. It even extends to our pets, with things like grain free foods for your dog. We tend to exaggerate how important these things are.</p></div>		</li>
