			<div class="markdown"><p>It's when the challenge level or difficulty of the task you're performing and your skill level are matched. </p>
<p>When your skill level is more than the challenge given by the task, you'll get bored eventually.</p>
<p>When your skill level is under the challenge level of the task, you'll get frustrated.</p>
<p>When they are evenly matched, you'll enter a state where you just keep doing the task without thinking too much about it and it's the best match for productivity. In popular culture, it's also called 'the zone' or something similar.</p>
<p>In the flow state, you're thinking about the task, not the <em>how</em> to do task.  You are just doing because you already know what to do.</p>
<p>Read the book <em>Flow</em> for more details. It's a brilliant book!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the guy that responded to you explained it well...but as a former athlete, all I can say is that flow state is real. Your strength becomes enhanced, speed, agility—every cell in your body are working in perfect locomotion, in tandem with your environment and surroundings, resulting in the only natural outcome that could derive from those actions. Every all-star play I’ve ever made, was crazily enough, done with the utmost of ease. My biggest failures were when I was in my head, too focused on what needed to happen, rather than letting whatever was going to happen, happen.</p>
<p>It’s essentially the epitome of “living in the moment”. </p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p></div>		</li>
