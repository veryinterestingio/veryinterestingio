			<div class="markdown"><p>For anyone reading this who is curious what those white wines would be: generally German Riesling Spätlese and up, good Burgundy (grand cru especially), Sauternes (dessert from Bordeaux), Tokaji (Hungarian dessert wine), some Alsatian wines, and Chenin from Loire. There are others, but they tend to be fairly obscure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious as to why Viognier is your go-to for ageable whites? Condrieu and Château Grillet can go the distance for sure, but the vast majority of it can't, due to the grape's natural low acidity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When a bottle of whiskey claims 12 years or so, its the number of the youngest barrel by law. To stay consistent flavors the master taster will blend older barrels to produce a similar product year after year. </p>
<p>Also there is debate whether liquor ages. It can in a sense, a near empty bottle will oxidize more as there is more oxygen in the bottle. But for most people its not noticeable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know it for Scotch but American I am not sure if they blend with older stuff. With higher end bourbons I know they rely less on age and more on proof as things like George T Stagg will put the proof and its different year to year.</p></div>		</li>
