			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, I got that. But what do the bees do differently when they attack? I'm assuming in both scenarios they surround the queen, but how do you know if they're trying to attack?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bees are the most protective near the entrance area. This area has bees standing guard. Inside the hive area they are less protective, as most of their natural predators attack the hive entrance, and doesn't quickly destroy walls to get into the hive area</p>
<p>Also note how he is moving slowly, this is important, as bees don't like jerky movements.</p>
<p>Also remember that bees get pushed around by each other all the time, they don't want to waste too much energy being aggressive.</p>
<p>Another factor is that every colony has different aggression thresholds, beekeepers prefer less aggressive colonies.</p>
<p>Once a be sting, its back end stays attached into fleshy objects, and emits a banana like smell that warns other bees that there is an attacker</p></div>		</li>
