<p>Then why does my knee crack everytime I bend it, even if I bend it twenty times in a row?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s likely the bone/cartilage slipping. Mine does it too. That’s caused by either weak muscles or damage to the tendons/cartilage.</p>
<p>Edit: note that damage doesn’t necessarily mean horrible debilitating damage. This means the typical wear and tear of your bodies cartilage from things sliding around for years.</p></div>		</li>

<p>My physiotherapist said that's not necessarily a problem or an indication that something is damaged.
His knees make small cracking noises with every squad and his muscles definitely aren't weak.</p>
<p>Joints aren't supposed to operate in perfect silence. There is friction after all and tissue is moved around. Larger joints tend to make louder noises and joints closer to your ears are easier to hear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can do that with my feet. Cracking is not always that air bubble. Sometimes it's tendons slipping.</p>
<p>I heard that if it doesn't hurt, it shouldn't be a problem.</p>
<p>Im 32 and my feet cracks since I can remember and no problem.</p>
<p>I love making my right knee pops when im in my bed. I can feel it poping and it feels good even tho it doesnt feel anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Years ago I remember reading a study about this. People who cracked the knuckles in their hands were asked to self-rate the frequency at which they did so. Then they were tested for grip strength. Those who didn't crack their knuckles had on average 40% more grip strength. </p>
<p>There are many possible conclusions to draw from this. But, in general the consensus I've heard is that regular knuckle cracking is likely not beneficial to ones health, and there is some evidence pointing to detriments.</p>
<p>Edit: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1004074/pdf/annrheumd00439-0036.pdf" target="_blank">Found the study.</a></p></div>		</li>
