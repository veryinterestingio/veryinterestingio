<p>In that vein, I don't think and external light or heat source would be cheating, considering that is essentially what powers the Earth in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To echo constantino1's point, one could ask: What's the smallest example of a system that can exhibit cloud formation whose position relative to &quot;the ground&quot; does change if one is to make the system larger.</p>
<p>The point here is that if we surrounded the earth with a enormous clear plastic sphere of radius say 10 times the radius of the earth, then the clouds would form at roughly the same height as if we enlarged the sphere to have radius equal to 20 times the radius of the earth. This is not true of your system with hot water inside a plastic box with ice on top. If you enlarge the box a bit, the rain would still form at the edge of the box.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;rain&quot; suggests enough condensation in the air, to form visible drops... Thats not quite the same as condensation on the lid of a cup.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I have heard stories that the rocket silo for nasa would have clouds if it was not circulated... Not sure if thats true, but it might be a baseline to start from if it were.  I think the key is that you need enough volume that you can contain enough humidity without it all condensing on the walls.</p></div>		</li>
