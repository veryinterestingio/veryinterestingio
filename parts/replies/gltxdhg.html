			<div class="markdown"><p>You may have just saved us a lot of crying! My 5 week old baby is hard to get to sleep unless she's milk drunk and we're currently holding/ rocking her to sleep. She's swaddled so this helps with the jerks but to know she'll keep going and we need to wait ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For both of our kids there is a moment where the sound of thumb sucking gets really loud and fast. It lasts just a couple seconds, but that's the moment that they cross over to being also enough I can put them down. I think it's part of that last jerk you are referring to.</p></div>		</li>
