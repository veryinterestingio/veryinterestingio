			<div class="markdown"><p>I the problem I could see with the floating tunnel would be ship anchors like you mentioned before. Also what happens if the floats are damaged by shipping traffic or rough seas? I’m sure a many redundant systems would be used but but still. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rough seas are only rough at the surface, drop a few more feet and you don't feel it. The tunnel would likely be well under that.</p>
<p>Edit: Please stop messaging me to tell me the floats would be subject to the surface waves. Floats can be submerged, the tunnel itself can be made buoyant. They just need markers at the surface to let ships know not to drop anchor there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The floats are at the surface? So they would move in rough seas causing the tunnel to move. Am i missing something here?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This depends on the wave height and length, among other factors. Also, thermal and saline gradients can and do create internal waves under the surface, that can displace water hundreds of meters vertically. The forces involved aren’t as severe, but it can still stress a presumably flexible tube under the water to be moving around at strange points due to differences in the density of the surrounding water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A &quot;wave&quot; is a pressure wave, there's only very localized, limited movements of water. Wave themselves aren't associated with any strong currents; really the water barely moves at all. It's only if you're trying to make your way through the uneven surface that you have problems.</p></div>		</li>

<p>more immune to earthquakes that tunnels connected to the seabed arent safe from. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are many cables, power lines, etc on the ocean floor. These are all marked on charts that restrict anchoring in those areas. If a ship drops an anchor in an emergency it would be done as a last resort near the shore at a suitable depth. If a tunnel was in the area the Captain would know and obviously would chose not damaging the tunnel (possibly killing people) and run his ship aground instead. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The seals (<em>Gina</em> seals) are designed to last at least the lifetime of the tunnel (say, 100 years). The Gina seal used during construction is supplemented by a secondary <em>Omega</em> seal on the inside. In the unlikely event the Gina seal should start leaking, the Omega seal will do the job, at least temporarily. The (dry) spaces between these seals are monitored, and if a Gina seal is found to be leaking, it will be addressed - like adding a third seal, or applying some kind of grouting.</p></div>		</li>
