			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. Adenoviruses are DNA viruses that are quite stable. They have their own ways of avoiding immunity that don’t involve antigenic variation. Rhinoviruses also have their own ways of avoiding immunity, including multiple strains and induction of relatively weak, short lived immunity.  I already answered for coronaviruses. </p>
<p>Every virus has ways of avoiding immunity, because every virus around is the result of an unbroken string of thousands or millions of generations that <em>did</em> successfully avoid immunity long enough to replicate and transmit. But each virus lineage has come up with its own solutions, and you can’t extrapolate from influenza to adenovirus, or from HIV to coronavirus. They are different viruses with different answers to the same questions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>? All of the symptoms of the common cold <em>is</em> the immune response.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HRV infections trigger a vigorous proinflammatory immune response that is thought to drive the symptoms experienced as illness [271, 298, 299], but they do not seem to actively prevent or interfere with the host’s immune response the way most other viruses have evolved to do. </p>
<p>....</p>
<p>It has been suggested that HRVs may have evolved with humans to such an extent that their symbiotic relationship serves to help train the human immune system (Kirchberger S, Majdic O, Stöckl J. Modulation of the immune system by human rhinoviruses. Int Arch Allergy Immunol. 2007;142:1–10.)</p>
<p>....</p>
<p>Traditional vaccine strategies were quickly ruled out as a prophylactic intervention for HRV illness because of the extensive antigenic variability that is a hallmark of the genus Enterovirus [178, 325]. However, if it were possible to identify “master” strains [352] that exhibit sufficient antigenic cross-reactivity to induce broad heterotypic responses against many other HRV strains, then an effective vaccine could still be possible.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Somewhat, but it's more due to the fact your common cold anti bodies last 1-3 years on average, and there are 4 common cold viruses you could catch.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Influenza is unique in the virus world in its ability to evolve to avoid population immunity.</p>

<p>That's really interesting and not something I've ever heard before. What's some further reading I could do?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I found your answer really informative but is it really ONLY influenza that mutates in that way? I thought this is a main evolutionary advantage of many viruses specifically HIV as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>HIV does vary <em>in its host</em> to avoid immunity, but it’s very different from influenza in many ways. For one, the immune evasion variants of HIV tend to be profoundly damaged, replicating much worse than “normal” HIV that doesn’t have to deal with immunity, whereas influenza can blithely incorporate mutation after mutation without showing any detrimental effect.</p></div>		</li>
