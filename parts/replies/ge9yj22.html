			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also the sort of thing that would be caught in vaccine trials if the vaccine somehow looked enough like both the spike protein and angiotensin. </p>
<p>I appreciate the metaphor of the hand on a doorknob, that illustrates really well to me why even though the proteins both fit the ACE2 receptors they don't necessarily look alike.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Scientist here (PhD in computational structure-based protein design). I've looked in great detail at the structures of ACE2, Spike, and how they bind, and it's really important to note a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The SARS-COV-2 spike protein binds a &quot;virus-binding hotspot&quot; that was also used by SARS (classic) to infect cells. That spot is not the active site where angiotensin 1 or angiotensin 2 are bound, but instead on the outside. Spike protein is wayyy to big to fit in the binding pocket ACE2 uses to catalyze the conversion between angiotensin 1 and angiotensin 2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All current vaccines aren't introducing ACE2 into the body, but spike protein. And since ACE2 is all over the human body (we use it to control blood flow), our immune system is trained to be pretty tolerant of ACE2. Adding a protein that bound ACE2 would elicit antibodies against the protein (such as spike), not ACE2. The antibodies I've seen all bind various parts of spike in various ways, and those are the ones that neutralize SARS-CoV-2.</p>
</li>
<li>The easiest way to know how likely a COVID-19 vaccine might induce an autoimmune disorder is not just to look at current vaccines, but to look at current patient outcomes. People who recover from COVID seem to actually <em>lose</em> antibodies and have a rapid fall off in immune response, with no obvious autoimmune consequences. Since all the current vaccines seem to be simply exposing spike protein to the immune system, they will do more or less the same thing as COVID itself. Thankfully, they seem to elicit longer lasting antibody responses too. It's not impossible to have an autoimmune issue when trying to manipulate the immune system, but the extensive clinical trial data thus far suggests it's very unlikely.</li>
</ol>
<p>EDIT: I went to bed, and was suddenly unable to reply to comments! I'll try to respond to the most important question here: will people with abnormal immune responses be safe from adverse reactions to the vaccine?</p>
<p>Short answer: we don't know, and that's not a risk we should be taking. &quot;Herd immunity&quot; is about having people with healthy immune systems protect people for whom a vaccine might have serious health consequences. So even though we don't <em>expect</em> a spike-based antigen (which is what current vaccines will be introducing to our immune systems) to induce autoimmune complications, we don't need to take that risk. Immunology is really complicated, and training our immune system to recognize the right molecules as invaders and tolerating others is an ongoing challenge! From what I know, our immune systems learn &quot;foreign&quot; vs. &quot;body&quot; at an early age, and later in life there are &quot;self-antigen&quot; which trigger autoimmune responses (often induced by pathogens), as well as &quot;self-toleragens&quot; which suppress autoimmune responses (often employed by cancers, for instance). It's a complicated field I understand very poorly!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your response! Do we know why introducing the spike protein to the immune system provokes a longer lasting immune response than actually catching covid does? Seems so counterintuitive!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably due to the intensity of the immune response. Many people who contract sars cov 2, or indeed any coronavirus, tend to develop extremely mild features (or asymptomatic) and rapidly rid of it. Sort of a hit and run response. And this doesnt necesssrily gain immunity.</p>
<p>HPV infection also doesnt really grant much in the sense of immunity, you can keep catching the same infection over and over again, but the vaccine has a sevetal thousand times stronger immune response and grants you actual immunity.</p>
<p>If I was to guess a reason, this would be it. A more controlled stronger immune response.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think we also don't know for certain that the immune response from the infection wears off. The antibody levels fall off, but the body might still be able to produce them again in the future from memory B cells.</p>
<p>There are documented reinfection cases, but it's probably too early to say if the natural immunity lasts or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since you seem to know more about this than anyone that I know, can you tell me if the reticence I have toward these two vaccines is in any way valid? My current thought process is that since two of the vaccines are a new type of vaccine, and we haven’t spend the standard 1 year studying results (I heard that typically they wait a year after trials?), that it is possible that the vaccines will have major consequences that we don’t yet know about. </p>
<p>If they worked similar to other vaccines, I don’t think there would be any need to worry. </p>
<p>Is that a valid concern? Like yes, I’m eager to be over covid, but if we give this to first responders and the elderly or at risk, are we possibly putting ourselves at risk of more dangerous side effects?</p>
<p>I’m not trying to fear-monger. It’s a real question; I just don’t know anything about this stuff so I’d love some info from an expert!</p></div>		</li>

<li>I read that trial patients with autoimmune disease were statically censored.  Can you give a link to that “extensive clinical trial data” along with the survival analysis techniques that were chosen, including what groups were censored?</li>
</ol>
<p>“These big phase 3 trials are basically looking at relatively healthy people across an age spectrum that is highly desirable,” he said. “Not surprisingly, patients with active autoimmune diseases are censored. Those on immunosuppression are censored.”</p></div>		</li>
