<p>It's hard comparing the cost of coal vs solar.  There's construction costs, and there's operating costs.  Just because something is cheaper to build doesn't mean it's cheaper to operate.  Coal plants need coal, which has to be mined and shipped.  Solar/wind plants?  Not so much.  OTOH, solar/wind have intermittency problems that coal doesn't.  But the price of coal can vary over the life of the plant.  Solar/wind, not so much.  Subsidies, regulations, etc.  You get the idea.  Saying which is &quot;better&quot; is hard to define objectively.</p>
<p>In an attempt to &quot;level&quot; the playing field, the finance geeks at <a href="https://www.lazard.com/perspective/lcoe2019" target="_blank">Lazard</a> proposed something called LCOE (Levelized Cost of Energy).  They take the total cost to build and operate the plant over its lifetime, then divide that by the total amount of energy it is expected to produce.  It's a rough number with several shortcomings, but it does give a sense of where things stand.</p>
<p>Back in 2009, the LCOE for solar stood at $359/MWh.  Coal was at $111.  So yeah, solar was way more expensive not that long ago.  However the costs for solar have been dropping <em>drastically</em>.  By 2019, coal has dropped to $109, and solar has dropped to $40 (forty).  Over that same time, wind dropped from $135 to $41.</p>
<p>In this very brief period of time, the question of &quot;Who is cheapest?&quot; looks very different.</p>
<p>Your point about storage is still relevant, but perhaps not so much as you think.</p>
<p>There was a <em>lot</em> of concern about how the variable availability of RE might affect the grid.  One of the analysts at <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/peak-emissions-are-closer-than-you-think-and-heres-why/" target="_blank">Bloomberg Energy</a> put it this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two decades ago everyone assumed that the cost of managing intermittency would soar after the first 5% of wind and solar entered the power mix; a decade ago we thought the inflection was 20%; now we know it is not this side of 40%. Modelling exercises around the world suggest that it is not until you reach 80% or more in any decently-connected grid that the cost of managing intermittency really starts to go vertical.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nothing like actually trying it to see how it's going to work out.</p>
<p>In the US, we're a long way from 80%.  Indeed, even if it turns out that there is no cost effective way to hit 100% RE (seems unlikely, but &quot;if&quot;), we should still be pursuing that 80% as hard and as fast as we can.  It's cleaner, better for the planet, and <strong>cheaper</strong>.  Indeed, it's so much cheaper, it can actually cost less to build an entirely new RE plant than just to <em>operate</em> coal or nuclear.  Yeah, that much cheaper.</p>
<p>I don't know if I remembered to mention how much cheaper RE sources are (/s), but as you look at the curve of dropping prices, there's no particular reason to believe that their drop has reached the bottom.  The more solar panels/wind turbines we build, the better we get at it.  Increasing competition helps too.  When Lazard comes out with their new numbers this November, I expect to see RE go down just a little bit more.</p>
<p>As for batteries?  What we've got now is already having an <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-big-battery-hornsdale-australia-cost-savings/" target="_blank">impact</a>.  And the amount of R&amp;D money being poured into this tech is amazing.  They're steadily getting better, with several (lab-only) reports of significant breakthroughs on the horizon.  By the time we're anywhere near 80%, I expect they'll be ready to carry the load.</p></div>		</li>
