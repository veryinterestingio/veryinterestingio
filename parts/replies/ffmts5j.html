			<div class="markdown"><p>I need to almost constantly play music because it drowns out the noise of civilization.</p>
<p>For instance I just paused my music to take a quick listen and I can hear</p>
<p>>one pair of arguing neighbors</p>
<p>>the computer fan</p>
<p>>something emitting an \~20khz buzz (I think it's a power strip?)</p>
<p>>a whole bunch of crows</p>
<p>>my heartbeat</p>
<p>>cars driving past</p>
<p>And this is a just quiet sunday morning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm the ADHD &amp; constant need for music.</p>
<p>I work In a warehouse &amp; there are tons of belts and balers and machinery running. The only way I can concentrate and get anything done is to have my headphones on at full volume.</p>
<p>Otherwise I hear the conversation my coworkers are having</p>
<p>The belts moving</p>
<p>The baler squishing cardboard</p>
<p>The forklift moving around</p>
<p>That cart that squeaks and drives me insane</p>
<p>The stickers 5 aisles down talking</p>
<p>Their handhelds' automated voice talking</p>
<p>All the little compressed air operated bits shifting on and off</p>
<p>It's really overwhelming and I get yelled at quite a bit for people not being able to talk to me but nobody seems to understand that I just cannot deal with all of that sound constantly. :(</p></div>		</li>

A lot of people take it for granted that they can focus on and understand body sensations as needed and ignore it the rest of the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ADHD has a similar symptom. For me, its specifically with sources of sound. If there are several conversations going on nearby, it leads to stress and headaches really quick. Best fix is to get somewhere quiet, or to slap on my headphones and crank up the volume so I can have a single sound to focus on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For sure! There is a bunch of research coming out that explores sensory processing difficulties in individuals with ADHD as well (it's not just a challenge for people with ASD).
Which makes sense if you think about it - sensory information is what we use to guide our attention and then interact with our environment. So if you are having difficulties processing that sensory information that's going to impact your attention. Or maybe it works the other way and operates in reverse. Not sure, maybe never will be, but super interesting and I think important to be aware of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Headphones never helped me. Even when I had noise-canceling ones, which were uncomfortable. Even ear plugs don't reduce sound enough to block it out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>High Functioning Autistic here. I've tried noise canceling headphones, earplugs, or earbuds with noise canceling built in, and they help a little. In those cases, I just try to deal with it. </p>
<p>However, when the noise is too loud for those tools to help, I simply need to move myself to a quiet space for a few minutes. Some of these quiet places include the outside of a store, or a restroom.</p>
<p>If none of those places help, or if other factors are built upon the noise, I will need to find an escape from the stressful area, possibly abandoning my plans so that I, and everyone else, is safe. I know, having to stop what you're doing stinks, but sometimes, safety is better.</p></div>		</li>
