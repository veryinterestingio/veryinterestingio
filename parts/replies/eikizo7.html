			<div class="markdown"><p>How do we know that the entire universe is expanding if we haven't ever found a finite end to it? Couldn't it be the case that in other parts of the universe things might be doing something entirely different?</p>
<p>Could the big bang just be the creation of everything in our (so far) observable universe and potentially one of several similar events throughout the universe?</p>
<p>My mind is blown...</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, we don't know anything about what might be outside the observable universe. We just assume it's the same as here. It's the simplest assumption compatible with observations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe you're leaning more into multiverse theory. generally the Big Bang is seen as the event that created our universe, actions and events that occur outside this domain would be considered part of another universe.</p>
<p>the light from the big bang stretches nearly 14 billion light years, but the space stretches (IIRC) 90 billion light years, this is a result of the accelerated expansion caused by Dark Energy, so the universe is already moving apart (not well worded) faster than the speed of light and beyond what we can see (hello Rafiki). </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If light-producing events happened elsewhere outside the observable universe but sufficiently <em>before</em> the big bang, that light could have reached us by now, and we'd see those events (it would be observable).</p>
<p>As for &quot;so far&quot;, the universe appears to be becoming <em>less</em> observable (bigger, but less in it) - new things probably won't become observable.</p></div>		</li>
