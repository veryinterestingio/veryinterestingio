			<div class="markdown"><p>Like at sonic our onion rings are &quot;handmade&quot; and are advertised as such. I'd say it's not false cause we add water to the batter then coat them in breading and bread crumbs. I'd say anything less than that, shouldn't be called handmade.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The KFCs near my house have &quot;fresh bakes cookies&quot; with their box meals. A couple months ago I could go and get one of these cookies warm in a little paper bag, because they baked them in their oven and put the cookies in the bags.</p>
<p>Now I can get a &quot;fresh baked cookie&quot; from their box meals, and they come in a sealed plastic bag with the KFC logo printed on it.</p>
<p>HOW THE FUCK IS THAT ALLOWED?!</p></div>		</li>
