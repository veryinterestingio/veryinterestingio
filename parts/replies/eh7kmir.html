<p>Eng woke up to find his brother died in sleep, and Eng passed away distraught about three hours later, likely due to the poisons developing in his brother's body (&quot;sepsis&quot;).</p>

<p>that's seriously one of the worst things I've ever read</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once read that Eng asked his son to come into the room to check on his brother as Eng had felt &quot;sick&quot;. His son told him his brother had passed away and he simply responded &quot;Then I am going too.&quot; </p>
<p>Terrible way to go, I can't even begin to imagine the pain. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just for the record, your definition of “sepsis” is a bit off the mark. Sepsis is more correctly a life-threatening response to infection, where the person’s own body causes damage to itself. As reported in their autopsy, Chang’s cause of death was attributed to a cerebral blood clot, while Eng’s exact cause of death is not wholly clear — there was no suggestion of sepsis as the cause of death. </p></div>		</li>

<p>For all from the wiki for further detail ...</p>
<p>“The twins' final autopsy report said that Chang had most likely died of a cerebral blood clot; the cause of Eng's death was left unclear. Pancoast and colleague Harrison Allen attributed it to shock—that is, Eng &quot;died of fright&quot; upon seeing his dead brother—based on the fact that Eng's bladder had distended with urine and his right testicle had retracted. Others who worked on the autopsy suggested alternate theories, most prominently that Eng had died of blood loss as his circulatory system pumped blood through the connecting band into his dead brother's body and received no blood in return. &quot;In the end,&quot; wrote academic Cynthia Wu in 2012, &quot;that Eng died of fright prevails not only in the medical record but also in the popular-cultural imagination.”</p></div>		</li>
