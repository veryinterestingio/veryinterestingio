			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a teacher in highschool that hated how my uppercase i's and lowercase L's looked the same and would take points off my assignments for writing them like that. It's not like it was unreadable. I have neat handwriting and it was an English class so it's not like we were writing anything that wouldn't have enough context to make it blatantly obviously what letter I'd written. </p>
<p>If it's not going to be clear, then definitely add marks to make it clear, but generally, sans serif fonts look nice and are perfectly readable.</p></div>		</li>
