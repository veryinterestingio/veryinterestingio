<p>fire is a very stressful experience, and people forget things under stress.</p>

<p>It really is. It is so fucking hard to stay calm which is probably the most important objective to come out of it with your life.</p>
<p>I was once trapped in an appartment complex when a fire erupted under me. I was the one making the emergency call and I remember my self closing my front door after realising the smoke was so black and dark I couldn't be sure to go through it. Standing there and watching the smoke creep through the door I kept saying to myself &quot;stay calm, stay calm, stay calm... What should I do now?&quot; While talking with the emergency dispatcher ( and we kinda had a casually talk) I asked him: What should I do? We talked about the appartments structure and thus and agreed I should go to the kitchen and prepare. This ment I should soak some towels and use them as a smoke barricate. The dispatcher did one hell of a job and I remember him saying &quot;I can hear the cavalary arriving now&quot; and I said ya, they're here but they still better hurry. He asked why and I told him, that the fired had gone through the kitchen window below me and started to go up towards me. Within 30 seconds, the fire major yelled my name and I looked out and he yelled that the only way to get to me was through the building as there was no safe way to get me out through the windows. They had secure the floor below me and that I should just make a run for it as they had guys coming up to me. And so I did. I took a towel and wrapped it around my head and just made a run for it. Halfway through the darkness a hand grabbed my shoulder like &quot;Iam here and just keep going&quot;. Going down the smoke and fire me and smokediver (?) were asked if there was anyone else up there. I stopped up and thought for a second and said, that while waiting I recalled hearing my neighbours dog barking and he lived in door 3 from the left. The smokediver instantly went right back up there like a fucking lighting. I was barely outside before he came out carrying my neightbours dog. For me, this was probably the most emotionally part. I know my part was very small, but the fact that me sitting up in my kitchen and soaking everything in made it so easy for the smokediver to go through every obsticle and getting the last living being out safely was just impressive to me.</p>
<p>After a coupe of days in the hospital I was called into an interview. The dispatcher and the firemen wanted to get to know how I stayed so calm and my respons were: Well... What choice did I have? You guys were my only hope and I litterally put my life in your hands. And you did brilliantly! </p>
<p>Even the dog survived through a hypercapnia because of I stay calm. </p></div>		</li>
