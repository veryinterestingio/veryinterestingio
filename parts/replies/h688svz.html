			<div class="markdown"><p>Another (IMO simple) way to think about it is to look at the kinetic energy of the car at all 3 speeds. 100, 50, and 0 using:</p>
<p>E=1/2mv^2</p>
<p>M is the mass, v is the velocity. Mass will be constant so will the 1/2, so basically you’re comparing the v^2 term only. </p>
<p>100^2 = 10,000</p>
<p>50^2 = 2,500</p>
<p>0^2 = 0</p>
<p>From this we can see that from 100 to 50 is a difference of 7500 and 50 to 0 is only a difference of 2500. </p>
<p>Please note that these numbers are not in any actual unit like joules, since I didn’t use the mass of the vehicle in the calculation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A practical demonstration of this is when you brake when driving. </p>
<p>To come to a smooth halt you gradually release the pressure on the brake pedal, as less force on the brakes is required to maintain the same rate of deceleration.</p>
<p>If you keep your foot still on the pedal, maintaining the same force on the brake, you will eventually just jolt to a stop. With practice, you soften your foot exponentially and get a nice smooth stop instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that has more to do with the difference between static and dynamic friction. Static fiction is greater than dynamic so as you come to a stop suddenly the brakes reach a threshold where they're more static than dynamic so the brake force shoots up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.   approx 4x as much actually I believe.</p>
<p>Edit.  3x as much.</p>
<p>Simple math,   Or requires 4x the energy to double the speed, but you’ve used 1 unit for the first half (0-50) so you can subtract that from the the 0-100 calc to get the 50-100 number, so 3x</p></div>		</li>
