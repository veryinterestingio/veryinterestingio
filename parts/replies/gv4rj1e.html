			<div class="markdown"><p>thats actually less than I'd think. Normal earthbound RC helicopters/multicopters have a much much higher RPM than that. Oh wait, I looked it up and RC helicopters on earth are more like 2500 RPM. I am thinking of RC airplanes that have props that spin more like 7-20,000RPM</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah the low rpm is for full sized helicopters and it isn't an apples to apples comparison.</p></div>		</li>
