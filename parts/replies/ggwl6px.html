<p>It's difficult for me to find currently public-facing scientific papers with the supporting info for this decision, but I'll post what I can find as I find it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Then you could test positive for around 90 days after that, but aren't infectious. </p>

<p>Christ, let me fix my wording: isolation for ten days, symptoms or not. Then at the 10 day mark, if your symptoms are worsening or not getting any better, the isolation period is extended for up to 20 days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isolation 10 days with “no symptoms” isn’t the same as 10 days isolation from onset of symptoms which is what the CDE website says but there is so much conflicting information about this.  Like, you can not have a fever, for a couple days, still have symptoms but maybe they are getting better but you still have some and you are at 10 days since onset. CDC would say that you are ok to not isolate but yet I hear people say exactly as you have and say “10 days without symptoms.”  Anyone know which it is?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And even that isn’t a guarantee, as there are cases which present after 10 days of isolation. Initial studies showed that 97.5% of cases presented within 11.5 days. That means more than 1 in 50 cases present with symptoms after 11.5 days since exposure. In rare cases, some people become symptomatic even after 14 days since exposure. This happens in less than 1% of cases. The point being, 10 days of isolation is not a 100% guarantee that you’re COVID free. If you’re visiting someone high risk and you only isolated for ten days, keep the mask on for the first few days of your visit. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://mcmasterhealthlabs.ca/news.php#article0" target="_blank">McMaster HealthLabs</a> is still in the middle of a large travel related study, but my interpretation of their preliminary results is that it is important to both quarantine for a full 14 days after travel, and get tested on a regular basis throughout, as a very small percentage of people (though no amount is insignificant in my opinion) may not test positive until the end of the 14 day period (at least, with rapid testing methods).</p></div>		</li>
