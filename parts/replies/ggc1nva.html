<ul>
<li>
<p>Nucleons (neutrons &amp; protons, not electrons as they are considered elementary particles), are made of quarks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In both neutrons and protons there is 3 valence quarks which determine if the particle is a proton or a neutron</p>
</li>
<li>there’s a lot of other quarks (top/bottom; charm/strange) that cancel each other so they matter a less for the electric charge of nucleons</li>
</ul>
<p>Lets see the 3 valence quarks of protons and neutrons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Protons: 2 up (+2/3 charge each) and 1 down (-1/3)</p>
</li>
<li>Neutron: 2 down (-1/3 each) and 1 up (+2/3 charge)</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus their electric charges:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Proton: 2/3+2/3-1/3 = +1 (electric charge of a proton)</p>
</li>
<li>Neutron: 2/3-1/3-1/3 = 0 (The neutron has a neutral charge)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a bit off topic as it doesn’t answer the question but I hope it helped!</p></div>		</li>
