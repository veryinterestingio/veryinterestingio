<p>A big one is that most people who were operating at a lower body temp had a low resting metabolic rate. This usually coincides with something like malnutrition, comorbidities, homeostatic dysregulation, or even just old age- all of which make one more susceptible to diseases in a multilateral manner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although, paradoxically, or perhaps not, a lower resting metabolic rate due to caloric restriction seems to extend overall lifespan, and even mice genetically engineered to have lower metabolic body temps live longer (<a href="https://www.scripps.edu/newsandviews/e_20061106/conti.html" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.scripps.edu/newsandviews/e\_20061106/conti.html" target="_blank">https://www.scripps.edu/newsandviews/e\_20061106/conti.html</a></a>)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It truly is really cool stuff! Seems like an immune trade-off where in an environment where diseases and infections weren't an immediate threat, the optimal body temperature would actually be lower than it currently is to stretch resources. Would further explain why humans just don't constantly run a low-grade fever. Also explains the evidence showing the average human body temperature modernly to be dropping, since things like TB aren't constantly being hung over the developed world's head. Thanks for sharing, fascinating!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read an article not too long ago about how the average body temperature for the population is trending downwards. I won't go into more as I dont want to butcher or misrepresent it, but I don't think it is too hard to find i may look for it in a bit if i get the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true.</p>
<p>My lab studies a heart condition called patent foramen oval, and one of the things we've found is that people who have this condition have a body temperature that is about 0.5 degree celsius higher than those without it - and about 40% of the population have a PFO.  This has likely skewed 'normal' measurements of body temperature, as the presence of PFO is pretty much never screened for, as the 'tradiational' thought is that it didn't really effect things.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I feel like this whole question goes away when we move to C.</p>
<p>Normal body temp isn't specified in F at all. Its 37C. The line a fever is drawn at is 38C. Where does 98.6 come from? Its just exactly 37C, which is a nice round number in C.</p>
<p>Looking around the venerable webmd says: &quot;For a typical adult, body temperature can be anywhere from 97 F to 99F&quot;</p>
<p>And yes, I too have been vigilantly watching myself for fever and begun to notice my body temperature is both very consistent and never really reaches 98F at rest. More of a 97.5 kinda guy.</p></div>		</li>
