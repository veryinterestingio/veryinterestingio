			<div class="markdown"><p>I assume you're American? I know in Canada, Police Officers can easily make over 100k a year. Still, you would need to spend 2 years salary to buy a decent house, even where I live in Northern Ontario. Houses are pretty reasonable all things considered up here. </p>
<p>For example, my parents, in 2000, bought a very large house that was built in 1908. They paid 125k. It was 6 bedrooms, 1 and 1/2 baths and about 6000 square feet and 3 stories. It need some reno in the basement and 3rd floor, but the rest was very nice. We sold it in 2010 for 160k while still needing those renovations. </p>
<p>I'm if not mistaken, that same house is for sale right now for about 330k. That's a lot of house now that it's been renovated for that price. 4ish hours south, in Toronto, that same house would be well over a million. I couldn't imagine living in Toronto and working for minimum wage. Canada's min. wage is 14$/hour. About 24k a year at 40 hours per week. If you're lucky, 24k buys you a used, 6 year old F150 with 120k. A new one with the same options? 45k. 2 years of salary nearly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Controversial question, but I wonder whether women being introduced into the workforce has basically inflated the income and thus made it the norm to be a two income household, making everything much more expensive. Obviously there's tons  more at play but still it's one of the blocks forming the current situation. And no I'm not blaming women for anything forget about going down that route.</p>
<p>Edit: pop goes my silver cherry I guess</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is something that seems very likely to be an underlying issue. One reason for the wage stagnation would be a much larger percentage of the population is in the workforce. To be competitive a company no longer has to pay the employee a wage to support their family because most families have multiple incomes, which very much wasn't the case in 1970. I also am not blaming women in the workforce at all. It's a huge value and plus to have as many people engaged as possible, however it does have consequences.</p></div>		</li>
