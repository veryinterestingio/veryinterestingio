			<div class="markdown"><p>I keep forgetting this (that the living portion is that thin sliver between wood and bark). From my naive perspective I'm used to thinking 'animal' when I see the words 'living thing', and pretty much all of the animal is alive. When you put it that way trees seem really alien. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Trembling aspen trees are a pain in my back side because of their shoots and cloning. A tiny sapling grows insanely quickly, drawing nutrients from dozens of adult trees in the root system. You have to put in consistent effort year over year to keep them from taking over an area. </p>
<p>However, it is super neat to see them in the fall. Because they're all clones, their leaves turn at exactly the same moment. Usually trees vary slightly as to that timing, but a large root system of trembling aspens will all go yellow at exactly the same time - a synchronized section of forest. </p></div>		</li>
