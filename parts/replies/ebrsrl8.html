<p>I had no idea this was a side effect of a concussion that lasted long after the injury occurred (a few months).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I defecated in my pants the other day on a construction jobsite. I went from everything being perfectly fine to needing to be in the portapotty - on the other side of the jobsite - three seconds ago. It all happened in an instant. Then I had to drive home forty five minutes. It was really unpleasant. Hope that brightens your day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this happened to me many times and I eventually realized it was because when I had to pee in my sleep, I would find a bathroom in my dream and end up pissing IRL.</p>
<p>Now, if there's a toilet anywhere in a dream, I immediately wake up when I see it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exposure to cold results in 'cold diuresis'. Your body tries to maintain core temperature by shunting blood away from your extremities and in to the core. To keep your blood pressure normal (more blood in less space increases pressure) it increases urine production. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See, I had a theory but didnt know about the body well enough to confirm or deny; I always thought that well, cold things shrink. Your body gets cold and the muscles start to contract, so everything is pressing inwards, thus pressing on your bladder.</p>
<p>Glad to finally have an explanation!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason behind this is because your body has to expend energy to keep urine heated within your body, so when you get cold it purges that to save energy and use it to help try to heat your body instead. </p></div>		</li>
