			<div class="markdown"><p>Also micro services. I was at a conference where their head of infrastructure was speaking and they went heavily in on micro services. Each functionality of Netflix basically has its own service: searching, streaming, rating, etc are all their own service and everything is containerized so a new container just spins up each time a particular service is hit with too much demand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Almost all major web services work this way, including things you may not think of behind the scenes. The oauth server for reddit likely has dozens of nodes all talking to its one database, which ought to be pretty optimized and maybe even have a few read replicas</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and Netflix was one of the first to adopt microservices on a large scale and basically wrote the book on scaling them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would presume they have enough servers to stream a separate copy every 'x' seconds,  and the device used to stream buffers enough of the streamed data to account for small differences in watch time, like if it took you a half second longer to get started Vs your neighbor. If you fall behind from pausing, you'd jump to a stream that's closer to your buffered data.</p>
<p>Hopefully someone that works with streaming will comment,  I've always been curious about the details.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, you're just reading a file off a remote hard drive (ELI5). Once you start the stream, the only reason you'd be switched is if there was some sort of major issue, like the CDN node (cluster of servers) went down, or you fully stopped and restarted the stream.</p>
<p>The files aren't streaming at all times, they're just resting on storage devices, just like a video file that would be sitting on your home computer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They often have storage at your ISPs various locations that storage will keep whateverâ€™s popular and may even keep multiple copies of it to accommodate write times. </p>
<p>Getting that down is a big part of what makes it hard to enter the streaming game.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then this also enters into the whole 'Net Neutrality' debate.</p>
<p>Those on the side of net neutrality, say all data across all ISPs should be delivered equally fast, regardless of what content / provider is being accessed.This is not saying that someone paying for comcast cable access, or starlink, should be equal in terms of speed to high speed FIOs, or other higher cost internet access subscriptions.But rather, that the data should abound by neutral rules to flow through the separately owned hardware networks to reach their destination efficiently.</p>
<p>Netflix, and other conglomerates want to come in and say to the ISPs,&quot;HEY. I can pay you a ton of money if you let us hog more of your data cable connections and fast track our services.&quot;</p>
<p>The upside? Your netflix video plays faster. ISPs profit.</p>
<p>Downside. The internet is further monopolized by conglomerate interests, making it impossible for smaller competitors to offer the same type of services.Additionally, it opens the floodgates for ISPs to throttle and fast track any traffic they want.One step closer towards a dystopian future where the internet is just ads being shoved down our throats.</p>
<p>Do you like using torrents to download (potentially illegal) things?Say goodbye to that in a heartbeat.</p>
<p>Do you like fast gaming pings? Maybe you'll have to pay a premium for those.</p>
<p>You want your favorite news site to load in less than 30 seconds? Time to pay extra.</p>
<p>And down the rabbit hole we go.....</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But Netflix will be fast. So there's that.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>EDIT: Guys.<br />
It's been pointed out to me 100 times now that I'm wrong about Netflix being against net neutrality.</p>
<p>Thanks for pointing this out. I was using them as a hypothetical example, but you all are right.</p>
<p>Comcast and AT&amp;T with HBOMax are the devil.</p></div>		</li>
