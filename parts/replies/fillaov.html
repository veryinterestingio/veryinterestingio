</blockquote>
<p>You'd need at least 90 floors of a building for sewage to reach terminal velocity. And that's if it's dropping down in open air or through the center of the pipe. Water draining down horizontal pipes clings to the walls and swirls around, instead of dropping straight down, so it would take much more distance to reach that speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is incorrect. Foul water will reach terminal velocity after about 3 floors, this is why you have to change the way you design discharge stacks as soon as the building exceeds three storeys. Source - public heath engineer.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Nonsense. There are NO mandated offsets in sanitary or storm water stacks in high rise buildings. NONE. It is NOT a code requirement nor is it a recommendation of the American Society of Plumbing Engineers.</p>
<p>It may happen for various reasons but it is not required. Take a look at <em>High Rise Plumbing Design by Dr. Alfred Steele</em> wherein he talks about the myth of high velocities. Here, I'll quote it for you: <em>&quot;No special provisions are required for tremendous velocities and no special precautions are required to protect the base fitting. Excessive velocities just do not occur!&quot;</em></p>
<p>I have designed literally <strong>dozens</strong> of high rise buildings and never once have I ever made any special provisions to mitigate high velocities. NOT ONCE. Needless to say, I would not have stayed employed past the first one if it was a problem.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: most of the other comments seem to confirm that the top comment is wrong, and the offsets actually occur for other reasons, so I'm going to go with the majority rules here. Apparently building code in my own country (Canada) also agrees that a straight drop is standard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If itâ€™s something like a residential home or light commercial, the master plumber usually knows the code inside and out and can design it properly.  When it comes to something like a high rise building, theyâ€™re just going to install what the design drawings show with minimal changes to the shop drawings to avoid interferences in the field.  Itâ€™s the plumbing engineer who knows what theyâ€™re doing in this instance, not the plumber.</p></div>		</li>
