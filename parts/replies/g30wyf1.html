			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't known about studies, but it probably wouldn't work. The dermis is below the cells we worry about for skin cancer, so it wouldnt block UV exposure to those. Also, a shallower tattoo wouldn't be permanent, so that doesnt work either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite. Phagocytes and Macrophages are types of immune cell that eat up debris. They're the clean up crew basically. They eat up the ink, and then chill in place afterwards, full of ink. Normally they'd break down whatever they've eaten into harmless parts, and dispose of it, but they don't do that with tattoo ink. Perhaps someone else can explain why, as that's beyond me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Macrophages normally destroy extracellular antigen by phagocytosing and destroying with various enzymes. The enzymes don’t have an effect on the ink, trapping the color in the cell. </p>
<p>Upon macrophage death, more dermal macrophages take up the pigment, resulting in tattoo longevity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tatoos are made of water insoluble mineral salts, like oxides, sulfides, sulfates and the like. These are chosen specifically because they can't be broken down by biological metabolism,otherwise they would fade. Bad news is that many of these are also toxic due to some of the metals present in them.</p></div>		</li>
