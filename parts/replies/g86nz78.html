<p>You can extend this with emergency medical care, like putting pressure on the wound or a tourniquet if it’s in a good spot for it, but at most you’ll extend your time to a few minutes. </p>

<p>This is not true. By using and applying a tourniquet kit the right way, they can easily survive for a lot longer (IIRC up to 4-6 hours, then your arm has to be amputated). Just make sure you don't reopen it after 30 minutes or the intoxications built up in your arm (with no blood) can kill you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When cells die of a sudden death they break releasing their inner content. This allows your immune system to  know something's wrong there and find them. </p>
<p>If you block the circulation for a long time the cells die in massive numbers and since you don't have flowing blood the inflammatory contents remain trapped in the tied up arm/leg.</p>
<p>Releasing the tourniquet allows the blood to flow again and the extremely high load of inflammatory particles is released in a short amount of time in your system, triggering an inflammatory response that lowers blood pressure and has a ton of other effects. Having already lost blood the initial pressure isn't high and with the further reduction in blood pressure the patients goes in shock and dies</p>
