			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope! Though they can indeed get very very small. Think of them as containers. When your body uses the contents, it doesn't make any sense to use up the container too. It keeps the container so it has a place to store fat later on if needed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More people need to understand this.</p>
<p>Gaining weight = you gain <em>additional fat cells</em> and they fill up with fat.</p>
<p>Losing weight = your existing fat cells shed triglycerides into your blood stream, but the number of cells stays the same.</p>
<p>So when you run a calorie surplus again, it takes less energy to fill up existing fat cells, than to create new ones.</p>
<p>Which means if you were ever fat, you will put on weight faster and easier than somebody who has always been fit. Which is why people with weight problems in childhood and adolescence struggle with it their whole lives.</p>
<p>Yes, Calories In Calories Out but certain physiological process are actually more energy consuming so knowing <em>exactly</em> what your caloric requirement is a bit fuzzy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is more about the importance of not getting fat in the first place, and for parents to watch their kidsâ€™ weight. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the only way to actually get rid of fat cells is one of the forms of liposuction (though I hear cryolysis works too). Dieting and exercise just cause fat cells to release the stored lipids so they can be used for fuel. Reverting to previous diet and activity levels just causes them to stock up again. </p>
<p>Liposuction physically removes the cells altogether. The downside is that, if you regain weight at all, it will come back in an unsightly, lumpy pattern as the remaining fat cells get even bigger to take up the slack. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow-up then: why would I ever get tired in exercise as long as I have excess fat? The body should have an effectively unlimited reserve to feed me while I work out.</p>
<p>It should be like Elliot Ness's guys axing open those barrels of illegal liquor, just tons more than I can possibly use pouring out.</p>
<p>Edit: Downvoted for a follow up question? Wow, some of you are really petty!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As u/barbarian818 said, physical removal is the only way. </p>
<p>However, if you're ever going to have kids, it's essential that you not let them get fat after toddlerhood. Fat(ish - chubby, actually) babies are good. Fat children are bad, as that's when you develop the habits which turn you into a fat teenager. There's a cut-off point, sometime in late adolescence, where that fat becomes permanently attached to you. You basically have &quot;temporary&quot; fat cells. Until that point, you can get rid of fat relatively easily and be fit for the rest of your life (or at least have the body state where it's comparatively easy to lose weight).   </p>
<p>Want your kids to be lean adults? Exercise them and feed them minimally-processed whole foods (avoid the aisles in the supermarket unless buying ingredients like flour). </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are slim/lean in late adolescence and early 20s (which I guess most people are) and then put on weight when you spend your days sitting at a desk,  do you add new fat cells or just expand those you had in your 20s? </p>
<p>Wish I were asking for a friend.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think I'll just stick to controlling their calorie intake.</p></div>		</li>
