			<div class="markdown"><p>As I've said in another comment, the event horizon isn't a physical barrier, it's just the moment at which the gravitational force is strong enough that photons can no longer escape. You can think of the event horizon as the black hole's shadow.</p>
<p>To get your head around things crossing the event horizon whilst they wouldn't appear to do so to an outside observer, we have to think of time as a personal experience. Your experience of time is unique to you and dependent on how you're moving through space. If it were you who was crossing the event horizon (of a particularly large black hole), your local time would run normally and you'd cross over no problem (apart from the problem of inevitable spaghettification and death). At this point, you're moving incredibly fast relative to an outside observer, which slows down your local time in comparison to theirs. They would see you approach the event horizon, slowing down until you stop entirely on the event horizon and fade away. You however would continue your journey unaware of the difference in time. </p>
<p>Not the best explanation, perhaps someone else can offer something a little more eloquent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand that it isn't a physical barrier. To me it would seem as if time dilation would make it impossible to actually cross the event horizon because the warping of spacetime is so extreme at that point that time stops at that point. I'm having a hard time understanding how something happens to an object when time is stopped. For example, a penrose diagram seems to imply that it is a barrier to me as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to break the idea that time is absolute and can be &quot;Stopped&quot; to all observers. Time is only relative to someone/things frame of reference/observation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it's tricky - I don't pretend to fully understand it but I can just about get my head around it.</p>
<p>Like others have said, it only appears to stop to an outside observer. The gravity is intense, but what that affects is your speed relative to an observer, which in turn affects the speed at which your local time passes. </p>
<p>If I fully understood it I'd be far better at explaining. But hey, I guess that's why I posted the question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Time passes at a constant rate for you - a second feels the same whether you are stationary or moving at the speed of light. It's how other people would observe you. Eg: at sufficient speed, what seems like a second to you would be a year to someone stationary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you’re thinking of is the <em>center</em> point of the black hole — the “singularity.”  That is the point where the infinities happen (theoretically), including time slowing to a virtual halt.  The event horizon is just a demarcation along your journey to the center, and is only actually relevant to observers in the rest of the universe, because that’s the last point at which they will receive any light from you.  The freezing and fading away part is an illusion that they see due to the behavior of light at the horizon.</p></div>		</li>
