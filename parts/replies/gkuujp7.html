They believe that the companies <strong>stock</strong> will be worth more which is determined by the number of people betting the price will go up vs the number of people betting the price will go down.  There is no direct concrete correlation between how well a company does and the value of its stock.  It is all wrapped up in the psychology of the market.  People have come to believe that stock prices will (in general) always go up and so they keep putting more and more money into the market which in turn causes stock prices to rise.  If anything ever occurs to break this self reinforcing cycle the whole thing will come crashing down as very nearly happened at the begining of the covid crisis when the market lost several years of gains in a short period of time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is not true, the correlation is driven by the expectation of future dividends or stock buybacks, both of which can only happen if the company has extra cash lying around. The only way to consistently have a bunch of extra cash is to be a profitable business.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except that right now, GME is worth $150 and nothing has changed except that everyone is pumping money into it. Tesla vastly increased in value despite not providing much more concrete evidence that they will ever make enough revenue to justify those valuations. In theory stock prices are tied to the companies, but reality is much more sticky. Tesla is currently at a P/E of 470, Do people really think that Tesla will 470x their yearly revenue anytime soon?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no *short term* correlation between stock price and company value. It's a popularity contest in the short term.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/755.Benjamin_Graham" target="_blank">Benjamin Graham</a> once said, “In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.”</p></div>		</li>
