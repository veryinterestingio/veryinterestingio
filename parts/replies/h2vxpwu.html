<p>We've found planets like this, and they are around <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/bizarre-planet-largest-known-rocky-world-40-times-as-massive-as-earth#:~:text=The%20roasted%20world%20known%20as,it%20has%20almost%20no%20atmosphere" target="_blank">40x the mass of the Earth</a>.  Thought to be the rocky core of a gas giant that had it's atmosphere stripped away.</p>
<p>Thanks to gravity and compression, 40x the mass doesn't mean 40x the size. As you add mass, you add gravity and that compresses the planet down and makes it denser.  That planet that's 40x the Earth's mass is only 3x it's size.</p></div>		</li>
