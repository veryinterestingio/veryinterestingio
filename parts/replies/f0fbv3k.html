<p>ψ(r) = eikz + ψ<em>s</em>(r)</p>
<p>looks like pure hieroglyphics to me. I mean, I’m not afraid of math, but these quantum guys are apparently solving for cacti.</p>
<p>I really need to start opening a book now and again.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm about to start teaching myself A-Level maths, I just love how the real world can be explained so elegantly sometimes!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Non-relativistic simply means that the interactions are being considered to be at speeds low enough so that Einstein's special relativity doesn't affect the result too much (ie perhaps a good point would be less than 10% the speed of light, though some consider 1% to be a more preferrable threshold). We do this to simplify analysis at times. However, it definitely will affect the results. For example, in modern LINAC radiotherapy beam interactions (the ones used to treat cancer primarily), the energies of electrons can be anywhere from 6MeV to 20MeV. For electrons, this is very much near enough to the speed of light that using the classical (non-relativistic) analysis we would calculate results which are far from accurate to the reality. For obvious reasons, we'd like to be as accurate as possible when calculating the radiation dose delivered to a patient, so we consider relativity relevant during our calculations.</p>
<p>Things that happen at high enough speeds include time-dilation, particles become significantly more massive, interaction cross-sections will vary, etc.</p>

<p>edit: photons are always relativistic, electrons is what I meant.</p></div>		</li>
