			<div class="markdown"><p>Years ago, I was at the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago. We were watching these little monkeys that had a big window on their enclosure. Two little monkeys were sitting next to each other, chittering and doing monkey stuff, up on this tall branch in the corner. This toddler walked right up to the glass and stared at all the monkeys. If I could get their transcript, it would go like this: </p>
<p>“Hey, monkey-buddy, check this out. I’m gonna scare the poo out of that little human kid.”</p>
<p>“Oh? Whatcha gonna do?”</p>
<p>“Watch.”</p>
<p>The monkey runs full speed down the branch, to the ground, right up in front of the kid. Buh-BAM! Slams his monkey hands on the glass right in front of the kid. </p>
<p>Kid: WAHHHHHHHH</p>
<p>The monkey ran back up to his friend. </p>
<p>“Dude! That was awesome! Hahahahaha!”</p>
<p>“I know, right! Gets them every time! Hahahahaha!”</p>
<p>Monkeys. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our zoo has something like this at our Orangutan exhibit. Unfortunately it's a little more then air, but they can dump water on you. They love to wait until an unsuspecting group gathers under the barrel then pull the rope, soaking the visitors. They always erupt in what sounds like the ape equivalent of laughter to me. </p></div>		</li>
