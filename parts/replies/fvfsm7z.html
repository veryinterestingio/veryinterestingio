			<div class="markdown"><p>a 35mm camera has an image size of 24x36mm, while a medium format camera generally will have a much larger image size. My Rolleiflex has a film size of 56x56 mm and a really sharp lens. So with a little care it can make an amazing image. Combine that with a good quality fine grain film and the image quality can be amazing. Mind you it takes a lot more work, which also helps. If everytime you click the shutter it costs you money it means that generally you are much more careful about setting up your shot</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a professional take photos with a large format digital camera. She zoomed in every shot to confirm focus. And she fussed with lighting. And checked focus again. Etc. Beautiful photos... I think is was 80% fussing and 20 % equipment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree about the fussing. It can be irritating sometimes if you're stuck as an observer.</p>
<p>Great equipment will get you slightly better results then fine equipment, but taking time to observe, frame, and balance out a picture (when you can) gets much better results.</p></div>		</li>
