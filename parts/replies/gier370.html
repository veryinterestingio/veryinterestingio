			<div class="markdown"><p>It's definitely the case with smells, where prolonged exposure leads the brain to decrease the reaction to certain smells. The kind of thing you're describing has been observed and described with the delightful German <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestaltzerfall" target="_blank">Gestaltzerfall</a> but apparently only in a few cases of people with specific brain injuries. It seems to be more prevalent with complex symbols like written words for whatever reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does in different forms. Owners of cats or those who know them may understand the term &quot;Nose Blindness&quot; where they don't smell strong odors around them. This doesn't reduce their overall sense of smell and other bad smells are still apparent. Speaking of noses, your eyes don't see your nose though if you think about it you can tell it's there. You don't feel you're tongue in your mouth, nor do you taste it. And when you eat something with sugar, something else sugary tastes less sugary. Regardless of how good you're clothes feel you eventually stop feeling them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Somebody already answered you about how it applies to smells, but it definitely applies to touch as well! When you're sitting still, are you constantly aware of everywhere your clothes are touching your body? No, the repeated input eventually &quot;loses meaning&quot;. </p>
<p>Basically, your senses are constantly collecting more data than your brain can fully process, so the brain <em>must</em> decide what to process and what to ignore. One of the filter rules it uses to do this is &quot;a repeated input that leads to no action when we DO process it = ignore that input&quot;.</p>
<p>I think sight is a specific exception to this phenomenon. The reasons would be 1. Sight is our primary sense and automatically gets a higher processing priority, and 2. Visual input from the eyes is constantly changing as we look around, so it doesn't trigger the &quot;repeared input = ignore&quot; function. When your nose is saying &quot;musty...musty...musty...&quot; or your skin is saying &quot;pants...pants...pants&quot; it gets ignored.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The same thing happens with sounds and smells and tastes. Our brains evolved to detect threats as quickly as possible, so once our brain decides a sound or scent doesn't represent an immediate threat, it tunes this out so that it doesn't block us from becoming aware of something else that could be important. Semantic satiation is just a reflection of this.</p></div>		</li>
