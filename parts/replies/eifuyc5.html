			<div class="markdown"><p>The cleanest deuce I ever dropped was while camping. Dug a hole, squatted, planted the log, and had a ghost wipe. TP was almost cleaner post dump. I assumed the squat helped minimize starfish sauce, but my study is based on the 1 experience. Can anyone confirm whether a squat helps to reduce starfish sauce (maybe a veteran of the Asian squat toilet)?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why do people have such a low opinion of animals and early humans? They're not all mentally disabled without a lick of instinct or deductive capabilities.</p></div>		</li>
