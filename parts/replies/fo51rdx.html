			<div class="markdown"><p>There are plans to utilize “Starshade” technology to filter out light, significantly improving the ability for a telescope the size of Hubble to view exoplanets. </p>

<p>Edit: this is aimed at up to 32 light years. Nowhere near 60Million. Disregard, but still an interesting read, since this is aimed at seeing exoplanets close to stars within the habitable zone!</p>
<p>Edit 2: additional reading </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>we could place several large-ish telescopes in orbit of the sun somewhere, spaced out so they work together to create a telescope as large as the sun, much like the &quot;earth sized&quot; telescope we built to image that black hole.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What more advanced technology gives you is the ability to create a structure big enough successfully.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But the dinosaur looking at that same mirror wouldn't see us.   It would be seeing another dinosaur, or something 66 million years older than him!</p></div>		</li>

<p>One could theoretically look at the state of anything at any point in the past if they could travel quickly enough to a point in space that had a line of sight to the object that was far enough away.</p>

<p>So you are technically time traveler/ing if you had a light speed ship? Could you not travel to a point far enough away that its message could contain a blueprint to light speed travel?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No.  You are traveling back in time if you have faster than light speed ship (which is impossible according to current physics).  At light speed (which matter particles can't reach), you're simply moving as fast as time moves.</p>
<p>It might be possible theoretically to move through warps in space instead to a point far away, to effectively get faster than light travel.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sorry, My question is with a light speed ship.</p>
<p>A is on Earth</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>B is on Alpha Centruia  4.37 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-year" target="_blank">l</a>ight years away</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If B looked at A they would see 4.37 years ago, could B not pass on info about what is current?</p>
<p>Better question is could we send messages faster then light?</p></div>		</li>
