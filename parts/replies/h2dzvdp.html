			<div class="markdown"><p>This is mostly thanks to advancement in technology.</p>
<p>If you &quot;just&quot; use 6 decks and not shuffle until the very end, counting can be awesome.</p>
<p>But now decks are just shuffled by machines in-between a few rounds. Counting becomes useless. Since counting becomes good towards the end of the deck, it is mostly useless nowadays. The end is not really reached anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not even close to standard in casinos.  Most still have 6 or 8 deck shoes that aren't shuffled until the end. The biggest casinos I've been to may have had 2 to 4 tables with continuous shufflers, but they are unpopular among many players.  Not only do people seem to appreciate a short break every 15 to 20 minutes, but they also do like keeping some degree of a track on cards in the deck, whether they're counting or just playing some hands by feel.  Also, continuous shufflers are &quot;rigged&quot; /s</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Continuous shuffle machines aren’t the norm. Also Just because you see a shuffle machine on a table doesn’t even mean it’s a continuous shuffle machine. It’s usually just shuffling one shoe while the other is in play so the house cuts out the time in between shoes</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What are tricks to actually count cards?</p>
<p>I assume it really is just more luck because the odds inherently favor the house and counting just makes it easier to lose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There isn't really a trick. You just need to watch every card that comes out of the shoe. You assign a value to each card and that way by a certain point in the shoe you can tell if the shoe is more to your advantage or the dealers advantage. Or neutral. If it's neutral you just play like normal. Dealer advantage you keep bets minimum. And you make your money when you have advantage </p>
<p>Theoretically anyway</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Counting cards&quot; is just counting the ratio of high vs low cards. Playing perfect basic strategy and counting perfectly still only gives you an approximate 55% chance of winning. In the long run, card counting will help you win, but without putting in the hours and having the discipline to follow through, you WILL NOT make money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically you just remember how many cards and what type has it been played. For example imagine if we are playing with only 1 deck, you are dealt a 9 and a 5, and the dealer shows 8. </p>
<p>For you not to bust you need a card that has a value no higher than a seven, which means 28 cards in the deck won't lose you the hand. 28 good cards out of 48 remaining cards in the deck is decent odds of success.</p>
<p>Now the math for the dealer is a little different because the dealer has different rules. Dealers can only stand on 17 or higher so we have multiple considerations. 20/49 cards the dealer stands with a total of 17 or 18. After that the math begins to get a little more complicated when trying to determine what the odds of the dealer having a particular number after having to take a third card but you get the point.</p>
<p>Making decisions when you use a card counting system are simply comparing the odds of the good versus the bad results for the next particular card, and you get the information from the previous cards played by not only you and the dealer but also by everyone else at the table. The card counting systems themselves are simply shortcuts to help you quickly make decisions and to make the information easier to remember.</p>
<p>Mathematically if you play a game of blackjack perfectly and there is no table ante it's one of the few games where you basically have the exact same odds as the casino, card counting systems can actually tip the odds in favor of the player which is why casinos frown upon them and actively designed procedures to prevent them from being actually useful long-term. Whether or not an experienced blackjack player following a decent strategy wins or loses money basically relies on when they place bigger versus smaller bets</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. Casinos take active steps against people counting cards in blackjack, back in the day if you were decent at counting you could easily go low early and then get absurd returns later in the deck. Now it's basically shuffled each (every few?) round so you can't do it as well.</p></div>		</li>
