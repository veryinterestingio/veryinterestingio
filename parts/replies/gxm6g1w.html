			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to back up a bit, and say the question in some ways is dangerous. The above answer, and a ton of the top answers really, are more accurately describing psychosis, which Schizophrenia often causes, but it isn't what Schizophrenia IS (A lot of other things cause psychosis, Schizophrenia does not even technically require psychosis, and you are not supposed to diagnose someone with Schizophrenia if they ONLY have hallucinations or delusions).</p>
<p>By asking for a simplification, you almost requires people to omit really key parts of the illness. Since it's an illness with a ton of stigmas, fallacies, rumours, misunderstandings, etc around it, trying to boil it down actually enhances those problems when people think about it, rather than putting out information to try to remove them.</p>
<p>There is no accepted diagnostic test for schizophrenia. It is diagnosed based on symptoms, history, ruling out other causes, and a kind of &quot;you'll know it when you see it&quot; attitude.</p>
<p>A ton of other things can co-exist, or outright cause some or all of the symptoms (depression, drug use, auto-immune responses, PTSD/stress coping, etc).</p>
<p>Schizophrenia usually negatively affects a wide range of mental outputs, such as speech, problem solving, emotional intelligence, flattened affect and mood, planning, motor skills, motivation, ability to do basic math/logic, concentration, etc. </p>
<p>Often that is a way bigger, and earlier, flag than the psychosis</p>
<p>For example, I had a friend who started smoking weed (very common 'trigger'). They slowly became, for lack of a better word, stupid. Over a few years, they stopped being able to solve problems, they failed classes, they stopped making sense. Their speech became odd, they'd string together a bunch of sentences but it was like a chatbot autogenerated them. It went from thinking they were high all the time, to realizing it had triggered something very very abnormal. It is also worth saying that as the symptoms became worse, they became a truly different person, and although they've done really well with the illness, it woke me up to the idea that personality, the 'self', etc are just configurations of the brain that can disappear without a person dying. </p>
<p>It took a few years for them to manifest some paranoia symptoms, but they were already diagnosed by then without any hallucinations or delusions, because their other symptoms, speech changes, and family history made it very clear what was happening.</p>
<p>The psychosis is usually and often successfully treated with antipsychosis drugs. But the person usually still has a host of other symptoms and issues that they need therapy, work, and support to manage and eliminate.</p>
<p>Whenever you start to equate psychosis and schizophrenia, you miss a lot of the struggles and profile of the illness.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Itâ€™s something really hard to reconcile to whatever notion you may have of a &quot;true self&quot; / soul/ whatever, and understanding it conceptually does not really prepare you to the reality of it...</p></div>		</li>
