			<div class="markdown"><p>I think artificial objects can be a wonderful way to start. Many life-forms in the ocean actually cling to and build off metals and concrete. Tires are made of rubber and not all artificial reefs are the same. marine life doesn't seem to cling-to the rubber the same way, plus they can be corrosive and toxic.

<p>Tabitha is right! Most marine life likes to attach to substances that are made of certain things and give off certain chemical cues, and rubber is not one of those things! They tend to like structures like concrete that resemble a rock-like texture. Many marine organisms really like objects that have crevices and grooves for them to hide in as well, so a textured surface can help. In general, objects that are toxic would not be allowed and would not receive a permit to be able to be placed in the ocean.</p>
