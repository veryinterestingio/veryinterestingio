			<div class="markdown"><p>There are usually limits on how much of a good you can bring without having to declare it or rather without having to pay taxes on on import. So it isn't illegal. But if you get checked and you lied/broke the rules you have to pay at best or be slapped with a fine at worst.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but I would assume that only happens if what you are trying to import is illegal or you can't pay the tax/fine. I saw a documentation about that a long time ago and the stuff people try to import is ridiculous. Rare animal leather belts will get you in all kinds of trouble, if these animals are on the list of protected species. You are importing an illegal good. That gets confiscated for sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know someone caught importing without declaring high end womenâ€™s shoes. They left the shoes in the box with the receipt (idiot, I know). They were told their luggage would be searched everything they entered the country for the next five years. At least it keeps you honest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its pretty easy to dodge the customs duties tbh. Last time I was in Paris my &quot;friend&quot; bought a few Gucci items and a Rolex because of the VAT refund (basically tax-free) and it was way over the import limits to the USA. He just put the watch on his wrist and wore the Gucci and played it off like he hadn't purchased it and nobody said anything. The only time you will have issues is if you've got like multiple OBVIOUS purchases located in your checked bags or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that's it, and it's not even personal use imports they're really focused on anyway.  Like you said unless you've got multiple items like sealed with the receipt they won't know whether you're importing it or bought it in your own city.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Luxury watch brands regularly adjust prices to deal with currency fluctuations. If people could save a significant amount by buying in a foreign country they would just call up dealers in that country and have the watch shipped.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, paid 7% tax on my Rolex in CA last year. Nearly $800 in taxes. I always check international Rolex boutiques in airports. You never know if youâ€™re going to get lucky with a hard to find model. (Hint: you almost never will. Iâ€™m batting .000 internationally).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably within the hour it gets put out. ðŸ˜‚ </p>
<p>I still check every time. Maybe you get there in that hour. </p>
<p>I walked into a retailer and walked out with a BLRO GMTII. It wasnâ€™t in the case but after some chatting it magically appeared from the back. </p>
<p>Thatâ€™s like THE unicorn in the Rolex world right now.</p></div>		</li>
