			<div class="markdown"><p>The way you wrote it except without the period (in the USA). But if the question mark isn’t part of her statement then it changes. </p>
<p>Did the little old lady say “here’s the beef”?</p>
<p>You need a period only if you don’t have other punctuation closing the sentence. </p>
<p>The little old lady asked “where’s the beef?” during our conversation yesterday.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What happens if the lady asked &quot;Where's the beef?&quot; but then the sentence continues?<br />
Based on your idea that the punctuation within the quotes has authority outside the quotes then my above sentence was cut short by quoting the lady.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question mark is a must so period has to go. And the whole sentence is not a question but the quote is one, so the best is ?”</p>
<p>Still there is no perfect or right answer to this, just preference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but there's a difference between...</p>
<p>&quot;Hello World.&quot;</p>
<p>...and...</p>
<p>He said, &quot;Hello World&quot;.</p>
<p>It makes more sense to only put the period in the quotation marks if the entire sentence is quoted.</p></div>		</li>
