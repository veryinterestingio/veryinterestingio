			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, exactly! You said it all -- except that <a href="https://www.liletta.com/" target="_blank">Liletta</a> (a lower cost version of the Mirena IUC) has been nipping at Mirena's heels for years. Liletta was approved for 6 years last year and, surprise surprise, Mirena quickly followed suit and <a href="https://www.mirena-us.com/" target="_blank">Mirena is now FDA approved for 6 years</a>.</p>
<p>This is one of many examples of contraceptives under promising and over performing. Other examples include the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5088635/" target="_blank">Nexplanon implant lasting for at least 4-5 years</a> (FDA approved for 3) and <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2991648?seq=1" target="_blank">Depo Provera lasting up to 16 weeks</a>, but we tell folks to come back 11-13 weeks. </p>
<p>It makes sense that the FDA approved package statements would be conservative as pregnancy prevention is pretty high stakes. After a product comes to market, independent organizations can do further testing to challenge the stated assertions, and often find that the methods out-perform their stated claims. Then reputable, evidence-based organizations like Planned Parenthood bring those changes to clinical practice -- while hopefully explaining why what they're recommending is different than what it says on the box. </p>
<p>I'm so happy this whole question was asked because I first heard about the 2-day NuvaRing thing when I started a job at a sexual and reproductive health center and was afraid it was a typo. I asked up the ladder for their source and eventually got it. Here is the link to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/rr/rr6504a1.htm#combinedhormonalcontraceptives" target="_blank">CDC page explaining the rationale</a> for the NuvaRing being out (and patch being off) for up to 48 hours. The specific section to search for is &quot;Late or Missed Doses and Side Effects from Combined Hormonal Contraceptive Use.&quot;</p>
<p>Lastly to actually answer the original question about NuvaRing and Annovera, it's possible that studies will show Annovera has more wiggle room than we thought, but we haven't had the time to do the studies yet. And Annovera uses a different progesterone than the NuvaRing, so it's possible there are differences in performance. For now, we're in that do-what-the-FDA-says-until-we-have-good-evidence-to-do-otherwise phase.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, legal reasons. Better to under-promise and over-deliver than the opposite! False advertising laws n such. It's one reason a &quot;baker's dozen&quot; equals 13, better to give the customer an extra item, than get in trouble if one of the other 12 is too small or otherwise &quot;damaged.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This answer is undervalued. Comparing company literature with health center adivice is apples and oranges.
The company literature has to do with licensing, FDA approval, and potential lawsuits.
Planned Parenthood and the UC Berkeley student health center is more focused on making sure underserved communities recieve practical and affordable reproductive healthcare.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Its likely that the PP / UC recommendations are based on follow up trials or real world evidence, while manufacturers language is purely to reduce liability</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is not exactly what I said. PP/ UC comments could be based on a guess with no proof, anecdotal or otherwise. But PP/UC statements are not held to the same level of scrutiny as the manufacturer statements. If a future clinical trial showed an off label usage of the drug existed, the manufacturer could make those statements, too. This implies that PP/UC are not using additional follow up clinical trials to make these statements.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Any statement a drug manufacturer makes must be proven true, that's the law. It isn't just about simple civil liability, it is about criminal fraud. A physician or medical facility, such as PP or UC, can make statements based on just a good guess. As long as the guess is good enough, they are usually covered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the answer. </p>
<p>Product wesbsites are tightly FDA regulated. Them writing stuff similar to PP would be considered “off-label promotion” and would attract a fine. For the manufacturer to promote with the more liberal use, they would need to go collect more data and actually prove it works the same. From the manufacturer’s perspective, they need to judge the cost of the clinical trial vs the extra sales they anticipate if they expand the label, if any. </p>
<p>Academics and advocacy institutions of course don’t need to conduct millions of dollars of clinical outcomes trials, they can judge based on evidence already available</p></div>		</li>
