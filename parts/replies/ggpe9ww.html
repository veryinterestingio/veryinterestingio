			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it does that in the context of halitosis, but not a great deal else. It also struggles to explain how kissing persisted until the age of halitosis, bearing in mind that the primary cause of bad breath is sugar and sugar was very hard to get prior to quite recently (it's why our teeth are quite as vulnerable as they are - evolution never had to deal with sugar).</p>
<p>Also, crucially, you don't actually need to <em>kiss</em> someone to smell their breath. So if this was all there was too it, we'd probably have evolved to instinctively smell each other's breath, not lick each other's diseases. And I cannot stress enough how <em>dumb</em> it is to mix someone's saliva with yours to check if their saliva has disease in it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The primary modern cause? Because virtually every society that lived in coastal regions from antiquity to classical times, from the Mediterranean and Black seas to India and east/ southeast Asia consumed fermented fish juices with many meals. Where they'd practice stuffing fish into sealed jars and letting them bake in the sun for several months before opening them up to consume the fluids inside at a romantic meal or special occasion.</p>
<p>No one's breath is smelling good after that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Re: learned behavior and the 3500BC date. Did pre-columbian Americans kiss? If so, it's either parallel development (and an odd parallel at that), or it's MUCH older than that.
Edit: fast google search suggests that they did not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No idea, but there's basically only two options here anyway. Either it appeared as a cultural asset in many different civilisations independently, in which case native Americans could absolutely have invented it themselves (or not done, or done it multiple times), or it appeared as a cultural asset before the early migrations, as the fact almost all cultures today do it suggests that it appeared in the common ancestor of all civilisations, which is well, well before agriculture or recorded history.</p></div>		</li>
