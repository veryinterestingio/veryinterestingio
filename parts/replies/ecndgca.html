			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the only place I put sunscreen on! I was out in the Nevada desert 3 years ago with a fresh shaved head driving in a rental mustang convertible. My whole head turned into a blister. 5 days later the whole cap came off in the shower. Now it hurts to be in the sun year round. I use 110spf. I know anything over 60 is overkill but I really don't want skin cancer on my dome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are not the same thing, look it up.  Exhaustion leads to stroke, stroke is much more rare and much more serious.  The difference is one where you're body is having trouble keeping your core temp and the other is starting to kill you / cause serious permanent damage because it's too hot.  You're not getting mild organ failure or brain damage with exhaustion.   </p></div>		</li>
