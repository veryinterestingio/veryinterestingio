			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked as a temp in a high precision bearing factory one summer and learned that precision ball bearings are critical parts for gyroscopes such as those used in the advanced bombsights of WWII</p>
<p>In the lobby of the factory was a picture from WWII taken through the bombsight of an American bomber during a raid on German industrial facilities. </p>
<p>The picture was that of a German ball bearing plant being bombed. It was already on fire and you could see more bombs already on the way.</p>
<p>Sometime after America bombed that factory to rubble the war ended and that same German ball bearing company rebuilt and  thrived. They got big enough to acquire competitors and eventually acquired the same American ball bearing company that had once been instrumental in blowing them up back in the day.</p>
<p>So, I guess with all that Freedoming the Germans also learned the power of capitalism. </p>
<p>That long game tho, lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Based on what I’ve learned about ww2, civilian cities on both sides were frequent targets. Once Germany hit London with an air raid, all the cards were on the table and Berlin was the first of many air raids on different civilian cities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But also bear in mind the technological limitations. To successfully hit one target, you needed dozens of planes. Carpet bombing was necessary because they didn't have the precision needed to successfully destroy buildings one at a time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Accidentally* hit London with one air raid, then Britain deliberately hit Berlin with three air raids in quick succession, then all gloves were off and Germany switched to extensive targeting of cities. The allies of course did not believe the initial air raid was accidental, but regardless they escalated things, followed by Germany escalating things further.</p></div>		</li>
