			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add because I didn't see you mention it; the brain is flushed with cerebrospinal fluid during sleep to flush out the toxins created as a byproduct of daily brain function. Due to blood brain barrier, the brain is not entirely unlike a car running in a non-ventilated garage; that fuzzy-headed tired feeling is your brain full of 'exhaust'. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gonna add to this: one of the specific &quot;brain washing&quot; targets is a neurochemical called adenosine, which builds up in your central nervous system as you go about your day awake and burning energy. Adenosine has an inhibitory effect, essentially meaning that the logger you're awake, the more adenosine builds up and the more tired you feel. When you sleep, both due to your decreased energy usage and the &quot;brain washing&quot;, the buildup of adenosine is slowly eliminated and you wake up with a somewhat fresh CNS. </p>
<p>Interestingly, that's part of how caffeine works! It blocks adenosine receptors, keeping you from feeling the effects for a while. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for chiming in with awesome additional info! I was googling around last night to see if any research had been done into initiating csf flushing, but couldn't find anything, so this points me in the right direction.</p>
<p>Blocking adenosine is all well and good but it's like putting ibuprofen cream on a broken finger. Is adenosine a toxic byproduct, or an inhibitor maybe? Can we remove it from the body safely? Hmmmm. This is one of the more interesting eli5s I've seen, many questions raised. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting and a good way to think about it. New meaning to mentally exhausted </p>
<p>How quickly does the fluid come and go? Does it add to the groggyness felt in the morning? </p>
<p>Is getting less than 7 or 8 hours sleep mean that there are still toxins in the brain. Say getting five hours for a few days in a row would expect to find higher levels of toxicity </p></div>		</li>

<p>Damn it, I missed a solid pun opportunity there!</p>
<p>I'm not sure re how quickly the fluid comes and goes. I really hope someone is working on this! Regarding getting five hours for a few days, I'd not be surprised if it turns out some people have a more effective CSF-flushing system than others. I used to date a woman who got by happily on 3-4 hours sleep a night; whereas I would be a murderous ball of rage after a few days with that little sleep.</p>
<p>I know 'sleep debt' is a real thing, from my own experience. Probably like you say about it not being long enough to fully flush the brain so you end up having to put the sleep hours in eventually.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was another post a few months back relating to this. There has been a lot of studies linking early onset Alzheimer's or dementia related conditions, to prolonged sleep deprivation. Although studies of this nature are rarely causation/root studies, they suggest that prolonged deprivation may lead to increased levels of misfolded proteins within the brain (c.a. The fluid flushing ). So once again, sleep is really, really great 👍</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your two cents seems more like worth two grand, easily-but, seriously, thank you much for going through the trouble to post this.</p>
<p>Now my own heavy contribution, submitted for your approval:</p>
<p>I've been recording my dreams for over 23 years. The hypothetical scenario the brain displays to us, may play into what I like to call the &quot;12:13 theory&quot; (seemed whenever I was pondering it, I would look at the clock and see that the time was 12:13). </p>
<p><strong>IF</strong> there is a possibility-even with the slightest metaphysical hint of clairvoyance or ability to perceive time in a way we are not normally and consciously aware of perceiving it (the way Vonnegut in &quot;Slaughterhouse Five&quot; or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Experiment_with_Time" target="_blank">J.W. Dunne</a> explained the perception of time)-that the subconscious mind can calculate, produce, and elaborate a mock up of &quot;what if&quot; concocting a great degree of detail, <strong>THEN</strong> isn't that dabbling into the insight of an &quot;alternate reality&quot;? Something that skims close to the fancy of the Rick &amp; Morty realm, yes, but it was something brought up in the beginning of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-9l7K7LftQ" target="_blank">Linklater's &quot;Slacker&quot;</a>.</p>
<p>I do also believe the mind is unraveling past dilemmas or overlooked loose ends, while ironing out resolutions to conflicts. Even if the conscious mind hasn't caught up and acknowledged those said conclusions, those things will stay poised in the subconscious (like a carbonated bubble hugging the side of a glass of soda pop) until it jogs loose and surfaces.</p>
<p>The philosophical problem with desires (money, lust, prestige, even just the &quot;illusion of security&quot;) is that we always conceive something stands in the way of our desires. That creates fear. The fear creates dis-ease and anger. The anger blinds us with ignorance and makes us clouded in our perceptions and our decisions bringing on more fear which brings on anger etc. etc. spiraling ever further in a destructive implosion-BUT the launching point into that destructive spiral is usually desire. From what I gathered from a few Taoist-leaning works I've read, if one minimizes the desires in your life, and there will be less fear and stress to complicate matters.</p>
<p>Thus fear and desire play hand in hand with what many once commonly referred to as the ID. As one chain-smoking sage once called that &quot;zone&quot; that which &quot;lies between the pit of man's fears and the summit of his knowledge.&quot; (if one equates the assurance and power one feels from being informed, then yes, add knowledge as a desire). Both can be terribly juxtaposed into a wild translation of events and imagery in the mind.</p>
<p>On a personal note with nightmares as it applies to Bio-chemical reductionism. I suffered nightmares for a very long time. It wasn't until I started maintaining my blood-sugar (the way a hypoglycemic person should) and engaging in deep breathing exercises (thank you, Paul Sorvino for writing that book), that I encountered less and less incidents of waking up in the middle of the night with sweats, trembling, hand clammy, and thoroughly racked with terror and a haunting from the horrible dreams I awoke from that would ruin the rest of my day. Also, problems with asthma have almost completely disappeared (been 12 years since the last asthma attack-which involved heavy canine dander- and six years before that-but only because I ate a popular brand of yogurt that used crushed-up red insects as a dying agent. This coming from someone who would miss close to three weeks cumulative of school every winter from illnesses.).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was on a jury for a first degree murder trial. Lesser charges were also included. We deliberated until 10pm the first day we were sequestered. We were greatly divided on the first degree murder charge. I was on the guilty side and I absolutely knew it but I couldn't convince the others. We were sent to a hotel for the night where they took all the radios, tv, and phones out of the rooms. That night all I dreamt about was the trial. I woke up in the middle of the night with the answer. The next morning were we brought back to our deliberation room. There was a big white board on the wall. I drew a timeline on it of all the things he did and when he did them. It was the thing I dreamt about. Right away everyone saw things like I did and within a half hour we all agreed that he was guilty. The foreman originally was told that she was going to have to read the verdict but when the guilty on all charges was shown to her, she read it instead of the foreman. What happened next was one of the strangest things to me. We were sent back to the deliberation room and told that the judge wanted to talk to us. We waited not saying anything. When she came in she sat at the head of the table and excitedly asked what made us vote guilty. We showed her the timeline and told her the one thing he said when he confessed. The defense argued that the gun went off accidentally when he pulled it out of his pocket. However, he was in the national guard and had gone through boot camp and the trigger needed an above average amount of pressure to be fired. In the video of his confession he tells the cop that he pulled the gun out then he said, &quot;I shot&quot;. </p></div>		</li>
