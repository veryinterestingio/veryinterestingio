			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes this ^ but also be careful because there’s a lot of fad diets and “diet pills” for sale that will promise to reset leptin, when in reality eating regular portion sizes, at regular intervals, with unprocessed food will eventually do the job, as well as reducing the risk of a large number of other illnesses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it can do - people often find this uncomfortable because for a long while you’ll feel perpetually hungry, and depending on how much you eat before hand sometimes this can be to the point of nausea. Other things that can help kick the hormones back into gear is regular exercise (nothing extreme, even just walking round the block is helpful), and eating less processed foods, because generally they’re more nutrient-rich.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  and pretty quickly.</p>
<p>Source:  The Insanity workout program comes with a healthy eating guide that recommends five meals a day.</p>
<p>Breakfast, 3 hours, Lunch, 3 hours, Afternoon, 3 hours, Dinner, 3 hours, After Dinner</p>
<p>each of those meals would be around 300 to 400 calories.  You learn pretty quick how to balance quantity versus quality.  </p>
<p>Right around the time you are getting pretty hungry.  Ping, time to eat.  Getting that last meal in after dinner was always pretty difficult for me and I usually resorted to a protein shake to force it down.</p>
<p>Within a week, I could barely finish a regular sized plate of food before my body was SCREAMING that it was full.</p>
<p>The catch is that once you stop that routine, your body goes back to &quot;I'll eat what I want, when I want, thank you much&quot;, pretty damn fast.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Unfortunately if there is a history of over-eating this feedback loop is redundant because you have essentially over-ridden it.</p>

<p>Does it come back?  I weigh 180 Lbs now, but 4ish years ago I was closer to 400.   I still don't ever get that &quot;full&quot; feeling,  I actually had forgotten about it until reading your post.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it’s possible for it to come back. However there’s no set guideline for <em>when</em> it will come back, but as you become more active, lose excess weight, and eat smaller meals at regular intervals, it will slowly start to return. Obviously I don’t know any of your individual circumstances, you could eat small meals already and your resistance is just taking a little longer to fix itself. You could exercise all the time already and again it just takes a while to return. I think the key is to just keep powering through and be as healthy as possible, and hopefully eventually you’ll get it again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand you might not have the answer to this, but does it also happen when you actively choose to ignore the hunger hormone?</p>
<p>When I was anorexic I stopped being hungry after ignoring my stomach for so long (around 4 years). During recovery we were told to eat when we felt hungry, but as I never did and didn't want to risk sectioned, I just started eating when everyone else did and the same amount that they ate. I also started exercising more regularly since I had the energy.</p>
<p>Long story short, I became overweight and started dieting at the advice of doctors (which I think I'm doing in a healthy way) but the feeling of hunger never returned. The only way I know that my body is hungry is when I faint because my blood sugar drops too low. This is 6 years after recovery.</p>
<p>It'd be nice to have that feeling back, but also just understand the science of it a bit more. No worries if you aren't sure though!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know why your answer isn't higher up. But this is actually the most correct response. There is some evolutionary biology associated with it like the top comment but this negates the evolutionary biology and just looked at a single human which is the most important thing to look at.</p>
<p>I came here to give this response if it wasnt here since this is something I can actually answer.</p></div>		</li>
