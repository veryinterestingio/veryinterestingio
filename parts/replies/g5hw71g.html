<p>The eardrum is a thin layer of tissue that is moved by the variation in air pressure that is “sound”. In order for the eardrum to function under variable conditions (at sea level, the top of a mountain, during good and bad weather) there needs to be a way to equalize the pressure of the space inside your eardrum with the ambient environmental pressure. The structure that does that is the Eustachian tube. The “pop” is the pressure being equalized by the Eustachian tube and your eardrum moving back to a neutral position where it is not being push in or out by a pressure differential. This can be related to congestion because the opening of the Eustachian tube can become occluded when a person has copious secretions, throwing off the normal pressure equalization that occurs when you chew, yawn, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! I always feel awkward typing out an explanation without getting to interact and ask “does this make any sense”.  I hope your day has gone well, stay safe out there!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No hurt feels here homie... I thought I had enough of an understanding to educate others, but uhh obviously I came up short by never mentioning the “tubes” - which came to mind in typing my reply from previous research on ears/sinuses etc.... but not being a medical wiz I figured I could get my point across without including the tubes... in that this component of the ear is responsible for the feeling of pressure lol.</p>
<p>So without further ado I’d like to thank you for the educational lesson😜</p></div>		</li>
