			<div class="markdown"><p>Stars will stop forming at around 100 trillion years into the universe. If we scale that down to 100 years, the current universe is on January 5th of the first year, at around 2:30 am. If I am doing my math right humans showed up on earth about 6 seconds ago on this scale</p></div>		</li>

<p>A billion is a lot, but it took IIRC 4 billion from the formation of Earth to now. 80% of Earth's lifespan is already done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unrelated but, this has been put forward as a possible explanation for Fermi's Paradox. The fact that compared to what will likely be the complete span of the universe's active lifespan we, as humans, are so early to the scene may mean we're one of maybe only the first few fractions of a percent of the total sentient lifeforms that will exist throughout time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It gets even weirder when you consider special relativity. There's <em>no totally valid way</em> to define &quot;now&quot; across different locations, because the same events can happen in a different order in two different frames of reference (by their particular definitions of time).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tbh its not fast by almost any measure. Nerve signals cap out at about 200 mph. This means the latency is in actual miliseconds from your eyes to your brain, a time gap you can actually percieve in external objects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s closer to 3.6 Billion light years away. But there’s also a former quasar, IC 2497, which is only 740 million ly away, and shut down 70,000 years ago. The nearest active quasar is 3C 273, which is about 2.4 billion ly away.</p></div>		</li>
