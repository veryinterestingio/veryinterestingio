			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the stress hormone. It's pretty much constantly at 100%. Everything in life gives me stress at this point.  Doesn't even matter what time I go to bed. Pretty much guaranteed I won't fall sleep for 2-3 hours at earliest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I eat extremely healthy high protein diet,  and I workout 3-4 days a week,  and I'm at a very lean weight. I try to do everything to take care of myself as I want to be around as long as possible,  but thank you for your suggestion. I come from a long line of stress filled people,  and I'm no different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be clear it isn't only adrenaline. Cortisol, a stress steroid is also involved in the fight or flight responses. Additionally, at 24 hrs, your body has a natural &quot;it's time to wake up&quot; response involving the production of other steroids which make you feel awake and the cessation of natural production of melatonin.</p></div>		</li>
