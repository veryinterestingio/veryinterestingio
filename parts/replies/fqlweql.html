Also consider that it's a <em>good</em> thing to be in that &quot;self cleaning&quot; zone where debris deorbits relatively quickly, it means less chance of impacts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What counts is mass compared to cross sectional area. A massive but compact satellite would experience less orbital decay than a light and bulky one. Although the ISS is massive it also has big solar arrays and radiators which cause a lot of drag. In fact the ISS controls its drag by adjusting the orientation of its solar panels, for example &quot;night glider&quot; mode puts the panels edge-on at night to reduce drag. During the space shuttle program the ISS was allowed to decay into a lower orbit before a shuttle visited it so the shuttle could reach the station with more cargo. Since the shuttle has retired, the ISS is now generally maintained in a higher orbit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wait, so you're telling me the ISS has actually actively shifted it's orbital height over the years of it's existence?</p>
<p>That's... kinda cool.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Years ago I had the opportunity to visit the Naval research labs near Washington DC. While working there, they took me on a bit of an unofficial your of their facilities, including the satellite lab where midshipmen build small satellites, under the supervision of Bob Bruninga (WB4APR).</p>
<p>Sitting in the corner was a bronze sphere, about 14 or 18 inches in diameter. I was told that this was a satellite designed to study the upper atmosphere. It w as basically the sphere, filled with batteries and a radio transmitter, and would have been launched into low orbit. Due to its high density (what work being filled with batteries), it would have stayed up relatively long, and to measure the density of the atmosphere, they'd just measure is variation in orbit.</p>
<p>Anyhow, after building it, someone did some additional calculations and realized that it would also likely survive reentry intact, leading to a 60lb item hitting the ground at terminal velocity. So they built a mkII version with plastic seems on it so it would break up as it reentered and burn up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No! The formula to escape gravity doesn't use mass.  That's why on roller coasters everyone can feel weightless on the loops.</p>
<p>When you work it out it seems obvious, but it doesn't seem that way otherwise. Blew my mind in class.</p>
<p>Edit: to add, the moon and a satellite would go to the same speed to stay in the same orbit of the earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mass doesn't matter for the orbit dynamics in terms of geopotential or third body but it affects the acceleration experienced from drag, solar pressure, albedo, and heat radiation coming off the station. Cross section also matters for drag and radiation forces. The latter are also affected by the surface properties.</p></div>		</li>
