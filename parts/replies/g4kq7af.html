<p>in Denver, Colorado, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/t3bQLr3.png" target="_blank">the temperature dropped from 93˚F (34˚C) to 33˚F (1˚C) in less than a day</a>. </p>

<p>I am curious, I can find the temperature, wind direction and barometric pressure, but what are the rest of the columns?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't there also a distinction, often lost in the media, between gusts and sustained winds? The strength of tornados and most damaging straight line wind events are typically determined by 3 second average wind speed. While hurricane wind speed is averaged over 1 minute (in the US), with higher gusts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a distinction that I didnt think to touch on in my top level answer, but you are correct:  hurricanes are measured by their highest 1-minute average winds, while wind &quot;gusts&quot; (3-second average) are typically what is quoted in storm reports, such as in this case. The highest sustained wind, <a href="https://www.fox13now.com/weather/utah-experienced-a-hurricane-kind-of" target="_blank">from what I can tell from news reports</a>, did not actually reach hurricane strength (and the highest gust, 99 mph, would still only be category 2 strength if it were sustained).</p></div>		</li>
