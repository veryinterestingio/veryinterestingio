<p>Why canines bare teeth with jaw closed as a threatening gesture, I don't know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With the canines it can have something to do with clenching the jaw. Same goes for humans when we're pissed or tense. It's usually when we're trying to be discrete though so it's likely why we rarely pair it with the teeth.</p>
<p>Just speculations.</p></div>		</li>

<p>An interesting observation someone brought to my attention one time was the differences in emojis between eastern and western peoples. Western emojis usually emote the mouth but the eyes stay the same:
=)</p>
<p>=D</p>
<p>D=</p>
<p>=/</p>
<p>=X</p>
<p>=O</p>
<p>=P</p>
<p>But eastern emojis tended to emote the eyes:</p>
<p>;_;</p>
<p>T_T</p>
<p>&lt;_&lt;</p>
<p>x_X</p>
<p>O_O</p>
<p>It's not 100% and by now a lot of the emojis have cross pollinated thanks to the internet, but if you look back at early 2000's Eastern emoji usage, theirs rarely looked like ours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That‚Äôs partly because of pop art. Western text faces were correlated with the yellow smiley face icon üôÇ that was popularized in the 70s. Early image emoji on forums and in messenger apps were even called ‚Äúsmileys.‚Äù Japanese Kaomoji, on the other hand, resemble the faces seen on super-deformed/‚Äúchibi‚Äù cartoons in manga. Also. making faces out of letters is already a popular pastime among Japanese kids ‚Äî look up henohenomoheji for a famous one ‚Äî so the leap to text is no surprise.</p></div>		</li>
