<p>For clear visualiation, he's essentially asking how these types of minerals and metals form, gold in particular. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/kkbIo31" target="_blank">https://imgur.com/a/kkbIo31</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As the universe cooled after the big bang the base particles of matter were able to condense into elements, but only certain elements could form this way. Those elements are mostly hydrogen and small amounts of helium. As time went by these massive clouds of hydrogen collapsed into galaxies, and inside these galaxies pockets collapsed even further into stars. Stars fuse hydrogen into helium. As these stars grow larger they fuse helium into carbon, and so on until they begin to fuse iron. Once a star fuses iron, the energy release of fusion at the core can no longer hold back the force of gravity and the star collapses into a neutron star or a black hole depending on the origin mass of the star. Resulting in a super nova. The explosive power of the super nova create every other element we know of. Neutron stars can also collide with other normal stars and other neutron stars to trigger additional super nova that also create elements heavier than iron. So our solar system is likely a &quot;3rd generation&quot; because in order for it to contain the elements it has, many stars from all over the galaxy had to form, and explode and then condense again into our planets and sun.</p>
<p>Recently we've discovered that gold is more commonly created in neutron star collisions. So OP is asking how earth came to contain gold if other stars first had to form, then die, and their super dense neutron cores had to collide to create the gold, then collapse into our solar system and be brought to the surface of the planet by tectonic movement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Different types of super nova produce different elements. Gravitational waves recently informed scientists on the location of a neutron star collision, when when they pointed telescopes at the area they saw that there was a major abundance of gold being detected. Traditional super novas from a star collapsing into a black hole showed abundance of different elements. From what I understand is that in order for our solar system to contain the elements that we've observed, at least 2 stars other then our sun must have gone super nova in some way to produce those elements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think OP is actually asking how those massively different sourced gold particles ended up conglomerating in the Earth's crust. What attracted the gold into ore veins instead of just being evenly disbursed across the planet?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess a gold vein can be described as a big chunk of gold you can find underground in a mine. He's asking how do chunks of gold like this form to be mineable by humans in the first place, shouldn't they be like scattered everywhere?</p></div>		</li>
