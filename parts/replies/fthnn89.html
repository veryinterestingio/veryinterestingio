			<div class="markdown"><p>Melting point tests are a staple of chemistry. Mixtures will usually melt at a different (higher or lower depending on the impurity) temperature than a pure product. I'd think that the ingnition tempurature would follow a similar pattern.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't. Most things will keep burning once ignited. Things do self ignite at a certain temperature, but it's too hard (and dangerous) to be useful.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I have since forgotten everything regarding my degree, but at least my memories/experiences still stuck around!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure about burning, but melting point measurements of compounds are definitely a thing that can be used to test purity. It's not the most accurate method, but seeing that something melts at the right temperature and that there are not parts of the compound melting at higher or lower temperatures proves that the purity is relatively high.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Obviously they will properly test but you can definitely tell the difference in purity from gumming. Cheap and heavily cut will make your gums and maybe tongue numb, the usual stuff will go for your whole mouth and the better stuff will go for your whole face. I can remember being told it was close to 90% purity once and after gumming I couldn’t feel my whole face. Idk how true that percentage is though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah until you realize novocaine and lidocaine are some of the most common impurities in blow and are specifically designed to make someone think they are getting good stuff when in reality it is 95% baby laxative and caffeine. Sometimes you have to be extra aware if your whole face feels like you are at the dentist because you might just be snorting local anesthetic.</p></div>		</li>
