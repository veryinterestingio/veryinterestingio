			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what some freedivers do to increase their performance. Reducing heart beats with meditation, they can resist longer without breathing. See, for example, Umberto Pelizzari  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umberto_Pelizzari?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umberto_Pelizzari?wprov=sfla1</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I learned to shoot when i was around 12. They told me to breathe in, hold it for a second, breath halfway out, this is where you focus on the shot (when breathing out). When you concentrate enough, you recognise that your &quot;heart skips a beat&quot;. And this is where you take the shot. Then you breathe out the rest. Don't ask me how, i just do it to this day while on competition or on a hunt. Always the same technique... Breathe, hold absolutly still, take the shot, breathe out, repeat. i hop this helps?!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Fun fact: alcohol is considered a banned performance enhancing drug in the olympics and competitive shooting in general because it's depressant effects on the body  do the same thing</p>
<p>i always thought that was a funny fact... because most peole assume getting hammered to improve your marksmanship  seems kinda counter-intuitive haha</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And high altitude/high speed pilots do the opposite. They pseudo-hyperventilate to raise their heart rate and blood pressure to make sure some more oxygen can be forced into their brain in a condition when they would be otherwise hypoxic and help preserve consciousness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>iirc one major reason meditation can relax you and lower heartrate is because it often involves concentrating on your breathing, and extending exhalation. It's been proven that our heartrate is often higher during inhalation while during exhale it slows (for what I would think are obvious anatomical reasons). </p>
<p>It's one of the best relaxation techniques out there, and once you also learn to inhale at a specific slower rate as well, it creates its own cycle of relaxation. I practice and recommend <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/box-breathing" target="_blank">box breathing</a> when having anxiety/panic issues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. When I have panic attacks, which is rare, I often try to do the breathing exercises. It's extremely difficult to start because the deep inhale always makes me feel worse. It's hard to stick with, especially when your mind is in panic mode, but I always feel better after a minute or so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Glad you found a way to deal with panic attacks. Mine started after a major accident. I learned simply refocusing my attention to something else worked for me. Stay focused. Great job!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hopefully you won't need to, but if it happens again, another trick you can try is making sure to only inhale through the nose but also push one nostril closed with your finger.</p>
<p>This forces you to breathe slower by taking longer breaths and lowers the heart rate. If it's really bad and this causes more panic, play the ABC game while doing it. Pick any topic and try naming related things through each letter of the alphabet. A simple task to focus your brain, while you'll naturally breath slower through one nostril while not realizing it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Try a skip breath next time. Take a quick short gasp of breath then stop for a beat and almost immediately have a long relaxing exhale to start. Then do the breathing exercises as normal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Incredibly true. I have tachycardia and my heart rate varies by about 30 beats a minute depending on if I am inhaling or exhaling. I can get it up to about 120 just be inhaling a long breath. It drops down below 100 every time I exhale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe OP was referring to voluntary control by focusing directly on the heart. What you're referring to is the parasympathetic nervous system activating because of rest.</p></div>		</li>
