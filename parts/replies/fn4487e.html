			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah, just gotta learn that the horses dont auto jump. Honestly the horse mechanics in that game are a little TOO exact. I've trampled more civilians than I care to remember, simply because I'm riding through towns too quickly or try to make a sharp turn I cant make</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah this happens very frequently for me  even for like short distances in games because I fucking know I wouldn't survive that. </p>
<p>Assassins creed while I do love some of the games is notorious for fucking with me like that.</p>
<p>Idk if the feeling is exactly the same but like it's a disturbing feeling in my stomach like when you first drop on a big rollercoaster and then sometimes u flinch near the ground cuz u know its gonna hurt</p></div>		</li>
