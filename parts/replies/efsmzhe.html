			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the right answer, but to add some context:</p>
<p>Earth's magnetic field is generated by motion of an electrically conducting fluid (mainly iron) in the liquid outer core. Imagine that you have a fluid that is convecting due to heat difference between the core's top and bottom (just like convection in water on a stove). It might look like <a href="http://www.phschool.com/itext/sci_exp/iText/products/0-13-181243-2/ch1/ch1_s2_3.html" target="_blank">this</a> - which you'll notice looks pretty symmetric. But when you add in rotation, the Coriolis force makes the convective regions organize themselves into &quot;Taylor columns&quot;, helical zones of convection, so the system looks like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field#/media/File:Outer_core_convection_rolls.jpg" target="_blank">this</a> instead. Although it's a loose analogy, think of that helical convection as a solenoid wire - in that case, the magnetic field would be aligned with the rotation axis. The other thing to note is that within the core, the magnetic field basically looks like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field#/media/File:Geodynamo_Between_Reversals.gif" target="_blank">spaghetti</a> - there's no beautiful dipole. The dipole is what we see on the surface because more complicated magnetic fields decay faster with distance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Based on the fact that the field is generated by liquid iron, will the earth eventually lose its magnetic field as the core cools and solidifies?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe. The simple answer has been given by someone else in that the estimated cooling time is longer than the time left for red giant phase of the Sun. Problem is not so much it cooling down it is it stopping cooling at all. The important thing for dynamo action by convection is not temperature but heat flux. Mars still might have a hot enough core but not enough heat transfer and so no convective motion. If this happened to the Earth we could also lose our dynamo without the need to be solidified.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>but how does that explain when the magnetic poles flip? the Coriolis force isnt changing? so.. the taylor columns reverse directions..? that cant be it surely?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is indeed not the answer! The Taylor columns always rotate the same orientation due to the spin of the Earth. No one knows why magnetic fields reverse. I have seen some interesting work on the Sun to do with resonant frequencies of various wave motions in the star. It is still highly theoretical though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question, and I was wondering the same thing as I was writing! So there are two things going on - the mechanical and the electromagnetic. Think of a solenoid again. You can change the direction of the field in two ways: make the coils wrap clockwise instead of counterclockwise, or change the direction of the current.</p>
<p>You're right, the Taylor columns don't reverse the direction of their motion. However, they can reverse the direction of their magnetic field without changing the mechanics. Dynamo action reinforces an existing magnetic field, and it doesn't matter which direction that field is in. While we're nearing the edge of my personal understanding, here is a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/153645/feart-03-00052-HTML/image_m/feart-03-00052-g002.jpg" target="_blank">great visual</a> that I use to trick myself into thinking I understand:</p>
<p>A) is an example of a basic disk dynamo. If you stare at the diagram enough, you'll see that the starter field is reinforced regardless of its direction or the direction of motion of the disk.</p>
<p>Now look at B), where you have two disk dynamos interconnected. It turns out this is a chaotic system! If you have only one, then the field direction never changes from that initial field. But if you have two, they will usually reinforce each other, but will occasionally reverse field direction at random. Even though the mechanical rotation never changes!</p>
<p>C) features the paper's proposal to conceptualize each Taylor column as one of these disks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And just to be clear, humans initially described magnetic poles as north and south on pieces of lodestone because they would point north and south. So the fact that the North Pole of a magnet points north is not by coincidence, but itâ€™s defined that way. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Taylor columns are columns of fluid that spin kind of like a cylinder. They are caused by the rotation of the planet. They are helictical so their motion is kind of the shape of a spring. These structures amplify the magnetic field strength in a direction.</p></div>		</li>
