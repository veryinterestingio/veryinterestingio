			<div class="markdown"><p>Your question is a good one and really really complex. Short answer, there are different types of memory and different liabilities come with each. It’s not the case that we should doubt all memories, but we have limitations. For instance we have bad memories for faces that are of different races than our own. I was more focused on memory and aging, and I’m sure there are more qualified people to tease apart the different types, but suffice it to say that our memories are really fickle and we should look for other sources of ground truth when possible (e.g., take notes, make a diary, video evidence, convergence of evidence and so on), particularly for memories of things we do often (did I take my meds today). </p>
<p>All of this being said, we are not amnesiacs by and large. I know I have two kids, I know I have a wife.  We shouldn’t got down the rabbit hole of suspecting everything as a memory failure.</p></div>		</li>
