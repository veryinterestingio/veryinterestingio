			<div class="markdown"><p>The big picture is really interesting. Because you have to have sex often in the hopes that one of the times results in a baby, this contributes toward a tendency to form long-term monogamous relationships. This is good, because the male partner becomes more likely to stick around after the child is born, which is important for humans as we developed larger brains and a longer childhood/adolescent period. </p>
<p>Natural selection is a really cool phenomenon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We (humans) are not entirely similar there, but I'm going to be honest it would take me a little too long to write at length about it because I'd have to check sources since it's not my field.</p>
<p>But one of the things that comes to mind is that there are at least 3 variations in our DNA which dictates the amount of vasopressin our brain synthesizes - we could essentially think of it as 'some have lots, average, or little'. Meanwhile, there's a bunch of experiments with vasopressin and monogamy in animals; the short version is that if you supress it in prairie voles (which are typically monogamous), they'll stop being monogamous.</p>
<p>Similarly, there's a good chance that some people are predisposed to being monogamous while some aren't.</p>
<p>I think the rough explanation is that you can both have lots of kids from lots of partners or with one. In cases where the dad doesn't stick around, probably the tribe / society has stepped in or maybe a mom is actually enough. Some moms work themselves to the bone, but if the kid makes more kids then that'll show up in our biology anyway, no matter if it was healthy for the mom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! This whole subject of evolutionary pyschology fascinates me...another side effect of men not knowing when a woman is ovulating is that he has to prevent her from having sex with other men all the time (i.e. be in a nurturing long term relationship with her). A man's worst evolutionary nightmare would be to raise someone else's kid unknowingly. It explains why men are more fearful of cheating even though women are statistically less likely to cheat...and women usually cheat because they feel something is missing from their relationship and men usually cheat to pursue something exotic and available. This is a wormhole I love going down...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sex doesn't actually promote biologically monogamous relationship, in my opinion. Because men seek to have as much sex as possible, they're more inclined to have multiple partners. Women in the other hand are encouraged to be monogamous biologically.</p>
<p>Edit : I'm pretty sure I'm saying bullshit. Also for some reason I ignored a study that I've read. In it, said that women are wired to not stay with a partner after a few years (biological, psychological boredom comes in). Soooo</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard this actually wasn't true, that some study showed men actually do find women more attractive when they are ovulating. If I recall, women actually do show some subtle signs, such as a slightly more flushed face.</p>
<p>And this apparently works both ways, as men who don't wank get a build up of semen (which triggers a signal to start looking for sex) and naturally (not deliberately) become more flirtatious towards women...</p></div>		</li>
