<p>It’s optional. </p>
<p>And I know that lots of people won’t like me to say this, but it’s true: We change our behavior often without setting goals. So maybe goal setting isn’t a good plan for your with this particular behavior.</p>
<p>Next, try to follow my Maxim #1:</p>
<p>“Help yourself do what you already want to do.”</p>
<p>In other words, figure out what you already WANT to do, not what you SHOULD do,. And invest your efforts in designing for what you want. </p>
<p>“Shoulds” almost never become true habits.</p>
<p>In Tiny Habits I map out how you find the best new habits for yourself. There’s a process. I won’t go into here because I explain it there better. But Maxim #1 is key.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the entire book Tiny Habits, I use the word “goal” just a few times, mostly to say I don’t use that word. </p>
<p>This is another way my work and my book aren’t at all the traditional approach.</p></div>		</li>
