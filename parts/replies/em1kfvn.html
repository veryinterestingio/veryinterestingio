<p>There's now also a third option:<br />
Cameras read your number plate at two separate locations. The system knows the time your car was at the two different locations, and the distance between them. It can therefore calculate your average speed between the two locations.  This hinders the practice of people driving like maniacs only to slam on the brakes just before the speed camera.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On top of this, there are places where &quot;speed limits enforced by aircraft&quot; is a thing.  Watch for rectangular &quot;tabs&quot; painted on the asphalt (<a href="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3ae79d06abf00a52564ba0ebe4ccbeaa.webp" target="_blank">Like this</a>): these are marker points for the camera in the aircraft. If you car travels between these marker points faster than you would travelling at the speed limit, you're speeding. The operator in the aircraft then radios to cars on the ground.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. A few people have started pointing that out, I understood it differently, will update the main comment accordingly.</p>
<p>Do you have a decent approximation of the tolerance of Doppler measurements from GPS satellites? I guess it at least could approach the accuracy of radar, but likely doesn't quite match?</p></div>		</li>

<p>You can actually get a very good idea of the accuracy using the Speed Dilution of Precision (SDOP).  Unfortunately, only a few devices (designed for GPS-based speed records) report and log this parameter.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always conceptualized it as counting phase slips, which works out to measuring the same thing as Doppler but suggests a different mechanism.</p>
<p>I believe that <em>very old</em> GPS receivers didn't do direct phase measurements, and somewhere along the line they started to, but I'm not clear on exactly when that transition happened.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ehm, from what I can remember, if there's only 3 visible satellites, the mathematics only works if you assume the car is at a fixed distance from the earth's core - so in this instance no.</p>
<p>However far more commonly there at least 4 satellites viable, and it can calculate everything, meaning it can accurately deal with height changes</p></div>		</li>
