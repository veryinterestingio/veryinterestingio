<p>There are claims that nerves may have some regenerative capacity but it's negligible.</p>

<p>It's often to be heard that our brain is incredibly &quot;elastic&quot; when it comes to being damaged or while learning, is it somewhat relevant to our regeneration?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my understanding, the elasticity is referring to the ability of the brain to find other neural paths to do something once an existing path has been damaged and not the regenerative abilities of the neural cells.</p></div>		</li>
