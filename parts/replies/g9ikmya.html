<p>Its risky income, you might end up with 0 dollars or 10 million over a 10 year period. When you invest money they promise to pay you a part of their profits in thanks for this investment, if they dont make any money you dont get anything in return either.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's the reason that's given as an argument, but the reality (as noted by Thomas Piketty in Capital in the 21st Century) is that the high rates of return for investments is the leading cause of the growing inequality in the world. The actual reason returns from investments are taxed less is <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rentseeking.asp" target="_blank">rent-seeking</a> - because those who earn the largest amount of this sort of income have the greatest access to the politicians who write the laws.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If this is the case, why is capital gains established massive companies like Amazon or Microsoft stock taxed at a lower rate? Or even from index funds? Do you honestly believe that investors need government subsidies to choose to invest in the higher yield stock market instead of lower yield bonds or other safer investments?</p></div>		</li>
