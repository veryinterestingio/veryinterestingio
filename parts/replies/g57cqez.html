			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah honestly this is why I use my iPhone's 2x camera more than the &quot;normal&quot; one. They call it 2x but it still looks more wide-angle than what you see with your eyes imo. I wish they made a 4x instead of one that's more wide-angle than the normal one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the phone. High-end phones of the past couple of years or so have multiple cameras, at the very least they'll have a wide angle and a medium angle camera. Some have even more, such as for telephoto and macro photography.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point of view will never change, as that is where the camera is positioned. The field of view is changing with the focal length.</p>
<p>Now digital zoom is basically cropping in so you lose some detail, but the resulting image will be pretty similar to optical zoom, just of lesser quality. But it will still be the same image with relations between objects and foreground and background staying the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 2x camera is, IIRC somewhere about 50mm equivalent, aka a standard lens in photography terms. It should be pretty much equivalent to the field-of-view of the human eye.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>2x just means twice as telephoto as the wide one. Or half as wide, depending wich way you prefer to think about it. </p>
<p>The wide is really damned wide, so half as wide is still pretty damned wide</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People aren’t explaining the full picture and that just causes more confusion.</p>
<p>People who are saying the eye is like an extreme telephoto lens are correct. But people who are saying the eye is like a wide angle lens are <em>also</em> correct.</p>
<p>Try this: look at some text in this comment section. Now try to keep your eye fixed on one letter but “look at” the sentences above without moving your eye from its original position. This is difficult to do since you’ll have the instinct to move your eye to whatever you’re looking at and the brain is very good at filling in missing information. You’ll notice that even a few sentences above or below the spot you’re looking at will appear blurry and illegible, and a paragraph above or below will just be featureless blurry lines.</p>
<p>The entire retina is covered in light sensing cells, but only the very center part (the macula) is high density, the rest is low density, so only the center “zoomed in” portion of your field of view is capable of sharp vision. It’s actually kind of shocking how small it is if you’re ever able to catch a glimpse of it, but your brain does an incredible job of filtering vision so just like trying to see the blood vessels in your eyes it’s very difficult to do on demand. I’d estimate it’s something like the size of a half dollar or Pog held at arm’s length (although that’s just based on context clues, not direct observation), that little spot is where the majority of your photoreceptors are and that spot is where all of the “sharpness” of your vision lies (but that spot is also quite a bit <em>larger</em> than the moon appears from Earth, which is how it can look so detailed to us).</p>
<p>So it’s not accurate to say the human eye is <em>exactly</em> like a telephoto lens, but it’s also not accurate to say that the human eye is <em>exactly</em> like a wide angle lens. It’s more like a low-resolution wide angle image with a very high resolution telephoto image overlaid in the center. At that center section there is a lot more detail of far away objects, but there is also a very wide field of view that takes in everything else around it at a lower resolution. But our brains are good at merging these images together, along with “magnifying” the high-resolution center portion so that it takes up a larger portion of our mind’s field of view than our peripheral vision (as well as other filtering like hiding or fixing stuff we don’t need to see). The result is a seamless border between the two that most people will never even be aware of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Read through some text. Even though you can see the word, the paragraph, the phone, your hands, a desk, a wall, the floor, a cup, and a poster, the only thing you can identify without prior knowledge is the word you're focused on. Our eyes have a huge field of view, but only a tiny part of it can see detail. The moon (and sun) has the same &quot;apparent size&quot; as your thumb nail at arm's length, which is also about the size of a word at a comfortable font size for the given distance. We live in a 3D world and constantly take little hints about true size and distance while constantly changing what's centered in view. A picture or video is 2D in which we're often locked to a single field of view. If it's missing detail when it's taken, it'll be missing detail when we're looking at it later</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the real answer ;-)</p>
<p>And not just any telephoto lens. A 200mm (on full frame) still won't do you any good if your plan is to have the moon come even close to filling the frame. 500mm and above is where it gets interesting.</p>
<p>And with those kinds of focal lengths, the relative motion of the moon actually starts to matter, and you'll get motion blur in your images. Unless it's a <em>fast</em> lens too. At which point things start to get pricy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And our eyes are relatively poor compared to many animals, especially if we compare to other predators (and especially especially compared to flying predators)</p>
<p>Because we have really had the need to improve our eyesight for thousands of years, there was no selective pressure to evolve them beyond what we had back when we were hunter gatherers and potentially our eyesight has even gone down since then.</p>
<p>Also, the fact that we were pack hunters means we did not need to rely on one particular set of eyes, as the group would always see something, it didn't really matter much if a few individuals didn't see as clear as the rest, so even then, poor genes had a chance to spread.</p></div>		</li>
