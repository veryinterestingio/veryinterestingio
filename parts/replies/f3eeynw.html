			<div class="markdown"><p>Taking the analogy further, imagine you're flying a biplane in the dark.  There are floodlights sweeping everywhere (that's normal radar), so you try not to get too close.  When the lights switch to spotlights pointing at you, you know you've been locked.  </p>
<p>Sweeping radar &quot;sounds&quot; different than a spotlight-like lock-on.</p>
<p>In fact, the earliest lock-on warning was literally a quick hack to detect radar and translate it into sound.  I think it was during the Korean war, where the Russians were able to get a mostly-intact american fighter (I <em>think</em> it was a P-80 Shooting Star) and examined its radar-based gun-sight.  A Russian scientist worked up a quick box that detected radar in the frequency the American gun-sights used, and turned it into sound.  The Russian pilots were then able to detect when an American fighter got behind them by the noise coming out of the radar detector.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Analogy could also work if you were a prisoner escaping from custody.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And to take this analogy further, the other way of detecting someone in a dark room is to listen to them move. It's much harder to figure exactly where they are by just listening instead of turning on your flashlight but you have the advantage of the other person not knowing where you are or even knowing you are looking for them. This is called passive detection (versus active detection.) Heat seeking missiles use passive detection.</p>
<p>A funky variant of all this is if there are two people in the dark room and you want to find one person but not the other. You put a very dim light on the person you dont want to find. If you hear noises of someone moving and you look in that direction and see a dim light you can assume it's the person you dont want to find. This is called a &quot;friend or foe&quot; system.</p></div>		</li>
