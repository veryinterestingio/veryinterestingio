			<div class="markdown"><p>That said there are limits. If we assume life composed of elements, that is chemically, certain rules have to be maintained to make it possible for molecules of that complexity to exist. While we can't know if any kind of chemical life would thrive there it would be surprising and challenge our notions of physics and chemistry. We'd need it to do so to be planet-bound, which is what we are focusing on right now.</p>
<p>Venus on the surface is very intense, the sulfuric acid, extremely high heats, pressure, etc. make chemistry over a certain level really hard. We can't send a machine with shields that can withstand the forces and conditions there, the organism would have to show very unique abilities. This is the view that Venus is a &quot;hellhole&quot;.</p>
<p>Of course if you avoid the surface and float a few KM over the surface the atmosphere is much nicer, to the point that it's been proposed that if we colonize Venus it would be with floating cities. Recently some atmospheric analysis has shown that a low entropy (rare) molecule has been found in levels that are not chemically or physically explainable. The only other planet is Earth with it's high oxygen atmosphere. So people are excited about the prospect, we may find life, or (what I suspect will happen) we'll revisit the math on some chemistry and physics at really high pressures/temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I still hold onto the fact that, we only know what we know and its arrogant and ignorant to believe that things might not be so clear anymore when we really start exploring new worlds. We say life cant exist on said planet because life as we know it cannot survive those conditions. That's the kicker here &quot;life as we know it&quot;. Its hubris to assume we have it all figured out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You're right, but we basically know that life relies on complex molecules, which is only really possible with a few elements - carbon and silicon. </p>
<p>We also know that strong acids or extremely high heat would destroy most organic (carbon-based) and silicon-based complex molecules, which means that many settings will basically eliminate life before it can even form. </p>
<p>Ultimately, we can't <em>know</em> anything at all. Maybe we all live in a simulation, or maybe chemistry is a local phenomenon, or whatever. And eventually, we run into the issue of trying to define what life even is - is a replicating crystal life? Maybe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not that simple. We've talked but never seen  a silicate based lifeform. Based on the math,  we are fairly certain it's possible.  The main thing to realize is that space is massive and our lives are limited. We go with what we know,  not out of hubris but because it's simply what's within our abilities.  We don't even have the lifespan and speeds to see if the planets we believe may have complex life, actually do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, but &quot;life that doesn't work as we know it&quot; is like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_teapot" target="_blank">Russell's teapot</a>. </p>
<p>Maybe this thing, that we've never seen, and that we don't understand, exists. But we can imagine an infinite number of things that we've never seen and don't understand. Maybe there's a teapot nobody has seen, orbiting mars for some reason. That is absolutely possible. </p>
<p>But the possibilities with no evidence aren't as interesting as the possibilities that have some evidence, so it tends to be more productive to focus on those.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This.  If we assume that a life form uses DNA, and we know that certain combinations break down with temperatures over 200 deg. C..  Then, we know that whatever life form may be in the Venusian atmosphere, probably will not produce proteins that rely on those DNA combinations.</p>
<p>It's wrong to assume the Earth's environment is the norm, and all deviations from it are &quot;extremes&quot;.  Thus, it's wrong to assume that extreme deviation from &quot;Earth normal&quot; conditions is somehow a limiting factor for life elsewhere.  But the laws of physics remain the same almost everywhere.  And while those physics may close the door to one form of life, it may open doors to life in forms we've never imagined.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wasn't proposing that it had to be carbon dna based life. Just that it was composed of baryonic elements. There's physics and chemistry rules that allow our prevent molecules of certain complexity to exist, and since life is complexity it puts a limit on life built from elements.</p>
<p>But even in Venus we see an important lesson. We never considered something just floating in the atmosphere, we assumed we'd see lower our higher. This is also important to the study of life in outer planets. We've been assuming that life would have a visible effect on the atmosphere (as we have here on Earth, if an alien species we're able to see, from their planet, Earth passing in front of the sun, making the star flicker, they would notice a huge amount of O2 in the atmosphere, which can only be explained through life) but it may be that planets with thicker atmosphere could hide this under layers. Either way exciting ideas to explore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's limits. Most extremophiles struggle to survive beyond certain density. They also evolved from non extremophiles, they have the same delicate processes, but then later evolve protective layers. One of the big questions on Earth was how DNA was able to evolve exposed on our environment (one of the main reasons we take panspermia seriously), so even Earth is more extreme than we think.</p>
<p>That said there's life in earth right? But not everywhere, there's a lot of areas on Earth, in the mantle and core, that are lifeless (at least as far as we've seen).</p>
<p>So what about Venus? It can have life, but it probably didn't start, and isn't most, on the surface. Just like much of Earth's life in the oceans isn't in the deepest parts of the ocean, but in the middle range. It makes sense that life in Venus would be in the areas that are friendlier to life, somewhere in that middle of the atmosphere. The same area where we've found the potential clues of life. It would certainly be an extra point to validate our theories of baryonic matter based life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sadly, its just so much a single human being could potentially reach in a lifetime (even if we could prolong it some day) considering the maximum speed of travel (light) and the incredible distances between everything in the universe. </p>
<p>Consider that today, after 42 years, Voyager 1, the most distant man-made object, is 22.5 billion km away from earth and is expected to arrive at the Oort cloud in 300 years, taking 30,000 years to pass trough it. The universe is just unbelievabily big.</p></div>		</li>
