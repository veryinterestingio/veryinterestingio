			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not how science works, and it wouldn't be that simple.</p>
<p>Getting an object to interstellar space, if we are oversimplifying things, is mostly a matter of inertia. Get it out of the atmosphere, trace the route on the nothingness and just wait.</p>
<p>But editing our DNA, much smaller than a single cell, and actually going through medical trials with humans is not trivial. It's not like we can reverse most of the consequences of aging anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fine tuning strands of DNA without damaging it is considerably more complex than rocket science; rocket science is more about the application of raw power and the engineering to keep it from exploding so could be done with basic WW2 science and a little creativity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not really very difficult at all.Â just get rid of the testosterone that is a precursor to DHT and you're golden. Also, you'll develop breasts and become impotent. The most effective ways to do this is to remove the testicles. So, um, yeah, great news if you're a transgender woman who doesn't want to lose her hair. Not so great news for cisgender men...</p></div>		</li>
