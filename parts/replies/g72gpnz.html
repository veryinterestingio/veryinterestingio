			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on this, rhythm in music and rhythm in speech are actually processed in the same region of the brain, but in <em>different hemispheres</em>. You can take damage to one, but the other won't be affected.</p>
<p>For example, I'm beat deaf. I have a quite horrendous sense of rhythm in music and typically don't even process sounds as music until I see someone dancing along. Even then, it only clicks if the words line up with the dancing, so the music is still no factor. I've never had a song stuck in my head, but I have had phrases from lyrics. That's the only catchy part of music for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That‘s really interesting. So you mean you don’t really recognize music if you don’t concentrate on it and look for references to that sound? I could imagine it’s more of a background noise that doesn’t make any sense to you then?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, a lot of songs aren't very distinguishable from traffic or ambient construction noise. It mostly depends on the singer, though. Since it's typically played at a loud volume, a lot of it is just irritating. I have to listen to a song over and over again to become familiar enough with it that it might be enjoyable. Since I can't bring myself to devote all that time to listening to new stuff, I just stick with the same few artists that I already know and love. That way, listening to a new album of theirs is a worthwhile investment of my time.</p>
<p>It took me about a month of listening to High As Hope (FATM) on repeat during my daily commute to really appreciate it, and then it was several months later that it even hit me that &quot;Big God&quot; had music. I mean, of course it had music—it's a <em>song</em>—but I just never heard it as anything other than poetry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting. Kind of like when little kids read a poem and don't realise it's supposed to have rhythm and meter, so the stress has to be on certain words/syllables.</p></div>		</li>
