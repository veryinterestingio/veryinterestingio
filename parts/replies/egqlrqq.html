			<div class="markdown"><p>'Volcanic glass' refers to material that is cooled so quickly that it actually doesn't have to time to form crystals, so it doesn't technically have a grain size, because there are no grains. You could talk about the size of individual glass shards, that might be incorporated into a volcanic rock, but not the grain size within the glass since it is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amorphous_solid" target="_blank">amorphous solid</a>.</p>
<p>Volcanic glass will have the exact same composition as the magma from which it formed (discounting chemical alteration from weathering, etc) and would also have the same composition as a volcanic rock which crystallized from the same magma, assuming at least that you are analyzing enough of the volcanic rock to get a nearly homogeneous sample.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite, if you physically crush a rock you end up with “sediment”. “Soil” is formed when rock and sediments are chemically weathered (e.g. when the minerals are broken down in water or by biological processes) and mixed with some organic matter like dead plants. </p>
<p>So a soil is basically a mix of decomposing plants/organic matter and sediments (sand, clay, etc.) </p>
