			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s really helpful, but I’m thinking about what would happen if a website ended up hosting the status page on a service that uses the same availability zone without knowing it. Is it common practice to have the status pages behind a load balancer that routes to multiple infrastructures? If AWS goes down, route it through Azure, or whatever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having your IaaS provider crash and burn catastrophically is just one way that a site might go down, and to be honest it's a much less common one. Most incidents are not due to the infrastructure provider, but rather the site itself exhausting its allocated resources or having a software bug.</p>
<p>That said, status pages for major sites are geographically distributed with robust failover behavior, i.e. &quot;high availability&quot; distributed services. The exact mechanisms for load balancing and failover vary, but the business of CDNs is to be extremely robust toward exactly these types of scenarios.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There have been problems like this before.  Pretty sure one of the big AWS outages managed to take down the AWS status infrastructure, and at the time they didn’t have a fallback to something else.</p></div>		</li>
