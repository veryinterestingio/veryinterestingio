<p>Also, both of your eyes work in a similar manner - look at the same position, focus on the same object</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So do animals with eyes on the side of their heads that don't focus the same object blink independently?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the main contributor is the same amount of time exposed to air part. Plus it likely requires less coordination in the brain to send the same signal to 2 places at the same time rather than independently monitoring each eye and blinking only one at a time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The blinking trigger is connected to both 'eye nuclei'. So when one eye decides to blink, the other follows.
It's a bit more complicated than just that of course,  but it's late, and cranial nerves are 3 semesters back</p></div>		</li>

<p>what happens when that's not true? or instance if you are facing perpendicular to the wind, so your right eye is getting 30mph wind+rain to the face, while your left eye is in the lee of your nose and sees none of that?</p></div>		</li>

<p>and passes on it's genes at the same rate as the one who blinks with one eye</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If that was the cas we'd have both.</p>
<p>So blinking both eyes is more advantageous. Maybe it's better to be blind 200ms rather than be depth blind 400ms. Also reaction time being 200ms you could punch people when they start to blink and gain 200ms advantage. Or I don't know</p></div>		</li>
