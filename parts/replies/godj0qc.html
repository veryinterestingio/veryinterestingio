			<div class="markdown"><p>Certainly crack behavior would be significantly different in the presence of oxygen than without, but cracking should still occur. Details will matter, but fatigue cracking should still occur.</p>
<p>Work hardening is where freely moving dislocations become entangled due to deformation. Freely moving dislocations make deforming the metal easier than if they were not present. Once they're entangled and can't move, the metal becomes more stiff. Oxygen isn't really critical to the process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any fatigue mechanism affected by environment should not be occurring in space (such as stress corrosion cracking or fatigue with hydrogen (embrittlement)). In space, you might have radiations that will affect the material.<br />
Otherwise, dislocations are still always present in the metal and will be generated by various loads. When there is enough slip near the surface of the metal that a step on the surface forms, you can get fatigue cracks. You can also get fatigue cracks if the metal has large enough inclusions near the surface.</p>
<p>Another thing is temperature: at low temperature, dislocations should harder to move, but that also makes the material more brittle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but won’t the crack immediately cold weld itself back together though once the mechanical stress subsides?</p>
<p>That’s what I was wondering.</p></div>		</li>
