			<div class="markdown"><p>Fuck, my dad was from Tornado alley and had quite a few occurrences. We live in Southeast VA now and about a decade ago had an EF3 start about a mile out and we saw it closing in on our neighborhood and took shelter. It was like a train going right past the house, the whole thing was shaking, a house just down the street was totally demolished, and so were a few deeper in the neighborhood. I got anxious during storms for years after that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in an earthquake area. There has to be a LAW passed to FORCE people to pay an extra $20 or so to strap their water heaters to the wall.</p>
<p>People will always take their chances to save a buck.</p>
<p>If you pass a law that forces people to live safely, but pay 20% more rent, they'll choose being homeless. If you subsidize them with tax money, they'll vote you out because they of the higher taxes.</p>
<p>Can't fix stupid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If only people had some sort of minimum wage that would enable them to pay enough in rent to get someplace safe...but that’d be silly, it’s much better our minimum wage workers go on welfare instead and live in ghettos</p></div>		</li>
