			<div class="markdown"><p>That honestly sounds heavenly. All my life I’ve had extremely vivid dreams that seem to stretch on for ages. I think I’ve had one time, ever, when I was about ten that I had “quick” night like you describe. Though I don’t think it helps that I have teeny tiny bladder and I have to get up at least once a night to pee. Can we just, like, switch sleeping states for a night? Pretty please?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here, except 5 is probably double what I’d guess. Everything I’ve read over the years is in a dead heat between “you probably just don’t remember” and “it’s perfectly normal to actually not dream at all, and it means you’re sleeping even deeper sleep.”</p>
<p>Both make sense to me, as I can’t remember hardly anything while awake and I’m practically dead to the world when asleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to snore pretty bad and rarely remembered ever dreaming. Was diagnosed with mild sleep apnea and got a cpap....BEST sleep I have had in years. Started having vivid dreams in the beginning, but now it's toned down to normal dreams like when I was younger. But still, I dream a lot more now and can tell the difference between sleeping with the cpap and sleeping without it. If I forget to wear it at night, the next morning is miserable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm the same! I rarely remember what I dream, usually I only remember the falling ones because I wake up. I sometimes remember enough to know that I dreamed something really weird but I can't remember the details. But usually I wake up and don't recall dreaming at all. I remember reading a while ago on some website that it's because you don't wake up during rem sleep but I have no idea if that's actually true or not. Sleep is such an interesting topic! On the other hand, my roommates remember their dreams in vivid detail almost every night.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you were given Versed this is not surprising. I work in an outpatient surgery center and Versed causes short term memory loss. I've had patients ask me the same questions multiple times. Which is why you should never do anything important or legally binding directly after having any kind of out patient procedure</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you might be right. It might have been Versed and not Valium. I actually had to have the procedure redone soon afterwards. (It was an implant in my nose to help my breathing and the first try it started poking out of my skin.) I took one pill instead of two and didn't suffer any short term memory loss.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How long is it before a patient starts conversing, and the &quot;snaps&quot; out of it?</p>
<p>Ive been under twice in the past year, and I've snapped out of it mid-sentance, and not been able to carry on... I'm not really worried about what I say, the nurses said I was &quot;polite&quot; haha, but they wouldn't say what I was talking about or for how long...</p>
<p>What's the recovery procedure like? Do you wait with the patient till they wake up? Ask procedural questions? Converse?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a nightmare once that took place over 71 hours. I’ve had dreams like this all my life, mostly as a kid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have exceptionally long dreams. Some of them took place over the course of weeks, others made it feel like years were passing.</p>
<p>I am pretty sure, with my awake brain, that I am only actually experiencing a small portion of that in real time. The rest of it is adopted false memory that is created whole cloth as needed and placed into a temporal order by my brain. So when I remember what happened I remember all of that as if it happened.</p>
<p>It is kind of like how it is impossible to tell if you were just created a minute ago with all your past memories. You would feel the same either way.</p>
<p>My theory for why this happens to me is a little odd though. I have started, probably to my detriment, to think of my dreams as something foreign to me in an odd way. This is happening because they seem to operate like a virus, and they constantly find ways to fool me out of my nightmare defenses. This serves to force me to endure them, as my dreams keep getting more and more realistic. It is awful.</p>
<p>For example, I used to be able to wake myself up by imagining myself being pulled up through my bed and back into my body. This worked for years, but ever since my dreams got particularly dark I now find myself being pulled into false awakenings constantly. No matter how I try to wake myself up it is always a false awakening now.</p>
<p>More related, I also used to use memory to determine if I was dreaming as a sanity check. So if something strange or terrifying started to happen I would immediately think &quot;how did I get here? What was I just doing.&quot; In a dream those answers are usually fluid and ill-defined, allowing you to find the inconsistency and become aware. But now that I have gained the ability to create extra detailed false memories, those questions now only serve to convince me that I am in a dream.</p></div>		</li>
