			<div class="markdown"><p>The part about Apple lighting is not correct, there is always 5V on the gold pins, you can measure it with a meter or you can lick the connector, the MFI certification is the phone checking before activating battery charging</p>
<p>Edit: screw that, it can charge fine even with non MFI cables, iPhones apparently check for voltage on the USB data lines before charging, I have no idea how the made for Apple chips works or what they do then</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the MFI is supposed to do the handshake for usb-PD FAST fast charging. When they can't handshake it will still charge but only at 5w or whatever. Could be mistaken though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my experience if the cable doesn’t have one, it has a chance to stop charging until you unplug it and plug it back in, but it‘s pretty much random</p>
<p>However I have only experience with slow charging phones, the usb c ones most likely do some handshake, I’m just talking about old usb A to lighting</p>
<p>I‘ve heard the charging current is determined by the data pins, dead short = 1 A 2.5V on both = 2.4A or something and that’s why power banks sometimes have two ports with “2.4A” printed on one of them. I think it’s for iPads since they have a larger power brick, but the brick is passive to my knowledge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The device decides at what rate it will charge, not the charger. Though the charger does indicate what rate it can support, by tying different values of resistors to the data lines. So when you connect a charger to your phone (or tablet, or whatever), the phone looks at the data lines to see if it supports charging at 1A, 2.4A, or of it should fall back to the old 0.5A USB standard (in the worst case). Then the phone configures its internal battery charge controller to draw the matching current. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most phone chargers don't have a ground, so the ground is not actually connected to the earth. It's just relative to the +5V.  This means that the ground connection does nothing until the circuit is completed. On devices connected to the earth as ground, you could neutralize static electricity or electromagnetic interference, but not without it.</p></div>		</li>
