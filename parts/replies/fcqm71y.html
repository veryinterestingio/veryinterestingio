			<div class="markdown"><p>Energy can only be converted, not created. If the furniture is at rest then its potential energy is not changing, so no energy is being converted to heat.</p>
<p>If the furniture is lifted up then dropped, then its potential energy has changed. That difference in potential energy is converted to kinetic energy and then converted to heat and sound as it hits the floor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing I have never been able to grasp:. Isn't gravity constantly exerting force on us?  So therefore energy would always be &quot;created&quot; in the micro view (but of course would have to come from something in the macro).  I expect I am missing something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd imagine it <em>technically</em> would, but the amount would be negligible since practically all of its energy would be potential energy.</p></div>		</li>
