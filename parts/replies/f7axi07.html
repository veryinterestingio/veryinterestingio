			<div class="markdown"><p>the pressure would, i assume just destroy everything and everyone. </p>
<p>your eardrums can hurt form going up and down some hills. and you have to equalize it when you are a few meters down into water.</p>
<p>imagine the insane pressure this water would have, it would destroy anything in its path. </p>
<p>atmospheric pressure at sea level is around 14.7 psi
att 3000m the preasure is 4477 PSI</p>
<p>its like having water with the pressure of an anvil on your eardrum (on every inch of your body in fact). </p>
<p>it is not an exaggeration to say that you are crushed into mosh if an sudden event.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To give some context the pressure differential is high enough that it's possible that the air will ignite as the water compresses it like in a diesel engine.</p>
<p>In a strange way that's the better of two options. If the sub doesn't sink below implosion depth your still doomed to a slow death as air slowly runs out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if you experience the panic of drowning for an extended period of time as the carbon dioxide level climbs. I know that our bodies sense suffocation not by low oxygen, but by high CO2, so it seems possible that you might start panicking like someone being smothered, but it would likely take much longer to actually get low enough on oxygen to die. </p>
<p>Anyone morbidly curious about this sensation can experience it semi-safely by inhaling some air out of a half full 2 liter soda bottle. Instant panic attack in a bottle basically. Probably do it sitting down though, you're unlikely to pass out or anything since your oxygen levels won't really be altered, but better safe than sorry.</p></div>		</li>
