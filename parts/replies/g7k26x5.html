			<div class="markdown"><p>Question:</p>
<p>As I understand it, general relativity views gravity not as a force or field, but curved space time, causing “orbit around the earth” to actually be “straight forward” for the moon</p>
<p>From this viewpoint, it sounds less surprising that these would be the same quantity? In fact, both of these are the same thing, the force it takes to change momentum (or whatever it’s equivalent is in motion through curved space time manifold)</p>
<p>But, while I have a physics bachelor, we never dove into general relativity and differential geometry, so maybe this is just a false conclusion based on hand wavy popular science explanations of space time ?</p>
<p>EDIT: </p>
<p>A lot of people have said it is the other way around, the fact that they are the same is an assumption on which general relativity is based.</p>
<p>However, I wonder, if we believe that general relativity is not just some mathematical tool but an actual description of reality, then I would say that the fact that inertial and gravitational mass are considered as two separate things that might have separate values is actually an illusion coming from our incorrect view that gravity is a force.</p>
<p>It is like, the speed of light just so happens to fall out of Maxwells equations as the speed of waves in the electromagnetic field. This caused Maxwell to realise that light <em>is</em> waves in the electromagnetic field, and why these &quot;two constants&quot; have the same value is no longer a question?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>General relativity <em>assumes</em> that inertial mass and gravitational mass are the same, and relies on that assumption. To quote Einstein:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is only when there is numerical equality between the inertial and gravitational mass that the acceleration is independent of the nature of the body.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea of viewing gravity as curving space-time only works if this assumption holds.</p>
<p>This is called the equivalence principle; there are a couple of versions of it, but they all have the same rough result; how something moves due to gravity doesn't depend on its mass.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Other way around.
It is seen like that because of the equivalence principle.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The interesting thing is that there's no known reason why those two quantities have to be the same thing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was a physics undergrad, but that was a long time ago, so please help me understand this.</p>
<p>We have an observation: a falling object accelerates with acceleration g.  Therefore, the force it exerts on a surface it's resting on -- for example -- is mg, since F = ma.  This is inertial mass, right?  I don't see any reason why an object accelerating with acceleration g shouldn't exert the same force whether that acceleration is due to gravity or due to anything else.  Maybe I'm missing something subtle here about the nature of a force in general.</p>
<p>Then we go to universal gravitation.  We want to compute an equation for the gravitational force between two objects.  We know that over small distances where one of the objects is much smaller than the other, the force is mg where m is the smaller mass and g is some constant acceleration which depends on whatever other factors.  There is no reason why the equation shouldn't be symmetric, so assuming point masses, the only other variable is the distance r between them, so the force is F(m1)F(m2)G(r), where F(m) ≈ m for small m and G(r) is some arbitrary function we don't need to worry about right now.  It turns out that F(m) = m.  Is this the thing that there's no known reason why it has to be this way?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems you have already assumed m^(inertial) = m^(gravitational) =: m. No one says that has to be the case in principle</p>
<p>You have m^(inertial) a = F^(grav) where if you assume it m cancels.</p>
<p>Technically, there is further distinction into m^(active gravitational) and m^(passive gravitational). one being how strong a source of gravity something is and the other how strongly it is affected by gravity.</p></div>		</li>

<p>From Newton's Second Law, if I have some acceleration g and some (inertial) mass m, the force is mg, right?  Isn't that the definition of a force?  What benefit could there possibly be to defining the force in some way that depends on the source of that force?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You start by using inertial and gravitational mass as if they are the same,  then get to the conclusion they are the same.
Even though it seems that a far as we can tell they are the same quantity they still represent two very different properties.
Inertial mass represents how hard it is to accelerate something when you apply a force to it. But that force could be anything at all.  If you apply one newton of force to a 1kg inertial mass it will accelerate in the direction of that force 1 m per second square.
Now that could be 1 N force caused by gravity,  magnetism,  electrostatic , a spring,  whatever. </p>
<p>Say it is electrostatic force,  that force will be caused by some property of the object Obj1 and that of say another object nearby obj2 Let's call it property A</p>
<p>If it is caused by gravity it could also be caused by some property B of those same two objects, unlike A, B caused gravitational force instead of  electrostatic force. </p>
<p>As far as we can see we have three properties of the object,  its Inertial mass M, its &quot;A&quot; and its &quot;B&quot;.</p>
<p>Now for this 1kg object we find that we can create the  1 N force by putting a certain amount of &quot; A&quot; on the object and on another nearby object that could be easily done in a lab with objects of similar size and order of magnitude in inertial mass. </p>
<p>We see experimentally that we can double the A it has and double the F , now it accelerates at double a as before.
We also find we can keep our object as is and double the A on the other object  Obj2 and obtain exactly the same doubling of F and A.</p>
<p>Now we test B property , we first find that B is much weaker as to generate 1N we need a small moon sized obj2.</p>
<p>As before if we double the B of obj2, obj1 is now subject to 2 N and acceleration double to 2 m over second squared.</p>
<p>However the curious thing happens when we try to double the B in obj1. , as expected F is now double to 2 N, however unlike in the case of property A, the acceleration in obj1, remains the same at 1 m second squared.</p>
<p>As a= f/ m we have to deduce that m changed. </p>
<p>So now  you see A and B started as two independent properties from M , but no matter how hard we try we can't add B to the object without changing M in the same proportion. </p>
<p>A is what we call electric charge and B would be gravitational mass.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore, the force it exerts on a surface it's resting on -- for example -- is mg, since F = ma. This is inertial mass, righ</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this case there isn't even acceleration,  therefore no total force on the object.  The force F due to weight is countered by the surface its on. </p>
<p>The way I got to understand the difference as a kid was moving out of earth. </p>
<p>Say you put a 500kg car on top of you on earth you get crushed by the 5000 N of force caused by earth gravity on it .</p>
<p>Go to the moon,  do the same,  you definitely feel the weight of the car but you don't get hurt by it.   The 5000 N are now  only about 800N.</p>
<p>Go to a space station , you don't even feel the car as it has no weight. </p>
<p>What you feel in these 3 cases is the force caused by the gravity of earth , and the moon,  and nothing in space,  the car itself is way too small for you to feel the gravity it generates. </p>
<p>Now say the car comes moving towards you,  let's say horizontally,  to take gravity out.  You are trapped between the car and a Wall.</p>
<p>Now you will be just as crushed on earth , the moon and the space station,  as now what you feel is the F your body has to make to decelerate the same 500 kg of inertial mass, which will probably be enough to cause you serious harm.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>What <em>is</em> a force?  I thought it was defined as something like ma (or dp/dt or whatever), meaning that if a thing has an acceleration, then the force required to move/stop it is definitionally the acceleration times the inertial mass, no?  Or is the idea that the force required to move it and the force required to stop it are different?</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>No, but there's gravitational force and the normal force; they cancel out since the object isn't accelerating, but the terms are there, right?</p>
<p>Anyway, what you've explained appears to be that the gravitational force generated by an object is experimentally determined to be proportional to its mass with no higher-order terms.  If that were not the case, then the effect would be that g would not be a constant given &quot;small&quot; objects at a relatively constant distance from a &quot;large&quot; object, as different objects with different gravitational masses -- well, different gravitational/inertial mass ratios -- would be affected differently.  So the implicit assumption I was making was that g is constant in the limit of a &quot;large&quot; object and a &quot;small&quot; object whose changes in distance are small, and there is no known reason why it should be so (where &quot;large&quot; and &quot;small&quot; correspond to how much Property B they have).  Is this correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When two things seem totally unrelated, but &quot;coincidentally&quot; are measured to always be the same, it's a clue that something deeper is going on. It was this clue in fact, among other things, that led Einstein to his theory of gravity (known as &quot;General Relativity&quot;), which is one of the pillars of modern physics today. Einstein realized that if <strong><em>everything</em></strong> in a gravitational field falls (accelerates) at the same rate, no matter what it is, then gravity isn't really about <em>what's</em> falling, but <em>the falling motion itself</em>, which would be the same for any object. And what is motion but a trajectory through space and time. So in the framework of General Relativity, objects (and light too btw) in a gravitational field fall not because of a 'force' between them, but because space and time themselves are warped in the presence of matter.</p></div>		</li>
