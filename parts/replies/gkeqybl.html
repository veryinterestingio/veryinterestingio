			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm.  I've done some work on refurbishing huge power plant drive shafts.  One of the steps was to install a thin wear sleeve over the bearing surfaces.  We'd pack the shaft with hundreds of pounds of dry ice and wrap the sleeve with induction heating coils to get just barely enough clearance to slide the two together- couldn't have been more than a few thousandths of an inch.  By the time all the temperatures equalized, you'd have a perfect interference fit that could only be removed by destructively machining the sleeve off.  Really cool process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually a shrink fit. It's enhanced by cooling the part it's going on to. There's lots of fits. IIRC from tight to loose it's shrink, interference, press, slip, and running.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No. As long as the entire single-material object is unconstrained, thermal expansion results in equal* linear expansion (i.e., strain, change in length per unit length) everywhere. (And thermal contraction would result in contraction everywhere.)</p>
<p>Things change, however, if some part (e.g., the outer edge) of the object is constrained or if multiple materials are used, which might lead to interesting effects such as buckling.</p>
<p>*(For objects with microstructural directionality such as single crystals, the thermal expansion strain can be different in different directions, termed anisotropy. To my knowledge, no uniform material exhibits thermal expansion in one direction and thermal contraction in another**, although I suppose you could obtain this behavior with a well-designed composite.)</p>
<p>**Edit: Wrong: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0160932795935864" target="_blank">cordierite, B-eucryptite, and sodium zirconium phosphate, for example, can exhibit this behavior</a>. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022024800007715" target="_blank">Also aluminum tungstate</a>. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022459697976052" target="_blank">More discussion</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny you should mention cordierite; it's a naturally occurring mineral that was officially discovered in the 1800s, but was used long prior to that by the Norse cultures as sólarsteinns, literally &quot;sunstones&quot;. As these gems are naturally polarising, they could be held up to overcast or even stormy/snowy skies and turned carefully to locate where the sun was even through heavy cloud-cover. This allowed much more precise daytime navigation, especially in the high Arctic where skies are very often overcast. Dead-reckoning is a fool's errand when navigating and, in the high Arctic, compasses no longer function correctly due to the magnetic field changing as you approach either pole, so solar navigation was a must-have and sunstones were used to do so. </p>
<p>It should be noted, however, that not all cordierites (or the other main mineral used, Icelandic spar) are suitable. Some, due to variable crystalline structures, simply do not sufficiently filter the light and therefore don't work. This was all basically conjecture but, relatively recently, a box of Viking navigational aids were found on the Canadian coastline that included a small crystal with no clearly-discernible use. When held up to the sun, however, it was strongly polarising. Combined with the Icelandic allegory <em>Rauðúlfs þáttr</em>, which could be not-unreasonably Anglicised as &quot;Rudolph's Tale&quot;, which gives a fairly detailed guide on how sunstones were used, we're now reasonably confident that this is indeed what was found inside the navigational chest and was probably a common artefact used onboard ships, especially those navigating the high Arctic and towards the Canadian side of the Atlantic.</p></div>		</li>
