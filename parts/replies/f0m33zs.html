			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed, but that might change depending on what they're talking about. &quot;We raised one thousand eight hundred dollars&quot; or &quot;we're only 200 away from $2000.&quot; Both work equally fine in that scenario.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's very interesting.  The brain is fascinating.  I have a habit when writing down phone numbers, if the last digit ends in a zero, I will leave it off.  I guess because my brain thinks it is of no value?  Bad habit, so if I give a phone message to someone and they say, hey, that last digit is missing.  Ooops, it's a zero!  How do you know?  Trust me, it's a zero.  lol</p></div>		</li>
