			<div class="markdown"><p>It does not ruin everything.  There's not so much grease in a pizza box that it would contaminate the rest of the load.  The sorting process would simply find those boxes and throw them away.  Doesn't mean you should try and recycle it and let them deal with it, but it won't contaminate the entire load because one idiot threw away a pizza box.  Same with a #7 plastic bottle that most places don't take.  Just because one person threw that in there doesn't mean they're going to chuck your entire load.</p>
<p>However, if during the sorting process they miss it and it goes to the next step for processing (usually China and most of southeast asia, but not necessarily) then it WOULD be thrown away and would contaminate the entire batch because at that point, it's not possible to separate it.</p>
<p>There are curbside recycling companies that, if they notice something in your bin that isn't recyclable, will simply not pick it up at all to avoid any hassle and make the sorting process easier.  At that point, fix your problem, and they'll pick it up.</p>
<p>Cooking oil would contaminate everything, it soaks into everything (plastics, cardboard, etc) so if some idiot threw a bottle of that in the recycling with some oil still in it THAT could contaminate most of a load.  It's really egregious things like that that can harm an entire load.</p></div>		</li>
