			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but that is such a weird system. </p>
<p>The two main stars are both sun-sized-ish, orbiting each other. But their orbit is crazy, going from 11AU to 35AU. Then 1/5 of a LY away from both of them is Proxima, orbiting the main two on some crazy half-a-million-year long orbit, and it happens to have a planet in the habitable zone. </p>
<p>If you're on the confirmed planets in that system, you won't ever see two suns setting. You'll see one sun, very close by, and two very bright stars in the distance near each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Three body systems don't generally have stable orbits. Only the ones that can be effectually reduced to a two body problem have stable ones.</p>
<p>That means a planets where its orbital trajectory will go around one star and then sometimes around the other one don't exist, or if they do they don't exist for very long, probably not long enough to develop life.</p></div>		</li>
