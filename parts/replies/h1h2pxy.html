			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh wow thank you for the thoughtful reply. I didn’t even consider that it was more complex than a servicer loans me money, they own my debt, and I pay directly to them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question though, what happens if my 10k€ tranche-ified debt gets cancelled? I win the lottery, inherit a house and pay it off.</p>
<p>What's the &quot;by the books&quot; solution for this?</p>
<p>Edit: also the best eli5 answer to op I've read so far. Most are by people without IT knowledge who say &quot;probably&quot; a lot, lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You paying off your debt is different than your debt being canceled without resolution/repayment, but it actually won't matter much to all the tranches themselves either way. Whether you pay it off all in one go, or get it written off without payment, you're just very slightly affecting the rate of all those tranches' return (which is how it turns into pension money). But debts are broken up and put into tranches exactly for this reason: the person who buys the tranche ends up with a steady stream of repayment money coming in, regardless of how any individual debtor is handling their payments. </p>
<p>The only way to have a significant effect on a tranche would be if everyone whose debt was bundled into a given tranche all did the same thing (either paid it off in one go or got the loan canceled without payment) at exactly the same time. Then either the tranche owner gets a REALLY big one-time payday, or is SOL. But the reason tranches are used is to avoid that exact volatility.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As the other reply said, your one loan being paid off doesn't really change much. It's not uncommon for tranches to hold billions of dollars in debts, and your debt could be scattered across several tranches.</p>
<p>There is also the fact that the tranches typically aren't traded, just sold/bought once. </p>
<p>As far as mechanics, your payment gets paid into the tranche, and your debt there is updated. From there the tranche pays it's shareholders (mostly other tranches) and the data is propagated.</p>
<p>Of course there are safeguards so that your personal information isn't widely available, but the necessary information is kept in several databases and spreadsheets.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The biggest thing to understand is that your bank doesn't keep your debt to themselves. Instead your bank sells that debt to others, usually combined with other debts in a tranche.  Think of a tranche as a slushie of a large number of debts, poured into manageable portions for sale.</p>

<p>I've heard multiple stories about banks that attempted to foreclose on a property after the housing bubble, but could not because they couldn't provide the 'note' showing they actually owned the property.   It has been sold/re-sold so much it was eventually lost.  </p>
<p>Don't think this could happen with student loans (as there is nothing to repossess).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So after a massive amount of complexity it can't be done because it can be reconstructed. And even if you did wipe it out by law, the impact on your grandparents' pension would be unrecoverable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I say stuff like this all the time.   It's not like the debt is all owned by &quot;Big Bad Banker Boy&quot;; its owned by us.   </p>
<p>As a drop-out that just got out of working at a University System, I would suggest don't borrow money unless you are getting a professional degreed at a public school.   Don't go to private school unless you have a scholarship.</p></div>		</li>
