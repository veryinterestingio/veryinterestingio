			<div class="markdown"><p>Said middle age female presented for a mental health assessment where I practiced as a clinical social worker. In the assessment the psychosis, paranoia, and delusions were all evident...to the extent I consulted with one of our psychiatric NPs regarding involuntary commitment. When the arrived at the ER shortly after, they noticed right away she never picked up an antibiotic prescription a week ago for a UTI. The untreated UTI had gotten much worse and started causing the psychiatric symptoms*. </p>
<p>*Assuming they got better when she took the antibiotic. She was scheduled to follow up with primary care. I will probably never know for sure. </p>
<p>TL/DR: Rule out medical issues, even when someone is younger than you might anticipate.</p></div>		</li>
