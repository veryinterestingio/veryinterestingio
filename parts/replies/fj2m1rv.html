			<div class="markdown"><p>I have this all the time and its horrfying. I cant move or anything. I just lay still, being wide awake. Sometimes I can pull my self out of it and open my eyes. Its like something is pushiing me down and I cant move or open my eyes. Usually takes like 30 seconds before I can wake my self up from it, but once I was so pissed I literally said ''Fuck this not again'' and literally jumped out of bed trying to get self out of it so hard lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its not exactly sleep paralysis. I dont have any nightmares or anything. Like yes it is sleep paralysis obviously, im paralysized, but Ive had real sleep paralysis before and its not exactly comparable to what I get. Like it usually happesn when Im extremely tired, I can lay down in bed and close my eyes and it INSTANTLY happens and I cannot move or open my eyes unless I force my self to with great effort. I can still feel my entire body and try to wiggle, but in sleep paralysis i cant feel my body at all, I just see a nightmare or something.</p></div>		</li>
