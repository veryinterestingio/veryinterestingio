<p>So just to be clear it’s more efficient to go straight up to reduce air resistance quicker then to gradually go up?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I think this can be a bit confusing. This does <em>not</em> mean that the vehicle would travel across the sky from directly overhead to the horizon in the time it takes for the coin to drop. It means that it would travel the distance from where you are to where your horizon is, which for a six-foot person is about three miles.</p>
<p>This would be a very small amount of travel across the sky, less than one degree.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it's not very efficient to go straight up then do a 90° sharp turn either. The most efficient trajectory is to start vertically but begin turning sideways very gradually but as soon as it's out of the thickest part of the atmosphere. </p>
<p>In fact, do this perfectly, and you can use Earth's gravity alone to follow this trajectory, rather than trying to maintain directional control with thrust vectoring. This is called a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_turn" target="_blank">gravity turn</a> and it's most efficient because all of the thrust from the engines goes towards gaining forward momentum and not making course adjustments unless necessary.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Just to clarify, most satellites are about <em>22,000 miles</em> further up.</p>
<p>Edit:  Poor choice of words.  My comment was meant to highlight the extreme variation in useful Earth orbits, not be an accurate accounting of their population.</p></div>		</li>
