			<div class="markdown"><p>Good explanation. I guess it might be common sense, but since this is eli5 after all, the explanation should've been that &quot;Air is everywhere at all times, so there is no start, the heating up of that said air is the start&quot;..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is the wind the energy transferring or the particles moving? If I could pick a single piece of air and highlight it so I could see it, would it be drifting along the wind current or would it be bouncing into the next particle to push into the next particle, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's... both. Still air is moving in that the molecules are bouncing off one another but on average, going nowhere. (The amount of kinetic energy we measure as temperature.) With wind, there's still all the bouncing and transfering of energy, but there's a net average displacement.</p></div>		</li>
