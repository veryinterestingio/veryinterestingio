			<div class="markdown"><p>The use of the word 'proposed' is key. There are lots of ideas about this, but little has been proven. In my view, it likely comes down to the molecules produced by the bacteria or as a result of the bacteria, entering the bloodstream and reaching the brain. It could be bacteria that modulate the barrier function of the gut to optimize what is adsorbed and what is not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To tack onto this, it’s not just circulating metabolites but also microbial products that can directly bind receptors on the vagus nerve. This can directly impact brain activity as the vagal nerve connects to various important structures in the brainstem! Gut barrier function is also super important,  because the microbial metabolites that get into the bloodstream aren’t always good. For example, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a component of bacterial cell walls that can trigger and immune response and increase inflammatory signalling</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really important question! There is a lot of work asking these questions in animal models, especially in mice, flies, and worms (among many others). Some of the most supported ideas that have experimental evidence (at least in lab settings) 1) microbes can make or degrade neuroactive substances like neurotransmitters that may or may not actually reach the brain, 2) microbes can induce the host to make neuroactive substance or alter neurodevelopment), 3) microbes can directly signal to the central nervous system through the vagal nerve, which connects the GI tract to the brain, and 4) microbes can impact host physiology, and that ends up affecting brain functioning. The microbiota and the nervous system are both (almost?) indescribably complex, so it's really hard to prove these in human studies, but there is a lot of work trying to correlate specific aspects of the microbiota with specific activity of the human brain (e.g. connecting 16S sequencing/transcriptomics/proteomics/metabolomics with either outputs like fMRI readings or specific neurological conditions).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In agreement with u/Suspicious_Dinner_31 that we are still very much trying to understand the exact mechanisms at play. If I were to chime in with my impressions from the research, I would say that some of the proposed ideas include:</p>
<p>- Metabolites produced by the microbiota that protect the gut barrier<br />
- Metabolites that enter circulation and potentially cross the blood brain barrier<br />
- Anti-inflammatory metabolites produced by the microbiota that help maintain normalcy and protect against systemic inflammation. Inflammation is implicated both in depression and in neurodegeneration.<br />
- The production and modification of neurotransmitters by the microbiota (although it's worth saying that serotonin produced in the gut, as far as we know, mostly carries out gut-affiliated functions and is distinct from the serotonin seen in the brain)<br />
- Communication from the enteric nervous system to the brain via the vagus nerve<br />
- Actual infiltration by microbes into the brain (uncommon, but proposed as potential triggers of neurodegeneration). This may be in partnership with an inflammatory disruption of the gut and/or blood brain barriers.   </p>
<p>There are probably others too! Excited to see what my other panelists say.</p></div>		</li>
