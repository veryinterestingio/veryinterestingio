			<div class="markdown"><p>So, if previous infections can be a trigger for autoimmune disease because the immune system “learned” to attack something which turned out to be friendly fire against the body itself, and a disease like Measles has been shown to “wipe” the immune system, is it potentially beneficial for a person with autoimmune disease to have a hard-reset infection like Measles?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very unlikely, because those types of infections generally cause a lot more damage, and also because your immune system would have to work very hard just do deal with everything which it is exposed to on a daily basis that a trained immune system does not have to spend much effort on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have to think what it's caused by. Here's a trusted source if you wish to read into it: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4539174/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4539174/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4539174/</a></a>.</p>
<p>In short; it's a chronic inflammation of the bowels. The causes are a combination of genetic predispositions, gut microbiome and other environmental factors. Crohn's disease in particular is caused by the overproduction of certain cytokines by immune cells.</p></div>		</li>
