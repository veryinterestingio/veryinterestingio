			<div class="markdown"><p>But what i think op wants to know is why do these colors fall outside of that triangle? What is the cause of the technical limiation that prevents them from being displayed?</p>
<p>I'm guessing it has to do with the available wavelengths for leds, phosphors, or whatever display tech one is using. Different chemical combos give off different light colprs and can only be tweaked so much by different dopings, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might have heard that we have 3 types of cones, or color detecting cells, in our retina that each detect one color of light. However, they actually detect a range of colors to <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/vision/imgvis/colcon.png" target="_blank">different degrees (the link is a graph of how strongly each type of cone responds to a given frequency of light, plotted along the bottom)</a>. The red cone actually responds strongest to yellow light and still picks up a lot of green light, and the green cone responds at least a little bit to blue and red as well. This is why computer screens can get away with only 3 colors of light, because combining those is close enough to what your eye would detect anyways. However, that means you can only go from no green to all green, or blue, or red. Combining blue and green light to make cyan means that the red cone is going to be lit up by the green light more so than if it was actual cyan light hitting your retina. </p>
<p>If you were mixing blue and yellow paint to make green, it's never going to be as intense as if you started with a green dye, because the blue paint is going to absorb some yellow light and vice versa. The combination of blue and yellow light is going to be interpreted as green but the total effect is less than if it was reflecting all of the equivalent green light; as you add more colors to this paint it is going to reflect less and less light until it becomes essentially black. The same effect in reverse occurs in lighted displays. Mixing different colors of light is going to make the result closer to white than a pure color would be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your eye can see parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, as illustrated in the graph. The design of the eye on based on broad-band filters, not narrow-band ones; this is the design that allows it to see a color space that's only somewhat triangular.  It's an excellent approach, but very, very expensive to replicate. Instead, the makers of RGB monitors are choosing narrow-band pixel filters at 3 points in the space, and they can thus display the range of colors between those three points.  When you look at the &quot;blue pixel&quot; you see a narrow band of blue light because that sort of filter is affordable to make millions of on your monitor.</p>
<p>To make colors outside those points displays would need more extreme colors, which would be hard to generate and result in the display being able to produce colors humans couldn't see.  That's quite inefficient, and to sell displays you need them to be good enough and cost effective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>dumb version is we don't have devices that can make the exact right blue and green to make the full cyan range.</p>
<p>not sure if this is correct, tho. i'm talking out of my ass theorizing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a notional concept of a color space.  There are pixels in that image that aren't different, because they lay outside the triangle.  Throughout the graphic, the color is approximate, and outside the triangle it's more of a coarse approximation.</p></div>		</li>
