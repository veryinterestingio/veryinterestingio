			<div class="markdown"><p>A few years ago now I was considering applying for a clinical trial of BMT as an experimental treatment for my severe Crohn’s Disease. At the time, I was unresponsive or allergic to all available meds and I already had surgery to remove everything from my sigmoid colon to my anus, leaving me with a colostomy and a “Barbie butt.” Then, when the CD spread to other parts of my body they had no clue what to do.</p>
<p>The study cited that in every case where a CD patient has had BMT for their cancer, their Crohn’s was also cured, not just remission- but totally gone. This, of course, is assuming they survived the transplant. I believe there were something like 11 or 13 cases that both the cancer and the Crohn’s was fully cured. I considered it but ultimately decided not to apply because the study was in Seattle and I’m in CA and I couldn’t afford moving for the 6 mos of treatment and would have had to leave my job, and then I really could not have afforded it. </p>
<p>Luckily for me, a new biologic medication became available and we decided to try it before considering more extreme measured. I’ve been in remission ever since (thank the gods) But someday I will run out of meds that work again (it keeps happening and a new drugs comes out just in the nick of time). I don’t think I would ever consider BMT (if that trial was even successful) again because of the high risk of the procedure. I like to live, even with Crohn’s disease!</p></div>		</li>
