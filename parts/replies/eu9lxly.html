			<div class="markdown"><p>There are some facial expressions we can more positively correlate with evolutionary biology. Surprise often is accompanied with physically retracting or freezing, opening your eyes very wide, and appearing as what's colloquially known as a &quot;deer in headlights&quot; expression</p>
<p>Nothing too cultural about that. You get big eyed to let in more light so you can assess your situation, you retract because dangerous stuff is bad, and if you freeze and stand there looking stupid, it's most likely because our dumb animal brains think dangerous things can't see you if you don't move</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not quite that our brains assume things can't see us...</p>
<p>Predators have what's called a Prey Drive. Felines and canines in particular have a very strong instinct to chase. Prey animals evolved freezing in place as an attempt to counter that instinct. They stay very still in the hopes that the predator will be distracted by something else and move on. As soon as they flee, the prey drive kicks in and the hunt is on. </p>
<p>That's why hikers are warned not to run away from animals like wolves, coyotes, cougars, and bears. If you run, they <em>will</em> chase. It's just their instincts kicking in. Slowly moving towards a predator animal, by the way, is also dangerous. That slow stalking is how predators hunt; you don't want a bear thinking you're hunting him. Just chill out, make lots of noise, and carry on your way, without turning your back to the animal or approaching it head on. You're neither predator nor prey; just a big, potentially dangerous thing that's best avoided and left alone. </p>
<p>This innate prey drive is also why your dog loves to run after things like balls and rabbits. If you want to get your dog to come to you, get his attention and try running <em>away</em> from him while calling.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Interesting, because our dumb animal brains are wrong about some things and silent about all things but right about this within a certain context. If you ever are being sought by predators or enemies who rely on sight and sound, then the advice to &quot;Freeze!&quot; might be good advice, the way stopped clocks occasionally provide the right information when you wander past the mod-12 memorial of the hour and minute that they became generally useless. If only it were as easy to replace the usually-useless &quot;Freeze!&quot; advice that our dumb animal brain gives us all the time with something that was even marginally more useful, like &quot;Enjoy!&quot; or &quot;Think!&quot; or...</p></div>		</li>
