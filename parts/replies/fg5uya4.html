			<div class="markdown"><p>That is partly correct.</p>
<p>It is that the Google play store requires phone manufacturers to include the full G suite of apps and services on their phones. They also have it that the phone manufacturers can't offer a phone without the G suite if they are licensing G suite.</p>
<p>Android/AOSP works fine without G suite.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AOSP works fine without the G suite but a <em>huge</em> number of apps distributed via the play store depend on Google Play Services in some way (and not just for stuff that's directly related to Play Store functionality), effectively making pure AOSP Android phones second-class citizens.</p>
<p>Note that most features of the Google Play Services have alternatives available, but it provides some convenience services that are on all &quot;official&quot; Android phones, so developers tend to not look for alternatives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if you cant run YouTube without Google Play Services installed, you can run Google Play Services without YouTube installed. Except Google makes manufacturers distribute YouTube in order to distribute Google Play services - which is pretty much a core component.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And Google does this deliberately. Google have <em>removed</em> stuff from the Android OS over time, and put it into Google Play Services, because if it was in the Android OS itself then they wouldn't be able to pressure manufacturers like this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And Google knows they wouldn't bother looking for alternatives because beyond the fact that it's too much work for the company, it's also too much work for the users. Once word gets out that &quot;apps do not work properly on this phone, you need to find fixes for everything&quot;, sales would drop harder than a gamer's panties when they see Henry Cavill. </p>
<p>There are tons of people who use Edge/IE because they don't want to bother with installing a new browser, don't know how to or even do not know that there are alternatives. Convenience has to be number one priority for manufacturers and Google uses it to their advantage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to root your phone and install a custom rom to completely remove all that crap, though.  Otherwise it's just &quot;disabled&quot;, and that will probably change to &quot;enabled&quot; on a software update.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have used my Android phone without any Google crap for a long period of time. Had no problems of any kind.</p>
<p>The only reason I don't install a custom ROM and go Google-less on my current phone is because I use Snapchat and it is a pain in the ass to use on non-stock software.</p>
<p>I hope I find a sollution to the Snapchat problem asap, because I really feel tracked by all those useless apps when using my phone.</p></div>		</li>

Google says you can have our  Gameboy for free as long also use our free games, batteries and headphones, even if you normally can make more money by getting someone to pay you to use their  games, batteries and headphones on our Gameboy.</p></div>		</li>

Ok we won't give you the necessary thing to make your android phone fuction like it should so you basically have a &quot;bootleg&quot; phone</p>
<p>Microsoft offers full versions of windows without their apps on contries were they would get in trouble, google doesn't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Play Services are more akin to common libraries.  A Windows equivalent would be core DLLs.</p>
<p>It's much easier to link these at executable time, and as others have said - this also means that Google are not beholden to individual carriers' and manufacturers' release management processes.</p></div>		</li>
