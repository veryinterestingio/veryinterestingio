			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, the microphone on an answering machine is awful. There won’t be any low or high frequency content at all. </p>
<p>If you know anyone who has a proper vocal microphone, you could try with that. You’ll be surprised at the difference a good microphone can make. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have the opposite problem. My voice sounds fairly animated and not especially deep in my head. When I hear a recording, my voice is quite a lot deeper and waaaay more monotone. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can think that...</p>
<p>But echoes are particularly strong reflections from surfaces in the environment that sound hits and bounces back to your ears. </p>
<p>In reality the sound going through the bones of your skull is travelling faster (sound travels faster through solids and liquids than air) and reaching your ears before the direct external sound from your mouth and way before any external first reflection and reverberation from the environment. </p>
<p>If anything, it’s pre-echo. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got familiar with the differences in my voice by writing songs and singing them (purely as a hobby) so now I’m never surprised by how my voice sounds recorded when singing... but when talking is a whole other story. I have a much thicker southern accent when talking than I perceive in my head. Explain that one heh </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s how thick your southern accent is. Psychologically speaking, most people don’t think that they themselves have an accent, but everyone else does. </p>
<p>There’s a difference between hearing information, which your brain wants to decode from sound, and <em>just</em> hearing the actual sound (frequency content and amplitude) that is there.</p>

<p>Essentially, the brain hears what it wants to hear. </p>
<p>(I’m currently doing a Masters on the Psychoacoustic effect of the Mastering process, whether people can tell if it was done by a machine algorithm or a human.) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't think I had to much of an accent going on.</p>
<p>Listened to a video of me my sister took last week (playing with my son so nothing serious or deliberate) and I have the most uptight English accent possible. I sound like I've escaped from an  episode of Downton Abbey.</p>
<p>I fully understand why 'my attitude' rubs some people up the wrong way now - I sound like I'm faking it for the sake of appearing better than they are. </p></div>		</li>
