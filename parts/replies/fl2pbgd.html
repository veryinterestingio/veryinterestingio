<p>It has been 25 years since I took chemistry so please excuse any mistakes I make. But mostly it's so you don't need make calculations. A .5N acid will neutralize a .5N base. Everything I buy reagent wise is in Normality. All standard methods are in Normality. I think every titration I have done since college has been with Normality. Honestly I haven't even thought about molarity since college.</p>

<p>Also I'm in a industrial chemistry lab. I don't do any research. I just make sure the product meets the specs. Most of my work is in wastewater and I ( just like every waste water lab in the us) is methods from the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater. I need to determine nitrogen in a sample standard methods 4500n</p>

<p>Most laboratories take from this and make your procedure and strip out all the stuff that doesn't apply to your work. Cause the actual methods can be very broad because it's a basic blue print on how to test pretty much anything.</p></div>		</li>
