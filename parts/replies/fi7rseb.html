What does it mean if fever disappears for a day or two and then comes back? You picked up another virus or complications developed from the first one?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It likely means that you cleared the viral infection (the fever stopped) but subsequently picked up a bacterial infection (new fever!). The term for this is super infection, which sounds a lot more serious than it usually is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, so that’s when the antibiotics are a good idea? Would you be able to know if round two is a viral or bacterial? That’s not obvious, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I went in to the doctor today for this exact exact reason. I also have bilateral atelectasis. I've had pneumonia multiple times and pneumothorax so when my cough goes on too long, I don't mess around. Thanks for sharing your knowledge!</p></div>		</li>
