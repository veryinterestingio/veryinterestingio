			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question.  There are many that I really love, so its a hard choice.  I guess I would have to say the Indri, a monotypic genus and the largest of the living lemurs.  But the muriquis, genus Brachyteles, from the Atlantic forest region fo Brazil are also high on the list, as are the very unusual short-tailed uakaris, genus Cacajao, from Amazonia.</p></div>		</li>

Uakaris look a bit scary to me.</p></div>		</li>
