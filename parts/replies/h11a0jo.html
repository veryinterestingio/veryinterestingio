<p>Government agencies value it because people who don't realize it's a fraud sometimes make damaging admissions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the stated reason why they are still used by OPM in background investigations. So many people believe they work that people admit to stuff and get disqualified.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The polygraph is just one portion of a comprehensive background investigation.  Also if you fail one test, they will often invite you back to take another, since a lot of the time &quot;failures&quot; are just high stress and not real failures.  They also don't fail you based simply on one persons reading, but have a secondary non-biased person look at the results.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also promotes this idea that we can evaluate truthfulness. Then the next conclusion is that if we can determine truthfulness we can ask questions and dig as deep as we want because we are not giving liars an edge.</p>
<p>Problematically this leads to people who are easily evaluated by the test or people who are naturally honest being subjected to much more scrutiny.</p>
<p>For example where does the question have you have committed a crime lead after it is asked.  More questions. Obviously every person answers yes to the first question but how deep that goes depends on how much life experience a person has and when and how well they decide to lie. Unless they truly have lived that boring life where they never downloaded a some or video game.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, in the same way that Wikipedia sounds &quot;biased&quot; when their article on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_of_the_Earth" target="_blank">shape of the Earth</a> explicitly mentions that it's a sphere in the opening paragraph. It turns out that the correct response, when looking into a practice like polygraphy and finding that it's pseudo-scientific bunk, is to update your position and build in a &quot;bias&quot; against it.</p></div>		</li>
