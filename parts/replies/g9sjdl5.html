<p>Do chickens &quot;try to retrieve&quot; very faint memories? Perhaps they do, but how could we possibly know that?</p>

<p>As an aside, sentience research exists. This sort of thing I'm guessing you would measure by problem solving, and observing behavioural tells when the chicken solves problems that it has encountered before.</p>
<p>Not sure if you could differentiate between thinking and retrieving memories, but someone more knowledgeable than I would know. I'm guessing if you performed brain scans you'd know which part of the brain was involved (logical problem solving or memory retrieval), but I'm not certain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very likely, chickens can, and do, retrieve very faint memories.</p>
<p>But, do they <em>try</em> to retrieve faint memories? That is a much, much harder question. The OP asked &quot;what is happening inside your brain when you're trying to retrieve a very faint memory?&quot;</p>
<p>For that matter, humans can, and do, retrieve very faint memories. Does <em>trying</em> make us more successful? No one knows that, either. I think we've all had the experience of trying, and failing, to retrieve a faint memory. Sometimes, it helps to stop trying to retrieve it. Then, after a little while, it 'comes to you.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This question might be more observable: When something spontaneously “comes to you,” is it because the brain is still “working in the background” to try to retrieve that memory while you’re primarily engaged in something else?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read something somewhere that when you're focusing on trying to remember something you can become too focused, and hence not thinking about it frees up your brain to try a wider range of things. Hence it pops into your head spontaneously later. It's probably way more complex than that though, but next time you're struggling to remember something try not thinking about it for a bit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, brain scans don't really tell you much. FMRI machines work by reading the movement of magnetic fields in the body, essentially they map blood flow. The problem is that the brain works as much by inhibition as by excitation, so its hard to tell if that blood flow is being used to boost the signal from a particular part of the brain, or telling that part to shut up and not drown out the more important activity happening somewhere else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the definition of thinking vs remembering is not very clear, but “thought” usually involves a longer process of contemplating, future planning, etc. Remembering can be a very short process that happens within hundreds of milliseconds, for example the decision to turn left or right on a familiar path. In this case it is not considered as thought. But the brain probably does not have two different systems for remembering and thought, rather the processes for remembering where extended and became more complex over time to accommodate the process of thinking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's because we don't.  We have a lot of information, we're learning more and more all the time about how the human brain works.  The more we learn though, the more we realize just how much we have yet to learn.   </p>
<p>A part of me suspects that to understand our own brains well, we would need something a lot smarter than ourselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just want to point out that many “speculations” that are posted here are in fact based on established scientific findings. There are many things about the brain that we don’t know, but there is also quite a bit that we do know by now. Therefore, just saying “we don’t know” is more lazy than scientific.</p></div>		</li>
