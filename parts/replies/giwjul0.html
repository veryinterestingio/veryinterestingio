			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to that, there are several mechanisms by which spectra are broadened. For example, the fact that atoms and molecules are moving at high speeds in most instances allows them to interact with light at different wavelengths because of the Doppler effect - if the molecule/atom is moving away from the light source, light would be perceived as having a lower frequency from the perspective of the molecule/atom. The distribution of random speeds in random directions symmetrically broadens the absorption bands, allowing for a wider range of energies to excite the transitions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That also happens, yes. As I said, there are several mechanisms that broaden spectra. The ones I remember from the top of my head are the vibronic couplings, Doppler effect, isotopic effects, uncertainty principle and differences in the topology of the potential energy surfaces of the excited and relaxed states.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a way, yes. Each of those categories can sometimes have  overlapping ranges within it  depending on the atom or molecule. Particularly for vibrational in complex molecules there is considerable overlap between the more complex vibrational modes, and also in electronic excitation the more different electron transitions you have the more likely some of them are to overlap and start to blur the spectral lines.</p>
<p>However each individual category itself mostly doesn't overlap on the other. Rotational is usually in the microwave frequencies (thus how a microwave oven works), Vibrational is mostly IR, and electronic is mostly UV/Visible and above. This is why you use completely different spectrometers to analyse each absorption type.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But energy of the photon shouldn't change according to the Doppler effect right? Just because I'm moving away or towards a light beam, the energy of it shouldn't change right? Or does it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does. The energy is relative to the frame you are in. The speed of a light beam does not change between inertial frames, but the energy of the light particles does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to expand on this, the &quot;Heisenberg&quot;-like tradeoff in uncertainties here follows from the fact that energy and time are conjugate variables in quantum mechanics, in the same sense that position and momentum are.</p></div>		</li>
