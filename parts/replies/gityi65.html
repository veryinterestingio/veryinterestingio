<p>Other countries don't have the same laws requiring dealerships.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this just speculation or data based information? A lot of service department, at least here, deals with recalls, warranty based work, province inspection and tons of body related maintenance. Cars have 5 years warrenty on drivetrain (very little money to make during that time) and by that time, a lot of customer buy a new car or get any engine work done at smaller garages.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When you have companies who are already differentiating themselves by pushing meaningful OTA software upgrades, always updated maps, long lasting batteries, etc.. it's going to be pretty hard to convince people to buy your car that has none of that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a catch-22.  Car dealers have tried flat, fixed pricing over the years (think Saturn).  Eventually it's always failed because customers think if they are paying the &quot;sticker price&quot; they aren't &quot;getting a deal.&quot;</p>
<p>So customers by and large bring this on themselves.</p>
<p>The last car we bought new was in very high demand, so we had to pay sticker price.  The whole process was pretty straightforward, without cheating, manipulation and lies. But were paying the price on the sticker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, actually. The dealership requirements were written as a consumer protection law after widespread abuse by car companies back in the early days of the auto industry. Cars were made by any bill, bob, or jane. You could have a car body made by one company, with a chassis or &quot;coach&quot;, hence the term &quot;coachworks&quot;) made by another, an engine made by a third.</p>
<p>You'd buy your car, take it home...and discover that nobody in your city, or state, or even region - could service it. Couldn't get parts, or nobody knew how some non-standard mechanism worked, or maybe every bolt or screw on it used some weird head/socket your mechanic didn't have. Or maybe it'd turn out that some part was so badly built that it barely lasted long enough to make it home.</p>
<p>Maybe nobody existed that could service it <em>period</em> except the original manufacturer who..oops...disappeared in the months following the sale. Even if they didn't disappear, shipping your car back to the manufacturer for repair obviously isn't very cost effective. And some car companies counted on that fact.</p>
<p>The dealership requirement forces the car manufacturer to demonstrate they are solvent enough to enter into partnerships with other companies (dealers) and that they have at least one location, in state, that sells parts and provides service for said brand.</p>
<p>This also assures better consumer protection, because the customer can more easily pursue legal action against an in-state company, an in-state company is held to your state's consumer protection laws, and they can't shift jurisdiction to somewhere more favorable to them or that would force you to travel to (or hire a lawyer in) their state.</p>
<p>People often mention Telsa as getting &quot;screwed&quot; by these requirements and how &quot;unfair&quot; it is to Tesla. Well, let's take a look at Tesla:</p>
<ul>
<li>they do not make any parts available via automotive parts distributors. They require a VIN number. They don't sell parts to anyone with a VIN number they consider to not be &quot;road worthy&quot;. Youtuber Richrepairs has run into this many times; they seem to arbitrarily declare cars no longer road worthy. <strong>No other automotive manufacturer does this.</strong> GM or Ford will happily sell you a compete crate engine and they won't care if you're putting it into a Yugo, a boat, or the world's most overpowered blender.</li>
<li>they do not provide any information on how to repair their vehicles in the US except in the one state they are mandated by law to do so (Massachusetts) and similarly in the EU. This is incredibly anti-consumer and again, <strong>no other company does this</strong>. Your local garage can get info on how to repair almost any vehicle through services like Alldata...but not if you have a Tesla.</li>
<li>Tesla's parts supply chain, particularly for bodyparts, is piss-poor, with owners often waiting months for parts and often vehicles are declared totaled because of the parts cost for collision damage. This parts shortage is because Tesla is throwing as much inventory as they can into production, and they're doing that because they nearly went out of business from losing so much money.</li>
<li>Tesla service centers are few and far between. In my state, there are three Tesla dealers, and they are all for some bizarre reason about a half hour drive from each other, and something like two hours from either end of our state. I didn't do an exhaustive search, but the only major car companies I can come up with that have a worse presence in our state are Ferrari, Lamborghini, Bentley, and Rolls Royce.</li>
<li>Teslas are the only EV on the market to use a non-standard charging plug. While &quot;superchargers&quot; used to be much faster than anything else you could get, DC fast charging is now available for almost any EV and some cars offer nearly the same speed, but using standardized connectors. While you can buy adapters to charge a Tesla off standard chargers, only Teslas can charge off supercharger stations. There are adapters for charging any car off the non-DC-fast-charge &quot;destination&quot; chargers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now consider that Tesla now deactivates features when you sell your Tesla, considering them &quot;licensed&quot; to you not the car, and has significantly increased the cost of supercharging...</p>
<p>Tesla is a massive step backward in terms of consumer protection. Frankly for years the reliability on them was atrocious, particularly the drive unit - with them needing replacement at shockingly short intervals. Tesla can't even manage to build cars that don't break their own windows, and it tries to blame the breaking windows on the owner's garage or changing weather in the area. In decades of car ownership I've never had a single window break due to weather...</p></div>		</li>

<p>In what way does it benefit the consumer to forcibly insert a middleman between them and the manufacturer, instead of allowing them to buy directly from them like most other technical / engineering industries? Middlemen like car dealers don't generally add any value to a transaction; they only extract it, making the whole thing more expensive for the customer for no reason. That was true long before the automobile was invented and it will still be true as long as humans have any kind of currency-based economy. Mandating that new cars be sold through dealerships instead of directly from the manufacturer never benefitted anybody except the dealers, who get paid for doing nothing of worth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Assurance there is at least one place in your state you can buy parts / get service.</p>
<p>Assurance the manufacturer is reputable enough that someone wants to enter a business relationship with them.</p>
<p>Assurance that if you cannot resolve a dispute you can bring an in-state party to court in your state, and you are covered by your state's consumer protection laws.</p>

<p>Guaranteed ability to repair, is a single major reason that this was implemented. </p>
<p>Dealers before laws like this were not required to support all the brands they sold, and you'd be damned if a local mechanic supported everything themselves, and it'd make it more expensive as there's no such thing as third-party warranty service at that time (and kind of isn't now, as it's dealer expectations for coverage). </p>
<p>So you could go and buy an Audi, and find out nobody in your city/county/state/province actually repairs/maintains them, and your dealer doesn't sell enough to feel it's necessary to support post-sale on them. </p>
<p>And the dealers kind of rightfully argued that it's unreasonable to support so many brands in-house, so government told them &quot;fine, so just sell one, and support that wholly&quot; and forced them to.</p></div>		</li>
