			<div class="markdown"><p>Iâ€™m no expert. Solubility of gas is dependent on both pressure and temperature. Higher pressure or lower temperature will increase solubility. A good experiment would be to pour a refrigerated bottled coke and place a fountain coke in identical glasses on the counter at the same time, then measure bubbliness at predetermined intervals lol.</p></div>		</li>
