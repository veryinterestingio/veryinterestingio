<p>I'm not looking for an argument, but... I never said that outliers make a rule false.  (Almost) every rule has exceptions, and this is one of them.  It just so happens that this <em>particular</em> one has a LOT of exceptions.  </p>
<p>I (and my professor) just found it funny that it was being taught as something that is absolutely true in every case.  <em>That</em> is not true.  </p>
<p>I am perfectly willing to lay the blame on my textbook - my school uses the cheapest ones they can get (a blessing and a curse).  It's not untypical for me and/or my professors to find 2-3 significant factual errors per chapter, especially in the physics and math textbooks.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Personally doubted the statement to begin with, but /u/Ide5ign pretty much described what I was thinking after I read it. In the same position as them (only slightly longer ring finger 6 foot sprinting machine), and not seeing the results of said study I'm lead to believe it's false, but there may be <em>some</em> correlation.</p>
<p>but also you must not have learned much in school if you think all research studies are accurate.</p>
<p>I looked for it but couldn't find it if someones got a link</p></div>		</li>
