			<div class="markdown"><p>Think about what I just said though... one satellite per 15,350 SQUARE MILES. I mean 1 satellite per square mile would be a very low probability, now imagine having 15,000 times that much area. The mind isn't really good at comprehending these numbers, but basically you have a much better chance of dying every time you drive your car than the odds that a rocket would hit anything. And there's a much better chance the rocket will explode during ascent due to a technical failure than due to collision. I am not saying they shouldn't track these things, obviously they should. But when you actually look at the numbers, you start to get an idea for how big space really is.</p></div>		</li>
