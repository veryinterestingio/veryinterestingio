			<div class="markdown"><p>You're the second person that I've seen on this Reddit with a magnet implant in finger, and it was brought up in an otherwise unrelated type of post such as this when I first came across it. So therefore I must hypothesize that this is like much more common than I ever would have guessed. Let's just say that it's not extremely uncommon. There must be thousands of people with freakin' magnets in their fingers just walking around on the streets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and technically it does, all the time. And you can look up Gamma Ray Bursts to learn about a very exciting way for all life on Earth to be extinguished instantly with no warning. But the way you’ve phrased your question leads me to believe you have a misconception of what an EMP is. An ElectroMagnetic Pulse (EMP) is <em>not</em> a large amount of electricity. It’s not really like electricity, and it’s not in anyway like a bolt of lightning. It won’t electrocute you. It’s a large amount of electromagnetic radiation.</p>
<p>The electromagnetic spectrum is broken down into categories that are differentiated by how much energy the radiation carries. Here are some broad categories, listed from most energetic to least energetic. You’ve probably heard of all of them.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Gamma Rays</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>X-Rays</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UltraViolet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Visible Light</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Infrared</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Microwaves</p>
</li>
<li>Radiowaves</li>
</ol>
<p>For this subreddit, the only meaningful difference in these types of EM radiation is how much energy they carry.</p>
<p>UltraViolet, known as UV Rays, are strong enough to cause sunburns after a couple hours. Long-term exposure can lead to skin cancer. I don’t know if you consider that to be the radiation doing the killing, but let’s keep going.</p>
<p>X-Rays are stronger still, and will lead to cancer much faster, which is why the doctor leaves the room for a full body x-ray. Don’t worry, single doses are safe enough to image our bones without killing us.</p>
<p>Gamma Rays are the most energetic category. You actually do encounter this in your daily life, just as a function of living on a planet and orbiting a star, but it’s such small amounts that it’s nothing to be concerned about. Significant exposure to gamma rays is what makes nuclear radiation so deadly. Going in the unsafe areas of a nuclear power plant, even with proper safety gear, will fill you with gamma radiation and you will almost certainly die of radiation sickness/poisoning after as little as 30 minutes of exposure. Thankfully, nuclear power plants are built with pretty strict safety requirements, and the average exposure to radiation is actually lower near nuclear plant than near a coal-fired one, thanks to those restrictions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, so if an EMP is a large amount of electromagnetic radiation, which type is it?  Yes I've heard of all 7 of those categories, we even had a chart of the spectrum back in physics class.  Or could an EMP technically emit any of them?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, they don't kill.   Even man-made EMPs from a nuclear bomb are believed to be quite survivable.  </p>
<p>An EMP is different than an electrical discharge.  Electricity will always find the shortest path to ground.  Electrocution, whether fatal or not, occurs when electrical current takes that  shortest path to ground through living tissue.   An EMP does not send amperage through the body.  </p>
<p>When a person gets electrocuted, the damage to the body depends not only on how much current the body was exposed to, but also how long the body was exposed to that current.  </p>
<p>Lives lost to an EMP event would not be from the EMP itself, they are more likely to occur from the collapse of life support systems.  The failure of water and sewer systems, food supplies,  medicines and medical equipment, communications, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electricity doesn't always take a path to ground, it travels between 2 points with different potentials when there's a conductive path between them. Ground is more of a concept than a universal return path, in the same way &quot;home is where the heart is&quot;, ground is where you put it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Okay, just to be pedantic here, &quot;electrocution&quot; is a portmanteau of electricity + execution - so if the person didn't die, they weren't electrocuted.  So many people today use it as a synonym for receiving an electric shock, it drives me nuts.</p>
<p>(I guess you could have a &quot;botched electrocution&quot; if someone is in the electric chair being executed but something happens like the power goes out or the person is freed...)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can a bright enough flashlight melt a window, or will it just kind of shine right through? It would have to be a pretty big flashlight, and even then not sure visible light could do it. </p>
<p>This is just meaning that at some point the issue is going to be the other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum that does interact with the electrons in our atoms, like UV. But we are basically windows to other parts of the spectrum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>when you produce light, it's hard to make only visible light.  so the light source is likely also making infared light, which is producing heat.</p>
<p>i guess in another way you're asking, if you had a 15 megawatt radio tower and you had a glass window right next to it, would the window melt?  i'm pretty sure the answer is no.  or, it wouldn't melt from the radio waves.  but the air and tower itself might be warm because of the high amount of electricity going through it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it can. </p>
<p>Since you can't achieve 100% transparency (windows are 85-95% transparent), and you can't achieve 100% reflectance of outside light, some percentage of the energy will be absorbed. </p>
<p>Light with high enough energy can melt or evaporate anything.</p></div>		</li>
