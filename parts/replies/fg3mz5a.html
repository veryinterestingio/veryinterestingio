<p>It certainly seems that different people have specific areas where they tend to store more fat, wondering if they also have areas where the fat is more or less difficult to burn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's been a while, so anyone feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.  </p>
<p>Your body has A1 and A2 receptors, with the latter being more attractive to fat cells. A2 receptors are the first to get fat, and the last to lose it. That's why certain people/sexes have a genetic predisposition towards carrying weight in certain places, like hips. Yes, it's more difficult to lose in certain areas, but like the other person said, there is no such thing as spot reduction. The only way I know of making fat loss more uniform is taking yohimbine supplements, which removes fat from the A2 receptors at the same rate.   </p>
<p>Please note that this doesn't lend credence to the &quot;fat genetics&quot; myth; genetics only control <em>where</em> fat decides to stick, not how fat you <em>are</em>.  </p>
<p>Also I want to add, you don't actually burn much from working out, at all. Running a mile burns the same amount of calories as <em>not</em> eating a snickers. If you want to lose weight, it's much more effective to monitor your diet. Your body burns <em>a lot</em> of calories just to power itself, the trick to working out is to build enough muscle so that your body's caloric maintenance goes <em>up</em>. That way, you burn the same calories watching Netflix as someone does going for a run.  </p>
<p>Edit: I don't mean to imply that cardio and weight training aren't beneficial; I advocate 1000% for exercise. I only meant to say the direct correlation to losing weight is largely overstated. Exercise is a great tool in addition to your journey, but it's almost entirely ineffective without a mindful diet behind it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Worse: it's more like running a mile = <em>half</em> a Snickers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So much good in your comment, but one thing needs rebuttal. Not eating a surplus of calories is NOT the same as burning an equivalent amount exercising. For with exercise your body experiences a great deal of persistent health benefits, the least of which is an increase in metabolism and muscle mass, leading to much more calorie burn while sedentary. Never mind the positive mental-health effects which further contribute to the advancement of one's physical health - they are deeply connected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fat deposition (and use) relates to mainly genetics and hormones - the easiest distinction is male/female. Men carry more weight centrally, in their stomachs. Women tend to carry it lower, on their hips. </p>
<p>Fat cells which are closer to the organs (visceral fat) tend to be more metabolically active - they have higher fat turnover because of their location. Subcutaenous fat (directly under the skin) is less metabolically active by comparison. It's the former that is considered to carry higher disease risk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the correct answer is genetics and hormones. We cant target fat loss but if we lose fat, it has to be lost from somewhere. How we hold our weight is determined by genetics and hormones and thus that will decided where it comes off first.</p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/bjibberish" target="_blank">bjibberish</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on how overweight you're talking about. The more fat we have, the more evenly we tend to lose it. Hormones play a factor. Estrogen tends to lead to fat storage on the thighs and chest whereas testosterone tends to store more around the abdomen. As you get leaner, you start to see where your body specifically is going to hold onto that fat more.</p></div>		</li>

<p>From other parts of this thread, it sounds like fat doesn't come from anywhere &quot;first,&quot; but rather its loss becomes more noticeable in some areas before others. This would be a direct result from, as you said, genetics and hormones determining where more fat is stored, those areas being the ones that are &quot;last&quot;.</p>
<p>The effect is the same and I think you're right either way, just wanted to bring that bit of the thread into this one since it seems to get at the core understanding behind OP's question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that's correct. I should have worded that better. Saying &quot;first&quot; made it sound like spot reduction. A better way to say that may have been something along the lines of priority. If your specific makeup prioritizes fat on, say, the thighs, then this area would be the lowest priority for loss and, while it would still lose fat, would lose a lower percentage than other areas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah there seems to be a lot of misguided answers. Factually our bodies decide where it wants to use its resources on factors like efficiency, hormones, or genetics. We can't target fat loss in zones of our bodies just by doing certain workouts, which is what that person thought OP was asking about, like you said. OP understood our bodies use up its resources how it sees fit. We can't make our bodies localize fat burn through local physical exertion. But the first line of the above answer makes no sense under OP's question.</p></div>		</li>
