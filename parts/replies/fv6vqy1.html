			<div class="markdown"><p>Benzodiazepines, hypnotics, and some anticonvulsants work on GABA receptors. However the first two are highly addictive and withdrawal after a couple weeks can kill you. But usually it just makes you wish you were dead. Also combining any of these things with each other or with alcohol can kill you.</p>
<p>Don't mess with anything GABA related. See a therapist and rewire your neuron pathways instead, it's just as effective.</p>
<p>Sincerely, a guy who developed a dependence on benzos and hypnotics without knowing it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Benzodiazepines have a very similar mechanism of action in that they promote the activity of GABA. Benzos are probably a little more potent in that regard.</p>
<p>Xanax, Valium, and Diazepam are examples of benzos. If anxiety is something you struggle with, it may be worth talking to your doctor about one of those.</p>
<p>Note: Benzos are highly addictive, have some nasty withdrawal effects, and can interact poorly with other medications. Definitely talk to a doctor before taking one of these drugs.</p></div>		</li>
