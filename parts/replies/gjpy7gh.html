			<div class="markdown"><p>Putting little moats around stuff works great for stopping ants. I used to have to do that all the time when I lived in an apartment with a crazy bad ant problem.<br />
People should put a little dish detergent into the water too, so as not to attract thirsty critters, and to kill mosquito eggs if outside.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then your bees may fall pray to your trap to get water, fall in and drown. I'm not a bee keeper, but is a great way to kill gnats in your house... Put some sweet stuff, usually sugar, some sour stuff, usually vinegar and a few drops of dish detergent in a cup of water and watch the gnats get stuck and fall to the bottom of the cup.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Malaysia where majority bees are Apis cerana (smaller size of colony compares with European honeybees), majority of us local beekeepers use this method to assist the colony. Either water or grease. Though I myself just let them fend for their own colony, stronger colony win.</p></div>		</li>
