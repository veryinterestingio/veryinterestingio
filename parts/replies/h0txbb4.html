			<div class="markdown"><p>While this is true, it's also true that it's not a sound archiving strategy because it's banking on people doing things on the thin edge of the law. And as you mention, it hinges on what the archivist decides to save, which is almost surely a very small part.</p>
<p>Also, it's no use having a copy if it's illegal or impossible to access that copy. There's examples of <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:EYE_Film_Institute_Netherlands_-_Nitrate_film_decay_-_3.JPG" target="_blank">movies degrading in archives</a> because it's illegal to access them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I can promise you that, regardless of the format and regardless of the &quot;encryption&quot;, there <em>are</em> already encryption-free copies of it, and those copies have been copied ... <em>a lot.</em></p>
<p>I offer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AACS_encryption_key_controversy" target="_blank"><strong>09 F9</strong></a> as an example of what massive fails various industries have suffered while trying to lock up their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_platform" target="_blank">Walled Gardens</a>. If they adjusted their revenue models, they might find they can make more money with less hassle (for everybody) by getting their heads out of their early-20^th century asses. E.g. Napster did <em>not</em> kill the music industry; it changed it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For mainstream titles maybe. You'll never ever lose <em>Harry Potter</em> or <em>Lord of the Rings</em>.</p>
<p>But I have certainly lost quite a bit of, uh, <em>niche stuff</em>, due to link rot over the years. Servers go down, domains expire, subreddits get banned, authors remove their works, DMCA does DMCA things, torrents get unseeded. </p>
<p>Sometimes, the internet <em>does</em> forget the small stuff. Perhaps they still exist in some tiny corner, but the road there has been lost to the public.</p>
<p>Conversely, I have a personal collection of extremely old software that almost certainly cannot be found online anymore. As newer versions are shared, the old ones stop being popular and start being forgotten.</p></div>		</li>

<p>All the notable stuff will be backed up somewhere or another.  There are probably tens of thousands  of albums from the 80's and 90's that are already lost to time, simply because they didn't sell very well and no one cared enough to collect them.</p>
<p>Digital storefronts and the dying gasps of physical storage mediums is probably means <em>more</em> of that barely notable indie-scene music is preserved for future generations, simply because it's easier to stumble on obscure crap you fall in love with than it was when you had to shell out cash on an album or happen to hear it on the radio.</p>
<p>Music is in digital format by default now and sharing content is the norm.  That band you loved back in the day, the one whose album you bought at their show and then lost at some point during the last decade?  You don't have to hunt through thrift stores looking for an out-of-print CD for a band that doesn't exist any more.  </p>
<p>The modern version of that is finding your favorite indie band isn't on spotify any more, so you download their discography off pirate bay or wherever.  </p>
<p>It's a nightmare for archives because as legit organizations they have to follow the law, but pirate radio will always live on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was jamming out to this really great pop music on Google play music a year or two ago. I decided to try to find it again. Turns out it's made by some girl who has like 300 followers on Instagram and recently got a record deal and had to take down all of her music because of that. So there's literally no way to listen to this music any more. I've spent hours and hours searching and I've only found a few ten seconds clips that are still on her Facebook. I'm glad she got a record deal and I'm looking forward to hearing a new album but I'm bummed I might never hear the music I fell in love with again.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Then someone rips the audio and slaps that into an mp3 on their computer.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>They own a license for the e-book. It's like buying software (because it basically is software). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not like software. It's just data. But data can also be lincenced.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They can only lend it a certain number of times. after that, they have to buy it again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many different types of licences. Only some work like you say. There are also licences so that the library owns the rights to that book for a certain amount of time, usually one year licences. It doesn't matter how many times the book is loaned within that year.</p>
<p>There are also licences where you pay a bulk sum and you get all the ebooks that company has, unlimited loans but the library pays a small fee for every single use.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's all defined in the licensing model. A publisher can perfectly well sell a permanent license to a book and in that case the library will own a digital copy for that book for all eternity. But an eternity is a very long time, so no publisher will do this. </p>
<p>Especially since paper copies get lost, aren't returned, get damaged... Paper copies could be loaned out indefinitely, but actually never are. And a publisher depends on this. They know a paper copy of a popular book will probably be replaced in 10 year and they factor this into the price of the book. (I know people reading Harry Potter once every year and their books look like crap 5 years in.) If the publisher would have an indestructible version of the book (thought experiment) than that book would cost more money simply because it is so permanent. </p>
<p>It's the same for ebooks. Having licenses for all eternity is a huge risk for lost future profit, so they would be very expensive. This is something libraries wouldn't like, since they could end up with a very expensive permanent ebook license that doesn't interest people anymore 5 years later.</p></div>		</li>
