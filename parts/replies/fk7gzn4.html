			<div class="markdown"><p>RIVM in Netherlands did the same around the <a href="https://www.rivm.nl/nieuws/resultaat-steekproef-4-ziekenhuismedewerkers-heeft-coronavirus" target="_blank">hotspot in Brabant</a>. 1097 hospital employees tested, 4% tested positive.</p>
<p>OTOH, there is a <a href="https://nos.nl/artikel/2326748-waarom-niet-bekend-is-hoeveel-nederlanders-er-besmet-zijn-met-het-coronavirus.html" target="_blank">group of 42 GPs around the country that systematically since February tested everyone coming in with mild symptoms</a>, they detected only one case and that was in the hotspot already known. So it's not that widespread for now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All cases that had the flu and went to the hospital. So the more severe once. But they also re-ran the tests from the beginning of the year to test for Covid-19. If you can't detect it in there it wasn't in the country most likely</p></div>		</li>

<p>It might just be that Germany (together with South Korea) simply shows the &quot;true&quot; mortality rate in western health care systems which were somewhat prepared for a pandemic outbreak. We will have to wait and see.</p>

<p>I think this is very important. One expert on the radio said today that the mortality rate in Wuhan was about \~3%, but in Wuhan also the entire health system collapsed. In the outer regions around Wuhan, where the health system could survive the blow the mortality rate was unter 1%. I think this really shows how important it is to &quot;flatten the curve&quot;. A health system that doesn't break means far less deaths.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 3% is based on diagnosed cases so when the hospitals get full, people with milder symptoms won't go there for tests/treatment. Sure having full hospital beds increase the death rate compared to having availability but I'm not sure it's 3x difference.</p></div>		</li>
