			<div class="markdown"><p>I read an article about body farms. People who donate their body to science help solve what happens to the body in different states of decomposition. I was fascinated about the fact that our bodies move significantly during the death/decomposition process. It would impact forensic testing for many situations. I do believe that it is in the open air. It might not seem the most dignified, but after you go... there isn't much choice to intervene and they are still helping so much, even after death.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Body farms are a tremendous help in criminal forensics. Because of the body farms we know what types of insects begin to invading the corpse to determine an approximate time of death. They do keep most of the body's out in open air. Some are placed in a tent like object, some are buried, some are only partially buried. It's not dignified at all but at the completion of your afterlife duties to science, you are then cremated and returned to your family for a final resting place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most people that I know in Germany do not donate their body to science because they think first aid responders or doctors will be less inclined to try to save you if you are seriously injured. I can't imagine there's much truth to that but there probably were some cases of this happening because the belief is pretty widespread here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funnily though, in Austria, the neighbouring country, everybody is automatically an organ donor. You can only explicitly decline, if you don't want to donate. People there have fewer fears from the doctors in emergency situation
and more organs for everybody at the end of the day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ugh my ex used to believe this and refused to be an organ donor. I am in the US and have heard this a lot but I just really can’t believe it’s that true. At least I hope not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hear this sometimes and it really makes me mad. Imagine how many lives were lost from this belief. </p>
<p>IIRC you have to die in the hospital to be an organ donor anyway. So even if EMS wants to harvest your organs they would have to rush you to the hospital ASAP.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I dealt with human cadavers in college, everyone was very respectful. I still don't like the idea of students leering at my corpse, but it seems like one can specify that they are OK with their body being used for research (e.g. taking samples of a rare tumor or making a cell line from it a la Henrietta Lacks) but not for educational use.</p></div>		</li>
