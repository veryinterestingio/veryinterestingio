			<div class="markdown"><p>Fascinating, so would you say the current tests for metabolites of THC are intended to catch users regardless of disorientation? Like they know their tests are going to pop people that may have smoked a week ago and they don’t care? Because, correct me if I’m wrong, but what I got was that they COULD test for THC but they don’t because this way they stand a better chance of snagging ya.</p>
<p>Edit: holy cow! Thanks for my first silver!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is pretty innacurate as a blanket statement. Really depends on bioavailability. We test for a number of drugs for both the parent and metabolite. Some like THC and Cocaine have a very high % converted to metabolite so only that is tested. Many others though the parent is excreted unchanged at a high enough amount to detect.</p>
<p>You also have cases where your body metabolizes one drug into another. Heroin breaks down into 3 different metabolites, one of which is Morphine. Test for just morphine and you wouldn't be able to tell where it came from. Test for Morphine AND 6-mam and now you can determine if the person took heroin.</p></div>		</li>

I know one that sticks out in my mind was a person who was jailed for quite a while before they determined that the spoon found in the car had spaghetti-os on it and not an illegal substance. They were released without charges obviously but given nothing to compensate for the time. The record of the just the arrest itself stays too unless you spend money to get it removed</p></div>		</li>

<p>I went to get one done for my last job and the lady used the exact same brand of 5-panel I used to test myself beforehand. They're $2/piece online and she billed $60 for our 45 second interaction. I talked to her about it a little bit and,she had absolutely no medical background. She just got an online certification and opened her own business. Her only expense is a little one room office with a bathroom. What an absolute goldmine if you're able to get a few companies onboard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not any notable amount that would get you high. Theoretically that's why the test is more conclusive weeks later than other drug tests, they are looking for a small amount of metabolites from that burned off THC.</p>
<p>Most people trying to pass a drug test will exercise days beforehand but not in the last day or two to prevent THC from being released. Note that none of this has never been scientifically proven to work, and its tough to test as metabolisms in people vary so much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm just speculating here, but maybe the reason it took so long for you was because you had a low &quot;fat-turnover&quot; rate due to being so lean. You weren't really storing fat or utilizing stored fat all that much, the fat cells you had weren't really changing or being used between when you were a heavy chronic user and when you were trying to clear your system, and thus the THCCOOH in your fat wasn't being liberated and then excreted. And then also, I guess if you have few fat cells, then each individual cell would be more saturated with THCCOOH for the same amount of THC consumed, which coupled with this low turnover, could further contribute to taking a while to clear out.</p>
<p>That speculative explanation makes sense to me, but I might be misunderstanding how metabolism works.</p></div>		</li>

<h3>Metabolism and Elimination of ▵9-THC</h3>
<p>▵9-THC is metabolized in the liver by microsomal hydroxylation and oxidation catalyzed by enzymes of cytochrome P450 (CYP) complex. The average plasma clearance rates have been reported to be 11.8± 3 L/hour for women and 14.9 ±3.7 L/hour for men (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3570572/#CIT0059" target="_blank">59</a>). Others have determined approximately 36 L/hour for naïve cannabis users and 60 L/hour for regular cannabis users12.</p>
<p>More than 65% of cannabis is excreted in the feces and approximately 20% is excreted in urine (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3570572/#CIT0058" target="_blank">58</a>).Most of the cannabis (80-90%) is excreted within 5 days as hydroxylated and carboxylated metabolites (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3570572/#CIT0067" target="_blank">67</a>). There are eighteen acidic metabolites of cannabis identified in urine (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3570572/#CIT0068" target="_blank">68</a>) and most of these metabolites form a conjugate with glucuronic acid, which increases its water solubility. Among the major metabolites (▵9-THC,11-OH-THC, and THCCOOH), THCCOOH is the primary glucuronide conjugate in urine, while 11-OH-THC is the predominant form in feces (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3570572/#CIT0051" target="_blank">51</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3570572/#CIT0069" target="_blank">69</a>). Since ▵9-THC is extremely soluble in lipids, it results in tubular re-absorption, leading to low renal excretion of unchanged drug. Urinary excretion half-life of THCCOOH was observed to be approximately 30 hours after seven days and 44-60 hours after twelve days of monitoring (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3570572/#CIT0069" target="_blank">69</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3570572/#CIT0070" target="_blank">70</a>). After smoking approximately 27 mg of ▵9-THC in a cigarette, 11-OH-THC peak concentration was observed in the urine within two hours in the range of 3.2-53.3 ng/mL, peaking at 77.0±329.7 ng/mL after 3 hours and THCCOOH peaking at 179.4ng/mL± 146.9 after 4 hours (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3570572/#CIT0071" target="_blank">71</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3570572/#CIT0072" target="_blank">72</a>).</p>
<h3>Detection and Analysis of Cannabinoids by Different Analytical Techniques</h3>
<p>Measurement of cannabinoids is necessary for pharmacokinetic studies, drug treatment, workplace drug testing and drug impaired driving investigations (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3570572/#CIT0073" target="_blank">73</a>).Because of increasing use of cannabis, developing a whole range of efficient testing methods has become essential. Cannabinoids can be detected in saliva, blood, urine, hair and nail using various analytical techniques, including immunoassays (EMIT®, Elisa, fluorescence polarization, radioimmunoassay) (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3570572/#CIT0074" target="_blank">74</a>). Various chromatographic techniques such as Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) (Foltz and Sunshine, 1990), High Performance Thin layer Chromatography (HPTLC) (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3570572/#CIT0072" target="_blank">72</a>), Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3570572/#CIT0079" target="_blank">79</a>), high performance liquid chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (HPLC- MS) (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3570572/#CIT0079" target="_blank">79</a>) are reliable in detection and quantitation of various cannabis metabolites.</p>
<p>Urine is the preferred sample because of higher concentration and longer detection time of metabolites in it. Moreover, urine can easily be sampled. Apart from cut off concentration, sensitivity and specificity of assay other factors like route of administration, amount of cannabinoids absorbed, body fat contents rate of metabolism and excretion, degree of dilution and time of specimen collection also influence delectability of ▵9_THC and its metabolites (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3570572/#CIT0012" target="_blank">12</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3570572/#CIT0072" target="_blank">72</a>).</p>
<p>The cut off value for detection of cannabinoids recommended by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)” and European threshold of 50 ng/mL was found to be consistent with recent or heavy cannabis abuse (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3570572/#CIT0051" target="_blank">51</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3570572/#CIT0073" target="_blank">73</a>). Lower concentrations of THCA can be associated with occasional use, carry over period or probable cannabis exposure (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3570572/#CIT0070" target="_blank">70</a>). Immunoassay is adopted as a preliminary method in the drug testing program (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3570572/#CIT0078" target="_blank">78</a>). However, false negative and false positive results occur from structurally related drugs that are recognized by the antibodies or occasionally artifacts such as adulterants affecting pH, detergents and other surfactants (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3570572/#CIT0073" target="_blank">73</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3570572/#CIT0077" target="_blank">77</a>). For this reason, any positive result using immunoassay must be confirmed by chromatographic techniques (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3570572/#CIT0075" target="_blank">75</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3570572/#CIT0078" target="_blank">78</a>).Cannabis has a long half-life in humans (67 days) (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3570572/#CIT0057" target="_blank">57</a>). In chronic cannabis users, it is particularly difficult to determine whether a positive result for cannabis represents a new episode of drug use or continued excretion of residual drug (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3570572/#CIT0062" target="_blank">62</a>). Algorithmic models have been devised to determine whether THC levels represent new use or the carry-over from previous use (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3570572/#CIT0062" target="_blank">62</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3570572/#CIT0064" target="_blank">64</a>). However, these models are not very accurate in discriminating new use and carry-over in chronic users (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3570572/#CIT0066" target="_blank">66</a>).</p>
