			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Leptin levels tend to be proportional to the amount of adipose tissue (or fat) you have in your body. Therefore, overweight individuals tend to actually have higher amounts of leptin in circulation.</p>
<p>Now, this can be super confusing because mice that do not produce leptin tend to eat in excess and gain an unhealthy amount of weight. In normal concentrations, leptin is able to act as a satiety signal. Without it, the mice lose this ability to feel full.</p>
<p>However, if you store a lot of fat and consequently have high levels of leptin circulating in your blood, your body becomes unresponsive to its effects. It’s almost like insulin resistance with type ii diabetes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not almost like that, its exactly like that. Excess adipose tissue leads to excess leptin, and that excess leptin is responsible for insulin resistance increasing, possibly leading to T2DM</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this mean that it’s easier to put weight back on if you’ve been overweight before?</p>
<p>Does leptin resistance reduce to normal levels if you return to a healthier diet?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the 72 hours straight thing is my normal state of not hungry and I just have to remember to eat manually or by paying attention to my body closely, though I supposed c-PTSD likely contributes to this problem. Every rare so often my body seems to just remember eating is what I am supposed to do and I get quite hungry, but this is often fleeting and is not very often.</p></div>		</li>
