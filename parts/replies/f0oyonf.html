			<div class="markdown"><p>How am I supposed to see that the therapist can see 'the big picture of my life' if I haven't the foggiest idea of that myself? Could a therapist simply spout some nice-sounding nonsense without actually understanding the client that could lure them into feeling like they've found &quot;the therapist for them&quot;? How would the client know?</p>
<p>^(<em>Background: I've had positive experience with therapists in the past, but none of them magically &quot;fixed&quot; anything and I don't know if they were actually a good fit, or if it was just the ability to open up to someone which helped</em>)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are absolutely right. It can be super hard to discern, and I imagine that there are plenty of therapists who offer little more than platitudes. A good therapist should be periodically checking in with you to see if they are accurately understanding what‚Äôs going on in your life and how different parts of your life come together. You‚Äôre also right that working with someone who helps you be open and unfiltered is huge. </p>
<p>In my experience seeking therapy, a good fit means that the therapist is pushing me. It‚Äôs not always comfortable, but I trust that they are acting with my best interest in mind. I also have the sense that they understand and respect my goals for therapy. </p>
<p>In my experience offering therapy, it‚Äôs really important that the person I‚Äôm working with tells me if they sense something is off. I have had some pivotal points in therapy that came from a patient telling me that things weren‚Äôt working. We processed that together and it was the most important aspect of our work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Psychologists are trained in case formulation. Meaning that you should be able to sit down with one and they have the tools to know which questions (and measures) to utilise to unpack the relevant information of what's going on.</p>
<p>They should then be comfortable explaining back to you what it seems is going on and seeking your agreement and further clarification (in my personal experience this is the step that's missed).  </p>
<p>Therapy should never feel like the dark arts of a magician's trick. It should be scientific. Whilst a lack of insight about an issue is often what people seek therapy for; it shouldn't mean that they feel as if therapy is something being performed on them rather than a collaborative partnership.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This right here. It is like finding someone that you are comfortable talking to because they have to communicate with you the way you are most willing to hear. Two examples I have is I grew up in a family that was scared of homosexuality and during a period where you would use gay an insult my brother said something that I said was gay. I was in trouble for a very long time and told calling him gay would turn him. I spoke to my therapist about it. He called me gay probably fifty times then asked if I was gay. Said &quot;see it does not work that way&quot;. Someone who could be that straight with me and direct was incredible. He changed my life for the better in many ways over the years and he eventually passed away but showed me how to look for help moving forward. Sorry if this does not make sense I do not get a chance to talk about him much.</p>
<p>Here is a link to the camp he started with his wife.
<a href="https://nuhop.org/camp-nuhop" target="_blank">https://nuhop.org/camp-nuhop</a></p>
<p>The second example is a more recent person I started talking to. I told him I stopped taking walks because I would just complain how frustrated I was having to take a walk. He said &quot; no reason you can't bitch and walk at the same time.&quot; He called me on my bullshit and I needed that. Those are the things I look for. </p>
<p>Sorry this is so long.</p></div>		</li>

<p>My first one retired but sometimes when I was in peak recovery, I would do or say some stupid stuff at work or home and he would just say, ‚Äúwhat the fuck were you thinking!?!‚Äù</p>
<p>Just comfort makes a world of difference...knowing you can be open and express yourself etc</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm truth though, my RA freshman year of college asked me the best question.</p>
<p>I had been talking about something, and she asked me the whole &quot;can I ask you a question&quot; thing, and just with that and her tone, I knew what she was going to ask. So, of course, I prepared a big fat &quot;no&quot; for her.  I grew up and lived in a time where being gay was a horrible thing full of ridicule and worse.
So, I was ready for it. Had my refusal down pat.</p>
<p>And she asked me the best question you could: &quot;Are you straight?&quot;</p>
<p>Literally got the word &quot;No!&quot; halfway out my mouth before what she said registered.  Took a few days of hard thinking to get back to her. But that spin just threw me for a loop and put a very relaxed and non-judgemental mindset to it.</p>
<p>Wish everyone thought of it that way. So much less pressure to deny.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a former Clinical Psychologist I would add that we were used for more 'complex' cases where significant mental illness / impairments (like dementia / brain injury) existed which meant you really had to be aware of underlying issues to treat effectively. We would also use more 'advanced' techniques than traditional counselling like CBT, DBT etc. If you have a specific *problem* (like phobia, major depression, major anxiety etc...) I'd go for a psychologist as it's really what we trained for.If you need drugs / other medical intervention go to a Psychiatrist. In the UK it's common for a psychologists / psychiatrists to refer patients to each other based on need and for GPs (family doctors) to refer to both  (well when people get referred at all...). This is all UK of course...many Psychiatrists ALSO practice psychotherapy / other psychoanalysis techniques  but they're comparatively rare here (the NHS won't cover that generally for example)</p>
<p>For more general issues like general anxiety, relationship issues etc..go to a therapist / counsellor.</p>
<p>I may be biased for for kids I'd got for a minimum of a Chartered Psychologist (so Psychologist registered with an appropriate professional body but not necessarily with a Doctorate / Postgrad qualifications) as it's far riskier and potentially more damaging if your therapist is untrained in that case.Oh and I'm no longer a Psychologist so have no skin in the game these days :)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>EDIT: As many have commented in the US it's VERY different for a variety of reasons (liability, insurance etc...) we don't really have 'therapist culture' in the UK either so they're far less common.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been wondering if I need some kind of meds for a long time, I've been going to therapy and I guess it helps a little, my therapist is trying to help me understand my emotions which is just so hard for me for some reason. Is there a way to tell when someone needs meds?</p>
<p>I kinda want to get over it without meds tho but if I do need them then I would be willing to take them, it just feels like a commitment and if I can do it by myself I would like that better. I feel like I might be asking a little too much from you right now and it is likely to be a case by case thing.</p>
<p>Edit: I want to thank everyone for their comments and suggestions can't answer to everyone because I don't want to spam that much, I'll go see a specialist they know better and I probably need it, I already started working on it and will try to do it right to get where I need to be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone explained it to me once that meds help you from the outside in and therapy helps you from the inside out. Most often you need both of those so the two different helpers can meet in the middle. A good diagnosis goes a long way. I would see a psychiatrist to get a good diagnosis (so you can get the right meds and therapy) and see about meds. Best of luck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was similar to you with my attitude toward medication. I had a great counsellor in college who understood and wanted to help me feel good without a prescription. She told me in our second session ‚ÄúAre you sleeping well? Are you eating good foods? Are you exercising? Are you going outside? If the answer to these four questions is not a definitive yes, work to improve these categories. If you have tried all of these things and still don‚Äôt feel right, we will look at medication‚Äù. </p>
<p>This is not a one size fits all solution but it really helped me to understand that my mental health is a part of my overall health and therefore directly affected by how I treat my body. Now, when I start to struggle, I look at my daily habits and try to evaluate if something needs TLC.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to piggy back off of this, the distinction you make is a good generalization, but I can‚Äôt stress the importance of trying to learn more about your counselor/therapist‚Äôs training moreso than their credentials. I just finished my Master‚Äôs degree and I‚Äôm working on becoming a counselor. However, I did an internship for two semesters at the VA and have a TON of training and supervision on PTSD and MST. That‚Äôs pretty specialized for someone who would otherwise mostly deal with ‚Äúgeneralized stuff.‚Äù </p>
<p>For the most part, it‚Äôs going to depend on the person‚Äôs training and experience. Some of my cohort members did internships at neurobehavioral and autism-focused sites and they have just as much training as would a recently graduated Ph.D student. </p>
<p>TL;DR: Try to match your needs with your therapist‚Äôs experiences AND try to feel out how well you click with your therapist/psychologist/counselor and you will have a good experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say that in the US, depending on the state, the difference may not be a huge one. Psychologists definitely have more formal training. On the other hand anyone who's licenced has done years of school and work in the field. The requirement for a Marriage and Family Therapist are a master's degree, 3000 hours of work in the field with clients, plus the licencing exams. That's in California. It's state by state in the US. CBT and DBT are used even in those settings. It's much more important to know that your therapist is well versed and trained in these approaches then what degree they have. The trainings are usually outside the school often obtained through organizations that set standards for the approaches. Main thing is that they are licenced by the appropriate authority. BBS in CA for example.
As for kids one has to do some research. There are therapists that specialize in working with kids and they are usually up on the research etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily true for the US. I am a Licensed Mental Health Counselor (LMHC) who specializes in CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy). I work with clients who present with Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety, PTSD, OCD, trauma, Juvenile Sex Offenders (credentialed), couples counseling etc. the distinction between a psychologist and myself is basically assessment training. Psychologists hold the exact same licensure as myself when it come to providing therapy services; however,  they have extensive training in the use of assessment measures. </p>
<p>Fit is absolutely important when finding a therapist, psychiatrist, etc. The client needs to feel comfortable opening up especially seeing that they are divulging the deepest parts of themselves to basically a complete stranger for help. It‚Äôs a very vulnerable position to be in, and I respect that. I am never offended if I am not a good fit for someone. I just want them to find the right fit, even if it‚Äôs not me. Their mental health and well being is so important. Don‚Äôt ever be afraid to change your clinician.</p></div>		</li>
