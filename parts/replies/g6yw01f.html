			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok. I kind of see it. So what would happen in the vacuum when I try to lift the water? It would just be too heavy, and crumple the cup? Or.. ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The cup would not crumple. When you lift the cup, the water would stay level because there is no air pressure forcing the water into the cup. There will also be no air pressure on the outside of the cup once it is lifted, since there is a vaccum both inside and outside the cup.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>but this gets to my original question. How, in this case, does the vacuum appear inside the cup? I thought it took huge energy to create a vacuum - when I pull the cup, upside-down, out of the water, what is happening inside the cup? The person I responded to suggested I shouldn't be able to lift the water out at all - but then what happens when I try?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would the water stay level..? In a vacuum the water would boil...
It's the nature of the difference in density of the air/water that causes one to sit atop the other... If you take away the air does the water not boil to take its place?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gravity is the only thing operating. And it operates on the water with no interference from air pressure. Nothing happens to the cup.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let‘s ignore for a moment the water will turn to steam. Or let’s replace the water by a perfectly fitting solid cylinder of metal in an airtight tube (the glass).</p>
<p>There is a constant pressure of air around you. This pushes against that cylinder from the lower, open end of the tube, keeping the cylinder in place, because the upper end is airtight and seals off and keeps away the air pressure that could counteract. </p>
<p>Now if you poke a hole in the upper end, you will have the same pressure on both ends, balancing itself out, and the cylinder will just drop down due to gravity. </p>
<p>With no air around at all, the situation is the same as with two forces cancelling each other out - the cylinder (water) will just drop. The only difference is that the space above will not be filled by air, but remain empty. This (empty space) we happen to call a vacuum. </p>
<p>It is simply the absence of everything else, it „appears“ because something else has been removed. There are no forces applied by a vacuum either, only by outside air pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is kind of random but if you had a 100' tube a foot across and capped the top, essentially a very long thin cup, inverted it and submerged. Leaving no air, than lifted it with a crane would the water &quot;sag&quot; in the tube since it's heavier than the atmospheric pressure</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a limit to how high you can lift this tube and keep liquid water inside, because the pressure will become so low that the water will start to boil (not get hot, just boil at ambient temperature).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More or less, yes.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torricelli's_experiment" target="_blank">This is Torricelli's Experiment</a>, to demonstrate that vacuum comes from pressure.  Water will start boiling when you get to around 400 inches tall.  (Note: &quot;inches of water column&quot; is a unit of pressure, specifically for variations on the instrument you have proposed).</p>
<p>That said, what if we used something heavier, and with a lower vapor pressure.  How about mercury?  <a href="https://assets.catawiki.nl/assets/2017/4/11/6/3/2/632bd1d8-6097-4a48-9558-9761314de42d.jpg" target="_blank">That would make for a much smaller and more convenient device</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would it not work the same in a vacuum, but high or really any gravity well? Water evaporation in a vacuum and such aside. The energy to lift the water would theoretically be provided from the work done by lifting. If one were to lift too high as to break the seal between cup and water, the water would flow lower into the gravity well in a similar fashion, or am I missing something? I would think that on a planet with water, but no atmosphere, as you lift the cup, you wouldn't create a tall tower of water beneath the cup.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You need the pressure from the atmosphere pushing on the liquid outside the cup. Without the pressure outside the cup you cant create any vacuum inside the cup to lift the water.</p>
<p>Instead of a cup think of a sufficiently long tube sealed at the top end at sea level. As you raise the tube you will lift up water inside the tube, however you cant lift water forever. As you lift the tube higher and higher the negative pressure inside the tube will increase as the weight of the water column increases and tries to pull itself down out of the tube. </p>
<p>When the weight of the water increases to the point that the negative pressure in the tube from the water pulling down is equal to the atmospheric pressure outside the tube, raising the tube higher wont raise the water level any higher. Instead you will create an 'empty' space above the water column inside the tube. (In reality you would start vaporizing liquid water and you would have water vapour in the 'empty' space). </p>
<p>If you increase the gravity pulling down on the water or reduce the air pressure pushing down outside the tube you will lower the maximum height you can lift the water to. If you dont have any pressure pushing down on the liquid outside the tube you will just create an 'empty' space about the tube. In a way, the pressure outside the tube is pressing the liquid into the tube.</p></div>		</li>
