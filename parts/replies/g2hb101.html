			<div class="markdown"><p>Hippos and whales are from sister groups (or clades or families, I'm not entirely sure what the correct term is for their groupings) but they diverged while their ancestors looked like hooved rat-pig things. They're not very closely related to sea-lions (more closely related to bears) or manatees (more closely related to elephants.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but the illustration serves its purpose. It lets us imagine the transition of mutation in a line of species, while retaining recognizable mammal traits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're in the same order but among the families in the order, hippos and whales are often grouped together as &quot;whippomorphs.&quot; Great explanation of evolutionary relationships!</p>
<p>A rule of thumb I use is whenever I don't know what taxonomic level of something, I just say &quot;taxon.&quot; Clade refers to a monophyletic group, and some people get super up in arms about that so I don't use that unless I'm confident (ie there's a tree and I can see the branching pattern). Same with family or any of the linnaean levels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd just like to drop a tiny shower thought bubble that every species is a transitionary species and for every newly discovered fossil of a transitionary species, you create 2 new &quot;missing links&quot;. </p>
<p>I just think that's neat</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an interesting take, the whole idea of &quot;missing links&quot; fueling the fire of evolution deniers is just an example of the shallow depth of thought from that group</p></div>		</li>
