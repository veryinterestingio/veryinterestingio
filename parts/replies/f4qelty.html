<p>In other words: while you're home might be fine, the neighborhood might look a whole lot different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to add to this that if we saw a 2 ft increase  that would not mean that everywhere that is currently 1 ft above sea level would automatically have water at their doorsteps.  It is an average and that can make it seem like less of an urgent issue than it actually is.  Some areas may even see the water level drop in the short term.  While others might experience several fold higher increases than the average.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not entirely qualified, but the jist of it is that you can't really think of the ocean as an enormous swimming pool where dumping water in one end increases the level at the other end.  It is best to think of it as many connected systems with their own local effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have no expertise but as far as i understand it all comes down to the fact that earth is not perfectly spherical. It is more &quot;potato&quot; shaped meaning gravity will pull water more in some directions than others.</p>
<p>Other influences are tectonic shifts, some places are still rising out of the water while other places are being pushed under.
Where i live in Oslo there is a phenomenon called glacial rebound which means that after the last big glacier melted(around 12 000 years ago) the land started rising and it is still going at about 5,5mm per year.</p></div>		</li>
