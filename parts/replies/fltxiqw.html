			<div class="markdown"><p>The main problem with this simplistic argument is that the kind of plant material eaten by livestock animals is not always edible by humans, e.g. grass fed cattle.  </p>
<p>In countries with poor (EDIT: soul to soil) soil quality such as in parts of sub Saharan Africa, livestock animals are essential for converting plants not edible by humans into edible products (milk, eggs, meat).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not the problem with the &quot;simplistic argument&quot;. Even if its inedible to us, we can use the land to grow food that is edible to us. The argument that they make otherwise unusable land into edible food is a rare edge case you'd never come across in your life when deciding to eat meat. When I went to Tanzania, they rarely ate their livestock and used them more often for milk (like one village would have a single goat or cow) and they would love to farm that land given the resources.</p>
<p>Either way, why would non-specific edge case like &quot;sub saharan Africa&quot;  affect your decision to eat meat in the US? When you go to the store, you can be confident that every piece of meat you see didn't somehow save some otherwise unusable land. It was fed with corn, soy, or &quot;grass&quot; grown in the midwest. Your counterpoint to the argument is pretty irrelevant for 100% of people in the US deciding whether to eat meat.</p>
<p>In the US, the majority of our ag land is devoted to growing cattle feed. We feed 99%+ our cows soy and corn. Even most of the grass-fed ones spend most of their life on soy/corn diets. Ironically for your argument, mono-crops for cattle feed are what make soil unusable.</p>
<p>Cows have to grow their bodies, move around, shit, all things that take energy before we can harvest them. We have to feed them that energy. Think about how many calories per day a cow burns if a human burns 2K calories/day.  Thermodynamically, we would get so much more out of our land if we didn't devote it all to raising cows. We only get what energy the cow stores.</p></div>		</li>
