			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok so a question for you as you clearly understand this topic- for muscle spasms- they're stuck in contraction mode. If I understand correctly the Ca2+ isn't being pumped back out? Or is there another mechanism involved? Is a twitch the same action as a spasm? How does one improve the pumping Ca2+ back out part of the equation?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Muscle “spasms” are otherwise known as cramps. They can occur for a multitude of reasons, however the most common is injury or overuse. </p>
<p>When a muscle is being contracted repeatedly, more and more calcium is “left over” within the muscle cell. If you do not give it enough time to pump all of the existing calcium out, it will contract quicker than before, and may end up in a state of prolonged contraction. This is sometimes localized to only part of a muscle, or the entire muscle. </p>
<p>To improve the pumping of calcium out of muscle cells, you can only do resistance training. If there is more calcium within the muscle cell more often, then these calcium pumps will tend to be inserted in greater numbers, along with the size of the muscle cell increasing, meaning there will be a higher threshold for calcium ions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry I'm not totally sure what you're asking here</p>
<p>As long as calcium and ATP (which is basically fuel) are present, the contraction can continue - removal of the calcium by pumping it out stops the contraction.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how to answer the rest, sorry</p></div>		</li>
