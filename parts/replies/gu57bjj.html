			<div class="markdown"><p>From personal experience it helps tremendously.  Sometimes I lose the ability to walk because of a bad foot.  I will run it under water the hottest water I can stand for 15 seconds  and then the coldest water.  I do this on/off for 5 minutes right before I go to bed.   It may not heal an injury but it helps me walk again.  It works so well I tell everyone who will listen.  The world is terrifying when you can no longer walk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey man! In case you didn't know (i learned not too long ago) that the RICE protocol of elevating an injured bodypart and applying ice is now outdated and even refuted by the original authors who came up with it. This is more for sports injuries or any sprains and strains though, not sure about your own situation. Here's a start for reading up on it! <a href="https://thesportjournal.org/article/the-r-i-c-e-protocol-is-a-myth-a-review-and-recommendations/" target="_blank">Link</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my chiropractor: only cold actually helps as it reduces swelling. Heat doesn't really do much except feel good, but cold will help reduce swelling/inflammation which causes much of the pain and discomfort from an injury</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>depends on what the &quot;damage&quot; was. you don't necessarily want muscles to heal too quickly, as the small injuries to muscles are part of what signals the muscles to strengthen over time. a study on antioxidant vitamin supplementation after work outs found that the pain and soreness were reduced significantly , presumable from antioxidants reducing some of the damage, but this carried an unintended consequence. The muscles did not build strength as quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I played football back in college, contrasts (swapping between a bucket of hot water and a bucket of hot water) were common, especially for ankle/foot injuries.</p>
<p>They were pretty rough to do, but seemed to help recovery.</p></div>		</li>
