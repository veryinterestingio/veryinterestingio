<p>That just sounds like it's holding back evolution. They literally mutated a tool to get infinite reproduction, let them have it dammit</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's better for them to be able to compete without killing each other, because maybe the young buck with great genes that loses this year due to inexperience will get to try again next season. Deers being born as unicorns is something that existed long before humans started culling them and yet deers have not become unicorns. Why? Because it's maladaptive. A unicorn deer might be very sexuallly successful, but most of its offspring will kill each other with those horns when they grow up and compete with each other.</p>
<p>edit: Just wanted to add that the best measure of evolutionary fitness is not the number of children you have, but rather the number of grandchildren you have. If your offspring aren't successful then it doesn't matter how many you have. It's still an evolutionary dead end.</p></div>		</li>
