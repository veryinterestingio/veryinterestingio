			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if nuking a planet’s interior was doable the amount of energy required would be colossal. Much of the heat generated within Earth’s core comes from radioactive isotopes decaying over time, which cumulatively add up to far more energy than we could ever hope to inject.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would at most give it a short kick of sorts, but since the necessary constant heat is still missing, it won't do much.</p>
<p>If your car has no gas, using the ignition won't get it running.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have had a thought for a while that I've never had sufficient background to really follow up on.</p>
<p>The thought is this:  early in Earth's history, it received a glancing blow from a planetoid.  This blow is most famous for creating the moon.  Could it have had an additional result?  Specifically, could the glancing blow have induced greater spin in the molten fluid, making a stronger dynamo?  Earth is the only rocky planet in our solar system with a strong magnetic field and also the only rocky planet with a moon that is not just a captured asteroid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's important to note that dynamo action in molten cores is all theory and the maths is so complex we can't accurately compute it. </p>
<p>We have no real way to prove it. It's just how we expect it should work. </p>
<p>Venus has a very hot active core and no magnetic field. The theory is that if you spun Venus faster (it barely moves) and allowed for convection via volcanoes that it would generate a magnetic field. </p>
<p>It's probably going to stay theory for quite a while. It won't reach computer modeled until we're quite a bit deeper in to super computing power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really all-theory -- <a href="https://physics.aps.org/story/v19/st3" target="_blank">there have been some experiments</a> using big tanks of liquid metal which have demonstrated the dynamo effect in question.  The details are still a result of modeling and such -- but it definitely does work.</p>
<p>E: Note: strictly speaking <em>in silico</em> work is also theory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The dynamo effect itself is understood, yes, and it would match the outcome we see of planetary magnetic fields... <em>but,</em> what we currently lack is a way to prove that that's actually what's going on. Dynamo theory <em>could</em> produce the effects we're observing, but we can't be certain that's actually the mechanism at work.</p>
<p>Imagine it like this: you're looking through a window into a room, and you see someone put a ball down on a table. The ball starts rolling and falls off the table. Based on what you know about gravity, you're pretty certain that the cause for the ball starting to roll is that the table is tilted - it would explain your observations pretty well, and simply. However, you can't actually prove the table is tilted - you can't enter the room to put a level on it. What's more, because you can't enter the room, you might not be able to see other factors at work - maybe there's a draft that could push the ball and get it rolling; maybe the ball is asymmetrically weighted and was put down heavy-side-up; maybe the ball is magnetic, and there's a magnet under the table it was repelled from.</p>
<p>Your theory matches the effect, but until you have better data you can't be certain that it's actually correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One theory is Venus was struck during the heavy bombardment period by a planet that slowed its spin. That slowed down spin is what killed its magnetic field. Or it could be the core isn't cooling so it's all the same temperature. Or the core has cooled completely. </p>
<p>There are volcanoes on Venus. In fact, it has more than any other planet in our Solar system.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That theory is generally not the preferred one for explaining the slow rotation of Venus. The more accepted idea is that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/275037a0" target="_blank">solar tides acting on the atmosphere slowed it down</a>, essentially acting like a giant drum brake on the planet.</p></div>		</li>
