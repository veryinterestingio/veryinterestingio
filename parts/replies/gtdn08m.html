			<div class="markdown"><p>Also from <a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/science/why-does-salt-enhance-flavour/" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Salt is used as a universal flavour improver because at low concentrations it will reduce bitterness, but increase sweet, sour and umami, which is desirable for sweet recipes. But at higher concentrations it suppresses sweetness and enhances umami, which is good for savoury things. It’s also easily obtained in a pure form without any interfering flavours.</p>

<p>This is the reason people sometimes put a pinch of salt in their coffee, makes it a bit smoother</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if this is weird, but I actually enjoy the bitterness. It adds personality to the coffee. I used to add loads of milk and sugar, but that masks the distinct flavor of the specific coffee.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I may have misunderstood you, but I don’t believe that’s what is happening. The receptors themselves don’t enhance any other flavor, they send a salt specific signal and that’s it. Chemoreceptors that respond to salt don’t stimulate any other flavor afferent signals, they only send a salt taste. As far as I know, the salt chemoreceptor type is still a mystery and hasn’t been classified. They know the general area they are in, but couldn’t point one out of a lineup.
If salt actually does “enhance” flavor, I would guess it would be in the brain where indirect sensation is known to occur.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are much more right than OP is.  Especially that the flavor enhancement doesn’t occur on the tongue but in the brain to guide food choice toward increased survivability in environment where calories &amp; electrolytes are scarce and most things you <em>could</em> eat would make you sick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hell, flavour <em>detection</em> doesn't even happen in the tongue beyond the basic 5 tastes, so unless the salt is somehow travelling up to your olfactory bulb in great amounts then it isn't unlocking any &quot;flavour gates&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
