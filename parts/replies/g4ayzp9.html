			<div class="markdown"><p>Small nitpick: any fluid can make a magnetic field, not just liquids. This response is great otherwise though.</p>
<p>One extra insight we use is the chemistry of the solar system as a whole. We know jupiter must be mostly hydrogen (and helium) because that's the only thing that's abundant enough. We know Earth has an iron core (instead of another metal with similar density) because we can infer earth's bulk composition from the solar system, and when we look at the crust and mantle we see that a bunch of iron is missing. This is circumstantial, but really powerful.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I assume you're talking plasmas here? That's true, Venus and Mars both have induced fields generated by their ionospheres. I'd be hard-pressed to think of a deep interior planetary dynamo that wasn't a liquid, though...maybe I'm being too Solar System-centric? Are you including brown dwarfs?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I mostly had plasmas in mind, in particular the sun's dynamo (I totally forgot about the terrestrial planets). I don't know what state of matter metallic hydrogen or ionic ices are, I'm guessing supercritical fluids...? Maybe liquids. </p>
<p>I don't know if regular gasses can be conductive, that might automatically qualify them as plasmas, but at least in principle if you had a conductive gas it should be able to be a dynamo. Though maybe you'd need so much mass that it'll immediately be supercritical...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My memory of it (worth looking up if you really care, take this with a grain of salt) is that a fluid is something that doesn't support shear stress. Basically, something that when you push on it, it will flow out of the way. A gas is a fluid that will fill a container, whereas a liquid is a fluid with a relatively fixed volume.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this we can also look at the response of a body to an external field. Jupiter's magnetic dipole is actually tilted slightly from the axis of rotation. This means that over the course of Jupiter's rotation the field felt by one of it's moons will vary with time creating a changing magnetic flux through the moon. Lenz's law tells us that systems will always act to oppose a change in flux leading to induced currents within the moon that generate a field that opposes this change in flux.  The induction effects will depend on the composition of the moon i.e. the closer it is to being a perfect conductor, the stronger the induced field. We can build various models that try to predict what field an observer might expect to measure near the moon based on the ambient Jovian field + induced field + natural field of the moon. Based on which models best fit the data we can assess what the conductive properties of the moon are and therefore what the composition might be like.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For instance, Jupiter's magnetic field is absolutely enormous, so we know there must be a ton of electrically-conducting fluid there</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Field size alone will not tell you the amount of material as you will also need to consider the typical velocities of the fluid. See for example the magnetic field strength of a nuetron star in comparison to its progenitor. A neutron star by its very nature has less mass than the progenitor and but significantly higher (relevant) velocities (in the relativistic regime). Basically, if you maintain the amount of material but increase the helical motion of the fluid, which can be done by driving the convective Rossby number down (spin up the object) , then you will increase the field strength.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What the field can tell you is the depth at which the magnetic field is produced. This is done by observing the drop of field strength with increasing degree of spherical harmonic. A colleague of mine used this method to provide an improved estimate of where the dynamo region depth is of Jupiter based on the latest Juno data (this was a couple of years ago).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe I misunderstood you, but neutron star magnetic fields are higher than in the progenitor because of magnetic flux conservation. When the star collapses, it reduces the surface area through which the MF &quot;lines&quot; permeate, increasing the flux. Adding helicity to the field and/or spinning up the background fluid does not amplify the MF.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neutron stars might be a bad example, I am not overly failure with their structure and dynamo mechanism. I just couldnt think of a better example off hand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically, if you take a planet and increase its spin rate you will increase helicity which can amplify the magnetic field. This is at least something you would expect in the geodynamo from my understanding.</p></div>		</li>
