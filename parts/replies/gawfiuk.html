			<div class="markdown"><p>They used extremely careful astronomical observations to determine true vertical from the stars, then compared it to plumb line vertical to solve for the density of the mountain. The Astronomer Royal himself was part of the expedition. </p>
<p>Yes, this means they had to get extremely careful measurements of the stars on a mountain in Scotland. Can't have been much fun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is really cool, thanks for sharing. While not requiring much in the way of specialized experimental equipment, it's a real feat of astrometry and surveying. It appears that this was published in 1775 about ~25 years before the Cavendish experiment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The mountain had to be surveyed very accurately. From this they drew lines between points of the same height and thus topological maps were born. When you see a weather map today you are seeing a by-product of the first attempt to measure the mass of the Earth.</p></div>		</li>
