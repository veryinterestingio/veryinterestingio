<p>Thanks for answering a question I've had for years that I never bothered to look up.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;Pay heed that both will receive a hefty blow to the chest and that their feet are placed outside their bodies. Therefore lift your sword with both fists while lifting up your left leg and kicking away his (?payn?) at his knee, just as pictured above.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had some friends who did historical reenactment fighting. I did a couple of sessions of swordplay training with them, the instructor had some words on getting into reenactment for cheap: &quot;You want to go out and find a big long lump of oak to use as a club and a tunic. When the battle starts, sprint barefoot towards the guy with the most expensive plate armour you can see, and hit him with your club so his armour rings like a bell and do it until he falls over&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, dress up like <a href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/mountandblade/images/1/17/Swadian_Recruit.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130701210953" target="_blank">peasant recruits</a> from Mount &amp; Blade? That sounds pretty fun, actually. Everyone is dressed up in fancy armor, and you're just in a sack cloth hurling insults and stones at people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much! One of these suits of armour costs thousands of pounds and are often owned by people who take the sport far too seriously, so having it dented by an almost naked student with a big stick is going to mightily piss them off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great, well-informed,  and well-sourced post!</p>
<p>Additionally, some people got around plate armor's protection from blades by crushing instead.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mace_(bludgeon)#European_Middle_Ages" target="_blank">Warhammers and maces</a> could just bang a big dent in the armor and inflict blunt force trauma to the unfortunate wearer underneath.  Ever wonder why sometimes a mace is depicted with weird blunt flanges on the head?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, those flanges basically maximize the amount of pressure being delivered by the mace by minimizing the area of impact. Less area means more pressure at a given point, meaning it punches the armor even better.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yep, I agree, maces were used too. I mean...in a way a poleaxe is a glorified warhammer after all. :-)</p>
<p>As for the flanges, u/Brad_Thunderdong answered that perfectly, as I see it.</p></div>		</li>
