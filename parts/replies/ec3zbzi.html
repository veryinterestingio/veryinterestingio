			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a classmate that claimed to have an eiedetic memory. He was a one upper, a braggart, and nobody really cared to call him on it. One day after astounding the study group with facts that he supposedly learned many years ago, (he would study off the wall stuff before we got together for the study session), I asked him how many people were sitting together behind him. How many males, wearing baseball caps, etc.. He got all of them wrong. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I'd say the majority of people that claim to have eidetic memory are plainly bullshitting. It's very rare and I'd wager people with eidetic memory don't even realize their memory works differently than other's.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if photographic memory doesn't exist and Eiedetic memory doesn't exist in adults, then what type of memory is it where I can picture a memory in my head?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that would be referred to as visualization. Everyone is capable of this, as we can recall memories and <strong>assign</strong> mental images to those memories. This differs from photographic and eidetic memory, which is the actual, precise image of that event stored as memory. Similar, but different in a significant way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not everyone is actually capable of visualization. A small percentage of people lack this ability to an almost, if 100% degree. It's called aphantasia. I am one. There's r/aphantasia if you're curious. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes sense. It does seem like it would be more akin to reconstructing the memory in the same way that I can imagine a man with 6 arms and blue skin</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Visualization is basically recalling the memory in your head.</p>
<p>Eidetic Memory is where you can perceive the memory so clearly that it’s almost as if your perceiving it again. Almost like have an instant replay, but it’s still somewhat possible to have errors.</p>
<p>Photographic is where you can 100% recall anything with 100% accuracy simply by looking at it once.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if I can read a book and remember in vivid detail (and visualize) the page number, paragraph, and everything then what is that called. I always assumed photographic memory. I also visualize many things when recalling a memory like the time or something seemingly irrelevant that most people don't recall when recalling the same memory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats just memory, albeit a good one,  anyone can do that for certain things.  If you can flip thru a book once, and then remember every word, position, page, etc, that would be photographic memory, which has never been proven.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Photographic memory is just memory too, it's colloquially termed to, ironically, illustrate the vividness of their memory. To think photographic memory is some set-in-stone 'condition' or 'state of being' rather than just a more precise - if a bit poetic - way of describing their capacity for minuet details in their memory is a bit naive, in my opinion. </p>
<p>I assert that having this &quot;just memory&quot; perfectly, and validly, constitutes as having &quot;photographic memory&quot; based on that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's just visualizing a memory. I'd also caution that your brain makes up a lot of those small details that you call seemingly irrelevant. You may swear up and down that the time was 1:46 in one memory or that you were wearing red shorts but chances are you brain made that up on the spot to make a more complete memory.</p></div>		</li>
