			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know that that analogy makes sense. There's not a finite amount of &quot;reaction&quot; in your body, otherwise the massive amount of allergens you encounter when you get symptoms would use up all the &quot;reaction,&quot; and you wouldn't get an allergic reaction (in this example, to pollen) for very long at all. Obviously this isn't the case, since people with allergies suffer for sometimes months on end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But let's say I have a pollen allergy that I'm exposed to continuously for about four months every year? If even a smaller dose in an allergy shot can grant immunity, wouldn't I end up generating some immunity on my own?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cause your body keeps rebuilding the land mines. It's not a permanent immunity. If you ask allergic individuals, they take not only the allergen shot, but also have to take additional anti-allergic medication. Cause though the shot wiped out a large part, their body is rebuilding the chemicals that cause allergic reaction so they take the allergic medication for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, but we get back to the question of how the shot is different than actual exposure to the allergen. Shouldn't continuous exposure to a large amount of the allergen (seasonal pollen allergies) be <em>at least as effective as</em> continuous exposure to a small amount of the allergen (allergy shots)?</p></div>		</li>
