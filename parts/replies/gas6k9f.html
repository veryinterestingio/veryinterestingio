			<div class="markdown"><p>If cells renew periodically, and by the age of 40 you're unlikely to have a single cell left from when you were born, why would any of that matter? Why can't the new cells work just the same as the original ones did?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I recall from my EMT classes, it’s because cell regeneration slows down progressively as you age. So death ultimately results from your cells dying at a rate faster than your body can regenerate them. But I’m also a moron, so take what I say with a grain of salt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im not a cell specialist but i think there’s a bunch of things that change with each replication, probably at a very tiny level like at DNA level and such. Also some Cells like hair cells dont replicate so when you lose them they are gone</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As your telomeres decay the genetic information used to generate new cells becomes damaged, so even though new cells are coming in, in many cases they’ll be worse than the cells they’re replacing, and eventually telomere degradation reaches the point where new cells are not viable to perform the job. At this point organs fail, death.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not entirely true. The optic nerve and the lens are not replaced, but the muscle and epithelial tissue (eye skin and inner surfaces) do undergo replacement. In fact, the areas above and below the pupil is where the stem cells live that replace the surface cells of your eyes</p></div>		</li>
