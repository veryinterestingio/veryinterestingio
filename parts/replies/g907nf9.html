			<div class="markdown"><p>And on top of that, here's a philosophical question on top of the way this is envisioned in scifi:</p>
<p>If I create some entangled atoms, and I kept my atoms and shipped the others to you, and then I effected the change such that you received that entangled information... is it still faster than light? You had to <a href="https://what-if.xkcd.com/31/" target="_blank">wait for the shipment.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the idea of entangled particles as sci-fi would have you think is that once you receive your bundle of entangled particles you would be able to get new information from the contents of that package faster than light.</p>
<p>I would say the question is akin to a radio. You don't receive a radio at the speed of light. but once you have the radio you can receive information from the radio at the speed of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's now also a physics question, not a strictly philosophical question, which is good news as that allows us to have a (more) concrete answer!</p>
<p>It turns out that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-communication_theorem" target="_blank"><em>you cannot use entanglement to transmit information faster than the speed of light</em></a>, irrespective of how you set up the initial conditions. If we could, we could also do all sorts of weird shit, like make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachyonic_antitelephone" target="_blank">a telephone that calls <em>the past</em></a>.</p>
<p>If we can transmit information through entanglement faster than light, that would indicate that there's something fundamental about quantum mechanics that we don't understand, and our current formulations of QMech appear to be absolutely superb descriptions of the universe.</p>
<p>That said, there are some (serious, legitimate) people looking into potential ways we <em>could</em> use entanglement for superluminal transmissions. There was one such guy in the physics department at my alma mater -- he was a real, respected physicist with a great deal of other active research, too. And because he knew the physics, <em>he fully expected his entanglement-telephone experiments to fail</em>. But the experiments were cheap and easy to run alongside his more mainstream research, and negative results are important to the field as well. In the extremely unlikely event that he does discover something unexpected, that would hint a new physics and would be an immense discovery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its because if you separate two particles really far away something weird happens. So you have two entangled particles even 100s of light-years away. The spins of the particles are still in a super position at this point. However, if you have a clock and have each particle measured at the same time, they still will measure oppisite of eachother. This makes it seem like the information of how the waveform collapsed from one particle travel to the other at faster than light. So although you couldn't send whatever information through entanglement that you wanted to, it still seems to send information faster than light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The crazy part of entanglement comes down to the fact that spin up and spin down measurements have an axis of measurement, if you measure both particles on the same axis they will always be opposite. This isn't very interesting. The interesting stuff happens when you vary the axis of measurement, but I don't know enough to speak on that with any authority.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I compare it to having a coin that you split in half lengthwise, and put “heads” in one envelope and “tails” in another envelope. You can take one of the envelopes in a rocket ship as far away as you like and whenever you open it, you instantly know what half is in the other envelope back on Earth.</p>
<p>If it’s a quantum coin, though, the half-coin inside will be neither (or both) heads nor/and tails until you open it, but you’ll still instantly know what someone will see when they open the other envelope, even though there hasn’t been enough time for a signal to travel back to the other half to tell it what state to fall into.</p>
<p>That’s weird, but no more useful for communication than if they really were in a definite state of heads or tails the entire time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is a great analogy. But to make it more clear you should mention that you need to flip the coin, cut it, and package it without looking at it.</p>
<p>You can be sure that heads and tails are both in different envelopes, so you can look at one and know what the other is. But there's no way to influence it or use it to send signals.</p>
<p>Even if you have an endless supply of these envelopes from your communication partner, all you can get from it is random noise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess the only way to send information in that case would be to be able to influence the likelihood that the envelope you open will contain the heads side or the tails side. I assume this is impossible with our current understanding of quantum particles. It's just if you observe it, it randomly picks one. But I wonder how truly random that is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you do anything to influence the state, it breaks the entanglement and the state of your system will no longer be correlated with the state of the other system, so yeah, you can’t transmit information that way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like this just serves as proof that the quantum state isn't in flux in the first place. Isn't it more logical to conclude that the states are fixed, than that some mysterious phenomenon is causing a superluminal transfer of information.</p>
<p>Edit: To clarify,  I'm not suggesting that there's a &quot;hidden variable&quot; that if measured would eliminate the probabilistic nature of MEASUREMENT. Rather that I don't understand the conclusion that the particle is in flux, instead of concluding the particle is fixed and its the unknowable state of the observer that drives the probabilistic outcome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the fact of their spins being &quot;defined&quot; or collapsed happens instantly right?  A &quot;spooky action&quot; that happens seemingly faster than light?   I'm trying to remember, but I thought there was an experiment where scientists proved that the &quot;collapse&quot; happened instantaneously regardless of distance.  Not just Bell's Theorem, but experimental data.  I think that's where all the FTL-transmission ideas come from, right?     </p>
<p>I can't remember the limitations of the experiment, but only that it ruled out FTL-communication.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Can you remind me how they measured/proved this?  That's what I am forgetting.</p>
<p>How do they prove that the collapse happened if they cannot know when it happened?   Because if you knew when the other person collapsed the particle, you would be able to communicate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does entropy work into this (if at all?) </p>
<p>Entropy increases as time increases for large close systems</p>
<p>So is it not possible to measure the entropy of your box? If the entropy is slightly higher, then the other person already measured their box (because the probabilities in your box has collapsed). If the entropy in your box is slightly lower than expected, then the other party has not yet measured theirs? Even in the classical way of introducing a tiny amount of heat and measuring the temperature increase? I am assuming that a slight fluctuation in box heat and measuring that temperature won't cause collapse, because these systems are experimentally demonstrated and no real system can avoid slight amounts of environmental fluctuation?</p></div>		</li>
