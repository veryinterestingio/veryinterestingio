			<div class="markdown"><p>While it is true that the cleaning is not 100% accurate, the probe did spend quite a lot of time in deep space. The radiation levels there, while some spores might still survive, should have been enough to kill any lingering contaminants. And most if not all the potential contaminants on Curiosity would be oxygen breathing metabolizing. The ones from Earth that would remotely be able to survive on Mars, are almost impossible to have come into contact with the probe before/during launch. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While very hardy creatures, they still need oxygen to live. They have been exposed to space in low Earth orbit and they survived. But that is different from Deep Space. No magnetosphere to block the harshest of radiation. And they would end up on Mars and they wouldn't revive from their hibernation. Even though there might be water on Mars, there is still no free oxygen in the air. And it is not in the air it will also not be dissolved into the free water, if there is any. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tardigrades can survive exposure to vacuum and radiation, but the longer and more extreme the exposure, the lower the survival rate. Curiosity took about 9 months from launch to landing, so I don't think even a tardigrade could have survived the trip unprotected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is in fact no way to absolutely kill all spores.  10^4 is pretty damn good.  Most medical sterilization, we're talking like heart valves and surgical instruments, are in the range of magnitude of 10^5 to 10^6.  What NASA is doing is certainly close to the best we can do.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to start by saying that I don't have access to the article, so I may be wrong here. </p>
<p>That being said, I think it is likely that those bacteria were exposed to space while in LEO. If I'm right then that means that they were within the Earth's magnetosphere for those 6 years. This would have protected them from quite a lot of radiation that anything going to Mars would be exposed to. The experiment does show just how durable bacteria can be, but unless they sent the samples well out into space for the test its applicability is limited due to the protection that the magnetosphere gave the samples.</p>
<p>Of course, this all ignores the fact that even if loads of bacteria were accidentally sent to Mars they would essentially be unable to do anything due to the inhospitable environment. A few hundred billion bacterial spores don't mean much without any oxygen and little to no liquid water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many spore forming microorganisms are anaerobic (cannot live in the presence of oxygen) or are facultative aerobes (they can use oxygen to grow better, but are just fine without it). Spores can also be resistance to cold, dessication and radiation, and I suspect that spaces where they'll be missed by cleaning might also be more insulated from radiation.</p>
<p>Not saying that a lot won't die en route, but with microbes, it only takes one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true, but it makes it sound like NASA just gives the surface a wipe down with alcohol wipes, and then sends a probe out. Everything gets this as the bare minimum, but components that can be subject to additional measures are, and at great expense. These include desiccation, UV exposure, temperature extremes and pH extremes.</p>
<p>After launch, anything that was able to go dormant and survive all that has to deal with the extreme cold and vacuum of space, along with UV and other ionizing radiation. Then, there are the extreme conditions that much of the entry capsule is subjected to during atmospheric entry, followed by the conditions on Mars itself, which are very different from what anything on Earth has evolved to deal with.</p>
<p>Even if something did survive, in a dormant state, it is extremely unlikely that it could ever wake up from that state to reproduce and spread. There's not oxygen to breathe, and even plants can't deal with anywhere near that much CO2. Although temperatures on Mars occasionally get above 0°C, the pressures are below the Armstrong limit, so even ice on the surface slowly sublimes into gas.</p>
<p>Many of these conditions are, on their own, survivable. In combination, however, they are extremely deadly. If Mars has been contaminated by earth, it is much more likely that the source is a meteorite impact, such as the one that killed the dinosaurs, nocking chunks of rock from Earth to Mars. The same thing may have even happened in reverse, and one of the many Mars meteorites we have on Earth may have brought life with it, or even seeded the first life on Earth. It has been shown that the interiors of such rocks, if they are reasonably large, never get hot or cold enough to sterilize them. For all we know, we could be descended from Martians.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Assuming that, in the very unlikely event that something were to survive the trip to Mars, would the lander's instruments be able to identify that particular microbe as being of earthly origin, and not Martian (and compensate for this in its tests)? And would the probe be able to identify a microbe that was intact but dead? As in, the empty, dead &quot;husk&quot;, if you will, of that single, tiny bacteria on the surface of <em>something</em> on or in the lander?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could distinguish based on quantity.  Based on all of the above it is possible that you might find one or two stray microbes that are in hybernation/bordering on death.  However if you find big clumps of bacteria happily churning out methane you know it didn't come with you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that there would be very clear features of the DNA which show it may have had ancestry of terrestrial origin. However whether they even thought it would be necessary to install instruments that could find and sequence the DNA of these hypothetical life forms is highly unlikely as it would probably add significant weight to the probe.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So, if we can find a natural habitat where the pH changes drastically on a semi-regular basis, we could probably find organisms that would survive. </p>
