			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm trying to understand how mining can remain worth while in the long run. Already I've read that bitcoin mining isn't really that lucrative and more of a hobbyist endeavor so how will the network be maintained once the cost of mining outweighs the reward? Won't the rewards have to infinitely increase to the point where simply maintaining the network becomes too costly? Or is this a form of bitcoin &quot;inflation&quot;?</p></div>		</li>
