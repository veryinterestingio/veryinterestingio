			<div class="markdown"><p>The whole point is that even if they had a Navajo speaker, it would only be one layer. </p>
<p>Like you said, there was random chatter between them about how breakfast and the weather and how's the wife and kids, by design. </p>
<ol>
<li>You need a Navajo speaker</li>
<li>You need to know which part of the conversation is chatter about breakfast cereal and which part is code for the Froot Loops are in the milk, I repeat, the Froot Loops are in the milk</li>
<li>Even if you can find the Froot Loops in the milk parts, you still need to find out what the Froot Loops and the Milk are. </li>
</ol>
<p>Even then, there are other protections to build into any code. Sending out false signals and seeing who shows up. One of the huge insights with the Enigma codebreakers was that they never acted on it. No one really knew about it, and anytime they used it, they'd make sure they had a credible alternate story for how they found out that would be much better known. Had they been too bold with it, the Germans would have figured it out and changed things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can not stress the importance of the last part.</p>
<p>I mean, one needs to understand that the Germans were not ‚that‘ stupid. Overconfidence played a big part with Enigma. But the Germans had their very own codebreakers which also had their successes. If the information of the breaking of Enigma would not have been guarded so paranoid, they would have found out eventually.
And while in the end it would not have saved them from losing, it would have made beating them much more harder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>During WWI, the British was breaking German codes as well, in a facility called Room 40. So, they knew a lot about U-boat locations and activities, but which they couldn't necessarily act on without tipping their hand. (As well as intercepting German and US diplomatic traffic.)</p>
<p>Eric Larson discusses it extensively in &quot;Dead Wake&quot; about the sinking of the Lusitania. They knew that there was a U-boat operating in the area, and had tracked its  course. Part of the reason they didn't do anything, like inform the captain of the Lusitania, or dispatch torpedo boats to escort the ship, was to encourage American outrage to cause the US to enter the war.</p>
<p>Later, when the German government decided to use unrestricted u-boat warfare to end the way, they sent a message the German ambassador instructing him to inform the US government, along with a second communication directing the German ambassador in Mexico to offer the Mexican president an alliance, entering the war in the German side, and in return Germany would press for returning former Mexican territory from the US.</p>
<p>In order to present that information to the US and encourage the US to enter the war, the British government had to find a plausible alternative source for the information, which they did (a radio operator in Mexico.)</p>
<p>It was this news, when given to the US government and leaked to the press, which generated the popular outrage necessary for Wilson to be able to ask Congress for a declaration of war. (They did these things a lot differently back then.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read once that they actually captured one or two native navajo speakers, and tried to get them to decode the messages, but the speakers (who were not a part of the code talking program, they just spoke navajo) just literally translated everything, and the japanese people couldnt easily make sense of it, so the thought the speakers were lying, so they tortured them, when in reality if they had taken the translation seriously they wouldve figured out the codes relatively easily.  </p>
<p>EDIT: the navajo speaker they captured was Joe Kieyoomia<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>Navajo as a code talking language was first explored in “early 1942” and the first code talkers were recruited in May, the same month as the fall of Corregidor when Joe Kieyoomia was most likely captured. He had almost certainly been there through the whole battle from Dec 1941 - Mqy ’42. His deployed preceded the idea of using the Navajo speakers.</p></div>		</li>
