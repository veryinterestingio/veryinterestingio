			<div class="markdown"><p>I managed a gas station for 10 years. I have replaced a handful of these handles every year because, yes, it does fail on occasion. Rarely, but enough that you should be paying attention so you can stop it yourself if it doesn't trigger - LIKE IS POSTED ON EVERY GAS PUMP EVERYWHERE.</p>
<p>The number of times I had stopped pumps on people as they are walking around the store or going to the bathroom while they left the pump going was one of my biggest peeves working there. They'd always act so clueless or even get mad at me because now they have to stand around for 2 minutes while they restart their pump.</p>
<p>The best was when they just hang the nozzle back up and drive away. I wish I could see the look on their face 5 minutes down the road when they realized they only pumped 2 gallons.</p>
<p>Sorry.. Some repressed memories still come up from working there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your post will make me change a habit. I always put the pump on auto and then go into the store for beer and whatnot. A two gallon fill I would pick up on, as I run cars empty and then know roughly how much I need, but the overflowing could cause a few liability issues.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had my hand on it (but the thing clipped) while it was pumping and overflowed quite the splash. Maybe like half a water bottle-ish at most from both the back pressure and overfilling. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Happened to me recently. I actually just pump myself, never use the autopump trigger. But it was really cold out and it engaged without me intending to do so, so I just figured whatever, I can put my hands in my pockets and watch money go out of my account.</p>
<p>Gets to about the max and I'm ready for it to stop so I can pull out the nozzle. It does not stop. It starts spraying around the sides. Stupidly, I yank the nozzle out and it sprays over the side of my car. I'm yelling every curse word in the book as I try to pry the trigger loose. I eventually succeed.</p>
<p>I hang up the pump and collect myself, survey the scene. Really most of it was just dripping down the side of my car. Not ideal, and it was maybe 3 seconds' worth, but not much else I can do. I do a quick brain check of whether or not anything I do poses a static spark threat, decide not, close my tank flap and drive away.</p>
<p>Sometimes those suckers just get stuck in shitty gas stations...</p></div>		</li>

<p>Protip: starting your car is a huge spark threat, considering it uses spark IGNITION to run and often those ignition cables can degrade over time. </p>
<p>Do NOT drive away after spilling gas. alert the attendant and get the spill looked after, let it dry off your car/wipe as much as you can up and only once the fumes have subsided should you start your car. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Happened to me once when I left my car to use the restroom.  I thought my passenger would keep an eye on it.  About 10-15 gallons of gas ended up on the ground.  I told the gas attendant and promptly left.  It did not look pretty.  Fortunately, I didn’t see  a huge explosion or fire in my rear view mirror as I drove away and the gas station is still standing today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, pretty interesting. I once had a nozzle where the vacuum sensor didn't work and the latch to keep it pumping on its own got stuck, so it started spraying gasoline all over my feet. Would have been nice to know about the rolling ball feature, and that pointing it up might have stopped it. </p>
<p>Now I'm curious to try that feature out, haha.</p></div>		</li>
