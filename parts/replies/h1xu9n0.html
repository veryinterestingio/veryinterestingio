<p>Or &quot;insanely high pressure that is impossible to achieve without Serious Science&quot; for those who don't like numbers.</p>
<p>I have no intuitive understanding of PSI, bar, pascals... but &quot;100000 times the atmospheric pressure&quot; is a lot.</p>
<p>(That's 1 sig fig, because the difference from the 114000 given in the article makes no difference to our understanding).</p></div>		</li>
