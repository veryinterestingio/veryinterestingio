			<div class="markdown"><p>spot on. this is why your car wont have heating until the engine warms up a little. it can actually be used to your benefit when the engine is starting to overheat; I once drove in an RV in summer and the engine was overheating, so we put the heater to max and rolled down the windows, as the cabin heater acts as a second radiator to cool the engine (by a small amount, we turned off to fix it ASAP)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, if your car doesn't have one, but you want one, you can buy it for $20 in a form of case for your seat and power it from lighter.</p>
<p>I have one of those. Put it on in November, hide it in a shed in March. Very useful when you start your car in the morning and it's -15*C outside. 20 seconds and your ass is in warmth. Though 5 mins into driving it's becoming completely useless because coolant is finally hot so normal heating available.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thereâ€™s a heating coil in the seat, electricity is passed through the coil and it gets warm.</p>
<p>The coil is a resistor, so friction is made and the energy is released as heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Moreover, the degree of control you have over temperature comes from a motorized flange that controls the mix of air being blown from heater core to the air coming from outside or from the cabin. This is why you have more of a range of heat beyond just &quot;however hot the heater core is&quot; and &quot;none&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My first car's blend door was broken. I only had 2 options :( Not only that, the resistor for the blower motor was busted so it was either off or max air flow. </p>
<p>All the heat that G20 could make, or none.</p></div>		</li>
