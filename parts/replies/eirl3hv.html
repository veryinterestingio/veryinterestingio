			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question! Skin allografts usually aren’t left on more than a month or so because they almost all ultimately reject, even with irradiation or immune suppression. They’re used more as a bridge to autograft when the surface area to be covered is larger than the amount of harvestable tissue available at one time. Patients with large burns, for example, sometimes require surgery more than once a week initially, just to move skin around. So you don’t have to worry about things like melanoma because it won’t be on that long.</p>
<p>(Also a big reason for irradiating it is sterilization to reduce the risk of disease transmission)</p></div>		</li>
