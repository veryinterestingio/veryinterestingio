			<div class="markdown"><p>VC is a subset of PE like the other comment says. They are different in a lot of ways, but the funds themselves are generally organized the same way. A PE or VC firm generally invests capital from outside investors (known as Limited Partners), in private companies only temporarily, to be later sold for a profit. Then the firms and the LPs get their separate cuts of the profits. PE and VC firms invest in very different companies, but the general idea is the same. </p>
<p>The other answer is much more succinct than I could be on hedge funds. I don’t think a lot of what you said was “wrong” as I said before, but perhaps a bit too vague that it was almost misleading</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some terminology. Hedge funds are private investment vehicles, not &quot;very risky investment opportunities&quot;. Hedge fund managers can invest however they want to, assuming their operating documents and investors agree to it.</p>
<p>If someone has a proven track record of betting on horses they could setup a hedge fund to do just that. They are private, unlisted, generally unregulated investment vehicles.</p>
<p>Also, not all hedge funds are risky. Some are setup to be risk averse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The general idea of a hedge fund is that it should generate return not correlated to the market situation. Hence the name hedge. If you hedge your investment you buy &quot;insurance&quot; against crashes (also called shorts). Eg the 2008 crash. Normal investment funds lost a lot of value during the time, because they have strict rules on how to invest their money. Hedgefund don't and can do whatever they want. So they could hedge against crashes. Some big hedgefunds generated a lot of return during the 2008 crash bc of that. The public thinks it's more risky because hedgefunds are not regulated as much as other investment funds.</p></div>		</li>
