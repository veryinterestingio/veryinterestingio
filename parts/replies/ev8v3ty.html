			<div class="markdown"><p>Just for a heads-up, there ARE small drones with six rotors (see: jjrc h20). They have a butt ton of mobility, but in exchange batteries doesn't last much, which I guess it's also a reason why many manufacturers prefer 4 rotors. Bigger battery = more weight!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's normal, basically you can build a drone with any amount of motors. 1:monocopter( not helicopter), 2:dual copter, 3: tricopter, etc</p>
<p>You just have to use some servos.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The nomenclature is pretty annoying if you know the etymology of &quot;helicopter&quot;</p>
<p>It's certainly believable by most that helicopter is a result of smashing two word ideas into one. It's not common knowledge that helicopter is not split into heli and copter. Instead, it is split into helico (helix, spiral, etc) and pter (pteradactyl, pterasaur, etc).</p>
<p>With that, &quot;monocopter&quot; and similar are stupid. But I get it, language evolved and now copter is short for helicopter I guess, so it's fine. This is fine. Dumb but fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but the extra work it provides isn’t enough to compensate for the added weight which is why it consumes more battery. If the motors weighed nothing then yes, more motors would not consume more battery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if the thrust is split evenly between motors, they’re not 100% efficient power conversion. So more rotors means more loss in conversion too.</p>
<p>Also, more motors weighs more so more overall thrust is required.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In general, it is more efficient to produce thrust with a small number of large engines than a large number of small engines.  IE, it is more efficient to have four large rotors than eight that produce half the thrust each.</p>
<p>This is also why airliners have standardized on two engines for most modern designs whenever possible.  The primary exception are the monsters like the 747 and A380; there are no engines large enough such that merely two of them could get those behemoths into the air.  The trijets like the DC-10 and L-1011 were too big to use only two engines in their day, but then engines got bigger, so they've been replaced with twinjets like the 777.</p>
<p>Technically, one really large engine would be more efficient than two.  But there is an FAA rule that all airliners must be able to climb with &quot;One engine out&quot;.  Which is kind of hard to do if you only had one to start with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's still true today. RC helicopters are substantially more capable than multirotors in just about every measurable way. </p>
<p>The arducopter autopilots used on multirotors also have a flavor that works on traditional helicopters now, so they are getting easier to fly. Still more mechanically complex though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I fly racing drones and looked into helicopters a bit and the mechanical complexity is what I think is driving people away from them and more towards quadcopters. with a drone the prop is driven directly by the motor on a nice strong carbon fiber frame, with helicopters you have all these little mechanical parts to break. I guess thats why there aren't really videos of helicopters doing really hard stunts that would take multiple attempts to get down.</p>
<p>all that said I still would like to get a small collective pitch and fly around fpv, which for some reason doesnt seem like has be done much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My first thought was &quot;but why?&quot; Then I watched the video. Oh. That's why.</p>
<p>I wonder if he could get even more yaw authority by putting the clockwise and counterclockwise rotors on two separate motors so he can keep the collective pitch benefits but also add the rotational inertia yaw control.</p></div>		</li>
