			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone said in a thread I was in a long time ago that people die in arrest harnesses because it pinches off a major artery to the leg or whatever, so what's the difference there?  Why would amputation result in rerouting but not a pinch?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theres two aspects. Firstly, the big difference is that the leg is still there and is thus vulnerable (as opposed when you have amputated it). Secondly, you will no doubt notice if there is not enough supply of blood to a leg - it will hurt like hell after a while. So compressing an artery is seldom a problem in itself. Something that is much  less noticeable and therefore dangerous is if you put enough pressure to pinch the veins but not necessarily enough to pinch the arteries. This results in swelling, and the blood trapped in the veins can clot. This clot can later break loose and travel all the way to your lungs, a condition called pulmonary embolism which dependent on its severity can be quite deadly.</p>
<p>This can happen during longer times of immobilisation as well, for example during long flights.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theres a thing called &quot;crush syndrome&quot; or &quot;entrapment syndrome&quot;, where toxins start to accumulate in a limb that's had the blood flow severely restricted for a long time.</p>
<p>The muscle fibres begin to break down and release toxins. Then, when the blood supply rushes back into that limb those toxins are suddenly  flushed into the rest of the body, and can overwhelm other organs (notably the kidneys).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Amputee here: don’t worry you’d feel it if an artery was pinched/blocked/severed. It would feel like your limb was on fire- that’s your limb dying from lack of oxygen. </p>
<p>If blood flow was restricted you’d slowly lose feeling, but flexing and altering position prevents that. You’d have to cut off circulation for an extended amount of time to be in danger.</p></div>		</li>
