			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on each specific purchase situation. This particular injection was Treasury securities (government IOUs) and short-term loans. So the people actually getting the money from the Treasury securities would be those holding the Government IOU Treasury securities: you, me, and the billionaires and foreign investors that do what we do on a larger scale. The other group of IOU holders are banks. The Fed buy it off of people/banks holding the securities. The short-term loans would go to your lenders and investors so they can move &quot;stuff.&quot; They have also been throwing cash to the banks so they lend out more money lately.</p>
<p>I think this case may be a Bank-to-Bank kind of Treasury buying. Where the Fed buys a bunch of Treasuries held by a bank to give them the cash, and then those banks distribute the cash via loans. It could also be bought off of us. Depending on specifics of this particular purchasing.</p>
<p>You can see some more specific Fed data on their balance sheet here: <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_fedsbalancesheet.htm" target="_blank">https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_fedsbalancesheet.htm</a></p>
<p>Its a big game of shoving cash at a clogged financial toilet and hoping something pops from the pressure without making the situation worse. One of my favorites things they've tried was &quot;Operation Twist&quot; where they sold short-term Treasury bonds and then immediately turned and bought long-term Treasury bonds to increase the demand value of &quot;investing in America in the long term&quot; (at least as far as long-term bonds do that).</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is exactly what they’re doing. It’s called “repo” market, or repurchase agreements.  You may have seen it in the news.  To build off of what u/atomandaether has already said...Essentially the repurchase agreements are how banks stay liquid (have “money” that is able to be immediately used, to lend out and pay for things).  At the end of each day banks need a certain amount of “money” to cover a certain amount of “stuff”.  Some banks have more at the end of each day and some have less.  In the past the ones who have had more lend to the ones who have less for a very low interest rate.</p>
<p>Sometime late last year banks stopped doing this.  At least they stopped doing this for low interest rates.  It’s hard to tell why they stopped but they did and this creates a problem: the banks who need a certain amount of “money” at the end of each day didn’t have a good way to get it.  When banks don’t have money that is a bad thing as they can’t give out loans and in extreme cases can’t give people money owed to them. There are also regulatory requirements for how much “money” banks need to have at the end of each day and in their quest to squeeze out a profit, some fall short.  For a forward look we’ll focus on not having “money” for loans...</p>
<p>When banks don’t give out loans economic activity slows.  Most people and companies don’t have ALL the cash to buy the things they need (expanding companies through big purchases or investments in technology), so they ask a bank for a loan.  If a bank doesn’t give out a loan then the company or people either can’t do or buy what they want and that in turn means that the economy is not expanding.  This is amplified even more if the company begins to reduce its own operations either because it couldn’t get the money it needed to sustain them, because it is trying to save the actual cash for that big expenditure, or it see’s things not looking so good for the future as a result of the bank refusing to lend out money.</p>
<p>In steps the Federal Reserve:  it will begin to buy banks’ “stuff” (Treasury securities) in exchange for “money” (room in the banks reserve account on the Feds balance sheet) so that they can stay liquid and hopefully keep giving out loans and meeting its own debt obligations.  </p>
<p>This all sounds well and dandy until one considers some of the troubles of <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/amp/business/story/yes-bank-crisis-urgent-need-to-clean-up-india-s-banking-sector-says-raghuram-rajan-1654663-2020-03-12" target="_blank">India’s banking system</a> and current economic slowdown/supply chain disruptions in China and across the world.  If too many of these banks were lending to less than ideal borrowers (think 2008 where large amounts of risky loans were given out without collateral requirements) loans start to not get paid back and similar effects as 2008 begin to be felt all around the world.  Since the Fed is already sitting on so much “stuff” it’s hard to tell how they’ll be able to step in and save things again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Fed does not give cash to banks. It's reserves. (outside money= notes, coins and reserves) Furthermore banks cannot distribute said reserves via loans. You and I cannot use reserves, only banks can with eachother (interbank payments,..) When the Fed purchases bonds from banks they are changing the composition of the bank's balance sheets. (increase in reserves, decrease in t-bonds)</p></div>		</li>
