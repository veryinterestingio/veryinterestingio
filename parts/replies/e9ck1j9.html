			<div class="markdown"><p>For those curious, here is the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/14/25.853" target="_blank">Regulation</a> that requires it: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>(f) Smoking is not allowed in lavatories. If smoking is allowed in any area occupied by the crew or passengers, an adequate number of self-contained, removable ashtrays must be provided in designated smoking sections for all seated occupants.</p>
<p>(g) Regardless of whether smoking is allowed in any other part of the airplane, lavatories must have self-contained, removable ashtrays located conspicuously on or near the entry side of each lavatory door, except that one ashtray may serve more than one lavatory door if the ashtray can be seen readily from the cabin side of each lavatory served.</p>
<p>(h) Each receptacle used for the disposal of flammable waste material must be fully enclosed, constructed of at least fire resistant materials, and must contain fires likely to occur in it under normal use. The capability of the receptacle to contain those fires under all probable conditions of wear, misalignment, and ventilation expected in service must be demonstrated by test.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is both a great thing and sometimes not a great thing.</p>
<p>It's great as it specifies the exact specifications and reasons for this, and does so in a way an engineer can understand.</p>
<p>It can be not-so-great as people who are experts in that field who write regulations or laws that can carry criminal penalties sometimes have no clue what criminal law is for, and forget to include important legal verbiage that requires, for instance, intent to violate a regulation.</p>
<p>In airlines this isn't as much of a problem, but in other areas this can be problematic and can punish people for doing something they wouldn't expect to be illegal and that they wouldn't think would give them jail time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If watching Air Disasters on the Smithsonian Channel has taught me anything, it's those smallest details usually only get thought about after a tragedy and they come up with ways to prevent it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, yes, particularly in the early days of jet aviation when there were a lot of things we didn't fully understand or take into account. We've learned often that anything that can go wrong, will go wrong, so in the newest airliners there are a crazy amount of redundancies.</p>
<p>Air travel is safer than ever today, and even in the handful of modern planes that do go down, often it's something like pilot error or terrorism/shootdowns that are very difficult to control. Rarely go planes go down 100% due to mechanical issues these days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh I agree, the amount of engineering, redundancies and details thought about and prepared for is staggering.  And many times it's a combination of little things working together that caused a catastrophic failure.  </p>
<p>And not just mechanical, the systems and protocols put in place so, ideally, no human mistake results in something bad is amazing.  Something as simple as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Express_Flight_2574#Probable_cause" target="_blank">shift change paper work</a> for mechanics while boring and seemingly meaningless compared to actually fixing planes correctly are actually important parts of a huge system of safety.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything is written in blood. I live in Canada, which was settled several times, each time with massive casualties. The people who wandered over from Siberia probably lost 90% of their people before settling, and the settlers from Europe died of scurvy and everything else. </p>
<p>Humans are great at dying and pretty good at fixing mistakes. </p></div>		</li>
