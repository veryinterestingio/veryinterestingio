			<div class="markdown"><p>Given you did such a fab job on that answer, I hope you don't mind me adding to the OPs question? (No good deed goes unpunished, etc. ðŸ˜‰)</p>
<p>Does the expansion of spacetime affect other things that we could theoretically measure, such as the rate of virtual particles?</p>
<p>Given that the expansion of spacetime appears to be accelerating, it <em>seems</em> reasonable to ask, tending towards infinity of time, what would the universe look like?</p>
<p>( And finally, is the entire universe really just one big game designed in order to psych and troll the poor Boltzmann's Heads? )</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is this relevant?  Shouldn't this expansion be adding energy to Earth's orbit on an on-going basis?  My impression is that gravitational interactions with other planets would return our orbit to its usual resonance, and there are other factors that remove energy from the orbit, but that that particular factor doesn't care about your gravitational binding.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, I don't think you can do that.</p>
<p>Here's my understanding of the situation.  Others with more theoretical expertise can weigh in, please.  (Tensors are not my forte'.)</p>
<p>The understanding of &quot;cosmological expansion&quot; comes from using Einsteins equations (which describe spacetime and its reaction to energy density) in one specific context, of a homogenous distribution of energy/mass density.   Once you break that assumption, you don't get &quot;cosmological expansion&quot;.  That is, if your energy/mass density looks like a black hole, you get the spacetime solution that looks like a black hole and the highly curved spacetime around it.  If it looks like the Sun you get the solar system, etc.  You can't talk about the &quot;cosmological expansion&quot; for a gravitationally bound object like the solar system, etc etc.  It's just the wrong context.  So I think no, there's no stress.</p>
<p>Which is good, because we have enough to stress about already.  :)</p></div>		</li>

Is the constant you used static? After the initial big bang, is the universe expanding at the same rate, or has this slowed?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I hear about cosmological expansion in passing, it is often mentioned that this will eventually lead to distant galaxies receding beyond our sight and end with stars and planets being ripped apart atom by atom.</p>
<p>Is this second part a misunderstanding by journalists?</p>
<p>Edit: Yes, I get the Big Rip theory, but OP said:</p>
<blockquote>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The expansion and gravity are the same thing. Spacetime doesn't do both at the same time, either the worldlines go together or they don't. It's very loosely like saying can I have a North and South pole at the same time. Magnetic field just doesn't do that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would guess that considering cosmological expansion to be an applied strain isn't reasonable. I think it really depends on the nature of cosmological expansion - if its a cumulative applied strain, or if its something else entirely. I'm not well-versed enough in theoretical physics to make a claim as to its nature.</p>
<p>If cosmological expansion just tends to move stuff apart, without actually exerting a Newtonian force, you might consider cosmological expansion to be like tugging on a spring and then releasing.  Stuff thats bound together will just bounce back to its original state.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The idea &quot;other forces hold stuff together by fighting against a constant background of expansion&quot; is a little misleading.</p>
<p>It is more correct to say that homogenous (uniform) spacetime obeying the FRW metric expands at a rate H_0. This is only valid on massive scales where we just average out all the mass of the universe, or in the vast empty spaces between local galaxy groups. On a smaller scale (like our solar system), local spacetime is better described by the Schwarzschild metric which does not contain any expansion.
To oversimplify but in a slightly more correct way, space does not significantly (compared to empty space) expand near dense matter. The presence of uneven clumps of matter basically holds space together at those points.</p>
<p><em>This</em> is why there is no significant strain on physical objects due to expansion. The situation might change if the cosmological constant changes (Big Rip etc.) but it's not a balance-of-forces type problem.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the rubber band is being stretched at a constant rate, no matter how slow the ant moves, it can always reach the other end eventually. Unfortunately, (or fortunately if you are worried about alien invasion :D ), our universe expands at an increasing rate, so the lights (and aliens) from enough distance away will be never able to reach us, and vice versa.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if my algebra is correct, for andromeda (roughly 2 million ly away according to wiki) this would mean the space between our galaxies is moving apart at ~43 km/s.  However, wiki also says it's moving towards us at ~110 km/s.  So that means it's speed towards us is ~153 km/s?</p></div>		</li>
