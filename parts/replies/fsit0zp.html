			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a close relative in the family who doesnt get the itchy bumps reaction to a mosquito bite - I've always envied that as a genetic win for her that I never got.. going from the above, is that actually bad? Anything to worry about in terms of the immune systems ability to respond to threats?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So it’s been suggested to me that my body doesn’t react to poison ivy. I’ve never had the balls to directly apply it to my skin but I’ve spent a lot of time in the woods and been among parties where many of the other people got rashes. I just figured I was lucky and it was a coincidence. Is it possible to be biologically not have a reaction? If so, Is that even a good thing since I may getting the oils on me but my body’s not doing anything to expel it?</p></div>		</li>
