			<div class="markdown"><p>I am pretty sure scientists say this is actually a more &quot;natural&quot; way of sleeping because back when we were cave-men we wouldn't be sleeping 8hrs all in one go at night. We have to do this out of necessity now culturally due to work etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can attest to this from personal experience. I often sleep roughly 4 hours during the night and then another 2-3 during the day, feels the same if not better than one solid block of sleep.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Oh my sweet summer child. It goes on for <em>much</em> longer than 8-12 months.</p>
<p>My first didn't start sleeping through the night for the first 2 years, at least. And right when he started to, the second one came along and it started all over again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have an almost 2 year old, she still doesn’t sleep well — won’t sleep in her own bed, won’t sleep through the night, needs to be held and rocked to bed. This newborn is a much better sleeper already, already self soothes and puts himself to sleep. But yeah, sleep is effed and has been since my first born. I was curious to know if my broken sleep was still doing maintenance on my brain or if I’ve just been deliriously walking around for the last couple years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my own experience (my kiddo didn't sleep through until he was almost 3), getting a 4 hour block of sleep made a huge huge difference. With four 2-3 hour blocks throughout the day I didn't feel nearly as rested as getting one 4 hour block and two 2-3 hour blocks. It's still not nearly as refreshing as a 7-8 hour night, though, but you adapt to it and it's enough to function during the day. Anything less than three 2 hour blocks was not enough for me to be functional the next day and I'd have to do the bare minimum until I could sleep more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not positive, but I think a similar role comes into play with Dream sleep and earlier phases. The body can adapt to a lack of sleep, but with enough poor sleeps and lack of maintenance, the body will force itself into dream sleep to get the rest it wants. That’s my understanding, feel free to add to or correct!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually curious about this. Few years ago I came across a study talking about many different types of sleeping patterns. Saying that there were roughly 8 main sleeping patterns. It was a study that was &quot;kind of debunking&quot; the 8hour sleep claim. Saying that it does not work for everyone since there are many different sleeping patterns.</p></div>		</li>
