<p>We were told, that even though we had diplomatic immunity, the ministry wouldn't hesitate one second in waiving that if we committed a serious crime.</p>
<p>Getting caught drinking in public once? No problem. Committing a murder? nah.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes sense, since I imagine it goes both ways. If the US sends a diplomat to France, and France harasses the diplomat, that would piss off the US and put France in a bad position. If the diplomat wantonly breaks the local laws and hides behind immunity, that's going to piss off France and put the US in a bad position. So I imagine you can generally rely on the diplomat's home country to enforce good behavior.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is an ongoing case where the wife of a USA diplomat in the UK killed someone by dangerous driving, she pleaded diplomatic immunity and quickly got on a flight back to the USA, now she wont be tried for the crime she committed or extradited back to the UK to face trial.. seems like a very shitty process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In that case (if there was a competent administration), the diplomat would be fired and the wife would be charged under american laws. </p>
<p>It's in the US' best interests to maintain good relationships with its allies. Part of that is by holding those with immunity to account.</p></div>		</li>
