			<div class="markdown"><p>I always do this. Unplug something, then hit the power button until the power light goes out, then maybe another 6 times for good measure, then plug it back. </p>
<p>It usually only takes 10 seconds, and is a lot better than standing around counting to 30.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most will, by design, not function this way. With insufficient power coming into the first side, the second side, designed to further remove any rippling won't provide any (or at least much) power without being fully charged.</p>
<p>Sure, some super sensitive equipment may not work this way, but most modern electronics do. Rolling brownout and unclean flickering power is a very real problem in a lot of the world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really depends. I see what you meant, but I have also worked with embedded system that the capacitor can hold for a good 20-30 seconds without power source. </p>
<p>This usually is handled during power cut-off that the OS halt and wait until the power is drained out, but there is no guarantee that the power-down procedure is done that way.</p>
<p>Some systems, do start writing things before system is started properly, it could be counters, logs, etc. Which in the best practices could be in RAM first or if it has to be persistent, in other part of hardware, NOR flash, or on CPU memories. But it is not uncommon that the OS/boot sequence has to be built on top of a not-so-well-thought-out hardware that misses that, and firmware developers could only use what they could use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. The OS may be stored in ROM, but a lot of cases, disk (flash memory, or even a SD card, etc) are used for storing data, configurations, or even data vital for booting, like keys for authentication.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The RAM actually doesn't matter. What matters is that the CPU resets. (Same issue though, it may have separate capacitors)</p>
<p>RAM itself consists of capacitors and will hold corrupted but partially readable data for tens of seconds. But when the CPU resets it will go through the normal boot process and ignore the RAM.</p></div>		</li>
