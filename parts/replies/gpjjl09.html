			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it (theoretically) possible to develop vaccines that work for animals that have reservoirs? Not talking about logistics in <em>trying</em> to physically vaccinate a bunch of animals,  but if it could be done... would it be possible to eradicate the flu?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We were fortunate with rinderpest in that it couldn't be maintained in sparse populations so wild animals weren't a great reservoir. With influenza however, 1) orthomyxoviridae are notorious for rapid and massive genetic shift because of their segmented genome and 2) are simply ubiquitous so we could never vaccinate all the animals in time for the next birth cohort to be protected. We would have to develop some kind of self-disseminating vaccine like OPV/Sabin but given the vaccine-derived outbreaks we're experiencing, there are shortcomings to say the least.</p>
<p>In short, no, we'll never have the resources to eradicate flu.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Certainly.  We did it with rabies on a localized scale.  That's for a disease with a 100% fatality rate and almost exclusively spread by animals but it shows it's doable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if everyone becoming vegan would eliminate the flu? Presumably eating and farming them is the biggest source of contact for people and birds. Wonder how many other diseases that would work with too?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There have been a number of direct avian to human transmission, mainly amongst farmers working with the birds. Veganism wouldn’t /eliminate/ influenza strains but it may prevent the next pandemic</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that's what I meant, the issue pretty much boils down to a) the proximity of birds to each other when farmed and b) our contact with them. If everyone suddenly started eating vegan those two things would basically vanish.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Farming is a large contributor of avian virus spread and mutation (creating new virus strains) The close proximity of the animals leads to increased transmission. You’re definitely right</p></div>		</li>
