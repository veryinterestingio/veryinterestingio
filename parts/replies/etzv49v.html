			<div class="markdown"><p>One of my favorite quotes is  &quot;the universe is not only stranger than we imagine, its stranger than we can imagine&quot;</p>
<p>I think the most extraordinary thing I've ever learned, personally, is that literally everything on earth is made of dead stars. Elements heavier than iron are made in supernovas. They have to be. Our whole world, you and i included, is literally made of stars. Or a star.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you touched on is why we believe the Earth's core must be made of iron. We can't actually go there and check so while there's a lot of evidence we can't <em>prove</em> it.</p>
<p>Anyway, the fact that run of the mill stars create iron (while super novas make everything heavier) means that there must be a shit ton of iron in the solar system/universe. However the earth's crust has relatively low iron. When we get a meteorite that is more homogeneous in it's elemental profile we see they can have a lot more iron in them.</p>
<p>Therefore one of the theories was that the Earth must still have a ton of iron, it's just deeper in the Earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to study science and learn music at the same time and sometimes in the morning I would just start to walk towards the uni for the lecture and somehow end up at the music school instead. Couldn't remember when or why my autopilot took the wrong turn but would usually end up few minutes late for the lecture because of this. I thought I was going insane at the time since I would never remember my walks when I get to the destination and people I talked to about that have never experienced such a thing.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Also, this morning I decided to walk to my favorite barber shop and get a haircut but ended up accidentally drinking coffee at my friend's house that is in the barber shop's neighbourhood because my autopilot decided that I should go there instead.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I love my autopilot!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Better, but sensation is still lessened. It's probably because you're still anticipating a particular sensation at a specific spot. The randomness of massages from a third party is what makes the sensation pleasurable.</p></div>		</li>
