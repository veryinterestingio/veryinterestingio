			<div class="markdown"><p>The one thing that article didn't mention is NOTAM. That is a Notice To Airmen and is how all the pilots know where to avoid.</p>
<p>This twitter account posts just space related NOTAMs <a href="https://twitter.com/NotamUpdates" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/NotamUpdates</a></p>
<p>as you can see they are terse, basically just time and place and some sort of shape. Pilots check for NOTAMs before each flight and either they or their navigator ensure they aren't crossing into a space and time referenced in a NOTAM.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For even more fun, there are <a href="https://skyvector.com/" target="_blank">websites that plot them over aeronautical charts</a>, so you can see the exact NOTAM-affected airspace and what's going on there. It's really interesting to watch this around rocket launches to see what areas are being cleared out, and when.</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for the gold!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Heh, well they <em>should</em></p>

<p>Airliners haven't had a navigator on board since like the 70's</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to this, NOTAMs are typically paired with what are called <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Regulations#Temporary_flight_restrictions" target="_blank">Temporary Flight Restrictions</a> (TFR). They are a legal barrier designated by the Federal Aviation Administration. The President and Vice President of the USA are both granted TFRs for their protection. These are in the realm of what you’re thinking about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something else to think about is literally this whole thing was 10 minutes long from air born to the things that were coming down being back down. It's a very narrow window and a very short one as well. It's not like these are hugely time intensive exercises. Either it all works and it's done in 10 minutes, or it all fails and the debris will be back down in about the same time frame.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Read the article. Even though the whole process takes about ten minutes, the airspace is closed for pretty much the entire launch window. The first Falcon Heavy closure lasted more than three hours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well you always have to have safety margins. Stupid people fly planes too. Got to have a big enough window to clear as many as you can. 3 hours seems pretty reasonable to me. And you would have to make the window wide enough that someone entering could be caught on radar communicated with and turned around before entering the ACTUAL area that matters. Safety margins and accomadaring for stupidity is 90% of safety.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the window.  Fast launches to the ISS literally have a 1 second window, which is required for priority equipment and I imagine passengers.  Other launches, such as commsats and this week's FH payload can have 3-6 hour windows depending on the trajectory and intended orbit (geosync, LEO, Supersync, etc.).</p></div>		</li>
