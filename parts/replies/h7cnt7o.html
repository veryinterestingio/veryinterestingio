			<div class="markdown"><p>Though that's correct, I would like to add a small but significant detail, it takes a lot of energy and a lot of time to reach L1. So, realistically, don't expect any space stations to be put there, only satellites.</p>
<p>Also, not sure it counts as &quot;orbiting the Earth&quot; as OP asked, but you're right the point gets constant sunlight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, getting a space station out there would be crazy expensive. At Sun-Earth L1 youâ€™re probably considered to be orbiting the Sun, but you might consider it a retrograde Earth orbit with a 1 year orbital period.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The ISS could sit at this point and always be in sunlight.</p>

<p><strong>In theory,</strong> that is. Realistically there's absolutely no way for the ISS to travel to the L1.</p></div>		</li>
