			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer and should be upvoted and awarded. I remember back in UO when you came across a server line, where one game server stopped and another started, sometimes there’d be a gathering of NPCs along the border because they’d get stuck there for whatever reason. There was typically a bit of lag when crossing the boundary too. Everquest had loading screens between servers. Programmers have gotten better with this transition and largely if not completely eliminated the loading screen in favor of seamless transfer between servers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that's quite right for Eve, they have some incredible super custom cluster tech that shifts load around their web of servers depending on load. They only tidi during big events to keep it fair, believe me Jita ain't running on one box.
There's a few white papers about their architecture and honestly some of its magic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is incorrect. Jita is always on its own node because of how many people are always there and how much is always going on (and they don't have any way to parallelize a solar system). TiDi is an automatic system that kicks in if there's enough player activity (at most they'll tune TiDi's settings to better match the kind of load). It's mentioned in at least one devblog, but it's also something you might encounter by accident. I've had TiDi kick in for trivial fights where 100% guaranteed no dev would have cared to watch. Most solar systems share a node and there is automatic balancing, but if there's a big battle coming up, the people involved <em>will</em> inform CCP so they can move that system (and maybe the neighboring ones) onto its own node in advance.</p></div>		</li>
