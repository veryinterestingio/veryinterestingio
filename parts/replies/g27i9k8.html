			<div class="markdown"><p>So, if I've pieced this and the one explaining it together correctly, it's because there's a layer of water in between you and the object of intrigue? </p>
<p>Like if you splash water on a rock there's a veil of water in between that the light needs to pass through twice to hit your eyes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rocks are a lot more porous on a microscopic level, so the water easily fits into the gaps. Not a veil covering the rock, but the rock acting as a (very ineffective) sponge.</p>
<p>Water can penetrate very deep into a rock given enough time, which is why you should never use river rocks to ring a fire - no matter how dry they seem on the outside there could still be water trapped in the centre. If the water tries to expand too quickly and can't work its way out of the pores in the rock, it'll find its way out much more explosively.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would add to this that it also appears darker because the film of water reflects some of the light before it hits the material below.</p></div>		</li>
