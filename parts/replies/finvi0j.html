			<div class="markdown"><p>The Tablelands offer an absolutely amazing landscape--and while the colors on that photo are a little bright, it's not that far off for a sunny day. I can't recommend Gros Morne National Park enough: all kinds of amazing landscapes, superb hiking--and relatively few tourists (in comparison to Yosemite or Yellowstone in the U.S.). We've visited in June and drove miles in the park without hardly seeing other cars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess I had forgotten that ophiolites had to be oceanic crust. So if submerged Zealandia is subducted and accreted on some other plate, would New Zealand and associated submerged continental and basaltic material be considered only a terrane?  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast_Range_Ophiolite" target="_blank">This link</a> also has some confusing text: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The exact origins of the rocks found in the ophiolite are a matter of debate; some geologists hypothesize that the rock primarily consists of mid-ocean lithosphere, while others assert different ideas related to island arc terranes associated with the Nevadan orogeny.[4]</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, something like Zealandia, which is basically a continental fragment, if accreted would be a terrane, not an ophiolite.</p>
<p>As for the coast range ophiolite, some of that is specific to that ophiolite (i.e. arguments about what it exactly represents in terms of particular events) and some is more general (i.e. how ophiolites are obducted remains a bit controversial and related to that is controversy around exactly what portion/type of oceanic crust do they represent, e.g. are they generic oceanic crust, something associated with island arcs, backarcs, etc?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Being continental crust, Zealandia is not going to subduct; it wants to float on the mantle. Oceanic crust will always subduct beneath it. If it collides with a continent it may accrete.
Edit: parts of Zealandia that are oceanic crust may subduct, but New Zealand is not going to be &quot;scraped off&quot; of anything. The big islands and underlying crust will remain intact and afloat.</p></div>		</li>
