So you open the the dam uphill to flood the city and put out the fire. Now everything has water damage and some people drowned but that’s better than a big pile of ash.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We do at least have precision strikes, in the form of immunotherapy (used beyond just cancer), but cancer evolves quickly enough that it learns to evade it if it's too advanced or isn't eliminated quickly enough after treatment. Radiation/chemo/surgery help prevent the surviving tumor cells from multiplying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also cancer is especially susceptible to chemo because chemo targets fast growing cells. Chemo won't hurt things like your heart because it divides really slow...but things like cancer (which is essentially a cell or cluster of cell types growing uncontrollably) and also hair and fingernails (which grow fast) get really fucked up by chemo.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Less carpet bombing and more &quot;controlled burning&quot;. Controlled because we can predict &quot;what it will destroy&quot; but at the end of the day it is still a fire that does whatever it wants to do.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The drugs look for any cells that kinda look like cancer cells. So ones growing fast, in groups and looking shifty. Then based on that profile they go round shooting all the cells that match their profile, killing innocents like hair cells along the way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This, basically. If bombarding the human body with toxic substances willy-nilly were an effective treatment for cancer, we’d be injecting people with bleach or something. Much cheaper that way. </p>
<p>Chemo is unpleasant, but it’s been oversimplified by well-meaning people trying to explain how it works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. A common side effect is nausea, and people on chemo are given anti emetics to help with the nausea. But the side effects like fatigue, feeling like crap; chemo works by killing the cells in your body of a certain type, and the whole idea is that it kills more cancer cells than healthy cells. Analgesia (thanks for the correction) is for pain receptors, and that's not really the source of the discomfort from chemo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chloroplatinate based chemotherapy works by inducing a ton of dna damage in order to get cells to commit suicide. The cells that are dividing the most rapidly (cancer and intestines) are more affected than other organ tissues that have longer lives.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Anesthesia is for pain receptors </p>

<p>If OP is talking about general anesthesia, pretty sure that will help with all types of discomfort.  Can’t be uncomfortable if you’re unconscious... </p>
<p>Or the sort of twilight sedation that dentists use for wisdom teeth.  Easier and cheaper to administer, and probably more suitable for long term sedation (a whole day or two after each chemo treatment)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are side effects of long term use of general anesthesia (i.e people who have been intubated for a long time - they have some long term cognitive problems that take a while to recover from; you can look up &quot;long term cognitive effects general anesthesia&quot;). For twilight sedation with benzos, that is also something that's more likely to cause harm than good especially when the person might already be prone to chemo brain (which is a thing in and of itself).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The best description ever from a doctor:</p>
<p>It’s poison with the idea that hopefully the cancer dies before the patient.</p>
<p>The drug is just something the cancer seems most sensitive to. Then try to figure out the precise dose to kill it without killing the patient.</p>
<p>It’s amazing we’ve got this far, but I truly hope we get to the point where this is viewed as barbaric and insane. That would be a huge win for medicine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work for a company that's developing a drug that protects blood cells from the chemo. Just waiting for FDA approval on it now, hoping to get it on the market next year, but it definitely helps with the toxicities. Reading some of the stories in this thread makes me wish we could have gotten it done ages ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The big drug companies are doing 100 trials at a time across many drugs, types of cancers, treatment combinations etc.</p>
<p>The benefit of a lot of it is pretty modest but when you combine all the treatments across the industry it is going to improve a lot in this era (and already has in fact). The resources spent on cancer is just ridiculous when you add it up.</p></div>		</li>
