			<div class="markdown"><p>Hawaii is studied a great deal and it is a focal point of a lot of zoological and ecological research.  However, it has been inhabited by humans for several hundred years while the Galapagos were only encountered by humans relatively recently.  In modern day, Hawaii has many towns and a fairly large city while the Galapagos have only relatively sparse settlements.  It means that in the Galapagos we are seeing a relatively untouched ecosystem while Hawaii requires a lot more parsing out native species from human introduced.</p>
<p>In fact, studying the Galapagos gives us a better understanding of what we are seeing in Hawaii.</p></div>		</li>
