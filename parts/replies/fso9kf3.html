<p>Why is there still a large discrepancy in poverty levels in the different races and ethnicities in the US? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Intergenerational wealth is a huge factor. There have historically (up until very recently) been huge barriers to (particularly but not only) black Americans building wealth.</p>
<p>There is a lot you can dive into in this area going all the way back to slavery. Or the <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/153772/racial-terror-failed-promise-reconstruction-trump-america" target="_blank">successful terror campaigns of the Klan during reconstruction</a> preventing black representation in their home states. Or the deliberate destruction of successful black communities in events like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_race_massacre" target="_blank">Tulsa race massacre</a> (historically, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_racial_violence_in_the_United_States" target="_blank">race riots in the US have been white communities attacking local minorities</a>).</p>
<p>But I'd start in the last century with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/24/upshot/how-redlinings-racist-effects-lasted-for-decades.html" target="_blank">redlining</a> and the <a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/12/4/20953282/racism-housing-discrimination-keeanga-yamahtta-taylor" target="_blank">modern legacy of housing discrimination</a>.</p>
<p>In a short version, the way mortgages were made available through a mix of federal and local policy meant that it was far harder to buy homes or invest in new developments in minority or &quot;racially inharmonious&quot; areas. Mixed use areas (such as in city centres) were also disadvantaged for investment. This was further exacerbated by explicitly segregated suburbs that drew yet more investment away from city centres while trapping the minority residents.</p>
<p>The first line from that second article;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As of 2016, the median wealth for black families in America was $17,600, while the median wealth for white families was $171,000.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That lack of wealth limits everything else. You can't afford to do most of the stuff others might do to guarantee a higher income in the future.</p>
<p>Now you layer on top of that the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/6/6/11852640/cartoon-poor-neighborhoods" target="_blank">various effects of living in a poor neighbourhood.</a> Taking someone out and giving them access to a wealthier neighbourhood directly improves outcomes, even if there are no other changes to their situation.</p>
<p>Notice that that article starts with the redlining problem as well. The mix of official and de-facto segregation reinforces the environmental gap that layers inequity upon inequity for the next generation. One generation being poor and trapped in a poor neighbourhood reduces the chances of the next being able to escape.</p>
<p>All of these factors are theoretically race blind. You might see similar issues in extremely poor white areas and individual poor white families are going to experience similar barriers from a wealth perspective, albeit with very different social and physical geography that are going to complicated the comparisons. But the history of the US means the particular mix of factors disproportionately impact black people and communities.</p>
<p>Then there are the explicit racial factors that emerge from social perceptions of black people and act as further barriers to escape. Things like <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/114/41/10870.full" target="_blank">unconscious bias against black people in hiring</a> making it harder for them to find employment compared to equally qualified white people. Or people perceiving the same traits as <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/115/11/2711" target="_blank">negative in black men and positively in white men</a>, leading to potentially worse outcomes in similar encounters. When those encounters are with police officers those negative outcomes can be devastating, if not fatal.</p>
<p>This has sprawled a bit now so I'll stop there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very good write up.</p>
<p>My question would be though is how do we ever fully stop racism and it’s related issues that plague the black community (poverty, education, often times a broken family unit)? How do we begin to dig these families out of poverty after decades and decades of it? How do we stop the employer from subconsciously preferring once race over another?</p>
<p>It just seems like something that won’t be solved for a long time, if ever. The issue is just way out of hand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your stat of Native Americans and police killings is very interesting! According to  <a href="https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/poverty-rate-by-raceethnicity/?currentTimeframe=2&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D" target="_blank">kff.org poverty stats</a>, Native Americans are also the &quot;most poor&quot; ethnic group in the US. This seems to support the hypothesis that poverty is a good indicator of susceptibility to police brutality. </p>
<p>While I believe racism exists, I'm not convinced that it's at the vitriolic levels it once was in the USA (with <a href="http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/shipp/lynchingyear.html" target="_blank">constant lynchings</a> in the South and openly-institutionalized police brutality; though now it may be more insidious and hidden). </p>
<p>This is a very interesting topic.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why does poverty lead to crime in such a large degree?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I mean, is this a serious question? Even avoiding the obvious answer, poverty is a huge stressor and stressed people act desperately. Even more systematically, if you know you're going to be poor for the rest of your life, then that can easily make you more reckless and breed a mindset that you just need to look out for yourself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nyc points to something else. The mayor is killing the merit based school priorities that has caused certain great schools to be heavily skewed Asian even though when you compare socioeconomic state between Hispanics, Asian, and black you find Asians are succeeding at a much higher rate and that is largely attributed to the Asian families saving every penny they can and sending their kids to after school programs to prepare them for the entrance test</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Education is directly tied to community wealth in the US though. If you live in a poor school district, tax revenue is low and, as a result, your education is poorer because your school can't afford basic necessities like books, much less more modern technology needed for today's workforce. And good luck getting a competitive education nowadays without a stable internet connection at home.</p>
<p>Not to mention there's a whole host of problems <a href="https://www.greatschools.org/gk/articles/struggles-first-generation-college-students-face/" target="_blank">first-gen college students</a> face due to lack of friends &amp; family familiarity with the higher education.</p>
<p>Poverty <em>heavily</em> influences access to education in so many ways; those are just a few examples off the top of my head. When studying humans and society, you can't assume that all factors are independent. That's... <em>very</em> bad data science.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the bulk of what he's trying to say is that we don't have a race issue. We have a poverty issue.</p>
<p>I believe that has been a constant thorn that only money and time can fix. None of the best teachers, police, doctors and businesses want to be in the porrest areas. That leaves the poorest areas with the fewest job prospects and the worst educations. This creates a continuing cycle.  Poor uneducated people in bad situations bringing up poor uneducated kids.</p>
<p>This disproportionate amount of blacks having police issues is because a disproportionate amount of them are poor and live in bad areas. The reason for that is because America used to have a race issue, which caused so many black people to get pulled into those poor areas to begin with. </p>
<p>I'm also not saying racism has nothing to do with it today. There's definitely still racism around, from every race. I just believe it's a secondary problem compared to growing up in a poor area. </p>
<p>Fixing that would take more good teachers that are getting paid better to be in those areas, more school funding, drug rehab facilities, and minimum living wages.</p></div>		</li>

<p>thats difficult to say because things arent as simple as it being either a race or a poverty issue. both are pretty closely tied together because of things like jim crow laws and their fallout. aswell as gentrification and such</p></div>		</li>
