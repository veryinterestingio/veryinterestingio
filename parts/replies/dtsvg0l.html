			<div class="markdown"><p><em>Technically</em>, you are not wrong.</p>
<p>One of the theoretical models to explain the anomalous thrust of the EM Drive proposes that the microwaves trapped in the metal cone reflect into counter-waves. When the generated waves collide with reflected counter-waves, then the two cancel each other out and energy is ejected out of the rear of the sealed metal cone in the form of proton (or possibly tachyon) radiation.</p>
<p>In other words, if you could alter your own wave-like frequency, you could pass through walls by converting into pure energy. This concept has been the basis for numerous <em>Star Trek</em> episodes.</p></div>		</li>
