			<div class="markdown"><p>An I also right in thinking there is a increase in density of the nerves in that area (and others like finger tips, tounge) that increase the sensitive and intensity of sensations? Which would also increase the apparent difference in sensation between a penis and a chest?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes you are! 2 point descrimination is a good practcial example of differing nerve density. If someone places 2 fingers slightly apart on your back, you'll likely feel it as one point of contact. Whereas if they did this on your palm, or your penis for that matter, you'll feel it as two separate points!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it realistic to actually only Target &quot;pain&quot; nerves and isolate them completely? Do &quot;aches and pains&quot; nerves differ in any measurable way from, for example, &quot;paper cut&quot; nerves? If you were to Target &quot; pain&quot; nerves would you likely include both?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They absolutely do! </p>
<p>We have lots of different types of nerves. Some are insulated with a fatty sheath along their whole length, called myelin. These conduct signals quicker than those nerve types that lack the myelin sheath. </p>
<p>With pain nerves, the fast myelinated nerves are called Adelta nerves. These are responsible for the fast, sharp feeling of pain, like a paper cut  Useful to tell the body to quicky move your hand out of the flame, for example. Then we have C type pain nerves. These are unmyelinated, and are responsible for the dull aching type of pain that comes on later, and is useful to remind you to look after that damaged body part.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always found it an interesting coincidence that the fast nerves are felt as 'sharp' and the slow ones 'dull'... in reality there is no way the human mind can comprehend the difference in speed between a myelinated and unmyelinated nerve impulse, and yet the faster one gives an unquestionably 'faster' flavour of pain.</p>
<p>The difference between quick, sharp, stabbing pains and slow, dull aches is universal and really useful to work out what's causing the pain too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this awesome explanation. It does lead me to a question about the orgasm process... How are orgasms created? Why are some people easier or harder to orgasm? And certain medications can make this unachievable... How?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm assuming you're talking about SSRIs? It'd be cool to get a pharmacology expert to do an AMA about SSRI side effects like anorgasmia and &quot;brain zaps&quot; from sudden discontinuiation (I don't even know if &quot;brain zaps&quot; has a clinical name yet, when I was on SSRIs 15 years ago the doctors basically told me I was making it all up).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes essentially SSRIs. Curious how people with premature ejaculation might have different brains/bodies, and how drugs can help them, and how different people react differently.</p></div>		</li>
