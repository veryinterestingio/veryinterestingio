			<div class="markdown"><p>So I work on an ambulance and take a lot of panic attacks to the ER.  I always thought negatively of the people I was taking since they weren't in real life threatening danger and the ambulance was not needed.  That changed when I responded to a 911 call involving a psychiatrist having a panic attack.  The man lived his whole life dealing with these things and became a psychiatrist to try and help others with the problem he faces.  He had a panic attack, thought he was dying and called 911.  He took his meds right after calling 911 and they started to kick in about 5 minutes after we arrived to meet him. Here is a guy that knows on a cellular level exactly why he is panicking and still called 911 because of how irrational he was in that very moment and he thought he might die.  His meds kicked in, he settled down and thanked us for responding but ultimately didn't want to go to the hospital.  </p>
<p>Dude changed my whole outlook on panic attacks.  They are nothing to fuck with and I pray I never have one.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It's not irrationality, though. It actually feels like you are going to die. The symptoms are very similar to a heart attack. People who have never experienced a panic attack are going to assume it is a heart attack. And they tell people who are at risk for a heart attack to go to the emergency room anyway even if a panic attack is a possibility, unless you have meds to take asap or are very familiar with your symptoms. But panic attacks cause chest pain and tightening, rapid heart rate, sweating, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, and extremities can start to tingle, go numb, or even feel paralyzed. So feeling like you are going to die is not irrational. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right, I said that wrong.  He had all of the symptoms you described but it was the extreme anxiety that was most obvious.  As a health care provider he knew, logically, that it was a panic attack and admitted openly to us it was but still thought he was dying.  After the medication started to work he could reflect and think clearly enough to realize it was actually not a life threatening event and he would be fine.  He knew through the whole event what was happening and still called 911 for fear of death though.  That was why I said irrational.  From an outsiders perspective it was, but to him, at the time, it was not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had my first panic attack shortly after my grandfather passed from a stoke and then my cousin shortly thereafter. </p>
<p>The first one happened late at night while I was on a long road trip. I hadn’t slept much and I remember rubbing my face and not feeling anything. My face felt completely numb and then my head started to tingle. I pulled the car over and went into a full freak out. Flung the car door open and erratically started pulling off my hat and scarf. I felt fine after a few minutes but I had never experienced terror like that before. I started having them daily whenever I drove a car. I eventually stopped driving and but they didn’t stop coming. </p>
<p>I have always struggled with anxiety but it never manifested into a full blown panic attack before that. </p>
<p>I didn’t manage to get them under control until I submitted to death. If this is my time then take me, otherwise it has to stop. </p>
<p>But I still can’t wear hats to this day. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Last time I had a panic attack I found it so hard to breathe. I was struggling for air and I was making this weird noise (like a donkey? It was weird) because my chest was expanding and contracting so fast. I had never experienced anything like it and I hope I never do again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing that's the hardest to explain to people is that panic attack is pretty much a raw experience that has no underlying reason. Your mind can catch up with panic attack by trying to rationalize it as fear of heart attack or a fear of losing consciousness or agoraphobia etc. However true panic attack has no conscious cause. It's much more of a biology than psychology. You can teach yourself not to be afraid of various things, but you cannot mentally secure your brain from a panic attack</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Before I got my medication I suffered from mild panic attacks but we never knew what it was because they would be like a normal kid/teenager type responses, only mine got to the point I never wanted to go anywhere or do anything.</p>
<p>So I also suffer from depression because of that and all the years I lost from being afraid to go anywhere, I could go outside and to stores in town but that was it, I couldn't go any long distances, I think my limit was 10 miles from home, I managed to get a temp job and helped setup a store but I had to literally force myself to go, I passed by where the store was and started to panic and almost turned around cause my nerves were going nuts.</p>
<p>The medication is just a small dose and it's amazing how much it changed me, even now I have found out that I can go 2 days without them, by the third day it is out of my system and I think about quitting my job (been here for 8 years) and just staying home forever and I have to force myself to make it through the day and take that pill.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've only had a couple, but the way I've described it that some people seem to get is &quot;That moment when you think you're alone in the house but turn the corner and see someone...that moment of heartpounding, stomach dropping, brain-feeling-like-you've-had-10000-cups-of-coffee terror...but you might feel it for hours even if you're just sitting safely on the couch.&quot;</p>
<p>You know you're sitting there safe, but you feel like you have to fight a rabid bear that isn't there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some do, some don't.  You will get approximately the same level of care from either camp. We all want to help and be good at our jobs, some people are just less empathetic.  I have a hard time adjusting my perspective sometimes as do others I imagine.  40 minutes ago I was doing CPR on someone and now I am dealing with a panic attack.  It's hard to adjust to the different levels of intensity, especially when you are constantly dealing with patients you just met 5 minutes ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is always hope! I suffered severe panic attacks daily for more than a year. I just kinda pushed forward each day and never ran out of my classrooms or tried to avoid my triggers. Slowly things got better and the attacks got less and less frequent. Now I basically never have them and I don't have the feeling of teetering on the edge of one either. Everyone is different, but the most important thing that helped me was to just never run away from your triggers and try to confront your panic attacks when they happen. The human mind is surprisingly plastic and eventually mine just desensitized itself to the mental feedback loop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re not crazy. You have a condition but  unlike visible conditions like a broken arm, this one is not visible. Others that don’t understand and can’t see it might have their doubts, which is why there are stigmas with mental health.</p>
<p>The good news is it’s very treatable! That doesn’t mean it’s easy but there is hope.</p>
<p>I used to suffered from social anxiety. I identify that my anxiety would increase when I’m in situations I’m unfamiliar with. Like meeting a new person or doing new social activities.</p>
<p>Overtime, through systematic desensitization and counseling. I’m able to safely said that I no longer have that problem. It dramatically changed my life.</p>
<p>I can meet new people, date, and network. I don’t feel like I have to stick with bad relationships. My friends circle changed for the better. I meant my wife. And end up at a great company because I gave a talk to show case my skills, I’m a software engineer btw.</p>
<p>So yeah man, hang in there, things will get better and don’t be ashamed to get help with counseling. It’ll work!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best breakdown of what is actually happening. My very first one literally came out of nowhere, and it was one of the scariest moments of my life. For weeks after that I had similar attacks but I think it was just a fear of having a true panic attack again. I've probably only had a handful of what I think of as true panic attacks, but I've had a ton of attacks that were more a conscious escalation of my fear. The &quot;true&quot; ones hit me without warning, sometimes even waking me up in the middle of the night. It's been a couple years since I've had one, thank goodness. I didn't realize how real and scary they were until it started happening to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to think panic attacks were over dramatic reactions from over dramatic people...until I experienced one of my own...I literally couldn’t breathe and the room actually felt like it was caving in on me. And like you for weeks after I’d freak out about another true panic attack creeping up on me. Luckily I’ve only had that one. I feel so bad for people who have them all the time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My husband was always very supportive when I was having an attack but I think he thought it was something purely mental that I could stop if I wanted to. Until a couple years later he was in the hospital because he thought he was having a heart attack. Turns out it was a panic attack. &quot;Holy shit, THAT'S what a panic attack feels like??&quot; He has had a couple since then. On the flip side, I had never had to comfort someone having a panic attack and that was eye-opening too. Even though I knew what he was going through, it was still challenging to say the right things and reassure him that he was going to be okay.</p></div>		</li>
