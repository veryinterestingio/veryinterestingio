<p>Sorry if its inappropriate, just curious how they would &quot;pass the time&quot; if you will.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep fully capable of basic self care, though they often need to be prompted to do things like take showers and brushing their teeth. They can read and write as well. Written communication is just as basic as verbal and their writing looks like a child's writing, only conveying basic things. They absolutely <em>love</em> video games, especially the games we grew up with in the late 80s/early 90s, definitely a big part of their stimming behavior.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's a very common example of the kind of communication I have with them: They walk over to you out of the blue and say &quot;HotdogSword36! McDonald's! <a specific day target="_blank">!&quot;. They bring over a calendar, point to the date, write down exactly what they just said on a piece of paper. They then bring this up over and over, showing you the calendar and what they wrote, until the date in question and we go to the place. God help you if you don't.</p></div>		</li>
