			<div class="markdown"><p>I've personally told plumbers before that I only flushed &quot;flushable&quot; wipes, when I actually was flushing nothing but normal Costco brand baby wipes.  So the plumber probably hears someone say this and just starts assuming that flushable wipes can't be flushes either because of this misleading and anecdotal evidence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way I understand it, they made a claim that they legitimately believed to be true, only to discover later they were mistaken. Considering that &quot;lying&quot; generally implies that the speaker knows what they're saying is false, I would not call that lying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I came here to see if anyone responded with this. I've always believed that people just said &quot;well the company labelled them as flushable&quot; to avoid admitting fault. After all, how can you prove what package a shitty wipe came from after it's been marinating in sewage for days? I think that's much more likely than wipes being advertised falsely (if it even is. not like there's a regulatory body that defined what 'flushable' means), which is a straight up crime. I mean, i'm sure it happens, with how little the law gives a shit about companies, but I also don't trust the average person to be totally honest when things go wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure to label them &quot;flushable&quot; the wipe has to disintegrate at a similar speed to TP, or be a small enough size to avoid any serious risks of getting caught within the pipes or transfer systems.</p>
<p>But yeah, my wife told me I could flush them, so I did.  Didn't wanna make me or my wife look stupid, so I lied to the plumber, especially since we are renting, and by lying, I got my landlord to pay for it by making her think we were only stuck with shitty plumbing rather than not following the rules.</p></div>		</li>
