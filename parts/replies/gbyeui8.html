			<div class="markdown"><p>Those two paragraphs are perfect analogy how physicists see all physical properties, not just unusual ones like spin.
For example, mass is a property that describes how something reacts when you push it. Charge is property that describes whether something can &quot;see&quot; electrical field and react to it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Nevermind the confusing choice of word 'spin', it's nothing to do with anything spinning</p>
</blockquote>
<p>IMO, it would be more confusing not to call it spin, because it carries angular momentum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but 'spin' - 'angular momentum' = 2 years, tops. So when addressing the general public, I usually go with assuming they either know both or neither.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not really sure what question to ask, but could you talk on angular momentum a little more please? It's a little frustrating that it's another term that, in a classical sense, deals with some mass physically rotating around a center, yet at the quantum level, nothing is rotating or spinning.</p>
<p>I understood what you said about how quantum spin carries properties similar to something classically spinning (like how charged particles can have a magnetic field even if they're sitting still), but the angular momentum part is tripping me up. I think it's the &quot;angular&quot; part that seems deliberately chosen when naming this stuff that I just can't come to intuit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So it's very similar to how one might think of charge. Something can be positively or negatively charged. You can't <em>see</em> charge, but you <em>can</em> see the consequences of that charge. </p>
<p>I wonder why spin confuses people much more than charge then? Maybe because we use spin to explain certain things in the macroscopic world which we can see?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an interesting question, I'm not super sure because it's probably partly a social phenomenon, but here's my shot. </p>
<p>There's this postmodern take on language which roughly says that words only have meaning with respect to each other, and the connection to the rest of the world is done by each individual. It kinda resonates a lot with the foundations of math in the style of Russel and Whitehead, which just crank up the axiomatic style to 11.</p>
<p>Electrical charge is defined with respect to a bunch of other words that represent things we learn about from a young age and continue seeing. Wacky hair if you rub a balloon, lightbulbs, getting electrocuted, seeing lighning. We have this very visceral understanding of all these consequences of charge, so this makes us feel less confused (sorry for the arm chair psychology, but I warned you!). The charge <em>is the thing that feels like a tickly pinch</em>, by definition, or the thing that causes the blast of the bolt.</p>
<p>With spin... not so much. We know magnets, but that's kinda about it. Also, charge is just a quantity. However, the consequences of spin many times have to do with the <em>direction</em> it points to. That kind of adds another layer of complication in the way of some kind of visceral understanding.</p>
<p>Last, I also want to mention science journalism. It's cliche but still true: quantum sensationalism is a problem. You, as the general public, will commonly be confronted with half-assed analogies for spin that do more to confuse than explain, and just generally cloud spin and anything quantum in arcane mysticism. It just sells to ponder on turning an electron a full circle and it ending up with its ass up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I'd add that charge is a constant and spin is a DOF. Also, a charge is a source while a spin isn't. But it does interact with an external field. So technically it's a hard comparison to make. I heard someone say that it's like comparing an orange to a table. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Charge is also a macroscopic effect we can build intuition about. Intuition is not understanding; we can think about charged foam balls repelling and attracting one another, but that doesn’t give you the exact understanding of how charge works.</p>
<p>Spin violates intuition; it shortcuts our epistemology. We intuit things about angular momentum that don’t apply to spin. So even though we have the same understanding of both concepts, because one maps easily to our experience we think we understand charge better even though we know electrons are not tiny foam balls bouncing around.</p></div>		</li>
