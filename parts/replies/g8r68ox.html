<p>Any more.  Magnetic-based hard drives used to be a lot more sensitive to that sort of thing, but it's been 25ish years since then.  Bulk disk erasers still work, of course, but those are BIG electromagnets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve stuck 5 1/4” floppies to fridges with magnets and not lost any data. They really never were that sensitive to the kinds of magnetic fields you’re likely to find around a home. </p>
<p>There are fairly strong magnets inside of every hard drive less than a cm away from the outside edge of the platters. Obviously these don’t cause problems.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If the metal is magnetized, it'll bend the beam, causing it to eliminate the wrong color of phosphor, making a rainbow effect.</p></div>		</li>

<p>CRTs have a steel structure inside them called a shadow mask.  If you magnetize that it will draw the electron beams out of alignment.  They won't hit the right color phosphors.</p></div>		</li>
