<p>As you know, not everybody can wink</p>

<p>I think you overestimate what I know.</p>
<p>In fact, I have just discovered that while I can wink with both eyes, if I wink with my left (dominant) eye I have to do it much more firmly or my face twitches.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Left eye's perfectly fine tho</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why some folks do that half grin on the side of the face where they wink - it not only covers up the .... let's say &quot;convulsion,&quot; but also denotes a sense of whimsy to the wink.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think everyone scrunches their face when they wink. Blinking, however, no face scrunching.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I only briefly studied visual science (focused mostly internally because it was for a cognition emphasis) but I know most things with our eyes are coordinated to ensure binocular vision, meaning there is a certain degree of symmetry in their structures.  Blinking basically cleans and moisturizes our eyes, and if we blinked one eye at a time the difference between the two eyes could potentially fuck with your ability to coordinate your vision if your eye got too damaged I’d suppose.  Most things in our face are meant to be pretty symmetrical.</p></div>		</li>

<p>laughing, yawning scratching and blinking are all learned and social behaviour.</p>

<p>What? That cant be correct. Deaf children still laugh like regular children, despite never hearing laughter. </p>
<p>Yawning is seen in, what, all mammals?</p>
<p>Blinking is still natural, even if people do blink more often from social stimuli. </p>
<p>And scratching again seems like a natural response to an itch. My dog scratches its head with its foot, so why wouldnt a human intuitively know how to scratch?</p>
<p>Do you have a link to the podcast?</p></div>		</li>
