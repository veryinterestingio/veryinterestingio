			<div class="markdown"><p>Furthermore, if you're trying to catch a rat with your hands, humans have the additional problem that we aren't very good at running when crouched down. And in the time it takes for us to stop and bend down, the rat may have scampered out of reach. My kids have pet rats, and chasing them down when they get loose is always an interesting challenge.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;What about crouching?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We're good at that too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What about running while crouching?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh... Yeah, that's a no-can-do.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>An airplane in the sky might seem to be not moving, or it's moving relative to some buildings way farther back. Basic geometry makes that seem less. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly.  And it's the small size that makes them quick to accelerate and change direction.  They have less inertia because of their lower mass, but compared to their size their muscles are stronger than ours, because muscle power scales by squaring while mass scales to the cube.  Same reason ants can lift so much, relative to their size.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Similar to, but not the same as, the reason smaller animals need to eat so much.  Their surface area to mass ratios are much higher (higher surface area as compared to mass) than with larger animals.  Smaller animals lose a LOT more energy as heat to the environment than larger animals do.</p></div>		</li>
