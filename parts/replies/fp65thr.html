			<div class="markdown"><p>Most operating systems use journaled file systems, so when the pc starts up it can view the journal and see of each action in it got completed or seemed to be corrupted, and simply use the journal of changes to roll back to a working state.</p>
<p>So while a system should never come to corrupt, you could for instance lose settings or file changes that might have not had their data saved and journal completed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this. Most applications write stuff in multiple steps and the OS doesn't really know, when an application is done. Also, from OS point of view, a file is just a bunch of <code>1</code> and <code>0</code> without any meaning to it.</p>
<p>Hence there's no way for the OS to roll-back to a known good state, because it can't technically know, what this &quot;good state&quot; is supposed to be.</p>
<p>A possibility would be, that applications tell the OS when a transaction begins and when the transaction is completed. But that relies on the applications actually using that feature and doing the right thing. Nothing the OS can enforce without breaking about every legacy application out there.</p></div>		</li>

<p>simply use the journal of changes to roll back <em>the filesystem</em> to a working state.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Journaling filesystems protect <em>the filesystem</em> from corruption. Remember having to wait for the OS to check the filesystems for consistency? <em>That's</em> what you're skipping; it's not necessarily getting the system back to a working, consistent state.</p>
<p>To illustrate what I mean with an extreme example, imagine losing power in the middle of upgrading your OS. Once you can power the system back on, the filesystem won't require any checking (remember CHKDSK?), but the system is extremely unlike to function correctly.</p>
<p>You probably already meant/intended this and I'm just being pedantic, but I thought it merited an explicit mention.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Really depends on what the hell the morons are using the server for and what the hell I have to do to fix the file system the best I can (helllooo xfs_repair!) before turning it back over to them with &quot;well this is the best you are getting, hope you been backing up your shit, lol&quot;.

			<div class="markdown"><p>For reference, it's still possible to fuck up a computer by spontaneous power loss.</p>
<p>Just last year, on a modern Windows 10 Laptop with a dead battery, we had a power cord get tripped over, and when we turned the computer back on it could not recover.</p>
<p>Luckily I'm surrounded by a lot of hard tech friends, and we managed to fuck around with it for like 3 days, digging through files via the command prompt through the recovery program, and find the files that got fucked up and replaced them.  Took them a while though and they weren't sure they would be able to do it.</p>
<p>Please forgive my lack of correct jargon, my friends are super techie, I am not; I don't fully understand what they did.  It was definitely a problem severe enough that a lot of repair shops probably would've been all like &quot;fuck it, here is a USB stick with your hard drives data on it&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>sfc /scannow at the recovery prompt is your lifesaver. It compares an archived copy of all Windows system files in the recovery partition with the ones in your boot partition and restores them if necessary.
It can take some time, it literally has to verify each and every byte of the executable for integrity (and Windows is like 20+ GB for a default install now, of which I'd expect 2-3 GB to be core system files) but if you can get to the Windows Recovery partition or boot from a Recovery CD/DVD/usb, it is a lifesaver.</p></div>		</li>
