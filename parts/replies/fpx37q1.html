			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure that this is fully accurate, actually.  Please do correct me if I'm wrong.</p>
<p>The reason why people who are having light clay or whitish colored stool need to see a doctor is because this is often an indication that a bile duct is blocked.</p>
<p>I'm not a medical professional, but if poop is relatively colorless in the absence of bile, it would make sense to me that bile, not red blood cells are the reason for the brown color.</p>
<p>edit: Original poster was NOT wrong, see comment on my comment explaining why.  Dummies like me come into threads like this with only half knowledge and are corrected by people with the full knowledge and everybody's bank of knowledge gets just a little bit bigger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dead blood cells go to the liver and the liver breaks it down to bile (bilirubin and biliviridin if memory serves me right).  This bile is what gets excreted out of the body with other food waste.  The original poster was correct in that it's dead blood cells.  So are you when you say it's bile.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was a kid, I thought poop was brown because that‚Äôs what happens when you mix all of the finger paint colors together, so it must be what happens when your body mixes all the food colors together. I like my kid logic better than the reality lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious how this works in extreme circumstances though.  During my 6 weeks in basic training for the usaf, i had one bowel movement total.  Why do i have one every day on schedule now, but only one in 6 wks then?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In extremely stressful situations (like basic training), your body gets flooded with stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, and body diverts blood and energy away from your central organs from more long-term life-sustaining activity (like digestion, filtering waste products, etc.) in favor of your limbs providing more short-term life-sustaining activity (running like hell from whatever threat is after you). Combined with the fact that you were probably running a severe caloric deficit (which can slow down digestion even when not in fight-or-flight mode 20 hours a day), you got backed up bad, bro.</p></div>		</li>
