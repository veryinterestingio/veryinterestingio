			<div class="markdown"><p>My friend adopted a baby that had been born addicted to crack and his mother had been using crack during her entire pregnancy. He most definitely has long term issues because of it. He is 5 years old now and has learning disabilities, problems with regulation of his emotions and some other issues stemming from problems with the way his brain developed which doctors told her was due to his birth mom using crack. I don’t know if heroin has different effects on a developing baby, but this kid is really struggling. He is lucky to have landed in a home that has the time, resources and desire to help him in any way possible, but it’s still an uphill battle for the little guy and it’s very sad to watch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So apparently drug use can cut off the amount of oxygen a baby gets in the womb. One side effect can be extra folds in the brain, which is not a good thing and can have a number of negative effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It changes kid to kid. My sister was born so badly addicted to herion she had a seizure. She was also very premature but these days she's healthy, expect from a small heart issue and the fact she's quite small, she is turning 18 in a few weeks. She doesn't even remember any of the terrible first few years of her life. She could be a lot worse off tho</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He still has 'effects'.  I mean, his mom died, and his dad took another few years to clean up.  He was an inconsolable crier for about 6 months, (severe) night terrors for another 18 mos.</p>
<p>He has no physical or mental problems. Emotionally, it will be a long journey, don't you think?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My adopted grandson was born to a PCP addict. He suffered greatly after birth and had the same symptoms. He is 4 and still has a feeding tube. He had rickets, is developmentally slow, but a very sweet child. It even affected his growth, he's very small for his age. Drugs are such a bad idea, pregnant women please think about the hell your child will go through. Please </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mom ran a &quot;cuddlers&quot; program at an inner city hospital. Her staff would hold and comfort the poor addicted babies and others in the NICU when their mothers couldn't or wouldn't, allowing the medical staff to focus on medical stuff while giving the babies much needed loving contact. She was a pretty awesome person.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cuddlers are much needed. I was a preemie and my parents lived 2 hours from the hospital I was born in so didn't get to hold me nearly enough when I was in the NICU. I sometimes think that contributed to my major sensory issues. I hate being hugged or cuddled or tickled at all.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yep. Arching back, crying inconsolably, difficulty sleeping, and sometimes disinterested in eating are things I've seen too. Pretty much have to be held constantly until they are so exhausted they sleep. ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My childhood best friend was given up at birth by a crack addict. My friend was raised by millionaires I told him he won the lottery, but sadly he turned to meth a few years back. It makes me think more along the lines of genetics at that point in the nature vs nurture debate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that infants recover and the addiction/withdrawal isn't a big factor in how they turn out.</p>
<p>The things that will hinder them is it they grow-up poor, or with poor conditions more than anything else. Plus the trauma from being removed from their parent(s). That last one is huge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They'll be like an addict with 15-20 years clean.  Cravings, but they've had a &quot;grip&quot; on their addiction for so long it's just part of who they are. </p>
<p>But when their high school teachers are doing the &quot;Don't do drugs&quot; rap at school, mom &amp; dad need to have a &quot;No, but seriously&quot; conversation as a followup. </p>
<p>Once their body is reminded how awesome crack is and how much it very much wants it, they'l go from sober to physically dependent in record time. </p></div>		</li>
