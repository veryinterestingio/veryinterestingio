			<div class="markdown"><p>currently nothing in our understanding denies this, dark matter should act regularly with black holes as gravity is seemingly the only force dark matter seems to interact with. so nothing we know says that it shouldnâ€™t but as it stands we know so little about dark matter atm. so probably yes, but not surely</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It could be possible, but with dark matter only being detectable via it's gravitational influence it is hard to say - I'm absolutely not qualified or educated enough to say with any degree of certainty as I'm just a physics casual.</p>
<p>I would have thought that if DM can visibly interact with a black hole it would be very miniscule to detect given that the black hole would have a far greater gravitational influence in comparison. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As long as something's gravitationally interactive, it should be able to interact with dark matter, and black holes are gravitationally interactive alright. The matter of the question is, we have no idea about the details. It's possible that dark matter can only fall into a black hole if it slams on it directly, as the way regular matter behaves when falling into gravitational wells (be it a black hole, star or planet) is also affected by its other interactions (such as regular matter interacting electromagnetically to lose heat or chemically react when forming a planet, for example). But dark matter's properties and behavior are generally a huge &quot;????????&quot; at the moment so we don't really know</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much all visible matter is what's called <em>baryonic matter</em> and it's not necessarily atoms, but rather always the building blocks of those. So yes, in a sense, that visible matter is comprised of regular atoms and some &quot;broken down&quot; atoms. </p>
<p>However, if we're talking black holes, we don't really know what's inside them, so it's impossible to say what black hole matter is like, but we can measure their gravitational effect which allows us to calculate their mass. Same goes for dark matter, we have no clue what it is made from, but its gravitational effect is very noticeable, so we can measure how much of it is out there. </p></div>		</li>
