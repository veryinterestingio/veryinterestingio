			<div class="markdown"><p>This plus some devices, especially larger ones, will essentially move the power brick parts into the device, such as TVs. Or, if you get a plug which is larger and boxy, that's essentially a power brick too. They all do the same basic function.</p>
<p>The ones that have an external power brick are able to let the device itself be smaller.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The power brick is primarily just a transformer to lower the voltage. The transformer can be housed in the plug (wall wart) in the cable (power brick) or in the device (internal power supply). </p>
<p>You can do other fancy electricity things after that, but every low power device needs a transformer somewhere.</p>
<p>Suppose it's noteworthy you can make that shit real small (usb charger). Smaller stuff will typically be able to provide less power, and is also typically more expensive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most power bricks these days use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switched-mode_power_supply" target="_blank">switched mode power supply</a> design, which can regulate the output voltage pretty much independently of the input voltage. (so long as V_out is well below V_in)</p>
<p>The only real difference between supplies for different countries is the shape of the plug, the insides are all the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to this, thermal considerations are often at play: AC/DC conversion generates significant amounts of heat, and in a device like a laptop there is already enough problems with moving that heat away from sensitive components.</p>
<p>Having the power circuitry predominantly outside the device itself removes potentially hundreds of watts of thermal energy, allowing the device to run faster for longer compared to if that circuitry was contained within the same enclosure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to it. A laptop puts the power supply/converter on the cord because it's too bulky to place in the laptop. </p>
<p>Where a desktop computer still has that same power supply (but usually bigger), except it is inside the pc case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Today when I walked into my economics class I saw something I dread every time I close my eyes. Someone had brought their new gaming laptop to class. The Forklift he used to bring it was still running idle at the back. I started sweating as I sat down and gazed over at the 700lb beast that was his laptop. He had already reinforced his desk with steel support beams and was in the process of finding an outlet for a power cable thicker than Amy Schumer's thigh. I start shaking. I keep telling myself I'm going to be alright and that there's nothing to worry about. He somehow finds a fucking outlet. Tears are running down my cheeks as I send my last texts to my family saying I love them. The teacher starts the lecture, and the student turns his laptop on. The colored lights on his RGB Backlit keyboard flare to life like a nuclear flash, and a deep humming fills my ears and shakes my very soul. The entire city power grid goes dark. The classroom begins to shake as the massive fans begin to spin. In mere seconds my world has gone from vibrant life, to a dark, earth shattering void where my body is getting torn apart by the 150mph gale force winds and the 500 decibel groan of the cooling fans. As my body finally surrenders, I weep, as my school and my city go under.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.365powersupply.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/C1804.jpg" target="_blank">This is probably a similar sized power brick</a>.  It's a 2400W supply unit (For a Dell R740).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The charger is still pretty big on the standard charger. The smaller USB-PD chargers that can handle laptop charging are using GaN (Gallium Nitride) which is relatively new, but far more efficient for converting and passing power than traditional power bricks. GaN chargers are relatively new and more expensive.</p>
<p>The macbook pro and ultrabooks are also less power hungry than gaming laptops and desktop computers. They're relatively powerful and enough for like productivity uses, but most of the power usage in a computer comes from the GPU, where Apple runs as lean as possible while still letting you use photoshop. The 13 inch macbook pro ships with a 61W charger, a gaming laptop usually 2-300W and a desktop PC probably more like 400W minimum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, Apple uses AC adapters that are underpowered. Most PC laptops have powerful AC adapters that can meet the PEAK power usage of the laptop. But Apple decided to use a less powerful (and more compact) AC adapter, and let the laptop use some battery power when it's under a particularly heavy load. So if you use a Macbook Pro at 100% GPU &amp; CPU load constantly (say, mining bitcoins), its battery will run down even if it's connected to the AC adapter. But in real-life use, this is not a problem. I think some PC manufacturers have started doing this now too, as they transition to USB-C power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The phone charger is still doing the voltage conversion from mains voltage to whatever your device needs but since I don't think it has as power-hungry components, it can use a smaller brick. Powerful laptops with dGPU's need over 100W so therefore has to use a larger brick.</p>
<p>The Macbook uses USB-PD which is awesome for powering smaller laptops and phones. The device can negotiate the proper voltage for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An interesting point to make here: Power bricks generate a lot of heat. The 360's brick is a pain in the arse to deal with, but removes that big heat source from the console itself. The PS3 is nicer and more self-contained, but has to deal with that extra heat internally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also worth watching how the 360 power supplies shrink over time, as the later system revisions are more energy-efficient, going from 200W at launch to 115W for the last revisions.</p></div>		</li>
