			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! I'm writing a paper and a big component is the importance of Vitamin D. I was going to add in that it's an interesting point that Vitamin D is the only essential nutrient we don't have to ingest to obtain (for individuals not needing parental nutrition) but you reminded me how we can absorb magnesium through our skin. Won't be making that statement!</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is kind of a self-supporting argument. If we could make it ourselves then it wouldn't be an essential nutrient.</p>
<p>Cats for example can make Vitamin C directly. If we could as well we'd probably never even have given it a name.</p></div>		</li>
