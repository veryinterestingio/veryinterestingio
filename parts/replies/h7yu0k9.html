			<div class="markdown"><p>And if you add rotation into this as well it will cool down about 40x faster. So if you rotate your drink while it's in a bucket of cold ice you could essential cool it down in about 2 or 3 minutes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw a post online where a guy tried this and he found that the wet paper towel actually slows down the cooling because it acts as a sort of jacket for the can/bottle. </p>
<p>There’s just more mass from the water and the paper towel that needs to cool down. Also, there’s no evaporative cooling at those temperatures. </p>
<p>Someone please correct me if I’m wrong. The post wasn’t super thorough. I think he tested one or two bottles each way with some temperature probes, and he wasn’t entirely sure how to explain the results with physics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It changes the convection coefficient.</p>
<p>Say air on can is 1, adding the wet paper towel is another layer but if air on paper towel is 4 and paper towel on can is 2 then overall it conducts heat faster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If glass is a better insulator than plastic, why does it feel cooler to the touch. Doesn't that mean it's transferring heat away faster than the plastic, therefore a better conductor, not insulator?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really - since the air in the fridge is such a poor conductor.</p>
<p>Plus at some point they all reach the same temperature anyway.</p>
<p>The real difference is that the metal can conducts heat away from your hand much faster than glass or plastic, so it just <em>feels</em> colder. The liquid is likely the same temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not discounting it’s just a perceptual trick going on, but I’ve noticed in one of my fridges that things in cans get colder to the point they’ll freeze over sometimes, or be so super chilled they freeze when you pour it, when stuff in plastic and glass doesn’t seem to do that.</p></div>		</li>
