<p>The link below contains a 3 min video of a mosquito dissection if you want more info on it.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Extremely unlikely. Having the blood in your hands mean very little, the virus must be able to infect you, this usually happens when the virus (or pathogen) reaches the blood stream.</p>
<p>Read about Chagas disease. The protist that causes it replicates in the insects (triatomine bug) intestinal tract and is shed in the bug's feces. When an infected triatomine feeds, it defecates at the same time to make room for the blood. Scratching at the bite introduces the parasite in wound, starting the infection.</p></div>		</li>
