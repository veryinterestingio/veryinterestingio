			<div class="markdown"><p>I commented this down below and thought it was pertinent to your comment, so here you go:</p>
<p>I have recently been reading &quot;The Body: A Guide For Occupants&quot; by Bill Bryson. In the 4th chapter, &quot;The Brain&quot;, on page 60, it talks about how we originally thought that all memories are permanently stored, we just can't retrieve them all, which is what I had heard as well. Here is the direct quote from the book:</p>
<p>&quot;It sued to be thought that every experience is stored permanently as memory somewhere in the brain but that most of it is locked away beyond out power of immediate recall. The idea arose principally from a series of experiments in Canada from the 1930's to the 1950's by the neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield. While carrying out surgical procedures at the Montreal Neurological Institute, Penfield discovered that when he touched a probe to the patients' brain, it often provoked powerful sensation-vivid smells from childhood, feelings of euphoria, sometimes a recollection of a forgotten scene from very early life. From this is was concluded that the brain records and stores every conscious event from our lives, however trivial. Now, however, it is thought that the stimulation was mostly providing the sensation of memory and that what the patients were experiencing was more like a hallucination than a recalled event.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>forgetting something is much more complex than it sounds at the surface. it can be either error in writing something into storage, error in finding something in storage, or error in retrieving something from storage. And those errors could be in multiple places too! they might occur in the short term memory, where it maybe doesn't properly transfer to long term memory. or maybe it does transfer to long term memory, but incompletely or unstable. we have very little understanding of this process and we don't know how any of this works. what i just described is based on the attkinson and shiffrin memory models, no idea if those are still relevant. learned about them back in 2012.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Retrograde amnesia is when you cannot recall a memory that was previously formed, caused by damage to the recall pathway.</p>
<p>Anterograde amnesia is when you cannot form new memories, so those underlying processes (for example, when encoding a short term memory into long term) are failing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No.  That would require more processing and energy than we can possibly provide... our memories as they are are very flimsy recollections and not particularly accurate in terms of &quot;reliving&quot; anything.  It's more like you reconstruct an experience from fragments when you recall a memory...</p></div>		</li>
