<p>Dry socket can occur three to four days after an adult tooth is removed. The blood clot that should form after removal is dislodged or dissolved before the wound heals, exposing underlying bone and nerves.</p>
<p>It is painful in unimaginable ways.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I got a syringe to irrigate my sockets after having all four wisdom teeth out.  </p>
<p>The first time I used it I made the mistake of using cold water.  Thankfully when I blacked out from the pain I collapsed backwards and didn't knock the rest of my teeth out on the sink.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The tissue holding the tooth in place calcifies, meaning it becomes hard, so it keeps the tooth in place mechanically even though it's &quot;soft&quot; in life.</p>
<p>I guess it calcifies more than other tissue.</p></div>		</li>
