			<div class="markdown"><p>Its not a high enough percentage that it will keep it sterile, but you know your beer is bad by smell most of the time and would toss it instead of selling it. And many ales were served fresh, with not much time from grain to glass so it didn't have the chance to spoil anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The idea that beer was safer than water has very little to do with the &lt;5% alcohol in your average small beer and a lot more to do with the fact that making beer involves boiling the wort.</p>
<p>They didn’t know how disease or even yeast worked but that procedural step likely made any difference that could be observable. Not, to my knowledge, the meager alcohol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. In addition to boiling the wort, the yeast also effectively prevented a lot of germs from messing up your beer. While they didn't know exactly what yeast was and how it worked, it's been used by brewers and bakers since forever.  </p>
<p>Yeast causes a big pH drop in your beer during fermentation, basically making an acidic, unsuitable environment for most bad bugs. People also used to add all sorts of herbs (and eventually hops) to beer to make it more stable. Hops in particular has anti microbial effects.  </p>
<p>It's still fairly common to ferment beer in an open container today, and the chances of it spoiling, to the point where it could make you sick, are tiny.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Boiling the wort is important but alcohol is part of the answer for why beer doesn’t grow pathogens later on. Alcohol, the pH range, hops(if these older beers had them, hops became standard relatively recently) yeast having consumed simple sugars all play a role.  Most pathogens are inhibited in beer below pH 4.6</p></div>		</li>
