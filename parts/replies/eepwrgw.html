			<div class="markdown"><p>After planting a few succulents in my spiders' enclosures, I didn't some research to see if they could produce enough oxygen to keep a spider alive on their own. During that research, I read that the total decrease in CO2 one can expect from a reasonable number of plants is insignificant. Much less than 1%, if I recall correctly. </p>
<p>It seemed to imply that no viable mass of house plants could possibly compete with the CO2 consumption of an adult human. The article was aimed at criticizing other articles for simply stating that &quot;plants clean the air because they turn CO2 into oxygen&quot; without actually doing any math on it. I wish I had time right now to hunt for that article again. Maybe someone can link another reference that did the math. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In terms of efficiency in converting CO2 into O2, algae beats them. </p>
<p>Plants are the obvious first response, but I'm seeking an answer that beats algae scrubbers in feasibility. It would require a <strong>ton</strong> of plants to match the output of a person.</p>
<p>There's another helpful /r/askscience thread about how many trees it would take to support one person:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>researchers estimated the number of trees needed to offset the average oxygen consumption of a single person in various North American cities. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/5rKHPCO.png" target="_blank">Here is the full table,</a> where you can see that in an average city (e.g. Philadelphia) you need about <strong>20 trees to provide enough oxygen for one person.</strong></p>

<p><strong>20 trees per person</strong> is not something most people can afford in money or space to match with houseplants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would an algae system seem intensive? </p>
<p>All it requires is a jug of water and a bubbler to cycle the air through.</p>

<p>Algae breeds like crazy, so setting up multiple systems would be even simpler than buying more plants.</p>
<p>For others' reference in that study, the Prayer Plant reduced the CO2 in a 1 cubic meter chamber from 1000ppm to 845.37ppm in 8 hours.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>carbon dioxide has set a record high each year since measurements began. It stood at 315 ppm when record keeping began at Mauna Loa in 1958.* In 2013, it passed 400 ppm. Just four years later, the 400 ppm mark is no longer a novelty. It’s the norm.</p>
