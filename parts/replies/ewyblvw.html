<p>This is still a very new discovery and the research is still in its early stages.</p>

<p>Do you have links for any research being conducted? Genuinely asking. Over in r/environment I think it was, people were saying research was abandoned because micro plastic is so prevelant it is literally impossible to have a control group anymore. It's already heavily impacted all of us and become more of a wait and see.</p>
<p>Would love to know if that's inaccurate because this micro plastic in the tap, rain, and air is concerning...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having a lack of a control group is definitely a problem for research. I've not come across that statement, but of all the articles I've read, they all either don't have any information on its effects on humans or other living organisms, or state that there is no conclusive evidence linking MP to any health effects.</p>

<p>For example
months
1-6 = polluted water, test for effects
7-12 = clean water, test for effects</p>
<p>Repeat 2-3 times. </p>
<p>Then Repeat with different durations of drinking polluted water.</p></div>		</li>
