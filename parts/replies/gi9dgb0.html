<p>Hence, the mexican brand &quot;Corona&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: Because Corona is crown in Spanish (as well as in Latin, hence the beer brand), in Spain the brand is called Coronita (little crown) because only the royal family can use Corona in products. Basically, if it has the word crown in the name it can be mistaken by the royal family supporting the brand, so no one is allowed to use it unless there is royal support.</p>
<p>Fun fact 2: The same is applicable to the word Real (royal in Spanish). If something is named Real (e.g. Real Madrid) it means that the royal family supports in some way that product or institution. (PS: Real Madrid is not the only “royal” team in Spain)</p></div>		</li>
