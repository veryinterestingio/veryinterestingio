			<div class="markdown"><p>can you explain how air is compressed just by spinning it quickly? I can’t find any info on that specific question and I don’t want to create a new post. all I find are answers like “the blades compress the air. How??</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you look at a cutaway of an axial compressor, you can see that the compressor is converging, eg getting narrower from front to back. It’s not the blades compressing the air, but the blades forcing the air into a smaller and smaller space that compressed the air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just did that, and was fascinated. In the cross cuts of turboprop engines, there is a combustion chamber just after the compressor, and just before the turbine. What fundamental mechanism at work makes sure the fuel exploision exits through the rear as opposed through the front? Is it merely air pressure differential?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right the passages are getting smaller, but that's not driving the pressure. They get smaller to compensate for the rise in pressure and density. The blade passages are basically rotating diffusers (the flow sees a local area increase), slowing the flow down relative to the blade motion. In a diffuser passage, velocity (relative) decreases and pressure increases</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is not correct - the narrowing space is intended to maintain the compression.  The compression itself is generated by the blades, which are oriented in one angle, pushing the air against the vanes which are stationary and oriented at the opposite angle of the blades.  Just pushing air into a smaller cavity would just cause it to move faster to get through the cavity, there would be little to no pressure increase.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just like a wing, blades change the direction of the air as it spins, pushing it backwards in a vortex like flow, then the stators, fixed blades in between compresor stages, slow down mostly of the rotation of that &quot;vortex&quot; and rrdirects the flow in a efficient way to the next compressor stage. That slow down part is where most of the compression happens, imagine pushing a sponge against the table, it will maintain the same mass in less volume.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An axial compressor typically contains a rotor and a stator (non-moving fins attached to the case of the compressor)</p>
<p>The rotor's job is to pull air into the engine and accelerate it.</p>
<p>The stator fins are layered between the rotors and serve to remove any spin from the airflow and decelerate the air. This interaction raises the pressure of the air whereas the rotor alone would tend to only increase velocity.</p>
<p>Layer this out a bunch of times and you can get a large pressure rise, this kind of setup is far too expensive to be used as just a normal air compressor which is why you wouldn't see this in most turbomachinery but for a jet engine it's much more efficient because the flow direction changes less than other types.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;main fan&quot; in a turbo fan is the big outside push/pull propeller. In a turbofan arrangement the primary thrust of a gas turbine is directed  onto a small &quot;fan&quot; spinning it like a kids pinwheel toy.. This causes the THRUST of the turbine to be converted into a rotary force and takes all that raw power and harness it to drive a much larger THRUST PROPELLER.   </p>
<p>If you remove this thrust propeller, you have what is called a turboshaft engine, commonly used to drive helicopters rotorblades or industrial generators.    </p>
<p>If you remove the smaller &quot;pinwheel&quot; you have a thrusting turbine engine that just blows its hot gases out like a hair dryer.  </p>
<p>A thrust turbine has a starter motor, and intake fan, and an exhaust fan all on one shaft<br />
so when you rotate the starter the first fan sucks air in, fuel is mixed and ignited, and then the exhaust gases blow directly on the exhaust fan, it catches the force and spins like a pinwheel....and this causes the shaft to rotate faster and faster WITHOUT the starter motor applying any power.....   </p>
<p>Now if you add additional fans between the intake and exhaust fan you force the air into smaller and smaller spaces with each blade increasing the compression of the gases, and that increases the potential thrust...Im fond of 5 stage compressors personally....All of these guys flying around with jetpacks, carbon fiber wings, and flying boards are using single stage model aircraft turbines from JetCat.....so they clearly get the job done despite their simplicity</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What governs the amount of thrust produced by the engine?  Is it just fuel flow to get the larger thrust fan spinning faster, or is there something else to it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not geared the both turn independently. The fan is being turned by the low pressure turbine that it shares a shaft with. The low pressure turbine is being turned by the exhaust of the high pressure turbine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the low pressure turbine is the assembly just past the compressor?  The exhaust from the compressor passes through the low pressure turbine, which is what spins the fan?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They aren't geared unless you are talking about a turboprop. The vains/other accessories are modulated (shifted) through a fadec system based on engine sensors and thrust lever position.</p></div>		</li>
