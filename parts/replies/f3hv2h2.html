			<div class="markdown"><p>Large chunks of New Orleans were built where flooding was imminent. The French Quarter, where people have lived for hundreds of years — it fared much better than the parts built comparatively recently, and the parts that have been built below sea-level and outside levees. </p>
<p>Amsterdam’s been slowly improving for 800 years. </p>
<p>Amsterdam is 85 square miles. New Orleans is 350. </p>
<p>Your comparison is unequal in a lot of ways.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Large chunks of the Netherlands were built where flooding was imminent and under sea level. </p>
<p>More modern constructions should be implementing more modern techniques and technology, being new isn’t an excuse to be weak. </p>
<p>Hurricane Katrina was only a 150 year storm. If you’re system isn’t built to withstand something that is likely to happen within a single persons life span then you’re not planning properly. </p>
<p>And Katrina was so catastrophic because it’s levees failed. They didn’t even perform to the standards they should have. </p>

<p>I am agreeing with your original point, but we can see that other places are able to mitigate disaster by planning for it, and some just don’t. Tokyo does plan, Huston not so much.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Did you know that historically comparisons have been made between separate things? I don't know where this new thing comes from that conservatives have been pushing that comparisons must be made with only one thing. But I suspect it's because so many of them have been having trouble with the complexity of doing it the other way.</p></div>		</li>
