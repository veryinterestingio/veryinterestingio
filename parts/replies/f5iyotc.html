			<div class="markdown"><p>Also worth noting that the reason bacteria don’t like salt is because the water inside the bacteria wants to have the same salt content as the water <em>outside</em> the bacteria, which would cause the bacteria to get dehydrated and die.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And, as a side note, there are species bacteria that are adapted to living in high-salt environments. They thrive on cheese, because that environment is particurly hostile to most other species, leaving all the resources to them: <em>brevibacterium linens</em> is one such type of bacteria and it is used in making gorgonzola, fontina, taleggio, romadur, limburger, Wisconsin brick and a great lot of others. It makes orange colored colonies and produces a distinctive bad smell... Rinds of those cheese I mentioned are repeatedly washed with brine to keep the environment salty and the bacteria healthy (this is not all the picture, obviously, lots of other stuff with different bacteria and molds happen inside the cheese to make it &quot;age&quot;, adding to the flavor and texture in hundreds of subtle ways depending on the recipes and techniques applied).</p>
<p><em>Brevibacterium</em> also thrives on human skin, in places that are humid, hot and salty. Like feets, particularly between the toes, especially when they've been kept all day in sneaker shoes without socks to soak up the sweat - but they live also in your armpits and in the perineal and inguinal regions.</p>
<p>Now you know why some cheese smells of feet. It doesn't. They both smell of <em>brevibacterium</em>. Or, if you prefer, it <em>litterally</em> does (it is indeed the exact same smell).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We eat both goat chèvre and goat feta. The goat cheese does go bad (moldy) after a while but usually just ferments a bit first. The feta just fermented and was strong. My partner makes kefir using goat milk and a 2L jug only lasts about 10 days before it’s sour. The shelf life is much less than traditional milk, in our experience.</p></div>		</li>
