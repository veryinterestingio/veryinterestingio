			<div class="markdown"><p>Great article. I didn’t get a great understanding of immunity from coating the mucosal surfaces, but it did a good job a dispelling the myth and getting me more informed on passing immunities as a whole.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>KellyMom also claims that an infant’s “open gut” allows breast milk antibodies to pass directly into the bloodstream. That actually doesn’t happen in human infants – except for maybe in the first few days of life when intestinal permeability is truly high (and the evidence isn’t clear on that point). Instead, human babies get maternal antibodies (IgG) into their bloodstream when they cross the placenta during pregnancy. These include IgG developed by the mother in response to infection or immunization, and this is why maternal immunization for pertussis and flu during pregnancy is so effective at protecting babies from infection after birth. This is different from many other species of animals, in which IgG can’t cross the placenta and are instead transferred to baby via milk (especially colostrum) after birth (12,13).</p>
<p>The most important antibody type in human milk is secretory IgA, which coats mucosal surfaces such as the lining of the GI tract and can protect against infection in that way. However, IgA can’t be absorbed into the blood in human babies.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But that would only protect the baby if it comes contact with covid 19 through the mouth (which is still the most likely path of infection since they tend to put everything in their mouth when they are able to). When it breathes in the aerosol it still might get infected.
Maybe puking through the nose helps them get their nasal cavity coated with IgA though...
Has anyone more information?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The nose, sinus, lungs, eye, etc. are also mucosal surfaces, no? I don't think reflux everywhere makes a baby any more immune (or not), it just makes it a baby.</p></div>		</li>
