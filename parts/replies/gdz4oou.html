<p>So, as I said in my initial comment, the scale of weak interactions is set by the mass of the Higgs boson. Now, the mass of any particle generically receives quantum corrections induced by its couplings to other particles. (This is a distinctively quantum effect, you don't see this in classical field theory.) For example, the electron mass is corrected by its interaction with the photon.</p>
<p>The exception to this is if the mass of a particle is protected by some symmetry. This is why the photon and the gluon (as well as the W and the Z, before electroweak symmetry breaking) remain massless despite quantum corrections; the symmetry of the electroweak and strong interactions forces them to be massless. Also, the corrections that fermions (quarks and leptons) get to their masses are proportional to the masses themselves. As a result, fermions do not get very big mass corrections. Crucially, however, there is nothing protecting the mass of the Higgs: it is a boson, not a fermion, and there is no symmetry shielding it from mass corrections.</p>
<h3>New physics?</h3>
<p>The Standard Model is incredibly successful, but it is incomplete. It is an <em>effective</em> theory, valid up to some energy scale, at which it is supplanted by a more fundamental theory. What is the scale at which new physics occurs? No one knows for sure, but most people believe that new physics will appear at the Planck scale. In my last comment, I explained that gravitational processes are suppressed by the Planck scale. But also, if I try to make a quantum theory of general relativity (our theory of gravity), the theory breaks down and ceases to be predictive at the Planck scale. For this reason, most particle theorists expect new physics related to quantum gravity must appear at the Planck scale or lower.</p>
<p>Slight aside: the same story happened with the weak interactions, before we discovered the W and Z bosons. Fermi wrote down an effective theory of beta decay (a radioactive process mediated by the weak interaction), which was predictive up to energies of around ~100 GeV/c^2. So, we expected new physics related to the weak interaction to show up around that scale---and indeed, this is roughly the mass of the W and Z bosons.</p>
<h3>Sensitivity, and a fine-tuning problem</h3>
<p>Suppose there's some new heavy particle at some mass scale M. We expect it to couple to the Higgs, and you can compute the resulting correction to the Higgs mass. The correction is of the order of the heavy scale M. But now we have a puzzling situation: if the Higgs is receiving corrections to its mass which are of the order M, then we would naively expect the Higgs mass, after corrections, to be of the order M as well. The only way that it could be much smaller than M is if different mass corrections are finely tuned so as to cancel each other out. For simplicity I assumed that the new physics takes the form of a particle with mass M, but the conclusion is more general. The Higgs mass is <em>sensitive</em> to the scale of new physics.</p>
<p>Here, then, is the hierarchy problem: if you expect new physics to appear at the Planck scale (or some other high scale), then the Higgs mass should also be roughly of that scale. But the Higgs mass is a factor of 10^17 smaller than the Planck mass. It's as though a number which we expected to be of order one is in fact 10^-17. Within the Standard Model, the Higgs mass seems very finely-tuned.</p>
<p>Now you can say to me &quot;maybe this is just the way the world is. So what if one of the input parameters in my theory is very small?&quot; This is a fair position to take. But I would contend that a number which is almost zero, but not quite, begs for an explanation.</p>
<p>There are a few ways we can solve the hierarchy problem. The traditional way involves introducing some new physics at a much lower energy than the Planck scale, not much higher than the electroweak scale. This pushes down the size of the Higgs mass corrections to the scale of the new physics, and additionally the new physics must somehow shield the Higgs from Planck-scale corrections. This was a big reason that particle theorists expected to see physics beyond the Standard Model at the LHC; solutions to the hierarchy problem often involve new physics at scales accessible to the LHC. However, the LHC found the Higgs, but no evidence of new physics! And so the mystery of the hierarchy problem continues.</p></div>		</li>
