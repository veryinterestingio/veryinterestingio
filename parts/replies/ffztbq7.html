			<div class="markdown"><p>They had long hallways that went back and forth (like a very angled zig zag) pattern. And they'd run drills having to run down them.  In case ak accident occurred it was meant to reduce any blast from going down a straight hallway.</p>
<p>I should probably dig up my dad's oral history of his work there that was documented for the Nevada Test Site Museum.</p>
<p>EDIT: Apparently this was more for escaping radiation than a blast. I'm going to try to find my dad's test site oral history and I'll post up a link when I do.</p>
<p>EDIT:  Here's a link to it.  It's held in the digital UNLV Digital Collection.
There's also an audio version of the interview.  <a href="http://d.library.unlv.edu/digital/collection/nts/id/1143/rec/1" target="_blank">http://d.library.unlv.edu/digital/collection/nts/id/1143/rec/1</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is half true they did have to worry about ash drifting people use to have watch party’s in Vegas for the mushroom clouds . The US was very cautious about wind direction and only had one incident I’m aware of where the wind carried the radiation dust across a town in UTah, they are known as downwinders for that reason.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Game theory is a thing. The world doesn't work the same on a geopolitical scale as on an interpersonal scale. </p>
<p>Interpersonally, there are authorities that use a monopoly on violence to enforce public order, and this changes the game theory of interactions. For example, if your neighbor is stealing your stuff you can call the police, but if there was no authority maybe the only way you can prevent that is by getting a gun and threatening to shoot. And maybe that works, but maybe it doesn't, so maybe you actually have to follow through with shooting him. If you don't shoot him all your neighbors now know they can steal your stuff with impunity, but if you do all your neighbors are now worried you'll overreact to shit and shoot them. etc. So maybe whether you shoot depends on the attitudes of your neighbors toward you, toward your neighbor, or in general.</p>
<p>There is no geopolitical authority. Geopolitical interactions are like interpersonal interaction would be <em>if there were no police or other government authority.</em> So we HAD to test nukes, and we HAD to do it as fast as everyone else, because if we didn't we would fall behind. This is exactly why the Partial Test Ban Treaty happened - geopolitical game theory. No government wanted to have to rely on tests that risked harming their populace, but as long as other governments were doing those tests they all had to do those tests. So they all agreed they all wouldn't do them. But no one was going to agree to stop testing altogether (because then whoever cheated would get super far ahead) so they all just agreed to limit themselves to the least harmful testing methods.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Underground tests still vent radioactive gas into the atmosphere, just at a much lower level than surface and atmospheric tests. They wouldn't generate a large mushroom cloud like the watch parties in Vegas were for.</p>
<p>On that note if you're ever in Las Vegas you should visit the nuclear testing museum, they've got a lot of cool exhibits!</p></div>		</li>

<p>They are known as downwinders, and radiation plumes and effects stretched across America. Nevada, UT, CO, KS, MO and probably further.</p>
<p>My uncle married a woman who was a member of the Sheehan family that owned Groom Mine over looking Groom Lake, later Area 51. Her grandparents and parents all suffered from being down wind of the early blasts.</p></div>		</li>
