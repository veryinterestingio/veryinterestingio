			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea that's not really the same as someone with fillings but yes very uncomfortable for sure. But with fillings it's like a shock from a small battery like a 9v... I know what that feels like... had brother who was 3 years older and ge thought it was funny... I was a gullible child</p></div>		</li>
