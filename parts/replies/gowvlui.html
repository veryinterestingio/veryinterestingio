			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm well I am not entirely sure if that is rational. Hydrogen and Helium are the most abundant elements yet they are very rare on earth (as free element or diatomic gas). Both carbon and silicon are very stable in nuclear term. Both are commonly trapped in forms that cannot be used for biological processes (oil and gaseous substances, with the obvious exception of methane and CO2 for carbon, and in the form of minerals for silicon). If thermodynamic permits, the chance of life finding a way to utilize them is there (such as in the case of nitrogen). I do not personally agree with the rarity makes the difference; it is purely thermodynamic and in short-time scale, kinetic as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While Si-Si complex chains are fragile, the Si-O-Si bonds aren't. Silicate polymers can do anything hydrocarbons can. Might weigh a bit more, but functionality can be the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct to some degree; carbon can form strong C=O bond without compromising the strength of the remaining two bonds. Carbon also form strong enough but labile enough bonds to allow chemical changes with other elements such as N, P, the halogens (except with F) and even transition metals. Si can of course do the same but the bonds are either too labile or the bond is weak enough that while a chemical change does occur, it likely will affect the integrity of the whole system.
Making a biologically functioning molecule solely with Si-O polymer is impossible because it cannot possibly serve any useful biological function and if the either polymer is not saturated with Si-O bond, the bonds that are not Si-O would likely just break apart.
All of these are just chemical properties as well; physical properties have not even been considered. Silicon is more polarizable than carbon and its compound likely stack more Van Der Waals when compared to carbon. Carbon is just more flexible; you can make it hydrophobic or hydrophilic or, well, both. Silicon on the other hand is naturally more fatty; couple with the fact that it does not have much choice when it comes to stable bonding with other elements, it makes it a lot less flexible to be the core of a biological organism. When it comes to being alive, flexibility is a key component.
Also other things to consider: basic biological functions like sweating, urination and defecation: all ways for the body to get rid of wastes. All of these are possible because the waste products are water-soluble or strong attraction to water due to heteroatoms on it. Exhalation of carbon dioxide is another important part to get rid of wastes from metabolic byproducts. All of which silicon compounds are simply not flexible and robust enough to do, over millions and millions of years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All good points if you're discussing how carbon-based life would fair against silicon-based life, but there exist carbon free environments. In our solar system alone, there's a place (Io) that is not only carbon free but is free of all the first row elements save oxygen. If life arises in these places, it is necessarily devoid of carbon.</p>
<p>Sodium silicate (super rubber) display sufficient polymerization characteristics and chemical flexibility, especially when combined with polar solvents other than water (NaCl is my favorite). I've seen nothing in silicate chemistry that precludes supporting the complexity of life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus silicon oxides are solid (see rocks), while CO2 definitely isn’t. It’s theoretically possible silicon life could exist, but, well, Earth is over 20% silicon and only has carbon in relative trace amounts, and we aren’t made out of silicon, so...</p></div>		</li>
