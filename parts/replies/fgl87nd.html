			<div class="markdown"><p>I cared for beardies for a short time, and I really noticed that eye-closing response too. Luckily they also make it so clear with their movements and beard when they're getting annoyed. </p>
<p>I took care of one for a few months for my breeder friend, she was losing weight quickly and he wouldn't take her to a vet. I didn't have the means to do so myself but I said I'd care for her and handle the syringe feeding business until she got better, or otherwise. She wasnt eating at all. First few days she would panick when I tried to feed her, but then got used to it. I would feed her mashed up spinach and stuff and she would close her eyes and just let it get down after that. She did die, but I hope I made her more comfortable until then. :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh my God I swear what I read back then said it was okay. Maybe it was some other dark greens. I also gave her fruit and stuff. Well, next time I'll double check. I hope it didn't make her worse though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is a sign of stress.<br />
If a bearded dragon closes his eyes you should stop touching it.<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>Head-bobbing is a display of dominance, but it can also happen if they feel threatened (therefore they try to act tough to scare away whatever is bothering them).  Tail-whipping happens when they're off balance, not as a defense mechanism (as far as I know, but I've never heard of it).  /u/amfa is wrong on the eye-closing thing, unless s/he has some evidence from an actual authority on it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I seriously doubt this, and I'll tell you why: Pierre is another owner, like myself and everyone else.  He has no special authority or education on bearded dragons, and everything on that web site is his opinion, often based around the comments on his web site.</p>
<p>I know for a fact that it doesn't cause her stress, because she will go out of her way to walk up to receive more.  Additionally, bearded dragons close their eyes for numerous reasons: a strong breeze, something getting too close to their eyes, napping, etc.  Those are stressful actions, they're responses to outside stimuli.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha, been in that situation as well.  Luckily Khisanth is sort of &quot;potty trained&quot; (sort of).  She likes to climb up my beard, bury herself in it, and nap when I'm watching Netflix or playing on the PC.  Otherwise she'll camp out on my shoulder and watch me paint models.</p></div>		</li>
