			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://style.mla.org/punctuation-and-quotation-marks/" target="_blank">This is the truth.</a> Incidentally, it is also why full-height punctuation such as exclamation points and question marks can go outside the quotation marks.</p>
<p>Grammar based on typesetting is outdated and stupid. The punctuation should be included inside the quote if it is part of the quote, and outside if it isn't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh? </p>
<p>That article says nothing about periods slipping out of place in typesetting. It’s about fixed width fonts and kerning. </p>
<p>Which would apply to typewriters, not printing presses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn’t make logical sense.  In mechanical typesetting, aren’t the individual letters and symbol blocks all a uniform height so they can be kept slotted in the same row?  The period may be narrow, but all the printed symbols are the same height so they can stay aligned vertically and make straight lines of type. </p>
<p>The period character just has a smaller raised area that actually prints on paper, but the hunk of metal it’s on should be the same size as an exclamation point and probably no smaller than the space which just has no raised surface so it doesn’t print anything.</p></div>		</li>
