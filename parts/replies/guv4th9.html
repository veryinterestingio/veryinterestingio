			<div class="markdown"><p>As long as you have a sufficient intake of varius proteins (full protein spectrum) then there is no benefit of BCAA supplementation. There is literature, if you’re interested, on the optimal amount per activity/desired outcome and the value of each protein source.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>a scoop of whey has 6g bcaa. in an ordinary diet, you're getting enough that supplementation would give no meaningful affect. </p>
<p>bcaa on their own have minimal value unless you are seriously cutting and trying to preserve muscle mass under a significant caloric deficit. </p>
<p>theyre expensive and bitter - tastes like ass</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. So many people forget whey has a bunch of BCAAs in it and will take BCAAs anyway even if they’re taking whey. Makes no sense</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not super studied, but a couple papers I found online didn’t show much of a benefit to supplements. You should be able to easily supply your amino acids needs with a normal diet.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Preferably brown rice. White rice has a much lower content of protein and minerals (basically you need to eat 3-4 times as much white rice as brown rice to get the same amount of nutrients) and almost completely lacks Thiamine (Vitamin B-1).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>so is that why East Asians supposedly have such excellent health and longevity? Their diet is built on a metric ton of white rice? </p>
<p>It seems like simply incorporating white rice into a westernized diet does more harm than good, but having it as a staple is beneficial?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While rice and beans may have them all, there's probabaly way too much fiber in the quantity of rice and beans you would need to eat if you are really trying to spur muscle growth. I feel bad for anyone else in that gym, particularly on squat day hahaha. you would need to eat a bunch of it every single day to and that's gunna get old quick. </p>
<p>It's so much easier to just buy protien supplements in my oppinion. That way you can vary your diet much more and rely on the powder to help fill in the gaps. Plus the ratios of BCAAs are usually intentionally set to what you would want when you buy a powder.</p></div>		</li>
