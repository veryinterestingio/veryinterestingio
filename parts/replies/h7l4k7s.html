			<div class="markdown"><p>Two factor authentication is usually taken to be two of these three factors: A thing you have, a thing you know or a thing you are.
Sometimes a fourth factor is included - A place you are at.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you make a transaction in place A</p>
<p>And then 10minutes later place B</p>
<p>But they're 200 miles apart</p>
<p>It'll flag as fraud</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on that, there is generally considered to be 3 different form of authentication, and any remotely secure system should ALWAYS use a minimum of 2 of these:</p>
<ol>
<li>Something you <strong>know</strong> (Password, PIN Code, etc.)</li>
<li>Something you <strong>have</strong> (Credit Card, USB Encryption Key Dongles, Phones with SMS or Authenticator apps....)</li>
<li>Something you <strong>are</strong> (Biometrics, Fingerprint, DNA, Retina Scan etc.)</li>
</ol>
<p>And in general, using multiple Factors increases the security of the system EXPONENTIALLY more than just making the one factor more secure (i.e. A simple key and passcode is far more secure than a security key with no password. A simple PW with an Authenticator App is much harder to breach than a super complicated password with no App)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it's even better with the roll out of emv, now the chip &quot;signs&quot; the transaction with it's own unique key, so the PIN verifies it's really you and the emv chip verifies it's really card # xxx and not some clone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Singapore the ATM will not tell you if you key in the wrong pin at first try. It will let you go into the home page as usual. Only when you try to withdraw money or access any other function, it will then tell you &quot;hey you entered the wrong pin just now, enter your pin again&quot; and if you fail it will swallow the card. Not sure if it triggers any silent alert as well</p></div>		</li>
