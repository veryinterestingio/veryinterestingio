			<div class="markdown"><p>I took physiology this previous semester, but if I had to guess... The combustion of tar in cigarettes would make it more of a gas as it enters the airway, and would coat the walls. This is where mucus would essentially soak it up towards the upper portions, but enough would make it to the lungs themselves. This is where macrophages would step in to try to clean up, but don't work as quickly as you'd think. The tar would be taken up, the cells would try to break it down, but if they are unsuccessful, they sit in granules of the macrophage until it ultimately dies and the tar could spread after it's destruction.. I think tar build has more to due with the fact that it's very hard to breakdown (molecularly stable, thick, sticky, etc.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Macrophages eating tar become too heavy to move. They are called 'carbon laden macrophages' . They reside in lungs and can't get away after getting fat from all the carbon they engulfed. </p>
