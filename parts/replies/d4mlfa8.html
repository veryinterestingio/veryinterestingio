			<div class="markdown"><p>What this amounts to (I think) is how much pressure is being applied at the point of contact. When the blade is angled, the full weight of the blade gets concentrated into a relatively small area of the edge as it it initially makes contact. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is more correct than the top post.  The angled blade still isn't &quot;slicing&quot;(typically a kind of sawing motion where the blade moves down <em>and</em> sideways) as it still moves straight down.  If you want to press the point, it <em>is</em> kind of simulating the mechanics of a slice but without lateral movement.</p>
<p>If it were straight, the blade would begin at the center of the back of the neck right where it's the hardest to cut.  Over time this could cause wear or even crumpling of the cutting edge right in the center.</p>
<p>It also provides the most resistance right away.</p>
<p>Starting from the side with the slanted blade, it is more of a shearing effect akin to scissors rather than a chop from an axe or cleaver.</p>
<p>Imagine if scissors were two flat blades where they had to bite with the whole blade rather than pivot and hit different parts of the blade as a cut progresses.</p>
<p>The idea is exactly as you put it, to concentrate the pressure over a smaller portion of the blade.</p>
<p>Another way to visualize it as a stab vs a chop.  Stabbing with a pointed blade is much easier because the energy is transferred laterally, once penetration is attained the blade sails through flesh like butter.  A chop would require much more force(or sideways pressure, eg slice) because you're utilizing more of the blades edge at once, more surface area means more drag/friction.</p>
<p>You don't hear about too many stabbings with a wide flat chisel for that reason, it just doesn't work as well as a pointed/angled blade.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Axes are actually rounded for this same purpose. Whether chopping wood or attempting to slice through armor, an ax concentrates the full force of a swing into a single point. A typical sword blade when slicing comes in at a slight angle, but for the many unbent swords in existence, the area of contact is still larger than if a curve were added. </p>
<p>I would almost argue the slant of a guillotine makes it more rather than less ax like. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>according to my history teacher too many.  one rather unfortunate aspect of the chopping model is that it's possible for it to not chop far enough through to kill you the first time around and so would have to be raised and dropped again while you sit there in a lot of pain, if you're lucky it would have at least already severed the spine so you wouldn't feel much but if it landed right on bone it could stop even before that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Before the guillotine that has its more famous look there was a more rudimentary version of the thing called the gibbet in Halifax in England.  This was essentially an axe head on the bottom of a huge block of wood.</p>
<p>It doesn't look like it was going to stop, just because the blade didn't hit <em>just</em> right.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you consider the sharply curved swords of ancient cavalry, it is easy to see that the same principle is at work.  Moreover, if you consider that sharper curves generate higher pressures, you can understand why the best armor-penetrating devices are not blades at all.</p>
<p>If you strike someone with a straight sword, more of the length of the blade is in contact with the target, therefore you are not maximizing pressure at the point of contact.</p>
<p>Moreover, we can generate even higher pressures if the the slope of the blade is made steeper and steeper.  If we make the slope extremely sharp, you don't have a curve at all, you have a wedge with the point of contact being the apex if the wedge.  Now if you consider the point of contact in three dimensions instead of two, you can see how the principle of curving a blade as sharply as possible actually gives rise to a point.  This explains why the best armor-piercing devices are not blades at all, but pointed weapons like spears, pikes, and warhammers.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure war hammers worked through blunt force trauma not penetrating the armor. They did have spikes but those were more for hooking shields and stuff for grappling.</p>
<p>Primary reason for design: To give a concussion instead of a stab wound. Stabby stabbys slide off of metal plates, hammers dent them and make a big &quot;GONG!&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Swords are also pointed weapons, and some of them are designed particularly for stabbing like an estoc, rapier, or to a lesser extent many arming swords. Those meant for slashing became longer and heavier so they could have a crushing effect vs armor and cause blunt trauma should they fail to penetrate, so you had weapons like the zweilhander.</p>
<p>Spears and pikes had difficulties penetrating later plate armors. Warhammers are great armor penetrating weapons but not because they are stabby but rather because they are designed to create blunt trauma, they do what the zweilhander tries to do against heavily armored targets better. Many had stabby ends, a back end designed like a battle pick, but this might only be used to cause a bleeding wound in an enemy already disabled, as it could get stuck and leave you vulnerable. A flanged mace is probably the best armor penetrating melee weapon, besides a couched lance on a charge/braced pike vs one, or maybe some specialized polearms. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I teach wood shop and have to sharpen and cut stuff all of the time.  If you have a blade that is sharpened to 15 degrees (chisel blade), if you draw it across a piece you are effectively decreasing that angle.  The steeper the angle, the less force you need to use.  The downside to honing an angle to a super acute angle is that they get really brittle.  Necks are a pretty tough thing to chop through, it used to take an executioner a few whacks with an axe.</p></div>		</li>
