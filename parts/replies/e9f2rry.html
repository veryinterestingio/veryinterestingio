			<div class="markdown"><p>I got this infection about 10 years ago. At the time I was in my late 30s, had no weakened immune system and really wasn't sure how I got it. I had necrotizing fasciitis caused by strep A. I have decided I got it in my body somehow and my exercising at the time was hard on my muscles and that's how the infection took over. It was treated by many surgeries with a medically induced coma, and antibiotics. Fortunately I didn't lose any limbs and don't have any lasting effects except for a very long scar down my right side. 0/10 would recommend.</p></div>		</li>
