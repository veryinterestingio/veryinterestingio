			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why aspiration pneumonia is so dangerous. The lungs have no way of eliminating puke so it just stays there with it's acidity and bacteria. Put passed out people on the side so this doesn't happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its much more common if the person cannot get suctioned to develop pneumonia than your body to deal with it. Food doesn’t really get broken down in your lungs and carried into the blood stream. Your lungs are directly coordinated to deliver o2 and release co2 through your blood stream. Nutrition gets into your body by being absorbed through the stomach, or intestines depending on what macro or micronutrient it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once had to take my pills (a bunch) and in my infinite intelligence decided that the hot saké next to me was the easiest way to wash them down. I always swallow them all quickly in one go. </p>
<p>I got half the pills and saké down the wrong pipe. After wheezing, coughing and spluttering for hours I thought I got it all up. </p>
<p>However, I had forgotten about all the delightful fauna that waits for a chance to have fun. Two days later the fevers started and days later it started bubbling when breathing.</p>
<p>It took two weeks on amoxicillin to clear out the fun bacterial pneumonia.</p>
<p>So, maybe Saké was not the best idea to wash it down...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of our airways have ciliated cells covering the surface so we slowly move the mucus and everything that's trapped in it (so long as it's small enough) up and away from our lungs until we either swallow it, cough it out or it eventually gets far enough up that the area isn't secreting mucus anymore and it dries up and becomes a booger.</p></div>		</li>
