			<div class="markdown"><p>This. The amount of virus is important, but ease of use and contamination potential are major difficulties. </p>
<p>To get the virus from swab to liquid you just swish the swab back and forth in a little tube (when I had it done I noticed the nurse doing that right after swabbing). To get the virus from bag or mask to liquid you'd have to do something like soak it in some liquid, shake it around, then pour or pipette the liquid into a tube. Doesn't sound that much harder, but when you're doing hundreds of hundreds of tests a day at a site that will substantially slow things down. Plus the concentration of virus will be lower, and there might be more covid contaminants. Plus the extra supplies you'll burn through (the mask/bag itself, any tray or pipette you need to use to transfer the liquid from bag/mask to tube). Just overall not worth it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's definitely not an industrial &quot;soak-the-bag-in-liquid-shake-and-pour-into-test-tube&quot; machine too! I haven't worked in many labs but some of the videos of the huge industrial ones are so automated. Talk about having to instruct the patient to cough in a bag too...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't speak about the analyzing machines, but we do absolutely collect sputum (throat mucus) from covid patients. I worked a couple of months at a covid-ICU, and while I didn't do the analyzis, we did get out counscious patients to cought into a small jar and send the sputum to a lab for analyzis. Not neccessarily for covid, we already knew they were covid positive, but rather for bacterial or fungal infections. So there certainly is infrastructure for that</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True. Testing is only as good as the materials &amp; performance. If the integrity of the test is compromised or the sample contaminated the results (whatever they may be) would not be reliable. Iow, why do the test at all if the results are suspect? It just wastes valuable testing supplies &amp; the technicians time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Go ahead and swab, but why not a tongue swab?  Nose swab?  Cheek swab?<br />
PCR is exquisitely sensitive, so surely these other membranes can provide a suitable sample.
A less invasive method would be a big step forward in rapid, high-throughput testing. The current method isn’t suitable for daily testing, because your sinuses would become sore/inflamed/infected. Besides, the current method is hazardous to the person doing the sampling. There is a high chance the swab will induce a sneeze, or another droplet dispersing bodily function.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nasal swabs (not the kind that go waaay back) are being used in test kits in Madison, WI for testing in our drive-thru test sites set up by the national guard.  It may depend where you are, and which test is being used.  Regular nasal swabs are acceptable/follow current CDC guidance for sample collection.</p></div>		</li>
