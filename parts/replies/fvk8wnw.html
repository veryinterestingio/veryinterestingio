			<div class="markdown"><p>It is possible and has been done, this is exactly what the sabin polio vaccine is</p>
<p>It offered the benefit of being an oral vaccine, which is far easier to administer and requires no needles or biohazard disposal. This made it ideal for worldwide polio eradication.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the counterpoint, hadn't realized that one if the polio vaccines was infectious. But is the oral administration intrinsic to it being infectious, or is it just a special case for the polio virus? Also addressed the difficulties of an infectious virus in an edit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wild polio virus infects via the fecal oral route, many live attenuated vaccines are administered the way you would be infected by the wild virus. For example the live attenuated flu vaccine is a nasal spray, since that is how you would get infected by wild influenza</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1.) It would be unethical to force medical treatment upon those who do not want it, 2.) The point of herd immunity is that there are some people who can't be vaccinated because of various reasons (immunocompromised). With an infectious vaccine, there's no way to control who you vaccinate and thus someone who is immunocompromised might get infected and then suffer the full effects of the disease or even die.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your explanation. I didn’t really figure those who were immunocompromised could get severely sick from it but I see why now. The only part I don’t understand is how it’s unethical to help people. Wouldn’t it be more unethical to let their ignorance hurt them and get them sick?</p></div>		</li>
