			<div class="markdown"><p>I think he's speaking more about the skilled workers actually building it.</p>
<p>Until you've worked a construction site with actual skilled tradesmen there is no way for you to fully grasp how much the engineers rely on the installer to correct mistakes in the design.</p>
<p>Nothing in construction is as precise as you think it is but through experience, training, and skill it is all possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, tradesmen are literally not qualified to correct mistakes in the design with the exception of the most minor ones. Why do you think engineers or architects exist as a profession in modern times?</p>
<p>It sounds like you're referring to tradesmen correcting errors. Errors that accumulate as you start building a structure as you can very rarely build something to the exact specifications laid out in the design.</p>
<p>I don't know if you have ever actually worked on a construction site, but every site I ever worked on ANY deviation from the design exceeding the allowed margin of error needs to be cleared with the planner and documented. Once the building has been finalized they need to supply the city planning office with plans of how the building was actually finished and more extensive alterations need to be cleared with them as well.</p>
<p>What engineers and architects rely on the tradesmen to do is to make their designs work, not to correct their mistakes. Every blueprint has some room for interpretation and it's up to tradesmen to use their training and experience to fill that room and create a usable and stable structure. It is up to tradesmen to catch any mistakes that went unnoticed and notify the designers to actually fix them, in the best case they can also supply possible solutions.</p>
<p>Every construction project is littered with small corrections and adjustments. A tradesmen isn't qualified to address the majority of them on his/her own. It's a team project and if you change something beyond the margin of error, you better check first or there could be a big bill waiting for you.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Construction can give feedback on constructability, or easier or preferred methods. But that is far different than mistakes in design. They aren't running structural calculations, that's the engineer. And that's done way before it goes to construction.</p></div>		</li>
