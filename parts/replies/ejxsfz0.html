			<div class="markdown"><p>Babies also turn their heads to one side or the other while laying on their backs, so any sick leaks out of their mouths instead of posing a choke hazard. </p>
<p>(I’m sure it’s possible for a baby to lay with their head pointing up but I’m struggling to remember seeing a baby/newborn sleeping like that)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I have a 3 month old right now, and I'm pretty sure I've never seen them sleep with their heads facing straight up. I mean, I'm sure it's possible, but probably not common. I do know that if babies sleep with their heads always twisted one way it can cause their necks to get stuck like that (not permanently, but it is uncomfortable for them)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the advice about sleeping on their back.
Don't bother with any pillow style device to 'prop' your kid this way or that way.</p>
<p>The safest crib is an empty one. No cot bumper, no toys, no blankets. Just the baby, swaddled (we had an incredibly cold house and had to compromise on the blankets but wrapped him up so tight that burrito baby wasn't going anywhere XD)</p>
<p>If your child has a stuffy nose don't prop them up - prop the crib up, stuff something solid at the head end to get a slight incline (never found it helped, but when they won't sleep cause of a cold you'll try anything XD)</p>
<p>Highly recommend sleep sacks/grow bags with removable arms - the security of being swaddled with the freedom of not being swaddled XD</p>
<p>Enjoy your tiny human. :) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We tried proping the mattress up like that when ours was little. Worked really well for a few hours, then she'd wake up again and we'd come in to find out she'd basically slid/rolled/whatever down the &quot;hill&quot; and was no longer angled.   </p>
<p>The only thing we put in her crib was the mesh like netting along the side after she outgrew the swaddlering. (Which is awesome btw. Legit recommend, like couldn't live without.) The mesh was breathable and she couldn't get tangled in it since it ran most of the height of the crib, but without it a few times she'd get her foot or arm somehow between the slats that were barely wider than her foot. I don't know how, but leave it to a baby to figure it out. Easy to fix and didn't hurt her, but caused her to wake up, which caused us to wake up and just general grumpiness all around.  </p>
<p>Other than that, emptiness. Proves that Less Really IS More... sleep and sanity all around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We swaddled my first born with blankets exclusively.  She didn't move much and liked being wrapped up.  For the second kid, we found very quickly that he didn't want to be wrapped up and had enough strength to get out of it by about 3 months.  So we switched to the sleep sack and he was much happier and it's way easier.  </p>
<p>10/10 would recommend the sleep sack again.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I first brought my baby home from the hospital I also worried about him spitting up and it choking him but as the person above pointed out, they have an amazing gag reflex.  He’ll turn his head and spit up, even while asleep. If he has a pacifier, he’ll spit it out then spit up. They’re pretty instinctive from birth, It’s actually quite amazing to see.</p>
<p>Your pediatrician will also remind you on every visit to make sure they sleep on their back. They’re not strong enough to roll over from their stomach or turn their head if their face get stuck downward while laying on their stomach. </p></div>		</li>
