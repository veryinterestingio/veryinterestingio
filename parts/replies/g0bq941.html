			<div class="markdown"><p>If I recall correctly it's down to the way the ocean floor generally works. Whenever the ocean floor comes into contact with a continental crust, or another oceanic floor, the colder floor generally subducts first. Essentially most of the floor is younger than ~125 million because that's just about how long it takes for it to get cold, move around, and sink under something else. </p>
<p>In the Mediterranean situation it's an interaction between the continental plates that that the Mediterranean sits on. Africa is subducting up under Europe in that region, which is actually creating a mountain range (if it keeps up). This has happened before in the Himalayas, the Appalachians, the Andes, and the Alps. The difference is that those mountain ranges are mountain ranges now, and not sea floor!</p>
<p>TL;DR</p>
<p>The east Mediterranean is being smooshed up into a mountain range right now, but it's a very slow process, so it's not being allowed to subduct. Someday it might be a mountain range and then we wouldn't call it &quot;ocean floor&quot; anymore!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are mixing a couple of things. What you are describing as ocean floor is actually ocean crust and it is very different than continental crust which is lighter and generally older, but huge parts of continental crust are under sea level and thats what usually form mountain ranges when they are uplifted. Oceanic crust hardly ever (close to never) form mountain  ranges because is always heavier and subduct under continental crust.</p>
<p>What you see in the Mediterranean is the remanent of an ancient ocean called Thetys that formed by divergence. The further away from the divergence the older the material is, and thats what you see there.</p></div>		</li>
