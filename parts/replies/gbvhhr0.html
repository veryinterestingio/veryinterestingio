			<div class="markdown"><p>A big helping of this.</p>
<p>A lot of people suck at cooking vegetables, let their kids eat a ton of very sweet foods as a baseline, along with processed foods loaded up with salts and fats, and then try introducing broccoli once their kid is 4 years old and wonder why they won’t eat it.</p>
<p>Start kids out on veggies when they’re babies, limit their sweetened food intake, and learn to cook vegetables and kids will eat them just fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like a little bit of it is learned disgust. The parents who can't cook them properly probably don't like them either, and give off yuck vibes when trying to get the baby to eat. So the baby freaks out and resists, and now the veg has a negative connotation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And TV also perpetrates de idea that veggies are yucky. Kid's TV has (or at least used to have) a surprising amount of episodes with kids disliking veggies. I imagine the conclusion of the episodes were that they're not so bad, but that's not what stuck with me</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mum tells me when I was 1-2 all I would eat was spinach and potato. If she tried to feed me anything else, I wouldn’t eat it, and just demand ‘pinach’. Then at 3 I switched to pumpkin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. I mean my nieces flip out for candy, but they also LOVE broccoli and eat it (they ask for it!) every day. Also big fans of carrots and cucumbers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>100% this. If you can't cook of course food is going to taste bad. Nobody likes mushy vegetables boiled without an inch of their life. Not everything can be cooked just by sticking it in the oven at the highest heat and hoping for the best after 40min. </p>
<p>A huge part is definitely psychological. Kids who don't like veg often have parents who don't like veg. They learn what they see. If veg is a chore but McDonalds is a treat of course they're going to want more of the treat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. I've always wondered to what extent the &quot;kids don't like vegetables&quot; thing is cultural. As in, &quot;some cultures think salt is a spice.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
