			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;I already tried unplugging it and plugging it in, I don't want to do it again!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, but did you do it for the full 30 seconds? Why don't we try it again, juust to be sure.&quot; (that you're not lying through your teeth)</p>
<p>Half the time it's &quot;oh well I guess I can do that&quot; and half the time it's &quot;I don't have time for this I want you to fix it now!&quot;. But it's better than spending half an hour troubleshooting something that a reboot would have fixed. Not that I've ever done that &gt;.&gt;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One software I supported had a strange error that was always resolved with a reboot. Nearly every time I got a call for that error, I'd tell them that issue is usually resolved with a reboot, and the user would claim they'd already restarted their machine. </p>
<p>So I'd remote in, check their system's up time, confirm my suspicions that they actually hadn't rebooted for a good three week, then tell them I'd fixed it but it would require a reboot to take effect. Then suddenly they were quite on board with restarting their machine. </p>
<p>It was annoying, but it made me look competent so no complaints there.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Or maybe unplugging power is too &quot;hard&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's why I prefer to reboot my phone instead. Remember when the boss said an alarm goes off in her office whenever you hang up on someone? She lied.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;Did you press X button on the screen?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes&quot; <em>[They're lying]</em></p>
<p>&quot;OK, can you read me the words at the top then and I'll work on it from my end?&quot; <em>[not necessary, just forcing them to actually open the program now]</em></p>
<p><em>[long pause as they actually open the program and try to discretely press the button they lied about pressing earlier]</em></p>
<p>&quot;Oh it works now&quot;</p></div>		</li>
