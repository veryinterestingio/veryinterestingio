			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, there are two main different types of bankruptcies.</p>
<p>There's chapter 7, which is &quot;bankruptcy&quot; as most people know it - your assets get repossessed. Typically it's because they take out secured debt (mortgage, medical, credit card etc) and can't make the payments given their limited income. </p>
<p>Then there's chapter 11 or 13 which is a request to negotiate with their creditors to have more time to reorganize their finances. It's rare that their assets are held in cash - they are most often conceptual &quot;on paper wealth&quot; or IOUs. Businesses and high net worth individuals tend to use this. </p>
<p>For instance, it could just be a cash flow issue ie: they owe a creditor $1 million, but won't get their lump sum earnings of $3 million (from a client) until 3 months down the road - so they may ask for the creditors to wait 3 more months to make that $1m payment. The creditor may reply &quot;okay, I'll wait 3 months but only if you pay me $50,000 interest on top, so $1.05m&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also Chapter 13s and Chapter 7s are far more common than Chapter 11s, Chapter 11s are for business reorganization (and may end up with a liquidation anyway). Chapter 13 is for personal reorginazation.</p>
<p>There were 7,735 11s filed last year vs 290,566 13s and 480,933 7s filed in 2018, so it’s arguable whether a Chapter 11 is really one of the “main types of filings,” since it’s a ptetty specialized area in a already specialized field of legal practice.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not technically no, but in bankruptcy proceedings, they are allowed to put in a &quot;proof of claim&quot; to sell your personal possessions in order to clear the debt. Hence many people having to sell their home to clear medical debt etc. So essentially, your assets are implicitly imputed collateral, even if it's not formally &quot;secured debt&quot; ie: in a contract.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If I have a company and sell a million dollar product but only get $1 as a down payment, I now have a million dollar revenue company.  But I literally only have $1.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, but it's generally considered an extremely bad idea to run your business on those structures unless it's very small or you have a <em>really</em> good reason for it. Forming an LLC is a minimum for anything more thana hobby, and almost completely separates your finances from the company.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m in Ga, not all your personal assets are protected legally as a simple LLC. I made my business an S-Corp which creates a thicker wall. BUT, it has to also FUNCTION as an S Corp. I can’t legalize and register it as an S-Corp and then pay my personal credit cards with company check book and expect the legal defenses of being an S-Corp to withstand the scrutiny of a lawsuit or an IRS audit. It’s called “piercing the corporate veil”. I take a paycheck, complete with all withholding then after all business obligations and taxes are paid, I will write myself a profit check. A lot of small business people think they are protecting their personal money in the event of business default by forming corporations or LLCs but then they behave in a way that doesn’t separate corporation and personal income. It’s also true  99% of credit issued to small businesses has provisions in the contracts that allow creditors to go after personal assets of ownership regardless of corporate status. </p>
<p>Source - Small business owner that is the primary shareholder in an S-Corp and uses quite a bit of credit.</p>
<p>TDLR- can’t just call it a corporation has to actually  behave like a corporation. </p></div>		</li>
