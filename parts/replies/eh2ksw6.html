<p>These fuses are usually fitted up the bum of the bomb. On the top middle of the bomb is a little wind turbine that deploys when the bomb is dropped and the fuze won’t arm unless the bomb is travelling a minimum speed. On the nose you usually have a proximity sensor or solid nose that can be fitted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The little wind turbine doesn't exist for every bomb - when we drop just FMU-139's with a Mk-122 safety switch, for instance, the FMU-139 has a limited life.</p>
<p>It's actually quite simple and ingenious how the two work: the jet sends an electrical volt to the fuze for which setting it wants to use and the voltage only reaches the fuze if the Mk-122 safety switch is pulled.</p>
<p>The catch is that the safety switch is shorter than the wire that sends the signal, meaning the bomb can only be armed if the weapon falls free and clear of the jet (as the bomb falls, the safety switch is pulled first which allows the signal to pass to the bomb)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cool. Thanks for the info I never got to play with the safety switch you are talking about. Definitely simple alright. Not much to a bomb at all. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The safety switches are wired up to lanyards that are anchored to the jet. When the bomb drops free the lanyards break away and the bomb becomes armed.</p>
<p>This is the same mechanism that will do things like deploy the steering fins of PGMs. It's very rare, but it has happened that maintainers on the ground accidentally snagged a lanyard with a bomb loading truck and when pulling away, the lanyard broke and the fins deployed and it shattered a guy's arm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can either drop bombs from from 40000 feet or you can drop bombs from 1000 feet or around about; low level bombing (a pilot can feel free to correct me) in the case of dropping bombs from 1000 feet if you were to just drop them as is the bomb would almost keep up with the plane so that when it hits the ground you are very likely to damage your aircraft from shrapnel. So what they do is fit different tails to the bombs that slow them down as much as possible so the plane has time to get out of the way this is the reference to high drag you were seeing. As for the high altitude drops well you are too far away for it to matter so a low drag design is best. This is an example of a high drag tail <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/biker1337/6747034367" target="_blank">https://www.flickr.com/photos/biker1337/6747034367</a>. Interestingly they moved away from this design as they had a few incidences of the fins snapping off when deploying so they weren’t slowing down and they caused some damage to aircraft. </p></div>		</li>
