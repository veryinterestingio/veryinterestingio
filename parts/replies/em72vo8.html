			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm. I'm definitely no expert here but from what I know REM sleep is more about memory consolidation and neurotransmitter receptor sensitivities (during REM, we dramatically lower certain neurotransmitter levels like serotonin, making our receptors more ready to go OFF the when they are around). I think (think!) that REM sleep would not have any increase in glymphatic (trash river) activity. Actually, since REM sleep is a lighter stage of sleep it might even have the opposite effect. </p>
<p>Cool fact: REM sleep is the only sleep stage we can rebound (catch-up on sleep debt). We &quot;lose&quot; our preceding deep sleep stages with no opportunity for make-ups!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really interesting post. Can you expand on the inability to make up sleep debt for other stages of sleep? I skimmed the article, but you've inspired me to give up for now and go to bed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are four stages to sleeping. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The bottom or deepest level is deep sleep. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The next level up is oddly called “light sleep.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then you have REM. </p>
</li>
<li>Then you have “awake” (you’d be surprised how often you are up while sleeping). </li>
</ul>
<p>REM is what they credit as the sorting system. It is believed that this is where your mind processes all the information for the day and deposits it. It doesn’t help with “rest” but helps with memory/retention/creativity.  Oddly enough, REM is also the closest you are to “awake” when sleeping meaning that you can easily wake yourself or be woken when in REM stage, which suggest the sorting function requires some level of consciousness or near consciousness given that you’re so easily pulled out of it. </p>
<p>Deep sleep is what they credit for rest. An hour of deep sleep is a decent amount of deep sleep and can make you feel rested. Issue is it often takes 6-8 hours of sleep to get an hour or two of deep sleep.  If you sleep without getting deep sleep you will feel exhausted the next day. It’s scary but when you’re in “deep sleep” it’s actually quite difficult to wake someone up and impossible for the person himself to wake himself up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm interested in the &quot;awake&quot; sleep stage. I have never heard of this before, but I am frequently up during the night due to insomnia and/or mood problems, sometimes for hours. And a lot of time things I did seem just somehow different than how I perceived them at the time. Like I might write what I thought was a good reply to an email, then find it embarrassing in the morning. Stuff like that. I'm not sure how to most accurately Google this topic...do you happen to have any more info you could share with me?</p></div>		</li>
