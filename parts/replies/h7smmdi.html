			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a big overstatement. Unlike smaller RNA viruses, coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2 have a proofreading mechanism that slows down their mutation rate. You can find various differing estimates, but just to give an idea of the ballpark, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19818-2" target="_blank">this paper</a> from November 2020 &quot;informally estimated the mutation rate over our alignment as 9.8 × 10−4 substitutions per site per year&quot;. Since the virus genome is nearly 30,000 nucleotides long, that corresponds to only 30 changes over the course of a year.</p></div>		</li>
