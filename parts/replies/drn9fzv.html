			<div class="markdown"><p>How is this managed? Like how does the stomach know when to stop churning food and pass it through to the small intestines? Are there flaps/muscles which control this? And what if the stomach passed the food through without the acid being neutralised, would this cause considerable damage to the intestines or just straight up burn a hole in you?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Contains multiple things, bile acids; cholic acid, deoxycholic acid etc, HCO3^- bilirubin that all serve different functions.</p>
<p>Bile acids: emulsify fats so they can be absorbed in the gut. They also serve to help kill microbes </p>
<p>Alkali (bicarbonate IIRC): helps neutralise stomach acid </p>
<p>Bilirubin: excretion of old broken down red blood cells and may serve as an antioxidant. This gives the green colour of bile, and makes your poop brown. </p>
<p>Again very ELI5, but if you're interested checkout the enterohepatic circulation. </p>
<p>Lack of bile will cause failure of fat absorption, leading to a condition called steatorrhoea (literally fatty diarrhoea) where your poop is light, coloured, floats, loose, oily and very smelly; all basically as the fat stays in your but until it hits the bowl! </p>
<p>EDIT: most water passes through the gut and is mainly absorbed in the large bowel (colon) whereas the small bowel (mainly jejunum and ileum) are responsible for other nutrients. Pretty fascinating shit (excuse the pun) </p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't know much about bile, but from having gall stones I know it aids in digesting fats.</p></div>		</li>
