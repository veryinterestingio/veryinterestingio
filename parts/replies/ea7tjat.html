			<div class="markdown"><p>Purpose and meaning have a LOT to do with it. If you helped your family and community all day because you physically had to or they would all die, it's really hard to develop existential dread. You were constantly in the presence of other people doing the same thing, so you didn't have all that time to yourself to wonder about it. Depression is a bit of a privileged mental disease, and that's why it has a sort of stigma around it. It's still a very real, terrible issue but I find it helps me to think of it in this way. Puts it into perspective and makes it feel much smaller and less insidious.</p>
<p>People of the past still had it, but I don't believe it was exactly the same thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you expand on what you mean by 'privileged mental disease'? Im dealing with depression myself, and it's not a thought I've had before.</p>
<p>Just to be clear - I'm genuinely interested, not trying to string you up or anything. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I read that during ww2, they got some people who suffered from such bad depression that they were unable to do much, and gave them worthwhile jobs that contributed to the war effort.  The sense of purpose made their depression disappear very quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would add that an additional factor could be because the stigma on mental health is not as bad as before, that it's becoming easier to go to a therapist and get diagnosed and not worry about being judged. We discussed cases like HIV in class where the rise in cases of HIV is both because more people are having sex and the taboo is lower which means more people get tested for HIV and I assume it's the same with depression</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some people are citing Abraham Lincoln and poets but I don't think they understand that <em>at the time</em> they were beginning to benefit from a somewhat modern lifestyle.</p>
<p>In 2018 if you have severe depression you can claim disability and continue to eat and survive.</p>
<p>In the 1600s and all evolutionary points prior, if you had depression and didn't get out of bed to hunt then you or your family may starve to death.</p>
<p>Depression is actively selected against.</p>
<p>Depression is leftover from an unsatisfied reward center, normally triggered by successful hunts/eating/mating. Now these things are nearly a given in modern society. With this pressure off of life you then have the foundation to set yourself up for negative thought patterns. The more negative you think the more negative your brain becomes, like making a path through a field of grass. This is the basis of CBT, which aims to weaken negative thought patterns and strengthen positive ones until it is on autopilot.</p>
<p>Anxiety is leftover from an unstimulated fight or flight response. Normally triggered by wild animal or other humans being a threat to you. This caution is mostly removed in a modern society. As a result this evolutionary advantage of worrying/thinking ahead now appears when there is no real danger.</p>
<p>We aren't built for the privilege of modern life that makes up such a small part of the human timeline.</p></div>		</li>
