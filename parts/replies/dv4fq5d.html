			<div class="markdown"><p>Also I imagine that the plants they're growing are for scientific studies. Inconsistent sunlight due to orbit isn't the best thing from a scientific point of view. Much easier to use a light source of guaranteed duration / intensity and cut out as many unwanted variables as possible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Alaska summer is pretty much 24hrs of sunlight a day. People still farm during this time, basically it just means it's a shorter season i.e. The plants are ready for harvest much sooner. It's actually pretty interesting seeing the farms during summer. Although no one ever visits Alaska unless it is summer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the plant. An easy example would be poinsettias or marijuana which both require a set number of dark hours to induce flowering. If this darkness is interrupted by light for even a few minutes, it can start the process over again. </p>
<p>It’s also how a lot of fruiting plants know when to induce flowering if they don’t rely on temperature. The amount of light/darkness they get is basically their way of telling what time of year it is. There are three types of these plants (day neutral, long day, or short day plants) which all vary. An example would be something like blueberries or strawberries which would never flower in a 24-hour light scenario. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's probably worth noting one of the major issues with space craft is the accumulation of heat. Turning the craft towards the sun to intentionally collect that source of heat is probably a bad idea without a decent mechanism to radiate that heat away from the craft.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh. Is it due to necessary insulation trapping a lot of heat in certain conditions, or does heat just fundamentally not naturally escape due to heat not radiating from the hull in space?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the contrary, the heat can <em>only</em> radiate. Heat fundamentally can transfer one of three ways: conduction, convection, and radiation. Radiation is the only one of these that can affect an isolated system in a vacuum (I.e. a spacecraft), and is also the slowest by a significant amount. On earth, for example, almost all heat is transmitted through convection.</p>
<p>Thermal management in satellites is a fairly significant field of engineering, as the space environment tends to get both too cold and too hot to operate depending on your location in orbit, plus the repeated thermal cycling places a significant strain on the structure of the spacecraft.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The space station is basically the perfect thermos flask - no simple way to remove heat. Without additional measures, all the ISS can do is get hotter and hotter (internal equipment, the sun etc etc)</p>
<p>On Earth, your own body removes heat via evaporation into the air (or loses heat as the energy is transferred to the air). There is a medium which can transfer that energy one way or the other, in space, you have a literal vacuum.</p>
<p>The space station has a couple of options. The main approach is to radiate, this link explains further: <a href="https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/3702/does-the-iss-need-more-heating-or-more-cooling" target="_blank">https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/3702/does-the-iss-need-more-heating-or-more-cooling</a></p>
<p>In theory you could transfer the heat to water, and literally eject the payload - but you'd soon run out. </p>
<p>It's quite an interesting topic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On earth we generally control temperature through the air. This includes water cooling. In space normal water cooling methods don't work like they do on earth, and you'd just keep pumping hot water. There's no use in running a fan in a vacuum and radiators don't work like they do on earth (for the water cooling). I think there's ways of radiating heat in space, but I don't really understand how they work, or how effective they are compared to the ones we use on earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ISS and other spacecraft already turn their solar panels towards the sun intentionally, and have to deal with the consequences. Other than that it's more about the cross section exposed to the sun rather than the specific angle - unless the cross section exposed when turning plants towards the sun is greater than that exposed by turning the solar panels, it should be pretty much OK.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we used something like fiber optics, we could have an external module collect light, then run it to the plants. I guess if we added in a reflective IR filter on the exterior we might avoid excessive heat gains? Might be interesting on a dedicated system.</p></div>		</li>
