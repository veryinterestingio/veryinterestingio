<p>I can understand why, with a CVT, some people might feel that something is &quot;missing&quot;. But it's not just about &quot;liking&quot; it (of course some people do), it was also a necessity in a way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With a CVT (or a traditional automatic), you don't need to &quot;read the transmission&quot; at all. That's the whole point. When they add fake shifts to the CVT it has no benefit whatsoever, other than people &quot;liking it&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a whole deal more than simply &quot;liking it&quot;. With older folks like me who only drove and still drive manual there's a part that's engrained in your brain, also muscle memory that keeps telling you constantly &quot;something's off&quot;.</p>
<p>First time i drove an automatic i was still searching for the clutch pedal after a month. It gets that engrained.</p>
<p>Edit: Just so i'm clear, adding fake gear noise to a CVT seems silly to me too, people should get used to it but i bet subaru &amp; co have done their research.</p></div>		</li>
