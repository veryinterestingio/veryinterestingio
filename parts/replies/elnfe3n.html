			<div class="markdown"><p>Alex: The field of cell-based therapeutics is showing real clinical promise and hopefully will continue to.  Specifically, adoptive T cell therapies for cancer like CAR-T cells are already in clinical use for some liquid tumors (certain leukemias and lymphomas) and are being investigated for use in additional tumors.  T Cell Receptor therapy is similar to CAR-T cells and has the potential to target even more tumor types, but there is still work to be done before these can be widely applicable.  As with any technological breakthrough in medicine, the process of gathering evidence of clinical utility and benefit needs to be rigorously done, but Iâ€™m optimistic that this represents a new tool we have against cancer and ultimately many other diseases as well.</p></div>		</li>
