			<div class="markdown"><p>The general relativity formulation of gravity doesn't prohibit the existence of a negative mass:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_mass" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_mass</a></p>
<p>No fundamental laws of physics would be broken by a negative mass. </p>
<p>(If a negative mass were to exist, it could be used to block gravity in a roughly analogous way to how electromagnetic fields are blocked by Faraday cages)</p>
<p>At the end of the day gravity can't be blocked because we haven't found anything capable of blocking it. Someone could discover some exotic matter that manages to do it tomorrow (although, obviously, extremely unlikely). Nothing rules it out, as far as I know, just as nothing rules out fundamental physical constants changing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Particles with Negative Mass falls into the category of &quot;Not-Impossible.&quot; &quot;Not-Impossible&quot; has a heavy overlap with &quot;Possible,&quot; but the Venn Diagrams do not make a circle.</p>
<p>I'm not aware of any evidence that we've found something with Negative Mass. We just don't know of any fundamental Law of the Universe which says there <em>can't</em> be a particle with Negative Mass.</p>
<p>To analogize this to an okay 2000s movie: Just because there's no rule that says a dog <em>can't</em> play Basketball, that doesn't mean that there exists a rule saying a dog <em>can</em> play Basketball. It just says that this situation hasn't come up yet.</p>
<p>There's definitely value in exploring what might be possible if negative-mass particles exist, so that we can get off to a good start if we every find out that they <em>do</em> exist... but I don't think they're worth thinking about at the level of a lay-person explanation.</p></div>		</li>
