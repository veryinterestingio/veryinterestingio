			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd add to the above that Interest Rates are a response to uncertainty and/or a governments central banks attempt to influence the markets uncertainty.</p>
<p>If you want to borrow $N from me during a period of uncertain economic conditions I will charge you more in interest. Does not matter what you are doing there will always be an adjustment up in the rate.</p>
<p>Everything going great, economy moving along nicely the interest rate is lower.</p>
<p>The trick is finding the balance between the two. Which historically doesn't happen at all.</p>
<p>There is a rise in debt caused by low interest rates artificially inflating the value of X followed by a crash in the value of X when X is determined to be overvalued. As that happens interest rates go up warning the market to knock it off and then the leaders of the  exodus retreat just before everyone else gets the message.</p>
<p>Which causes a crash, which everyone who got out before the slump can use to buy under-valuated whatever at the new down point and here we go again!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is half the story, though.  You need to factor in prices and how they rise in response to higher demand and then fall with lower demand. As a result, your final &quot;repeat, repeat, repeat&quot; is not really true.  Prices fall to the point that demand equalizes with supply and the economy slowly digs itself out of the ditch.  Interest rates and prices fall as capacity/supply exceeds demand and borrowing is reduced. Businesses seek to get rid of excess inventory, pay off borrowing and raise cash. There are victims, to be sure, but the overall economy regenerates. It is a cycle, not a spiral.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true to some degree, but the &quot;regeneration&quot; of the economy can take decades and you suffer significant long-term damage in the meantime. Prices falling means wages falling, sticky wages means lay-offs, lay-offs and falling wages kills demand and causes bankruptcies, etc. etc. Deflationary spirals suck, even if they end eventually.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't disagree, here, but would say that a decades-long deflationary spiral is a very rare event, and I'm not aware of anyone forecasting such at least for this decade.  I am aware of a respected economic firm forecasting a depression for the 2030's due largely to excess worldwide government debt and fiscal mismanagement finally catching up to us. if you're interested in the analysis, have a look at <a href="https://itrondemand.com" target="_blank">itrondemand.com</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is there is way too much capital sitting right now, private equity and venture capitalists are using debt to fund their companies, keeping their primary funds on the side-lines.  They have so much cash they have no idea what to do with it, there are literally trillions of dollars hanging out.</p>
<p>It will be a bit painful to pull some of that money back into the economy, but letting cash leak out of the economy is causing more harm than a moderate increase in rates to reduce the amount of running companies on pure debt (where they just shutter it and let everyone go and not risk their actual funding).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Would this suggest that interest rates should be raised?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Before the pandemic would have been a sensible time, try to stop only using debt to fuel growth and get some of the free cash back into circulation.</p>
<p>Even those that are screaming that it would ruin everything know that is a complete lie, it just means they might actually have to use some of their reserves to fund growth... which is more like how it is supposed to work.</p></div>		</li>
