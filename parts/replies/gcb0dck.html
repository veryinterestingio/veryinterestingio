			<div class="markdown"><p>Birds are especially notorious for this. In the wild, birds would be prey so any sign of injury or illness would make them a target to predators. So they hide any symptoms EXCEPTIONALLY well. Most of the time, the first hint something is wrong is they're lying dead in their cage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I watched a youtube video from a guy that owns toucans. He was recounting how his toucan died.</p>
<p>He said everything was totally fine. He noticed her laying down, but that's a thing toucans do. They lay funny to sun themselves. Still, something felt weird, so he inspected the bird. She was slightly less energetic than usual. Seemed to have trouble hopping up onto her perch.</p>
<p>He rushed her to the nearest emergency vet in a panic, but it was too late. She was dead a few minutes after he got there.</p>
<p>(For anyone wondering: Turns out the breeder he'd gotten her from lied about the quality of care they gave, and it was an absolute miracle she lived as long as she did after that.)</p>
<p>It's crazy to me how fast it all went.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is hilarious because my husky/gs mix whines and growls if he’s too sleepy and needs tucked into bed. He also doesn’t like gravel under his paws. He talks and talks and talks before finally trying to jump over the gravel, just to land on...gravel. Only to repeat the process until he’s done walking through it! He’s the dog version of your cat</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a big dog that is all about the theatrics too lol. Every minor thing is treated as some sort of slight or disrespect (no room for her on the couch? INJUSTICE! Wide eyed disbelief, whining, pacing, storming off dramatically to bed, the whole works). The scene she makes when she knows she's going to the vet is next level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You know what, though?  On the whole, the giant breed dogs I run into at the dog park with my dog are some of the most well-trained and gentle dogs there.  It's almost like you really <em>have</em> to train those dogs well, and start young, because there's no way in hell a typical 150-180lb human is going to be able to physically restrain a 150lb dog from doing anything the dog really wants to do. :P</p>
<p>I have absolutely 0 problem with her wanting to play with a 100+lb dog because of this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. My cat passed away this morning, but only until yesterday he showed signs that he was bad. He was always following us around the house as usual and suddenly yesterday he started to puke, but he didn't want to eat anything, we took him to the vet that took a blood test, and told us to keep him drinking water. He still refused to eat or drink and was just sitting and looking down. </p>
<p>Then we took him back to the vet and kept him there for the night. The lab results showed that he was very bad, maybe even before we picked him up from the street, but he was always looking alright until yesterday. Couldn't have known he was that bad.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Either of those, you better haul ass to the vet and get tests done before the cat self destructs.</p></div>		</li>

My girl is super food focused, I know immediately something's wrong if she's 1) not screaming at me for food before it's time and 2) not eating at the speed of light. Oh and weight.

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm so sorry to hear that. It can be so fast with cats, by the time they show it it's usually too late.</p>
<p>I nearly lost a cat that way. The only sign that something was wrong at first was that he was sitting. Normally when he came to greet me he'd stand, walk around, rub on my legs, etc. But that day he walked over to me and sat down. Any time he wasn't actively walking somewhere, he'd immediately sit.</p>
<p>He stopped drinking that night and became so weak that he fell off my bed and landed on his side. But by then we'd gotten some cat antibiotics in him (force fed, no fun for anyone) and he ended up pulled through. We basically had a party when he was well enough to drink again.</p></div>		</li>
