			<div class="markdown"><p>In the three-stage version, yes. There are also two-stage versions where the fusion explosion contributes to more complete fission of the initial fissionable material. Percent explosive yield per reaction type within a single bomb depends on the style of bomb.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>in addition to that, the trigger first stage is usually &quot;boosted&quot; with fusion allready. Whats happening is that in the very center of the fission first stage is a small Reservoir of hydrogen. When the fission reaction occurs, the hydrogen undergoes fusion due to the heat and pressure and releases a so called neutron shower. Lots of neutrons get released which in turn boost the initial fusion stage.
so technically its a fission-fusion-fission-fusion-fission reaction. but the first fission-fusion-fission reaction is usually just condensed to as just the first fission part of fission-fusion-fission.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The latter fission reactions are not a result of the heat and pressure created by the secondary but rather the neutron flux from the fusion reactions. These neutrons are sufficiently high energy to cause fission in U-238, which is convenient because you donâ€™t have to use enriched uranium. Uranium is used to make the tamper that compresses the secondary because it is dense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Importantly, this U238 fission is not due to chain reaction and doesnt require all the engineering necessary to get it. The first H bomb, Ivy Mike, got 85% of its 10 MT yield from fissioning its U238 tamper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>not entirely correct, but mostly it is believed that modern thermonuclear warheads all work like that.
But the yield of a fission-fusion only bomb is unlimited allready. In fact, the most powerful of such devices ever tested (Tsar Bomb <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsar_Bomba" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsar_Bomba</a>) did not include a 3rd fission stage at all due to environmental concerns.</p>
<p>The Yield is entirely achievable with only the fusion second stage, the reason why fission is used in a third stage is because its easy to do and you need some kind of containment anyway. So why not just use fissle material to further increase the yield.</p>
<p>At least thats how I understood it.
Feel free to correct me.</p>
<p>Here is a very interessting lecture about the desing of nuclear weapons:
