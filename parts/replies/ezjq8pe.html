			<div class="markdown"><p>Infinite, but only if you let the pattern continue indefinitely or use ever smaller divisions of a beat. So long as you put sensible limits on that (e.g only using up to four bars of 4/4, and don't use anything shorter than a 1/16th or 1/32nd note), there are a finite number of combinations possible that would realistically end up in someone else's music. A lot, certainly, but I imagine a normal home computer would be able to iterate across them all in a reasonable amount of time. Even if it took a few weeks to go through it all, that wouldn't be too bad. One could then spend a small amount of money for subscription to a DRM service and uploading it to streaming platforms and let the copyright trolling begin.</p>
<p>EDIT: Did some calculations. Permutations really do get big quite quickly.  Looks like sticking to 16th notes for two bars is the only sensible way of calculating every permutation of 12 notes. I figure there are about 10^11 permutations of that which at a billion results per second (I estimate that's probably as much as a consumer grade computer could do) would take three years. But if you decide to just go for one bar of 16th notes to create the melodies then you'd be looking at ten days at a million results per second.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose. But that's just for beats. You then have to consider melodies, and harmonies, and layering different instruments together. And there is an infinite number of notes and timbres, for each instrument.</p>
<p>Then you consider left-right panning/mixing, and effects, and you have infinity raised to the power of however many variables you have.</p></div>		</li>
