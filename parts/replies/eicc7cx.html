			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually aldehyde dehydrogenase, the enzyme responsible for the second step of alcohol metabolism, causes Asian flush. </p>
<p>ADH converts ethanol to acetaldehyde. ALDH converts acetaldehyde to acetic acid.
Acetaldehyde is responsible for the flushing and many Asians have a mutant, defective version of ALDH so acetaldehyde builds up following a single drink. Most will avoid alcohol because it’s very unpleasant.</p>
<p>There is an FDA approved drug for alcoholism that inhibits ALDH leading to immediate and very unpleasant (hangover like) symptoms if one continues to drink while taking it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Acetaldehyde causes hangover-like symptoms because, along with poor sleep and dehydration, it actually is the reason you feel hung over after drinking. It will cause anxiety, racing heart, headache,   and nausea. Acetaldehyde buildup is also responsible for much of the increased cancer and cardiovascular risk associated with heavy alcohol consumption.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, I'm Korean and this happens to me. It varies pretty widely too, based on what I've eaten, when, speed of alcohol consumption etc. Things I've experienced (either together or separately) are headache, rapid heartbeat, itchy skin (probably induced by the flushing), mild trouble breathing, nasal congestion. Yeah, not pleasant. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The worst and most dangerous detox is alcohol. The only thing close is Benzo detox.  </p>
<p>Alcoholics coming off  are just wrecked for the first 3 days, generally after that we start to see them feeling better, but that initial 72 hours is literally what hell must be like.</p>
<p>The highest BAC I have encountered in my job was a mid 50’s male, hardcore lifestyle alcoholic for 35 years... his BAC was 0.51%</p>
<p>Legally drunk is 0.08% so he was 6 and a half times over the legal limit....</p></div>		</li>

<p>On the other hand, during that same period, I used to join patients in the smoking room down the hall and bum a cigarette off them. Things have changed a lot!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i went to rehab. they told me to keep drinking that night because i couldnt be admitted until the next day.</p>
<p>they gave me a few different medications that made detox smooth as hell. i had been drinking a standard 750ml bottle of vodka every day basically, sometimes more. i cant remember the medications, someone might be able to chime in. i also had meds to help me sleep and some for anxiety. honestly detox kinda felt alright besides being tired and not getting to go outside more than twice a day</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add a layer to this, psychologically....There is also considerable evidence that this tolerance is somewhat state-dependent. Your body starts to prep for consumption when the conditions for consumption are familiar. E.g. You enter your usual bar, pull up to 7-eleven to grab a twelver, and even arriving at home after work. Your physical location/situation influences your ability to tolerate consumption. This is thought to be why so many famous people die of overdose while traveling/on tour. Their friends swear that they didn’t have any more than usual, and they are probably correct. Their body just wasn’t prepped in time because the location/situation was novel enough that the cues to prepare for the dosage were missing.
It works the same in reverse: trying to abstain. Even smokers find its easy to quit having moved to a new place. And yet, upon returning to their old haunts (even decades later) they find it difficult to abstain. The evidence suggests that certain places (and even certain people) can cause these underlying physical changes to actuate which, in turn, can lead to mental cravings. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I came across this at university and studied it in some depth, so I can corroborate what he's saying - definitely studied in the literature more widely than that article implies (it seems to indicate it's a limited field of research by one researcher).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jsad.com/doi/abs/10.15288/jsa.1990.51.494" target="_blank">https://www.jsad.com/doi/abs/10.15288/jsa.1990.51.494</a> is a peer-reviewed source on this and a related phenomenon also mentioned by the poster you're replying to (environmental triggers for cravings).</p>
<p>It's applicable to both alcohol and other drugs, and I recall that usage in an unfamiliar environment is also a major factor in opiate overdose.</p>
<p><a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/216/4544/436" target="_blank">http://science.sciencemag.org/content/216/4544/436</a> is an old paper on environmental tolerance as a contributing factor to heroin overdose, so it's a well-established finding. </p></div>		</li>

<p>There is also a study I found once that talks about how rats can be given the same dose of alcohol in two different environments, and that the dose can turn out to be lethal in an unfamiliar environment but not lethal in a familiar environment. I couldn't find that same study, but the one above talks about this effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The quickest I could find was the statement in this ‘article’ citing a Harvard study. “The hippocampus and the amygdala store information about environmental cues associated with the desired substance, so that it can be located again. These memories help create a conditioned response—intense craving—whenever the person encounters those environmental cues” <a href="https://www.helpguide.org/harvard/how-addiction-hijacks-the-brain.htm/" target="_blank">https://www.helpguide.org/harvard/how-addiction-hijacks-the-brain.htm/</a>
I remember it from my undergraduate psych coursework. A lecture titled “Sex, Drugs, and Rock-n-Roll”. My professor was a principal on a related study at Columbia on cigarette addiction. Sorry, can’t seem to find that one. </p></div>		</li>
