Our species, as a whole, is defeating the environment, which is the pinnacle of evolution.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In all honesty, I think it's about exposure and in moderation. I developed seasonal allergies, both spring and fall in my 20's. At age 34 I decided I've had enough and wanted to get shots. What do they do? Inject me with the shit I'm allergic to! The complete ban of nuts in schools is only going to continue making things worse</p></div>		</li>
