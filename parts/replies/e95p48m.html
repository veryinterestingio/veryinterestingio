			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a WSB post recently about a guy who overheard a lunch meeting between two people discussing one of their employers purchasing the other. He snapped a photo, determined the people were legit by LinkedIn stalking them and bought stock accordingly. The merger was announced the following week and he made a lot of money. </p>
<p>Where does the law fall on that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Almost certainly not insider trading (not legal advice, tho).  There was a similar(ish) case where a couple of yard workers at a railyard saw a bunch of guys in suits walking around.  They eventually pieced together that the railroad was gonna get bought out and bought a bunch of options and made big $$.  </p>
<p>The SEC pressed charges but lost the case.  See <a href="https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/10/01/s-e-c-charges-railroad-workers-with-insider-trading/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.secactions.com/jury-rejects-aggressive-sec-insider-trading-claims/" target="_blank">here</a>.  </p>
<p>The situation you brought up is even weaker than the railyard case b/c the guy that was listening wasn't even a LinkedIn employee.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great citation, there. </p>
<p>For the benefit of other readers, here's the counter-intuitive part &gt;&quot;there is no statute or regulation that expressly prohibits insider trading. &quot;</p>
<p>It goes on to state that the crime is actually the breach of duty by the person with inside info.</p>
<p>Huh. Guess you learn something new every day. </p></div>		</li>
