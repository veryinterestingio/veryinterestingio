			<div class="markdown"><p>So much inaccurate and just plain wrong info posted here. The truth is, saturated fat is not bad for you. Saturated fat was vilified by “research” by “Dr.” Keys (I think that is his name). It is well known that he cherry picked his data to get the result that fat consumption is associated with higher risk of heart disease. It is also well known that the inclusion of the rest of his data actually shows the opposite... increase of saturated fat in the diet is associated with lower rates of heart disease. Unfortunately, big lobbyist and big money are so invested in the current agricultural system (humongous money is at stake) that they control the narrative through media and by funding biased “research”. </p>
<p>If you look at research that is neutrally funded, conducts the experiment properly (accounts for healthy user bias, does not rely on participant memory, properly and correctly accounts for macronutrient intake), you will see consistently that saturated fat is not associated with increased heart disease. In fact, it is associated with a decreased risk. </p>
<p>Look at heart disease rates in the US. In the 70s and 80s, as Keys false “research” began to influence how people ate, saturated fat intake drops to present day, sugar (carbs) intake rises to present day, and heart disease rates rises to present day... yet fat is still to blame...</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our medical professionals our trained incorrectly when it comes to diets. Across the board, doctors do not have time to read research, let alone sift through and find the quality papers. They are also afraid of getting sued. So if they go along with the narrative they were given, they avoid risk. </p>
<p>Saturated fat is actually less prone to oxidative damage than monounsaturated fats (polyunsaturated fats are the most prone to oxidative damage, and are ironically recommended for your consumption. Most polyunsaturated fats are produced in extremely harsh environments because it’s cheap, so right out of the bottle you are getting extremely oxidized fats). Oxidative damage in lipid proteins is a huge factor in heart disease, as it leads to inflammation. Inflammation is linked to every single modern disease (cancer, heart disease, etc). </p>
<p>There is an asterisk here. The quality research does suggest that people that have metabolic issues (caused by eating too many carbs and processed foods) may not be able to properly handle higher quantities of saturated fat. </p>
<p>Think about this. Your body has evolved to store excess energy as fat. Not just fat, but saturated fat. When you go a few hours without eating between meals or when you are sleeping, your body is metabolizing saturated fat in the same manner it would as if you were eating it from a meal. If that caused heart disease, humans would not have made it very far...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This, IMHO, is a good video arguing (correctly) that saturated fat is indeed bad for you... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsVApece-Yw" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsVApece-Yw</a></p>
<p>Here is a 55 second WebMD video summarizing the same point... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okxk5WbG3Gc" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okxk5WbG3Gc</a></p>
<p>WebMD is a pretty good source of info on this.  The first video cites a number of Harvard scientists as well.</p>
<p>And there is this from Harvard... <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-truth-about-fats-bad-and-good" target="_blank">https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-truth-about-fats-bad-and-good</a></p></div>		</li>
