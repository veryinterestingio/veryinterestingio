<p>Well, if you make jam yourself you use, fruits, sugar, maybe lemons or other sour fruit. It's not all that different, fruits and sugar are things which makes most of both of them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>sugar is a very good desiccant</p>
<p>honey is about 80-90% sugar, Jam is about 40-50%. Jams contain other carbohydrates that are not as good a desiccant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it would stop being honey long before and become dilute sugar water. Also, once the exposed surface area of a blob of honey is covered by a thin layer of dead bacteria, how would the osmosis continue? You'd have to paint a football field or something with a micrometer layer of honey have enough surface area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd need enough microbes that their collective mass was several times greater than the honey's mass. I'm not entirely sure what that would look like, but I'm pretty sure I don't want to find out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify, honey doesn't kill off the spores of some bacterial. So although there will be no living bacteria in it, the honey could still potentially carry a bacterial load within it. This is why you're not supposed to feed infants honey.</p></div>		</li>
