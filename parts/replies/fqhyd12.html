			<div class="markdown"><p>Just for clarity, there isn't some force restricting the speed of objects in the solar system. If there was an object doing 41km/s and we stick a rocket pack on it and accelerate it by an additional 2km/s on the same trajectory, it would then be doing 43km/s. What will have changed is the shape of the orbit, extending the high point so much that the Sun's gravity loses it. </p>
<p>Orbit is just falling with enough sideways velocity to <em>miss the ground</em>.  </p>
<p>Think of it like throwing a stone forwards, harder and harder.<br />
The arc of that stone's path forms a curve.<br />
You throw it directly forwards, not up.<br />
You have unlimited strength (and we will ignore air resistance) and throw the stone ever harder. With every successive throw the portion of the arc that is parallel to the ground is longer and longer, the impact point further and further away. Eventually, you would throw the stone beyond the horizon, with the arc curving along with the curve of the Earth. With more strength, the stone would land on the far side of the world. More again and you hit yourself in the back with it (we're also ignoring mountains here). </p>
<p>This time, you duck when it comes around.</p>
<p>The stone circles our airless, smooth Earth and whizzes over your head. With no air resistance to slow it, it carries on at the same speed, with gravity speeding it downwards equally for every bit of sideways speed it robs. At exactly the right speed, this trade off can keep it at a constant height above the surface and it traces a perfectly circular path around the world.</p>
<p>It's in orbit.</p>
<p>The slow/fall tradeoff is in such perfect balance that by the time the stone reaches the far side, gravity has fully reversed the stone 180° and flipped its vector compared to launch, so it's got the same force behind it all the way around as it did when you threw it.</p>
<p>Your super human strength allows you to grab it out of this ultra low orbit despite it hitting your hand like a crate of TNT.</p>
<p>You throw it harder again.</p>
<p>As you watch it disappear beyond the horizon, it is arcing <em>upwards</em> slightly compared to previous throws. The path traced by the orbit is now <em>higher</em> on the <em>opposite side of the planet</em>, but it loses so much speed getting up to that height that gravity pulls it low again and it whizzes by your head at the same height as before, but took a bit longer to get back and is traveling faster (the same speed you threw it at). </p>
<p>Keep chucking it faster and it will keep raising the far side of the orbit and taking longer and longer to come back (raising the orbit like this is how we sent people to the Moon).</p>
<p>You could grow old incrementing the speed and waiting longer and longer for your next throw, until eventually the far side height is rising so much more with each successive throw that the stone has more speed than gravity can rob from it  and never comes back, with the height of the high point of the orbit (and the time taken to complete an orbit) tending towards infinity. If the direction it gets flung off in is carefully planned, it could encounter another gravity well and fall into orbit. This is how we will send people to Mars.</p>
<p>You now understand orbital mechanics to a basic degree. I recommend Kerbal Space Program for the rest :)</p>
<p>42km/s is just the fastest that something can be traveling about the Sun and still loop around. If its going faster than that, it'll fly by, and it's never coming back.
This is how we'll travel to some of the other nearby stars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does there need to be a ‘something else’? If all that existed in the universe was our solar system and a vast nothingness, and I could throw a rock 50km/s, would it still leave the sun’s sphere of influence, or would it come back eventually?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have a very nice analogy but right at the end you're introducing an issue.  You said &quot;eventually the far side height is so high that the stone gets distracted by the gravity of something else up there&quot;. But that's not actually what happens. What happens is at a thrown speed of 42km/s (from the Sun), the &quot;high point&quot; actually becomes infinite.  So the &quot;orbit&quot; is no longer a circle. It actually will follow a parabolic shape and go off toward infinity (and naturally never return).  There's no need for your crate to get pulled out of orbit by some other star.  It has reached escape velocity and will not return.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's already taken into account. 42km/s of max object speed plus 30km/s of Earth speed.</p>
<p>With same direction orbits it would only be 42-30 = 12 km/s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of a shame nothing has happened beyond initial feasibility studies about sending a probe to it.  It's not like you get that sort of chance very often.  There are still a few potential launches in 2030 and 2033, though, which I wish we were considering more seriously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We've already seen one more: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_object#2I/Borisov" target="_blank">2I/Borisov</a>, and our calculations show that there should be many of these things within the sphere of the solar system. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-STARRS" target="_blank">Pan-STARRS</a> telescope program should be able to find many more of these objects if they exist.</p>
<p>Also, to say that it 'fell' into the solar system is missing the most interesting part. It's basically sitting still from the perspective of our 'local standard of rest' (the average velocities of our galactic neighbourhood), so you could say we are 'sweeping past' it.</p>
<p>If you haven't heard <a href="https://after-on.com/episodes-31-60/040" target="_blank">Avi Loeb talk about 'Oumuamua</a>, it's definitely worth a listen!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With a few gravitational assists something small and fast can change directions in ways that planets usually cannot, and there are extra-solar asteroids as well.</p>
<p>It's really, really hard to assign a specific probability to the odds of a collision with Earth, but it would probably be &quot;less&quot; likely to be head-on than otherwise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gravitational assists are a rare thing in nature. It's the gravitational equivalent of bouncing off a planet, from the direction the planet is going to. A tiny little planet in the vast emptiness of space. And hitting it from the wrong side will slow you down. </p>
<p>The craft we launch from Earth need precise launch timing and multiple course corrections to hit their boosts.</p></div>		</li>

I don't mean gravitational force, but gravity, like how much it's bending space around it, I don't know if I'm explaining myself. Like, is there a measure unit for that? How much something bends space's fabric?</p></div>		</li>
