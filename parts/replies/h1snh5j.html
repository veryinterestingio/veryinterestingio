			<div class="markdown"><p>Hyenas were though to be hermaphrodites for a while, turns out that wasn't the case. It just so happens that females are the leaders (matriarchal creatures) and the females evolved huge penis-sized clitoris in response. Females are more muscular, aggressive, and dominant than males, and females outrank males consistently.</p>
<p>Their vaginal opening merges with their urethral passage, allowing passage of pee and anything from and to the vagina through the same passage. This whole system means that in order for a female to be able to reproduce, she must willingly hold any desire and retract the tip of her pseudo-penis inwards, at which point the male may scuttle underneath her (the positioning is higher in the stomach, so it can't be reached from behind) and put themselves, so that the female may push themselves bringing the male penis inside their pseudo-penis, at which point the male may ejaculate inside. You gotta give it to nature, it really gives even the more fucked up furry porn humans have imagined a run for its money.</p>
<p>When females give birth the baby comes out through the pseudo-penis. The process is as painful as, well, passing a whole baby through your penis. The result leaves the pseudopenis permanently desfigured, which is necessary to help the baby make it through the next time. About 60% of the first babies die because of how brutal the whole affair is, and 15% of the time the mother dies.</p>
<p>Still not the most fucked up &quot;normal&quot; way of reproduction in the animal kingdom though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><h1>Hyaena clitorises!</h1>
<p>My time to shine...</p>
<p>So, yes, the females do have things that look a lot like a penis, but lets call a spade a spade, or a clitoris a clitoris! Because that's what it is. Due to very high levels of testosterone in spotted hyaenas, particularly during gestation (but also the first two years after birth), the formation of genitalia in males and females doesn't diverge until later in the process so they're physically similar and it's very difficult to tell the difference between the sexes (and is actually the primary source of their derision, but more on that later). And due to this elevated testosterone, females are also utterly dominant over the males.</p>
<p>As well as these enlarged clitorises, that are the Swiss Army knives of genitalia, their external labia have also fused together and look a lot like a scrotum. Further adding to the confusion.</p>
<p>Now, when it's time to mate, the female gets an erection in this clitoris (that are pretty much the same size and shape as a penis) and she will 'flip' it against her chest to express arousal if a male signals interest (remember again that it is the females that call the shots). The female will then <em>invert</em> the clitoris (after a mutual inspection of each other's genitalia) before copulation so that it becomes a functional vagina, and she will later give birth <em>through</em> the clitoris (almost always to twins) causing it to rupture and split. </p>
<p>The large pink keloid <a href="http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/50689000/jpg/\_50689886\_guccigrtcartercropped.jpg" target="_blank">scar</a> (SFW) this leaves (if the mother doesn't die from blood loss) is the simplest way to tell males from females. Mother mortality is 9-18% and infant mortality can be as high as 60%.</p>
<p>As for their derision, it is again because of the clitoris confusion and it's the Victorians' fault.</p>
<p>Back in the day, homophobia was especially prevalent in Victorian-era society. That generation were also the first to go on leisure safaris and, importantly, the first to introduce mass education. So, when some of these holidaying homophobes saw what they thought were two males fornicating, not only were they shocked but they went home and told everyone in all the classrooms and the negative connotations in western society were seeded.</p>
<p>In addition, local folklore often depicts hyaenas as witches or as the favoured method of transport of witches (much better at handling the terrain than broomsticks). The Lion King also really didn't really help.</p>
<p>And since I've got your attention, here are a few more popular misconceptions about spotted hyaenas.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They are not scavengers - close to 90% of their food is hunted. They love a free meal (carrion) like anyone else but they almost always hunt. And they are very good at it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are not nocturnal - they are <em>crepuscular</em> meaning they are most active at dawn and dusk, rather than through the night.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despite their shape, they are more closely related to cats than dogs as they are part of the Feliformia ('cat-like') carnivore suborder.</p>
</li>
<li>They are not stupid but incredibly intelligent cooperative hunters that have displayed problem-solving abilities on par with the Great Apes.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you've any more questions, fire ahead. I worked with these guys and I'm very fond of them.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a pretty good question and one that's still being studied.</p>
<p>In terms of splitting clitorises, I'm not aware of any other species that give birth in this way. The size and shape of the clitorises (and their similarity to penises) is likely due to the testosterone during in-womb development, but, as fascinating as these very novel hormone levels are, the subject is chronically under-researched!</p>
<p>In terms of near relatives, there are obviously spotted, striped and brown hyaenas, but their family (Hyaenidae) also includes the aardwolf, and beyond that, it would be mongooses and civets!</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>No, they can give birth many times and the mortality rate decreases after the initial split! Deaths still happen, but the scar is weaker tissue so it ruptures more easily!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why do you work with hyenas?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I got into them as an 'outgroup' to compare with the monkeys that I was already working with. Their social structure is similar to many primate species. I also just really wanted to work with social carnivores!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What do they hunt, and what about their hunting makes you say they are &quot;smart&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They will tackle just about anything within reason (megafauna like elephants are not on the 'live' menu). Now, they primarily hunt alone, in which case they will target smaller ungulates (antelope etc.) and smaller mammals, reptiles, amphibians, but in groups they can go after larger ungulates like zebra, kudu, and their hunting success rate also goes up if more are working together.</p>
<p>In terms of their intelligence, there are four levels of cooperative hunting observed in animals, and spotted hyaenas operate at the second highest because they coordinate their actions in response to those alongside them, rather than simply chase the same thing by random chance (1st level), or collectively initiate a chase of the same thing at the same time (2nd level). The highest level involves specific roles within the group, which hyaenas do not demonstrate, but their coordination is nonetheless very impressive and more experienced hyaenas will moderate their behaviour to accommodate the younger or less experienced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This would seem like the logical progression, solid answer. I would also just add that evolution is fluid and not every adaptation we see today is the end state of a species. One other thing to consider is that if hyenas give birth only once or twice per lifespan, maternal mortality has a diminished effect on genetic drift (my terminology may be wrong, it's been a while).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can go one further and just say it's impossible. Rape doesn't exist in spotted hyaenas.</p>
<p>Also, it's not the best males but the oldest. Whilst the females have the normal competitions to establish dominance, the males 'queue' based on when they joined the clan.</p>
<p>Spotted hyaena have what's called a 'fission-fusion' society, meaning that once males reach sexual maturity they leave the clan they were born into (they have standards) and join another. Rank amongst males is then <a href="https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/12/5/558/311674?login=true" target="_blank">simply determined by when they joined</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a trade off going on, since bigger brains at birth are important but hips being adapted for energy efficient walking is also really important.  The two are in opposition, and that puts some constraints on how easy births can be.</p>
<p>That said, people do have adaptations to get around these problems.  Very unusually for mammals (and really any species) we don't give birth in isolation but pretty much always have someone else around to midwife in basically every society.  That's an adaptation that lets us get through more difficult births more successfully.  Our infants are also born at an earlier stage in development, letting them cram in more brain development outside the womb, which allows for an easier birth than being born with an even larger head.</p></div>		</li>
