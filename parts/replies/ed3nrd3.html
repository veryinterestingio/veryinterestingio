<p>Germany should be called Deutschland but is called Germany in English and Allemagne in French, due to those names become fixed before strong international trade between the nation states could spread the name Deutschland.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The name Germany predates any single nation state - it derives from the general geographic area as described by the Romans (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germania" target="_blank">Germania</a>). People from neighbouring tribes/kingdoms/empires and ultimately nation states have been trading and otherwise interacting with people from this area long before any nation state existed.</p>
<p>So it's not that Germany got its English name because people from England never had any contact with people from Germany - it's that people from a bunch of other places (including what is now the UK) started interacting with people from Germany long before a single political entity existed in that region that could name itself. A unified nation state occupying similar territory to the nation state we now call Germany (albeit not continuously) has only existed since 1871.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, Germany is a bit of a weird case when it comes to translations. Some will use the Germanic tribes as a basis, some use another tribe and have Allemagne, then other languages use something with Sax- or Saks- from yet another tribe.
“Deutschland” is basically the Land of the “Deutsch” which IIRC comes from another word that just means something like “the people”.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, I was born in '91, and it's always been Japan in written and spoken language that was produced around or a little before the 90's or after I was born. </p>
<p>But I'm into old TV shows, and one of my older favorites is Mchales Navy, which was produced in the 50's and focused on WWII in the Asian/Pacific I believe, following a PT boat crew run by Mchale. </p>
<p>The character Mchale often calls it Nippon and the Japanese Nipponese, though sometimes they've referred to them as Japs or Japanese (so it's not due to any sort of attempt at being &quot;PC&quot; in the 50's). </p>
<p>I still wonder if Nippon was used because the navy base Mchale was stationed out of in the TV show was in/near Asia, and such he'd have come across many people in countries who knew Japan as &quot;Nippon&quot;, or if that was a common interchangeable term used around WWII?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two valid pronunciations of the country name in Japanese:  &quot;Nihon&quot; or &quot;Nippon.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nippon,&quot; with its harder, more masculine glottal stop, became more popular after the Meiji Restoration and up through WW2, as Japan became to think of itself more of a conquering empire.  The formal name of the country, &quot;dai nippon teikoku&quot; (Great Empire of Japan) always used the -ppon pronunciation by convention.  As such, referring to the country as &quot;Nippon&quot; came to have a vaguely militaristic and right-wing sound.  That is the one that American service members in the Pacific encountered most often, because it's what Japanese service members and those they conquered used.</p>
<p>Since the end of the war, &quot;Nihon&quot; has been generally preferred by default, especially by younger generations, and  &quot;Nippon&quot; has gradually fallen out of favor.  Because of this, it can sometimes carry a vaguely eyebrow-raising statement of implied nationalism if not being used in say, an actual historical reference.  You'd almost expect someone who still calls it that to also still wave around a copy of the old many-rayed rising sun flag / naval ensign instead of the modern, simple red dot.  Much like the affect that waving around a Confederate/rebel flag might have in the US.</p>
<p>That being said, there are still many government branches, older public/private companies, banks, etc. that date from back when Nippon was more common, and still use that pronunciation for historical purposes without any implied political statement.  Just because it’d be a pain in the ass to change and probably start a political fight that nobody really thinks is worth it.</p>
<p>The term &quot;Japan&quot; is the English hard-J and short-A mispronunciation of the Portuguese transliteration through trading routes of the Chinese attempt to write a term they (possibly) imported from Korean for the islands off Korea's eastern coast, where they assumed the sun came from in the morning.  Originally the Chinese term for the country was &quot;Wa,&quot; and later &quot;Yamato” (“Greater Wa”) but Japanese found the Chinese written meaning offensive and pushed for Nihon/Nippon instead.  No one is entirely sure who came up with it first, but the &quot;sun&quot; term was conveniently aligned with Shinto teachings, so Japan was all too happy to use it.</p>
<p>There was never really an opportunity to &quot;close the loop&quot; and short-circuit the various mispronunciations and transliterations by asking the Japanese directly, because by the time the term came to be used in English, Japan had mostly closed itself off to foreign trade for several hundred years, and by the time it re-opened, &quot;Japan&quot; had been used for so long that we were stuck with it.  Contrast that with Japan's terms for other countries like Deutschland, which are usually much closer to their native pronunciations because they were flooded with them directly and rather recently.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Might just be that individual's own idiosyncrasy to refer to Japan as &quot;Nippon&quot; if he knows a little Japanese. I learned some Chinese as a second language, and will sometimes refer to China in using the Mandarin name &quot;Zhongguo&quot; or the literal translation &quot;the Middle Kingdom&quot; （&quot;kingdom&quot; is a bit of an archaic translation of &quot;guo&quot;- &quot;country&quot; or &quot;nation&quot; is a better translation - but you get the idea). And I notice a lot of other Chinese as a second language speakers will do the same. A bit of harmless showing off that you learned a bit of the language, maybe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the languages surrounding Germany usually it's the cities that would have been noticed most early whose names get a translation.</p>
<p>Köln and München, but also Aachen, Frankfurt, Nürnberg or Regensburg are translated pretty much everywhere (if not in English, then in French, Italian, Spanish, Czech, Russian and whatnot), as they were <em>the</em> hotspots in the high middle ages. In Slavic languages, Dresden (e.g. Polish <em>Dresno</em>), Leipzig (<em>Lipsk</em>) and suchlike get translations for proximity and shared history (most places east of the River Elbe were Slavic settlements before the Ottos headed that way). In Dutch on the other hand, most cities and even small towns close to their border have proper translated names (Gulik, Noordhoorn, Osnabrugge, Gelderen etc.), which also works the other way round for German versions of Dutch names. And then again, Italian has amazed me with the invention of <em>Stoccarda</em> …</p>
<p>Berlin doesn't get translations – adapted pronunciations at most – probably because it's such a young town compared to the average European capital, and even younger as a city of note. Similar phenomena might apply to other young places. As far as I know Hannover gets special treatment only in English (which has the excuse of their shared history).</p>
<p>No known language has come up with a translation for <em>Bielefeld</em>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not a significant reason imho. Sure, dropping diacritics as the English are all too quick to do changes the pronunciation a bit, but that's about it (Btw, pronouncing <em>ü</em> like <em>u</em> in &quot;use&quot; and <em>ö</em> like <em>o</em> in &quot;yoghurt&quot; is an intelligible work-around). But whether or not a city has an umlaut-heavy name doesn't seem to play any role in whether it gets a translation. Düsseldorf, Münster and Lübeck don't have any in English.</p></div>		</li>
