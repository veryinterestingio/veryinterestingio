<p>Non endospore forming bacteria aren't going to evolve that process overnight. That could take millions of years</p>
<p>What's  more problematic is antibiotic resistance</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They absolutely can but this typically occurs with small bits of DNA or smaller rings of DNA called plasmids. Endospore formation is a process that takes not just one gene but many. So I would guess it's theoretically possible but extremely unlikely that a bacteria could acquire all the genes need to form endospores</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but that is usually things that take only one or a few genes, like antibiotic resistance. Forming endospores is a very complicated process that involves lots of genes.</p>
<p>It's similar to the difference between say making tomatoes that are spicy (very possible, only involves adding/turning up the expression of a few genes) and turning tomatoes into a tree.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the case of c diff, the c diff cells outside the body are spores, and already inactive. They're passively protected from alcohol by calcium plating and a protein coat. The spores revive into the active bacterium if they enter the appropriate environment.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>So it's a bacterial strain that is resistant to antibiotics and kills thousands of people a year. Isn't that the literal definition of a superbug?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>C diff is largely kept in check by other bacteria, and surges when you wipe out that bacteria with antibiotics. Sure there are antibiotic resistant strains, but it's not largely called a &quot;superbug&quot;. Spore formation is something other Clostridium species do, and it's why it's a problem in various settings.</p></div>		</li>
