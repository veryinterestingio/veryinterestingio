			<div class="markdown"><p>They should as their doctor for carafate or sucrofate in liquid form. It's like a bandaid for your throat, used to heal ulcers in the throat and stomach. I just got done recovering from pill induced esophagitis (swelling and damage to the throat from pill irritation) and it worked pretty well to heal me up. As a preventative, they should make sure to stay well hydrated and drink a few big, but spaced out sips of water before trying to swallowing any pills. My doc also said u can coat the pill in a very thin layer of butter to help lube it up some.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What like seltzer? Was the seltzer itself painful or do you just not like seltzer water? I'm quite partial to it myself but it seems like it would just irritate further. I wasn't supposed to drink anything with carbonation during recovery.</p></div>		</li>
