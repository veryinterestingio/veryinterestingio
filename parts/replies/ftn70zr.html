			<div class="markdown"><p>A bad energy source specifically. Energy = Current x Voltage x time Now we know current and Voltage are both very large (200,000V and 20A respectively) However, the time is ridiculously small, on the order of nanoseconds (Lets say 50 for simplicity's sake). So, if we plug these numbers into our energy formula we get:</p>
<p>20A x 200,000V x 0.00000005 seconds = 0.4 joules </p>
<p>Any Van De Graaf generator that can deliver much more than a Joule is on the verge of becoming dangerous.</p></div>		</li>
