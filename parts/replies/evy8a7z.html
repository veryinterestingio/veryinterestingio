			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. It's also easy to mistake thirst for hunger. Next time you feel like you want to snack, down a big glass of water and wait 10 minutes. It will often kill the craving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to weigh 240 lbs. I rest at 185 lbs now, and after a few years, I don't even notice the changes I made to get there. Drinking a lot of water is key. I drink between 85oz and 120oz of water daily. And I'm not suggesting this is some kind of &quot;one weird trick&quot; bullshit. It's just a simple matter of substitution. I drink water to the point that I almost always feel a little bit full. Not to the point of feeling sloshy, but most of the time the thought of eating anything has me feeling like, &quot;Meh, no thanks.&quot; I keep a 14oz Tervis full of water at hand all the time. A side effect of drinking so much water is that I go to the bathroom a lot, which keeps me from sitting.</p>
<p>Before you get too excited, I also adjusted my diet (I don't eat fast food and I drink no other fluids than water; no coffee, no soda, no &quot;drinks&quot;), I now go to the gym three times a week, and I ride around 30 miles a week on my bike. None of that happened overnight. I just slowly started substituting habits that contributed to my weight with habits that contributed to my health.</p></div>		</li>
