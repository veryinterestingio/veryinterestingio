			<div class="markdown"><p>Formula One has regs coming up in the future regarding the usage of E-Fuels, made from sources other than fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Put F1 engineers on to something they can get performance from, and they'll go bonkers.</p>
<p>They're already getting 50% thermal efficiency from a gas engine with hybrid heat and kinetic recovery, which is unheard of in a road car.<br />
Since F1 teams have partnerships with Shell, BP, Total, etc, I expect them to rapidly improve.  </p>
<p>Full electric is great, but for places where it's not realistic, hybrid tech needs to keep improving to help the required ICE's to work more efficiently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is it folks, capitalism giveth, capitalism taketh.   We will never run out of oil, but we will move on one day.  It's not that we don't have any alternatives to oil, they've just been less economical until recently, as the cost of oil goes up we will phase it out for cheaper alternative sources of energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Consider the fact:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The international transport sector consumes 20% of total global energy, and it is almost entirely powered by fossil fuels, thereby contributing significantly to global carbon emissions.  There are no technological prospects that show any demonstrable signs of materially changing this construct quickly enough to mitigate the deleterious effects that transport energy has on climate change. <a href="https://4thgeneration.energy/advanced-nuclear-can-make-gasoline-out-of-water/" target="_blank">ADVANCED NUCLEAR CAN MAKE GASOLINE OUT OF WATER</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Synthetic carbon-neutral fuels is the only feasible option to stop burning natural hydrocarbons. I doubt recycling carbon is a death sentence to the climate.</p></div>		</li>
