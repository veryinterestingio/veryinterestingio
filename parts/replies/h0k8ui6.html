			<div class="markdown"><p>Also worth mentioning that 1 what is also equivalent to a Newton meter per second in mechanical systems. It is quite elegant for SI units that we have an equivalent unit for power in both mechanical and electrical systems that has a simple relationship with other useful units.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Slight clarification needed. We only use the word resistance when talking about a purely DC system, or for analysis of very simple AC systems with only purely resistive components like a heater coil. For an AC system, where the frequency needs to be taken into account, we instead use the word impedance to describe the “resistance” as a reactive or imaginary component of the system.</p>
<p>Edit: Just saw your comment about how “it gets more complicated” and also realized I’m in the eli5 subreddit. So cheers mate!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A very, very, very ELI5 sense for real power, apparent power, and reactive power.</p>
<p>Think of a pipe with gasoline, feeding an engine. More gasoline down the pipe, more boom. Those are your resistive loads. Assuming a constant boom-ness of the gas (voltage) then the power is directly proportional to the volumetric flow rate. More gas per second, more boom. And it's just that simple</p>
<p>Now imagine someone adds some water to the gas tank. A small amount is fine. But too much, is gonna cause some issues. The engine goes boom based on how much GAS it gets, not how much FLUID it gets. The water does nothing to increase your boom. And this water takes the spot of some gas in the pipe, meaning there's less for the engine. So real power is how much GAS goes down the line per second, whereas apparent power is how much FLUID goes down. And of course reactive power is how much WATER goes into the engine per second. And you see, if you have watery gas, the only way to get the boom you need, is to chug more fluid (faster, or wider, pipe). And this isn't very efficient at all. And you can compute a &quot;power factor&quot; by taking the ratio of gas to water. Or rather, gas to total fluid</p>
<p>This doesn't account for the frequency analysis, or the trigonometry (my analogy is linear), or god forbid inductive vs capacitive loads, but, ya know, ELI5</p>
<p>Also, this place the &quot;dirtiness&quot; on the input side, not the load side, but ya know, eli5</p></div>		</li>
