			<div class="markdown"><p>Best answer in the thread. Example: If you're running a machine shop you can buy a set of precision-machined &quot;gage blocks&quot;, each of which is guaranteed to be, say, &quot;x centimeters plus or minus y centimeters&quot;, and you can check your own measuring devices by measuring them.</p>
<p>Those blocks came from a company that checked its own measuring devices against a much more expensive set, bought from someone who had yet a better set, and there's an unbroken chain of calibration up to NIST in the US, and then to other agencies in France and Germany which keep the master standards.</p>
<p>So, basically, precision costs money: how much would you like?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. I have a metal bar that is guaranteed flat to 1/10,000 of an inch for 36‚Äù long. and it cost me $175. Everything flat in my shop is trued with this bar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True. We get cheap ruler/measuring tapes in our place which are often displaced by few .1cm to 1.0cm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When it comes to tape measures, the construction crew is supposed to check every tape to be sure they are all the same measurement.</p>
<p>Most of the variances are related to the hook.  That is why some measuring is done by &quot;burning a foot&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>International Standard -&gt; national standard -&gt; regional standards, if applicable -&gt; companies make standards -&gt; company mass produces rulers, weights, volume measuring stuff, pressure gauge, resistance meters...so on.</p></div>		</li>
