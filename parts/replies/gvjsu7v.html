			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never got any negative response for this (at least on my face) but a lot of people do agree that a trauma in childhood can cause issues in the development later on.</p>
<p>That the reason you hear why some neurological disorders can be fix early in childhood but can be hard to fix later on in life.</p>
<p>Take good care of your children people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That may have just been happenstance, to be honest. Unless you were having a seizure or smashed your head on the way down I don't think that fainting would cause a lifelong stutter. It may have just become more noticeable once you reached around the age of three due to the increasing language complexity that you began to use. The inflatable horse may have just been a memorable thing that your parents eventually created a false relationship between them. Have you been to a speech pathologist? I had a speech impediment which included a stutter and through speech therapy when I was younger it is almost unnoticeable today.</p></div>		</li>
