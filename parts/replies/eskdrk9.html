(not much longer, probably on the scale of seconds or milliseconds longer, because that vibration is still being converted in to heat energy within the objects themselves)</p></div>		</li>

<p>To expand on this, defects in the structure can absorb (or scatter) vibrational energy, eventually turning any 'acoustic' vibrations into thermal phonons:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes the two objects would start to resonate. The effects of the collision i guess would be a bit more pronounced, when compared to the same collision happening in an air filled environment, because a fraction of the energy would be lost in making the air molecules vibrate. But i woulld guess the amount of energy lost that way is extremely small.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Saying the objects would resonate is at the very least misleading. They do t resonate with each other. And while the vibrations in them would generally settle on their resonant frequencies, I'm not sure that counts as resonating. It's just that the other modes of vibration would quickly lose energy, leaving only the resonant modes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A collision creates a forces which contains all frequencies (Fourier transform of a delta function) and the object will resonate at all of its natural frequencies as long as the point of impact isn't on a node of the modeshape. Resonance and natural frequency are commonly used to mean the same thing. Some people might argue there's a technical difference, but even among specialists it would be normal to use the terms interchangeably.</p>

<p>I mean, I agree with you but while we’re being pedantic, that’s what it means for an object to resonate. That is exactly why banging a tuning fork or plucking a guitar string produces specific sounds. The action generates vibrations across the entire frequency spectrum but only the resonant ones survive. That’s why the attack of a note sounds different from its expected pitch; the aharmonic frequencies haven’t yet completely destructively interfered for a very short duration after the note is struck.</p></div>		</li>
