			<div class="markdown"><p>Me. Too. </p>
<p>Ever since I was little, people ALWAYS pointed out my dark eye bags. Because of that, I‚Äôve come to be very self-conscious of them, honestly. I‚Äôve even had some people NOW say ‚ÄúYou need some sleep‚Äù or ‚ÄúSleep much?‚Äù. It‚Äôs genetics - and I wish more people were aware of that instead of pointing something out on my face. I try to use concealer and then some foundation on top to cover them up a bit, or at least, to make them look lighter. Here‚Äôs to the dark eye bags community.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Saaame, I have permanent dark zombie circles and it sucks. The worst part is that I CANNOT figure out how to cover them with concealer and not have it look all cakey and wrinkly? So I get to choose between looking exhausted and sick or looking 10 years older than I am üëç</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right there with you. I rarely wear makeup (too lazy and bad at it), so I just rock my raccoon eyes.</p>
<p>I do occasionally have people make comments like, &quot;oh my goodness, you look tired today&quot; or &quot;is everything okay? Your eyes are blah blah blah!&quot;</p>
<p>I've learned to reply, &quot;yep, I'm fine, thanks. This is just how my face looks.&quot; That's also my line when someone says something about my natural resting bitch face. &quot;Are you upset?!&quot; &quot;Nope, this is just my face.&quot;</p>
<p>It's polite but kinda lets them know how rude they've just unintentionally been.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Using a colour corrector might help! Yellow tones counteract purple and orange tones counteract blue so applying a colour corrector underneath concealer should mean you need less product overall and it doesn't get as cakey.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So far colour correcting products have only succeeded in adding a lovely orange tint and an extra layer of cake hahaha. Not sure if I havent discovered the right colour/product or if I am simpy too pale for that technique. Any recommendations?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think that's why I've been single for 7 years. As a guy, it's a little harder to get away with makeup.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It shouldn't really be noticeable as makeup if you get the right product and apply it correctly. It should act as color correction, i.e. being subtle and discreet.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Maybe when I have money for decent makeup, I'll watch some YT tutorials and give it another shot.</p></div>		</li>
