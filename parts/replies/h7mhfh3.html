			<div class="markdown"><p>A max &quot;volume&quot; exists as volume is a pressure wave. When the volume exceeds the ambient pressure it creates a vacuum effectively limiting this volume. In air, at sea level, and 0 Dec C, this is 194 dB, this has a pressure deviation of 101 kPA, atmospheric pressure at sea level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The low pressure zone behind the pressure wave becomes a near total vacuum. This causes the behavior of the wave change and it turns into a shockwave. Shockwaves can cause damage, but the Earth wont disintegrate or ignite the atmosphere.</p>
<p>194dB is loud, really loud. It's about 10,000x* louder than a jet engine (150dB). Aside from some type of explosion, there isnt much that can produce a sound that loud.</p>
<p>The same scale we use to measure sounds can also measure shockwaves. We dont measure how loud sounds are, we measure the intensity of the pressure wave. The apparent loudness of a sound is subjective and depends on who is listening, while the intensity can be calculated. This is how we can say certain events made sounds louder than 194dB, like Krakatoa (est 310dB) or Tunguska (est 305dB).</p>
<p>Edit: initially said 40x louder</p></div>		</li>
