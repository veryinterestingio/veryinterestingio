<p>Because if anti-atoms fell up, we could do away with General Relativity.</p>
<p>If matter attracts matter and repels anti-matter, then by symmetry arguments it should not affect particles that are their own antiparticle, like photons. Experimentally we know that the path of photons is bent by gravitational fields, which is also predicted by GR.</p>
<p>General relativity is built upon Einstein's equivalence principle: all laws of physics are the same in a free falling reference frame in a gravitational field as in empty space in absence of gravity. The implication of this is that <em>no local experiment</em> would be able to distinguish whether you are falling in a gravitational field, or are in empty space in absence of gravity. Suppose anti-matter fell up, we could release an object of anti-matter and one of matter. If they don't move with respect to each other, there is no gravity. If the matter remains stationary (we are in free fall) but the anti-matter starts moving, then we are in a gravitational field.</p>
<p>Therefore we can conclude that either anti-matter falls down like normal matter, or General Relativity (a highly successful theory we haven't found any evidence against in the 100 years it existed) is completely wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would also, surely, require that gravitational and inertial mass decouple for antimatter? Since we know positrons/antiprotons behave as expected in electromagnetic interactions (ie. they obey Newton's 2nd law, or it's relativistic analogue at least). </p></div>		</li>
