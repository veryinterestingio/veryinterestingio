			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not the person who wrote that, I just copy pasted from them. However my educated guess would be that nail growth is due to things like nutrition and genetics, same way that some people grow hair super fast but others struggle to get any at all.</p>
<p>Because we use our hands a lot, it's hard to maintain long nails in the same way that most animals manage their claws simply by using them so much, yet the same animals as pets need trimming. So it's not that they stop growing, it's that usage keeps them short, and also that longer nails makes them more brittle/weaker, and so more easily broken/work off beyond short lengths.</p></div>		</li>
