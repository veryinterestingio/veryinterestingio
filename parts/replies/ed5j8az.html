			<div class="markdown"><p>Mercury is a good example of this. It's not a perfect tidal lock, it's a near lock, iirc the relationship is 3:2 ( whereas the Earth's is 365:1), but it's pretty much a biblical hellscape. The solar energy heats up the dayside to over 400° C, while the lack of atmosphere to retain heat (largely due to the low gravity, but the solar weather, exacerbated by the slow rotation, contribute a non trivial portion to the effect) as well as the slow rotation allowing a large amount of time for heat to dissipate, means that the night side can get roughly 600° colder, at about -173° C</p>
<p>So yeah, it's a good thing earth isn't tidally locked. It'd be nearly impossible for life to be sustained there as we understand it, let alone to develop</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There appears to actually be recent computer modelling that suggests that a plant like Earth that had a thick atmosphere would be capable of distributing heat sufficiently well that the dark side would not allow the atmosphere to freeze out.</p>
<p>This is especially true on a planet with a globe spanning ocean like ours, where water would evaporate at the subsolar point, flow to the dark side int he atmosphere and condense there, where the global ocean would return it to the subsolar point.</p>
<p>Life would be strange on such a world if you lived near the terminator but it is probably capable of supporting complex lifeforms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's important for a couple of reasons. It's the first man-made object that has landed on that side of the moon, so that's an important step for China's space program, and for us as a species as well. Also, and more significantly, because that side of the moon always faces away from Earth, the probe will not experience radio interference from all the signals bouncing around on our planet (this can also be referred to as a radio black-out area). This means that it will be able to make radio astronomy observations without worrying about whether or not a signal is man-made. However, this also means that China had to launch a second probe that sits at L2 (Langrange point 2) which is far enough away from both the Earth and far-side of the moon that it can relay signals back and forth--without it, China wouldn't be able to talk to their lander because of the radio black-out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The two sides of the moon are pretty different. The near side has lots of Maria, or flatish planes, whereas the far side is very rugged and covered in craters. There are some theories as to why but it is still an active area of study. </p>
<p>The research from this lander will help explain that, give us more information on the moon in general, and do observations that are difficult to do from earth or near earth. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.space.com/32964-china-moon-far-side-mission-science-goals.html" target="_blank">Specifically</a> the lander will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Study the characteristics and the formation mechanism of lunar surface floating dust</li>

<li>Measure the chemical compositions of lunar rocks and soils and study their distribution;</li>
<li>Carry out lunar surface low-frequency radio astronomical observation and research;</li>
<li>Identify the structure of cosmic rays, and to find the possible original position for these cosmic rays;</li>
<li>Observe the independent kilometer wave burst event from the high layer of the solar corona, investigate its radiation characteristics and mechanism, and to explore the evolution and transport of coronal mass ejection (CME) between the Sun and Earth.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A day, in astronomical terms, is defined as the length of time a celestial body takes to complete one full rotation. Earth's day takes 24 hours to complete one full rotation. That's what causes the sunrise and sunset. The moon takes 29.5 Earth days, or 708 hours, to do the same. The moon doesn't rotate fully once per day, at least not as we think of days. Of course sunrise and sunset would still be different on the moon because the moon also revolves around Earth at the same rate that it rotates.</p>
<p>tl;dr<br />
Moon days are longer than Earth days. Sunrises and sunsets on the moon would take longer on the moon than the Earth, but are also weird and different because the moon revolves around Earth.</p>
<p>Edit: also, the lunar cycle is a result of the moon's revolution around Earth and not it's rotation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Tidal effects from the Earth would be hard to distinguish on the Moon, since they have mostly consistent direction and magnitude, but sensitive equipment could pick up the difference between the Moon's perigee and apogee. By my calculations weight would change by 0.07% from one to the other.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That sounds like a really interesting concept for a sci-fi novel. I like the idea of people living somewhere amd not knowing they are orbiting another even bigger planet. </p>
