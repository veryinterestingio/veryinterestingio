			<div class="markdown"><p>I think without Xerox PARC, Silicon Valley may not have flourished as it had (though it would still have been a hub). Xerox, which was based on Rochester, NY could have easily selected Buffalo, New York City, or even a research community like Ithaca/Cornell (Dartmouth’s lab produced a ton of innovation in the middle of the woods of New Hampshire). Silicon Valley firms are still printing cash based on technologies that were spawned from the lab. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd argue that the semiconductor industry in particular is what led to the boom. There's no Xerox PARC without the work on computing/memory systems at Intel (and others). It's natural for the computing/software businesses to pop up down the street (sometimes literally) from the semiconductor shops. They were sharing products and ideas over lunch oftentimes.  </p>

<p>Are there any books about this subject?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Shockley diode is actually what did him in! He hired some of the brightest engineers of the day (Robert Noyce in particular - dude invented the Integrated Circuit) and none of them wanted to work on the &quot;four-layer diode&quot; (aka, Shockley diode). So they mutinied, and Noyce became their fearless leader. </p>
<p>There was a great documentary on Netflix a few years ago, I can't remember what it was called. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're remembering &quot;American Experience: Silicon Valley&quot;, which was produced by PBS (Public Broadcast System in the USA), but was available on Netflix.  (That's where I found it, too)  It's available on DVD from the PBS.org website.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not specifically about Shockley, but “The Idea Factory” by Jon Gertner discusses his story in a lot of detail. The focus of the book is on Bell Labs more generally (which of course is where Shockley worked during the development of the transistor).</p></div>		</li>
