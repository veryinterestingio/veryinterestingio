			<div class="markdown"><p>It only begins to occur if the muscles aren't used at all, i.e. you're a bedbound patient with a grievous injury who can't walk or move around whatsoever. As long as you actually move around to any degree during the day the body recognizes that the muscles are being used and you won't have any atrophy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Once theres a significant trauma and swelling that muscle will essentially shutdown, thats when it atrophies quickly. In between your weekly exercise those muscles are still doing day to day tasks</p>
<p>After a knee reconstruction i was amazed at how quickly my left quad atrophied. It was very noticeably skinner than the right after less than a week</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>barely. the general rule of thumb is that consistent usage of antipyretics will increase the duration of routine febrile infections by about a day. While percentage wise that's a lot, it is worth it for most people for the comfort level of not having a fever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, the medication strikes a very good balance between reducing symptoms and maintaining the benefits of a fever? Or was I just misled in classes about how important a fever was to fighting bacteria/viruses?</p>
<p>Edit: I just always think about the fact that weak malaria was used as the initial syphilis treatment so I consider it to be effective against diseases</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might be thinking of NSAID medications, which in the name (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory) tells you they should help with swelling. Motrin/ibuprofen is the most common example in the US, but there are many.</p>
<p>Fever reduction medication (Tylenol/acetaminophen) is different, and doesn't really impact swelling. </p>
<p>NSAID's commonly get used when you have a fever, as they can relieve internal inflammation caused by the fever. So many people confuse the two types, and think they're the same.</p>
<p>While not a replacement for ice/rest, NSAID's do indeed impact swelling reduction, and it's typicallyrecommend to take an over the counter one for several days to help reduce swelling. </p>
<p>Think of it as part of the recovery duo with RICE, rather than a replacement.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Of those two only NSAIDs are antiinflammatory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's important to understand that many NSAIDs don't merely reduce the pain of a fever. They're also antipyretics, like tylenol. They work by inhibiting cyclooxygenase.</p></div>		</li>
