			<div class="markdown"><p>Even this wouldn't destroy the whole universe - at large enough scales the universe is expanding faster than the speed of light. Since this vacuum bubble is subject to the speed of light limitation it would never reach most of the universe.</p>
<p>I do think this is the best answer to OP's question however, as it does a better job at destroying the universe than any other reasonably possible scenario.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm probably wrong but entertain me for a second, it seems like the vacuum bubble would still reach all of space, my reason for thinking this being the ant on a rubber band problem: </p>

<p>Would this not apply in 3d? Or maybe it isn't the speed of light expansion, but the fact that its accelerating somewhat?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This and an expanding universe sound like the same problem, but they are actually quite different!</p>
<p>Consider two cases: The rubber band expanding 1km when its 1km long, and when its 2km long. In the first case, it doubles in length, while in the second, each 1km section only grows by 0.5km, meaning the &quot;expansion&quot; of each length of the rubber band actually slows down over time!</p>
<p>For the universe, each section of the universe is expanding at a constant rate <em>per unit length</em>. So it would take the same about of time for the universe to grow from 10 billion light years to 20 billion, as it would for two 10b ly segments to do the same (which would go from 20b to 40b). Unlike the linear growth of the elastic band, this &quot;linear growth per length&quot; is actually exponential growth</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not that it's accelerating linearly like we see in your example, it's that it's accelerating at an exponential rate. So, lets say that over a given distance, for a certain time, that length doubles. Then each part of that new area doubles over the next period of time, and so forth.</p>
<p>Eventually you're guaranteed to get portions of the universe that are &quot;moving&quot; away from each other faster than the speed of light can catch up to them. Even if they aren't moving through space relative to each other, what that space does between them is what pushes it over the top.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It goes over this in the wikipedia page, but this is only in cases where the stretching is constant, whereas in the universe the expansion seems tobe spreading.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It actually would in a roundabout way. Over infinite time, the entire universe will have undergone vacuum decay- although the extending edges may not, from any perspective where matter is otherwise present, you would never be able to observe beyond the vacuum decay bubble.</p>
<p>Also, a bit more technical, but it wouldnt destroy the universe but completely change how it functions, at worse: all mass is converted into energy and we have a universe devoid of change. We would essentially fast track to maximum entropy in that situation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't opening a wormhole from an inhabited area to a place of true vacuum be basically game over for the race doing it?</p>
<p>You always see the trope of wormholes being opened to amazing places far away, yet connecting to true vacuum might mean instant annihilation and there's no real way of knowing if you might stumble upon that.</p></div>		</li>
