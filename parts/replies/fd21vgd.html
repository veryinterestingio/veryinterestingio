			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't. &quot;Prediction&quot; is a term used to denote client side processes. The kinda of things you can do without server confirmation. This includes moving your player. Turning your head. Shooting your gun. Throwing grenades and other items like that. Prediction just means that the server predicts that all of these client side actions will be accepted on the server side. Turning prediction off makes everything wait for server confirmation before your game changes states. Meaning if you press W and begin to walk forward, you won't actually move until the server says it's okay to do so. </p>
<p>This eliminates rubberbanding, as the server no longer corrects for client-side mistakes, but greatly increases latency, as your client is now waiting for confirmation on every single action you make.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not as fancy as it sounds - as with most programming stuff. The term is mostly used for things like anticipating where a projectile is if the game knows its speed and your latency.</p>
<p>You can see this in action in some games if a player has a bit of lag and fires a rocket. The rocket will appear a few feet ahead of their gun because it wasn't able to predict when the player was going to fire, but once it's out it's easy to predict where the rocket currently is. You know its last position, direction, speed, and the age of that information.</p>
<p>It's still a can of worms of inconsistencies. There's a billion &quot;but what if-&quot;s where you just have to screw someone over or do more complex stuff like rolling back or try for fancier predictions. It's often not worth it as it ends up being a ton of work to make your game behave even weirder and making it harder to work with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's right. Since they aren't human opponents it's fine to give the player the advantage. You can have half a second of lag and evade a blow that would already have hit you, but your local game gets to set the &quot;truth&quot; in what happened.</p>
<p>The only consequence is that it looks a little odd for the other players where you will take a hit, then roll away without having taken damage. It's arguably more hackable, but cheating in cooperative games isn't as attractive and doesn't have the same consequences. It's a tradeoff.</p></div>		</li>
