			<div class="markdown"><p>Alternatively, why is it often easier to actually recall what you are having trouble when you stop trying?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I.e., that one word with starting with 'k' meaning ruler.... oh well I think of it eventually. 2 seconds after changing focus &quot;KING&quot;! That's what I was trying to say.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, I think I read an article on reddit a couple weeks back about this.
To help you find information your brain ‚Äúblocks‚Äù off access to some information it thinks is <em>close</em> but not what you‚Äôre looking for.
It can accidentally block off what you‚Äôre actually looking for and the harder you try to think the harder it blocks off this information.
Only when you give up does it drop the block and then you can absentmindedly stumble across the information because it‚Äôs no longer hidden from view.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reminds me of the &quot;doorway effect,&quot; when you go into another room (usually passing through at least one doorway) and forgot why you went in there.</p>
<p>Apparently it's because, when you go to another room, your brain goes &quot;look at this totally new space that has nothing to do with the last place we were! we better close all these open tabs to make room for the stuff that's gonna happen here!&quot; and it just leaves you stranded in the kitchen with no idea why you're there. And of course, the second you go back to the previous room, your brain goes &quot;ok, what tabs did we have open before that we need back now?&quot; and makes you feel stupid for forgetting you got up to get coffee.</p>
<p>Human brains are all about <em>context</em> apparently. There's a million reasons why you <em>could have</em> walked into the kitchen with a cup in hand (getting a new drink, getting a refill of your last drink, putting the dirty cup in the sink, etc.) but the wad of soggy bacon in your skull doesn't come up with &quot;we need more coffee&quot; when you're in the kitchen because you had that thought in (the context of) your office. Or maybe I just notice the contex thing more because I'm autistic, lol, so my brain is even more context-focused than most people üòÇ</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find the more i try to think about something, the harder it is to see the big picture.  Would this be related?</p>
<p>This relates a lot to project work, where the more I dive into the details and nit pick issues, the more I lose sight of the overall scope and goals. So I have to consciously take a step back and let my mind open up to the other major elements of the project that I've lost track of, to make sure I'm still working towards the overall goal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dont know this for sure, but based on the answer id assuming its because 1. When we stop thinking of it, part of our brain still thinks about it and/or 2. Actively thinking about it causes the brain to go through these many steps, but when you subconsciously think about a word you already know its very quick to find, you just almost confuse your brain when youre actively looking for it</p>
<p>Seems to happen to me often, but again I cant say this is for sure why</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah whenever i cant remember something, instead of focusing on it and trying to remember, i immediately move on and usually withing 30 seconds it will come to me, whereas if i try to actively remember it will take much longer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read a few years back I read a book (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0057DCE7M/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1" target="_blank">I think</a>) that described that the different parts of the brain are engaged during focused thinking and otherwise. Something like focused thinking was the logical, left-side of the brain and not-focused was creative, right-side of the brain.</p>
<p>When we stop focusing on a problem, and we zone out while on a treadmill (or whatever), we are giving the creative side a chance to work on the problem. The different thought process of the different hemisphere can make the connection or solve a problem when the the logical side may not.</p>
<p>The LPT: if youre struggling at remembering something, or solving a problem, sometimes the best thing to do is to stop thinking about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh boy, something I can answer! Think of your mind like a company. Some people never talk, they just get the routine work done (heartbeat). Some work on storing and recalling information. Some are on the CEOs executive team and work towards decisions. Then there's the CEO, who is the voice of the company, but can only act because of the efforts of the people that work for him/her. </p>
<p>In normal times, when you're hunting for a word, several folk on the exec team are planning the CEO's speech (1-2sec before it's said), and asking their staff to give them the right next words, in context of the structure of the sentence and the meaning to be conveyed. The CEO calls for a vote on what to say and then chooses to take the results or send it back for revisions. </p>
<p>When the word recall staff under one of those board members struggles to come up with the right word in time, the bosses up the pressure. In some cases this gets the worker to deliver, but that urgent pressure can lead the staff to just deliver the first word that fits, rather than the right one. The CEO gets pissed, and says what it has to get through the moment. </p>
<p>For a while after this flub, that word recall staffer still feels pressure to get to the actual right word for the CEO. When he has some free time, after his boss stops looking over his shoulder, he may find the right word and delivers it back to his boss excitedly. That exec gives it to the CEO, late, but proudly. &quot;A ha! The word was 'Khan'!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Saw a Vox documentary on Netflix about memory competitions, the participants can memorize hundreds of random numbers. They do it by giving each number a sound, the numbers are grouped in threes. With the combined sounds they're able to make a story that allows them to recall the sounds and then decode to the numbers themselves. Cool huh?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's also how you can &quot;cheat&quot; at those memory tests where you're tested to see how many random words you can remember. Like you will be given a list of words:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Monkey</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gardener</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gun</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fish</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cash</p>
</li>
<li>Horse</li>
</ul>
<p>(In the real tests it will be 10-20 random words) You only have a minute to memorize it, and then one hour later you're tested on how many of the words you remember. If you try to just brute force remember the words with no context, you will likely only remember 10-20%. </p>
<p>The &quot;trick&quot; is to use associations. So for the above example: &quot;Once upon a time there was a <strong>gardener</strong>, who was mugged by a <strong>monkey</strong> with a <strong>gun</strong>. The monkey stole the gardener's <strong>fish</strong> and his <strong>cash</strong>, before escaping on a stolen <strong>horse</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>It's a silly, easy story to remember, and every noun is a word from that memory list. Every word gets linked to the others via the short story. Once you remember the start of the story, your brain will play out the rest. The point being, the brain is not wired to memorize arbitrary things, but it can memorize associations incredibly well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or take it in chunks.  Ill never remember &quot;Monkey, Gardener, Gun, Fish, Cash, and Horse&quot;, but I can remember &quot;Monkey gardener, Gun fish, and Cash horse&quot;.  </p>
<p>Sort of like I dont remember phone numbers as a string of single digits.  Its not 4-1-2-7, it's 41-27.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In certain parts of the world there is still admiration for rote learning, remembering numbers, solving math puzzles in yr head and tricks related to them. Or solving int√©gr√©s and deriviates. They are in books/online. It was like fun in the days before tv, radio, electricity; great way to fill your free time with the family.:)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent description. In my Experimental Psychology class we did a set of experiments on ourselves where words were flashed on a computer screen for milliseconds.</p>
<p>At first we were just trying to see how low we could go before we could no longer state the word.</p>
<p>As we went lower we found that even though you could not read the word anymore you would get close.</p>
<p>For example if the word that was flashed was &quot;apartment&quot; you might say it was &quot;house&quot; or some similar word.</p>
<p>You would not say something that contained some of the letters in &quot;apartment&quot; - which meant something was going on other than just reading the word.</p>
<p>If I remember correctly the goal was to show that similar concepts were housed near each other in the brain and the quick flashes caused the viewer to be in the right neighborhood looking for the word but not able to complete the task to the right destination.</p></div>		</li>
