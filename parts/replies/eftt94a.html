<p>You can use dryer balls to make the towels fluffy </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Next time you hold a dryer sheet, rub it between your fingers. It's soaked with stuff that rubs off in the dryer*. And compare a new sheet to an old one when you're done with one, it's like it's been &quot;emptied&quot; out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does, sort of. The coating on the fibers help the folds of fabric slide over each other, rather than catching and binding which can cause wrinkles. So it <em>helps</em>, but not by very much.</p></div>		</li>
