			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting here that the human brain has a great deal of difficulty distinguishing physical pain from emotional pain. In &quot;the subtle art of not giving a f*ck&quot;, the author (Mark Manson) points out that &quot;Like physical pain, our psychological pain is an indication of something out of equilibrium, some limitation that has been exceeded.&quot; (p.29) </p>
<p>I found knowing that to be extremely helpful in dealing with what you describe. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it’s worth noting the somewhat improper way in which the sympathetic autonomic system is used in modern humans. The so called “fight or flight” response and activation of the sympathetic autonomic system to sustain the alarm response are products of evolutionary processes which were driven by the need to avert direct physical threats. The response raises heart rate and muscle activity, while decreasing the energy consuming bodily processes which are not essential for immediate survival, such as digestion and immunity. This helped when animals needed to be fended off, physical combat needed to be won, and humans needed to be able to rapidly adapt their physiological state to meet the physical requirements of these tasks, yet modern humans encounter far fewer direct physical threats, instead facing many psychological threats. These can include anything from the jolt of anxiety when you miss your alarm clock and may be late to work, to the anxiety derived from many social interactions or the constant requirements of many modern workplaces. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All these psychological stressors lead to the same activation of the sympathetic autonomic system which physical threats do, yet they occur far more often. The cumulative effect of these psychological stressors is a near-constant activation of bodily processes which were only adapted for short-term use. This can be damaging to both psychological and physical health and partially explains why many people experience constant stress and are at risk of outbursts of rage at the slightest inconvenience. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally I’ve found this incredibly helpful for coping with and understanding the underlying reasons for my stress. I found taking time to relax and isolate myself from the psychological stressors greatly increased my productivity and overall happiness. So next time you feel on-edge, don’t fret, have a rest and you'll release all that stress. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since it's something I find weirdly fascinating, the fight-or-flight response actually has all kinds of fun, wonderful effects.</p>
<p>Tunnel vision, temporary deafness, up to tripled strength (You're not like this normally because continual exertion of muscles to this degree can rip them from the bone and cause them to pretty much start to liquefy), severely reduced ability to think consciously (You become much more act-react), bladder relaxation, blood thickening (to stop you bleeding out when attacked), reduced bloodflow to the skin, increased breathing rate...</p>
<p>Your body basically just goes &quot;Fuck everything else, MUSCLES MUSCLES MUSCLES!&quot; which, as mentioned, was a very useful strategy when facing down a lion. It's not so useful when you're preparing for a job interview.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sooo what part do benzodiazepines play? In an instance where you are experiencing the fight or flight and want to throw up for example. I know they are not the best option, but many people rely on them frequently.  </p>
<p>Also, I find the blood thickening thing interesting. Maybe this is why a lot of people under stress have heart attacks and/or are given an aspirin or blood thinner regimen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Out of six children, three of us have a very powerful fight or flight response.  The eyes go bloodshot, you actually see red, you can't hear anything except roaring in the ears, and then we fight, because the flight part usually doesn't work right.  I haven't been in an actual fight in years, but If I start getting that feeling and see red, something happens to me and I also bare my teeth in a big grin, and maybe even will start laughing my head off.  Scares the shit put of people and they run away.</p>
<p>I'm glad to know it's a natural thing caused my nervous system and I'm not an actual psycho.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is a really wonderful response!</p>
<p>I wish this was discussed more openly when it comes to things like anxiety disorder. I suffer it and people often do not understand all of the physical effects that come with it. </p>
<p>I will literally feel sick. </p>
<p>Even when things are not really an issue and my brain is telling me it is, my body is still having the same fear response as if it were a real problem. </p>
<p>It isn't something that only effects our heads!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's so hard to explain this to patients, though! When I tell people that anxiety can give them real headaches and real stomach aches, and that the only things left to try are therapy and psychiatric medication, they think I'm saying it's all in their heads ? It's SUCH a tricky discussion to have, especially when they just want the pain to stop, and they think we're holding out on them. Sure I can put you to sleep, but I can't render your wakefulness pain free.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I fought with this for such a long time. My depression plays out psychosomatically, and for the longest time I thought that my doctors were telling me the pain that I was feeling wasn't real. Not to mention the havoc that constant stress wreaks on your immune system. Combine that with society telling us that physical illness is more acceptable than mental illness, and it's no wonder that I just felt sick all over all the time. It's gotten better over the last few years, but it's still something that I have to think about: ok, am I sick because I'm isolating and depressed, or am I depressed because I'm sick and therefore necessarily isolated? I don't think I'll ever hit a point where I can completely disentangle the two.</p></div>		</li>
