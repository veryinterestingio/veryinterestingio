			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess I simplified a bit.  Ionized water is just water than has other things (ions) dissolved in it.  Ions are charged molecules such as the sodium and chloride ions which are separate and charged when table salt is dissolved, but overall neutral when it is in its solid crystal salt form.  When oxygen dissolves into water, it also forms charged ions.  </p>
<p>If you have water with salts dissolved in it, you need to use electrolysis or distillation (boiling and condensing) or something similar to remove the salts.  If you had deionized water, but it was exposed to air, you could bring the water to a boil to remove the dissolved gasses and have deionized water again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An ion is just an atom/molecule with a net electric charge from either losing or gaining electrons.  When you heat an element what you are doing is adding energy to the electrons in it. If you hear it enough those electrons can gain enough energy to break free of the element entirely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not really accurate.  Heating dissolved ions does not make the electrons break free.  Heat is the kinetic energy (speed) of the molecules, rather than the electrons.</p>
<p>Dissolved ions are dissolved because water has a side that is a bit more positive and a side that is a bit more negative.  If you have a negative ion, the positive sides of the water group up and stick to it, and keep anything else from touching it.</p>
<p>When the water gets hot, the water molecules are moving too fast to clump up around the ion.</p>
