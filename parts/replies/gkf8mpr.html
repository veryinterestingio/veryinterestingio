			<div class="markdown"><p>I have an air fryer/instant pot combo, and a convection oven. From what I can tell, the air fryer continuously blasts hot air on the food while the convection oven kicks the circulation on and off, while maintaining a distinct temperature. The oven circulates the air for more even cooking, but the food is still very much being baked in a traditional sense. </p>
<p>The air fryer takes hot air and blasts it DIRECTLY onto the food. I’ve tested this out too, and the air fryer gets food crispier in way less time. Of course, it’s substantially smaller than the oven, and takes a lot less time to preheat and cook the food, so it’s definitely more of a convenience thing. They both have their places in my kitchen. </p>
<p>That’s just my experience though. Higher-end air fryer vs a mid-level Samsung gas range, so YMMV. I’ve seen newer ranges advertised as being equipped with air fry technology, which is different enough to advertise that in addition to convection, but marketing is a fickle mistress.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The countertop air fryers are literally the same technology as convection ovens, just a different scale. It takes less time to heat up because it's got a much smaller interior, but that also means you can't cook as much in one go.</p>
<p>As for #AirFryingOvens, take Frigidaire for example. &quot;Air Frying Ovens&quot; are just rebranded convection ovens to take advantage of the air fryer fad. They just renamed one of the buttons.  <a href="https://www.frigidaire.com/Blog/Product-Advice--Education/What-Is-An-Air-Frying-Oven/" target="_blank">https://www.frigidaire.com/Blog/Product-Advice--Education/What-Is-An-Air-Frying-Oven/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>So what is an air frying oven?</p>
<p>Air frying is a method of cooking that circulates hot air inside your oven at a high speed through the use of convection fans. This cooks food faster and creates a crispy, fried layer and even-browning on all sides using little to no oil compared to traditional deep frying.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might be better to say convection toaster oven, just to give people a better sense of scale. A bunch of companies has rebranded their convection toaster ovens are air fryers to sell better (and upcharge slightly more. Yay, marketing)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You did the research, so thanks for getting in-depth. </p>
<p>My personal experience leads me to believe that they’re different functions, but that might just be the scale of the appliances and size/position of the fan. At least they’re different enough to me to know when to use one vs the other to cook certain foods. Air fried tater tots are superior to even deep fried ones in my household. Frozen chicken strips are still better deep fried, but in close second is air fried, with convection in third by far.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was an instant pot duo, it came with the standard pressure lid and an air fry lid. I use both functions fairly often, and I was a skeptic going in (more towards the air frying side). I saw that they’re selling after market air fryer lids now, and I believe the premise is the same, but the functions are built right in to the machine on mine. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably because they are the very proud owner of what is essentially a convection toaster oven. No one wants to spend a couple hundred bucks and realize/admit that's all it is. To be fair, you can make some great food in one, but calling it an &quot;air-fryer&quot; is misleading because it doesn't actually fry anything, it's just a small oven for baking and roasting smallish portions of food.</p></div>		</li>

<p>convection toaster ovens seem to have about the same price points as air fryers - anything from $50 for essentially a hair dryer, to $300 for multi-function, high capacity, quality devices. You're correct that they're effectively the same device repackaged, though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>??? You can go to Walmart and buy an air-fryer for $20-40.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ever since air fryers became a big thing, my dad keeps asking if I want one as a gift for various events/holidays. I have to keep reminding him I have a full sized convection oven, so he'd be wasting his money.</p></div>		</li>
