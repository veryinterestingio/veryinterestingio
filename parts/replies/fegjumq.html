			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what you classify as “life threatening”.</p>
<p>Humans are certainly the exception when it comes to this topic. Most other animals have a far lower mortality rate when it comes to reproduction without medical assistance. (At least if you discount species which always die during reproduction.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reproduction is an incredibly resource-heavy, complicated, and taxing process for most organisms. You've somehow got to make at least one copy of you, and most of the time you need to do it without compromising your own function too much.</p>
<p>It's one of those realities of biology, that reproduction is a very high-cost operation. The female generally has a much higher risk and cost associated with reproduction as compared with the male, from a biological perspective.</p>
<p>It's one of the reasons that the females are kinda the &quot;choosers&quot; in most species (including humans!). Also one of the reasons that rape is quite common in a lot of different species when the term can feasibly apply.</p></div>		</li>

<p>To break the egg the bird would have to have such a serious impact that the animal is probably dead before the egg breaks. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>At least with chickens, they can certainly have an egg break internally without the blow killing the bird. I've seen it happen to a couple hens - one had a fully-shelled egg that broke internally (that hen perished from internal infection).</p>
<p>The other had an egg that cracked during one of the earlier parts of shell application and then had more layers of shell secreted onto the egg, closing the crack up. For that one the hen's lower abdomen was bruised under her feathers and the area seemed quite tender for days afterwards but she ended up healing fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ow, poor chicken! I've never had enough of them to see the full range of what all can go wrong. The first few eggs looked a bit odd at times, but no emergencies... and after the fox came by, no more problems at all. Sigh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I was seeing if someone commented, a chickens egg can get broke inside for a few reasons not just blunt force. I had one prolapse this summer due to an egg that was broke inside. There was a hole in the vigina cavity and when the chicken tried to push it out it broke. We have urban chickens so they are well taken care of and the shells are not weak by any means. Also had another one do the same and live! Clean that prolapse of yolk and shelfs and stuff er back in! Cause of problem was too rich of food</p></div>		</li>
