<p>But I drive past a refinery that is always 100% of the time flaring.</p>
<p>Day or night, rain or shine. I've never seen it NOT flaring.</p>
<p>Surely this facility isn't under emergency conditions during every second of every day?</p>
<p>I don't work in the industry. So I'm incredibly ignorant on almost every aspect of the process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it can depend on environmental laws as well. If the refinery flares 100% of the time, they have a base load that is not recovered. Either the emissions cost then don't outweigh the costs of a compressor, or the gas cannot be recovered due to the gas quality (composition). I think mostly it's a financial choice, so if they want to reduce emissions, they can do it quite easily for the base load at least.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most flares need some constant natural gas purge to keep oxygen from entering the flare stack.  Most refy recover the majority or all waste gases as described above.</p></div>		</li>
