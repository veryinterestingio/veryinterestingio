			<div class="markdown"><p>I definitely drink too much, and recently got a diagnoses of severe adhd as an adult.<br />
I find drinking slows my head down to a degree where I can be present and enjoy company and feel much more relaxed and myself.<br />
I’ve been thinking about stimulant medication, but I’m concerned that it would make things worse, but all of the physical side effects that come with drinking I’m also concerned about. As it stands right now, I’m making it through life by coasting because I cannot focus enough to get shit done. Luckily I have the me of those jobs that is conducive for someone with adhd.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Caffeine and Alcohol don't just cancel each other out, homeostasis is way more complex than that. If I remember biochem correctly, caffeine is also a vasoconstrictor (below the neck), combined with depressing the nervous system spikes BP and puts a lot of stress on the heart. Add the fact that caffeine swaps behavior above the neck, you dump alcohol past the BBB faster, making you dumber and less coordinated.</p>
<p>Small doses friend, small. Doses.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Actually GABA agonists like Alcohol, Barbiturates, Benzodiazepines etc almost perfectly cancel out the effects of any stimulant. They are fairly commonly used in psychostimulant overdose treatment.</p>
<p>The problem with Caffeine is that it's similar to Cocaine, as it disrupts various ion channels that tells the heart when to beat. In fact, relative to lowest psychoactive dose vs average lethal dose, Caffeine is more dangerous than <em>Methamphetamine</em>.</p>
<p>The Alcohol <em>does not</em> fix that for you, but it does fix the anxiety/palpitations/profuse sweating associated with Caffeine overconsumption. So you can easily OD on Caffeine (and other stimulants as well) while consuming Alcohol because you won't feel the other side effects before your heart stops beating properly.</p>
<p>The classic example of this is a &quot;speedball&quot;, where a user intravenously uses both Cocaine and Heroin at the same time. The Cocaine keeps the user awake and alive in spite of taking too much Heroin, but it wears off faster so the Heroin kills them after a short time.</p>
<p>The &quot;half dozen&quot; of 4Lokos you mention elsewhere, assuming 600mg/can, is ~3.6g Caffeine. That is <em>far above</em> what most people will get hospitalized for. The fact that they got that far in the first place is thanks to the Alcohol, because severe symptoms will usually set in after consuming 600 to 800mg in a short time period (4-5 <em>LITERS</em> of Redbull/Monster, 8-10 standard cups of coffee).</p>
<p>I'm an avid user of Caffeine pills while drinking, and as long as you make sure to dose your Caffeine <em>before</em> you start drinking it's fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mixing uppers and downers supposedly makes the two drugs &quot;cancel&quot; out to some degree, allowing the user to take larger doses, while still enjoying other effects of the drugs like euphoria.  However taking these opposite drugs doesn't necessarily cancel each other out; the results can be dangerously unpredictable.  </p>
<p>Taking multiple drugs to juggle effects like this is also a major sign of addiction/abuse, someone who does that is clearly not a &quot;casual&quot; user.</p></div>		</li>
