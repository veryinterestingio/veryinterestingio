			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi! Thanks for asking. I've worked in the healthcare and science industry for 6 years. I've conducted research regarding skin cancer (specifically melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma) for many of those years. Histology and pathology of the skin was a natural part of that research, as well as teaching doctors at medical and dental schools as a part of their training.</p></div>		</li>
