			<div class="markdown"><p>He's using the wrong word:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Petrichor is the earthy scent produced when rain falls on dry soil.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That scent comes <em>after</em> the rain has started or stopped, not before.  The smell before the rain comes is likely ozone.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, but Petrichor is actually the word for the smell that comes <em>after</em> the rain.  What they might be thinking of is ozone, which is the smell before the rain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for clarifying the order of things ? I did mention ozone :) But, sometimes this smell occurs without an associated electrical storm to split off the ozone.. I suspect the preceding rise in humidity levels is behind the initial process of ‘reconstituting’ the plant oil/bacteria metabolites into a volatile form prior to actual rainfall finishing the process, meaning you can smell those compounds prior to water hitting the ground. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to expand on this, the smell of the sea is also a bacteria too, and the theory is that is causes clouds to seed so the wind picks up the spores of the bacteria so they can spread.  So I wouldn't be surprised if geosmin is for a similar reason.</p>
<p>Or that is how the theory currently is, either way, it's pretty cool how fragrant various plants and microorganisms can be just to either get them to help spread seeds, or a happy little accident from evolution. </p>
<p>Mint is another interesting one because it's nice and tasty to us, but to an insect it's toxic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, Petrichor is not the same thing, it only appears during and especially <em>after</em> rainfall. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Petrichor is the earthy scent produced when rain falls on dry soil.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That scent comes <em>after</em> the rain has being going a few minutes or has stopped, not before.  </p>
<p>The smell before the rain comes is likely <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/storm-scents-smell-rain/" target="_blank">ozone.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before the rain begins, one of the first odors you may notice as winds pick up and clouds roll in is a sweet, pungent zing in your nostrils. That's the sharp, fresh aroma of ozone—a form of oxygen whose name comes from the Greek word ozein (to smell). </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify because I can’t see it mentioned apart from in the link above; the reason you actually get the smell of ozone is because the Thunderstorm has down drafts which bring ozone down from the upper atmosphere</p></div>		</li>
