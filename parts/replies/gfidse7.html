			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you tell me why permanent retainers aren’t more common? I know several people who had braces, didn’t wear their retainer enough or at all, and end up with overcrowding again. I only know 1 with a permanent retainer and her parents had to push for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because you're paying someone to do the difficult task of evaluating your malocclusion, periodontal status, oral function/habits, growth (if applicable) etc and moving your teeth and jaws into a healthy position in a healthy manner. It's the same reason it's so expensive to pay someone to make a detailed and delicious meal using high quality ingredients, or paying someone to figure out how to write a program that can interpret your finger gesture and translate it and execute a specific task.</p>
<p>Orthodontists and dentists are professionals that have trained on how to fix your teeth while ensuring things don't go awry.</p></div>		</li>
