			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are talking about, say, baseball, the ball is moving too fast to smoothly track it (faster than your eyes can rotate). However, there is some evidence that other sorts of visual training may improve baseball performance (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982214000050" target="_blank">Deveau, Ozer, &amp; Seitz, 2014</a>). I am unaware of any attempts to use smooth pursuit training to specifically improve sports performance. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel it would be useful at leading a target if it was moving at a constant pace and being intermittently obscured. </p>
<p>Imagine someone playing paintball and they are aiming for another player running from obstacle to obstacle. Perhaps a trained smooth pursuer would be able to extrapolate the targets movement better while they were behind cover?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve noticed it’s very useful in art and drawing. One form of art practice that’s really common in drawing classes is blind contour drawing. You don’t look at the page you’re drawing on at all and instead just <em>slowly and steadily</em> follow the contours and lines of the object that you’re drawing. The goal is to train your eye to see every little detail of what you’re drawing as well as to get your hand and eye to become synchronized. You want to be able to control your eye movement and focus on the line instead of just darting around to random spots. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d imagine it would come in handy when scanning an area looking for something. For example if you’re looking for someone from a high vantage point, you could smoothly scan back and forth from the top of your field of vision to the bottom and have greater confidence that you didn’t skip any part of the area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like lookouts on ships, looking for either other ships on the horizon, or planes. (Maybe less useful now with modern tech, but yeah).</p>
<p>Read an old naval handbook on how to scan the sky for enemy planes, you scan left&gt;right, down a little, right&gt;left, repeat. Developing your &quot;smooth pursuit&quot; would be highly advantageous in this, I'd imagine.</p></div>		</li>
