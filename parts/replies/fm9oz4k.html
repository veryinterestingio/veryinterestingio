			<div class="markdown"><p>For a more ELI5: imagine water is a bunch of squares. If squares are put really close together they can block things. Now imagine water is the square wood planks your roof is made of and carbon dioxide is tiny balloons. Put the squares close enough and let the balloons go, they will be trapped in your house. Now imagine sugar is a whole bunch of termites quickly eating the roof. Let the balloons go and some of them will find the holes the termites ate through your roof. The termites (sugar, alcohol and salt) have made holes in your square planks (hydrogen networks) and now your balloons (carbon dioxide) are escaping.</p></div>		</li>

I have no idea what's going on with this question...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, exactly right. </p>
<p>There are very few if any substances (I can't think of a single one) you can dilute in water that will actually strengthen it outside of ionizing anomalies which polarize hydrogen atoms. This causes one hydrogen atom to face north and the other south, for lack of simpler terms. Unfortunately for our fizzy refreshment consumption, these polarized bonds will have a tendency to 'stick' to each other instead of the foreign substance, forming a tetrahedrally coordinated hydrogen bond between water molecules and not carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>If we did get the carbon to stick to the water, H2CO3 (carbonic acid) would be the building block of the stable carbonated water structure, but you definitely don't want to drink it in an appreciable quantity. It is a natural byproduct of carbonated beverages and our own respiration, which is why it's found in our blood. But it is poison, fortunately our bodies can take care of trace amounts through a process known as the Bicarbonate Buffer System. It basically strips it down to form a bicarbonate ion (HCO3- and H+), otherwise, well, we would all kill ourselves by breathing.</p>
<p>Sorry I got on a chem rant there, but I hope it answered your question.</p>
<p>For really geeky reading, you can check out this article on ions increasing strength of hydrogen bonds in water called... &quot;Ions increase strength of hydrogen bond in water&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, it still has an impact but not as much has to be used to get the sweetening effect, so there are less pathways created for the quick release of the CO2. It's also why diet soda seems to have more 'bite'.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Alcohol, sugar and salt all play a role in weakening these bonds which opens more pathways for carbon dioxide to escape.</p>

<p>So if you put salt in sparkling water, would it immediately start to fizz up? (Normally I'd test this myself but, you know... self-isolation and all.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Here's a fun experiment to live vicariously through YouTube until your isolation is complete (and thanks for self-isolating, it helps me keep my team and me healthy and your power and water running!):</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How odd. I figured that would have more to do with nucleation sites than anything else.</p>
<p>I guess you'd have to test it by making a very saturated saltwater solution and mixing that into sparkling water. That way, you avoid the nucleation issue.</p>
