While Mars is not the same color all over the planet, the reddish color we see is due to the surface. Its atmosphere is mostly transparent in the wavelengths of light that we can see (except during a dust storm!)</p></div>		</li>

<p>The simplest answer is that Venus has a very dense atmosphere, therefore much of the light is reflected back off into space.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The atmosphere isn't doing any reflecting, though. It's the clouds.</p></div>		</li>
