			<div class="markdown"><p>Altitude data is absolutely used to supplement GPS data. GPS is relatively accurate in x and y on the surface of the earth but is pretty garbage for altitude/elevation. Adding a barometric altitude changes how location is calculated and gives better positional accuracy. More simple GPS uses a lookup table for elevation but that limits the accuracy to how fine a resolution that lookup table has. Local weather data is available with calibrated barometric pressure so variations in weather can be compensated for.  </p>
<p>It turns +/- 50ft into +/- 5ft which is about the limit where you need to do the crazy spectrum analysis to compensate for error caused by signals through the atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The GNSS calculations aren't exactly rocket science: the satellite sends the user data of its position and current time of its clock. More advanced receivers also read the phase of the signal wave to enhance accuracy, but phones of course don't.</p>
<p>The elevation error is due to receivers measuring the ellipsoidal elevation, while Earth isn't a perfect ellipsoid. But still, in normal conditions you're getting a lot more accurate data even on cheap receivers than you do on some clock or phone barometer. At least I've never heard of such barometers getting 5ft error or even close to that.</p>
<p>If the satellite horizon is poor, your accuracy will suffer to all dimensions - vertical is usually about double the error horizontal is. But phones aren't very good at this in general - at work we usually get to less than 5cm elevation errors with our receivers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't understand why you think it's hard to see how having a secondary measurement of altitude could aid in location accuracy.</p>
<p>A cursory Google search yields many articles on using barometers to supplement GPS, particularly when GPS signals are weak, or with helping GPS calculate position more quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I'm a surveying engineer and I deal with GNSS data on an almost daily basis. What I'm saying is, it's very unlikely the phone has a barometer that's more accurate than satellite data. It'd need to deal with atmospheric pressure changes as well. </p>
<p>Most civilian receivers get to a few meters' accuracy, and the height error is around a double of that. If you have less than five satellites in sight, the accuracy will of course suffer, but most of the phone GNSS error is due to it being a cheap receiver with a cell tower assistance, so your accuracy suffers when the link tower connection isn't strong.</p></div>		</li>

<p>GPS is notoriously inaccurate when measuring elevation. 80 meter errors are not uncommon.</p>
<p>Supplementing position data with the barometer will make the elevation reading much more precise - especially if you don't have a height profile for your navigation map, if you're flying, or if you have few satellites available.</p></div>		</li>
