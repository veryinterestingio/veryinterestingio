			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for this answer! I'll suggest a couple additions.  </p>
<p>First, Freud does not seem to have been the one who &quot;invented therapy.&quot; Rather, he initially acknowledged the influential roles of treatment pioneers like Janet, and one could argue that Mesmer and Breuer were others. We often think of Freud as the first, but that is not borne out in history.  </p>
<p>Second, OP's question about Freud being considered the &quot;father of psychology&quot; is not held by many (in my view, most) psychologists. In history of psychology courses, for instance, Wilhelm Wundt is consistently acknowledged as the first psychologist. Freud was not a psychologist; he was a neurologist who was a (the?) founder of psychoanalysis. Psychology applies the scientific method to a broad range of questions beyond clinical issues (e.g., cognitive, social, health, education), and psychoanalysis, as u/Whatawaist notes, is pseudo-scientific by modern (e.g., neo-Popperian) standards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Finally someone mentions Wilhelm Wundt. He founded modern psychology and set the stage for psychology as a science.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wundt is generally regarded as the founder of psychology as a field of science, and experimental psychology in particular. The thing is, most people associate the word “psychology” with “therapy” or just the sliver of the field that is clinical psych. If someone asks me what I do for a living and I say “I’m a psychologist,” they think I’m a therapist (vs  someone who sits in front of a computer all day making notes about how kids move their hands and shoulders when they’re confused).
So if you’re having a discussion about the “father of psychology” out in regular life, Freud kinda is the father of modern psychology the way the word is being used in that conversation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve always assumed therapy roots back to the Socratic method of teaching - didn’t he teach philosophy and personal growth through his questioning? Curative therapy may find it’s modern roots in Freud but we’ve been helping people grow and learn about themselves (most of modern therapy) for almost as long as we’ve been recording western culture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Naw, it's far too reductive. His thoughts on the oedipus complex and penis envy etc aren't even that big in the repertoire of his thinking, they're just the most famous in popular media. That's only the final stage of a whole arc he called the &quot;Psychosexual Stages of Development&quot;, the second stage of which is where we get the popular term &quot;anally retentive&quot; for OCD-like traits from, and even that is just a part of the broader model. He also brought ideas like the &quot;Id, Ego, Superego Model&quot; and the notion of psychological defenses to the table, while incorporating concepts like the &quot;unconscious&quot; into their modern forms.</p>
<p>A lot of his ideas did die out from subsequent thought almost completely though, oedipus complex being a good example. But a lot of his ideas were incorporated in massively modified forms into later developments, for example the psychosexual stages theory found its way into the earlier models of the much more robust attachment theory, and psychological defenses are still employed today in various forms of psychotherapy. A large quantity of people following his heritage expanded on, derived, or reinterpreted his theories, leading to more modern modalities with clinical validity such as psychodynamic therapy. And it can't be said enough that, prior to him, people tended to view childhood as completely episodically distinct from adulthood, and so what happened to a child didn't strongly affect their later development, whereas Freud properly drew connections between childhood experiences and adult personality development and relationship patterns, which was to psychology as evolutionary theory was to biology. And just as we wouldn't consult Darwin for thought on developments in epigenetics, Freud-era psychoanalysis is similarly overshadowed by both his own descendants and the behavioural, psychopharmaceutical, and cognitive revolutions in the later 20th Century.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you understand how much harder it is to quantify discoveries and prove your claims in something as abstract as delving into the different manifestations of the human mind?</p>
<p>With something like math, we can prove it all neatly within itself, <em>a priori</em>.</p>
<p>Physics is almost there, a lot of it we can build upon theoretically from axioms similar to math, experiments are needed but it is all extremely verifiable and measurable. Same for chemistry, same for geology, same for biology.</p>
<p>But psychoanalysis? It’s not easy. You have to actually see the archetypes and understand them and realize that there is no way to verify their existence other than the fact that they are <strong>right in front of you and they make sense.</strong></p>
<p>Some people just can’t see them, and they call it pseudoscience, and there’s nothing you can really do to change their mind. But regardless, the ideas are there and they’re workable, but they will never catch the mainstream because the abstraction level is completely out of bounds to what everyone else wants to say science is.</p>
<p>If anyone disagrees with me on this, go and read something like Lacan and tell me how you’re supposed to prove any of that. Read Jung’s archetypes and tell me how you can verify anything in that book as remotely true.</p>
<p>You just can’t. But I don’t think that makes it pseudoscience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you’re describing is (charitably) more akin to philosophy, or literature. I wouldn’t pretend to know much about those, my PhD is in psychology.</p>
<p>But I can tell you that what differentiates scientific from pseudoscientific claims isn’t whether or not they can be verified, but whether they can be falsified.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because it's incorrect. Freud very much wanted psychoanalysis to be a scientific discipline. It's just doing science on what it is to be human is very different to doing science on physical phenomena, which was the dominant form of science at the time.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the contrast is American psychology which is where eugenics emerged from. As well as many other horrifying ideas we now reject outright.</p>
<p>That Freud is still taught as the foundation of mental health practice today in many universities across the world, supported by a century of disciplined academic study demonstrates Freud's success.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The die hard empiricist is boring at parties and even duller to read. Freud, like continental philosophy, believes there is more to life than data. Freud, for example, viewed people's histories as novels to be interpreted. That doesn't meant counting the instances of each letter, it means using empathy to understand the impact of important milestones and traumas on the psyche.</p></div>		</li>
