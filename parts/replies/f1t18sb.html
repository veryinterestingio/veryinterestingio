			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, scientifically, we say there is a supermassive black hole at the centre of our galaxy. We don't need to clarify (likely) in this instance as the level of evidence is substantial. It does not harm the investigative mindset.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because, despite exhaustive scientific research and observation, most of what we &quot;know&quot; about the universe beyond our planet is theoretical.  They might be damn good theories, and the accuracy of them is probably rather high, but at the end of the day, it's all a collection of reasonable educated guesses that build upon each other.  Those theories are constantly challenged, and every once in a while, a better theory becomes accepted going forward.  Or some observational fact will disrupt the accuracy of a theory, requiring either to rework the theory to match the facts, or to dispute the accuracy of the facts.</p>
<p>One of the oddest ones is dark matter.  Scientists believe it exists, because observed galaxies should be 10-20 times more massive than they are to act the way they do, according to physics as we know it.  Yet, this matter must be evenly dispersed, produce no localized gravitational effects, and be completely invisible to all detectable forms of radiation.  For all practical purposes, it doesn't exist and at the same time HAS to exist.  In more sensible terms, it's a sure sign that physics, and science as a whole (including methodology) still has some discovery left to it.  </p>
<p>So if black holes as conjectured even exist (they probably do) there might be a large one at the center of our galaxy, because that makes sense based on the theories and what observations we're able to do support that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most spiral and elliptical galaxies have a central supermassive black hole (SMBH)  I'm not sure about irregular galaxies. The SMBH however is usually only a small part of the galaxy's mass. Stars in a galaxy aren't orbiting a supermassive black hole, they're orbiting the combined mass of all the other stars, gas, dust, dark matter, and other stuff in the galaxy.</p>
<p>Since the SMBH is only a small part of the galaxy it's theorised it could be ejected, leaving behind a galaxy without it's SMBH. A black hole merger can do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I don't understand is, since galaxy are big, 100000 light years across, how gravity changes along the way ? i.e. wouldn't attraction sun feeling from Black hole at the centre is actually of blackhole mass 100000 year ago. And becauee we know gravity force that many year ago, we could have better picture of the universe ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn’t it more accurate to say that we actually don’t know what’s holding galaxies together since it appears they don’t have enough mass to coalesce, i.e. dark matter is the ‘missing mass’ required to account for the apparent gravitational sustainment of galaxies without them flying apart?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope.</p>
<p>There are Galaxies (large ones) where no SMBH has been inferred. We're not exactly sure why some do and some don't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have memories of a 'nova' type ( I don't think it was an actual episode ) show which explored the theory that SMBH are required for galaxies to form. As in,  the energy released during the formation of the black hole is what caused a large number of stars to form , thus creating the large clusters of stars we call galaxies. I also remember them saying something about they have found a SMBH at the center of every galaxy they have checked for one. Do you by chance have a reference to these galaxies without a SBMH at the center ?</p></div>		</li>
