			<div class="markdown"><p>For anyone interested and in the US, you might be able to find an imaging center that does these at a reasonable price. My doc was concerned about my high LDL and I told him I wasn’t interested in statins (I don’t really believe lipids are an issue if your blood pressure is under control). He gave me the number of an imaging center that did an elective coronary artery scan for $100 completely out of pocket.  It came back with a big fat 0 (perfect) and that $100 bought the best piece of mind.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's just incorrect.  High LDL is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, even in the absence of other risk factors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless you live in a part of India, this isn’t true. </p>
<p>Most parts of the world have an average background of 2-6msv, CT scans average 10-20 or more depending on scan. Unless you live in that place India that has a background radiation of 17-18msv, your ct scan is hitting you harder. </p>
<p>It’s why there is more concern with CT scans in paediatrics - there is a correlation between ct scans and mid/late life tumours in paeds.</p></div>		</li>
