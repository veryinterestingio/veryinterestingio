			<div class="markdown"><p>That's most likely because temperature really affects flavour in a lot of chemicals, water included. If the container is not perfectly sealed or it has any &quot;head space&quot; at all, heating water also drives dissolved gasses out of it over time, and that can also make the water's flavour change. </p>
<p>Go to your sink right now and take a sip of cold water. Then do the same for warm. You'll notice a real difference in the flavour. </p>
<p>To see the effect of dissolved gas, even in just tap water, take a cup of ice cold water from your aerated tap, and let it rest and warm up to room temperature, putting a paper towel over it for a couple hours to keep dust or bugs out. Give it a rap with a spoon to loosen any bubbles that formed on its side. Then get some fresh water at the same temperature from your tap (if you want to be precise, use a kitchen thermometer), and taste them both. The water that was allowed to warm up will often taste &quot;flatter&quot; than the fresh-poured water because it's given up much of its dissolved gas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While that seems feasible, you'd think you would be able to test it by heating up water in a pan and comparing the taste to warm bottled water. I've tasted warmed water before and it's a different experience to the bottled stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Comparing warm and cold tap water doesn't really prove your point because warm tap water does actually have a slightly different chemical make up because it passes through an additional step (the boiler) and also hot water dissolves minerals better than cold so it's picking up stuff from the plumbing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to hate the taste of water that had been sitting by my bed overnight. I don't notice it as much now, my taste in general is a lot less sensitive. I would notice bubbles in the water too and associate that with the bad taste.</p>
<p>I guess this explains why. Thanks.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Don't leave your bottles in the sun. Drinking water like that a few times shouldn't do any damage, but we are still figuring out how plastics in our body impact us. The good thing is we are able to excrete the plastics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Problem with some nanoparticles, micro-plastics and petro chemicals from plastics is that they can transfer into the cellular structure with water. Studies are still determining how this can effect dna and other basic cellular functions. </p>
<p>So we can eat plastics and crap it out, if it breaks down small enough it becomes part of our dna and we evolve into plastic hybrids. Eventually man will have a suction cup detachable penis- said no one ever except maybe in song.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The main concern with refilling one-use-intended plastic bottles is sanitation, not chemical leaching. Once your lips touch the bottle or you crack the seal and air gets in, the odds increase that the &quot;pure&quot; water in there gets pathogens in it.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, because those bottles are meant to go through a washing machine that does a pretty good job of sanitizing them.</p>
<p>Most people don't put a one-time-use thin plastic bottle through the wash because it'll just partially melt and collapse. Best they do is just rinse it out a little using the tap, and most people don't even do that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have never put any of my sports bottles into the washing machine either. Rinse the bottle with water after use and leave it open to dry; nothing is going to grow in a dry environment.

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not the best of sources, but I saw this article earlier and thought of the question. I was hoping there was some validity to it, or to have Reddit explain the real reason to me. No real substance was given in the article about <em>why</em> other than it's dangerous. It didn't explain the dangers of the original water in there. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably there are already other users talked about this, but single use plastic bottle is safe to be refilled. however, you do need to treat it like your drinking glass or water bottle. Clean it up after some time, because bacteria (or in some disgusting cases, thin layer of algae) can grow on the inside after repeated use without cleaning. I assume you wash your drinking glass or plates about every day right? </p>
<p>expiry date in water bottles and such does not necessarily indicates that it is not safe to drink the water anymore, but it is required by the government to have an expiry date printed. FMCG companies usually put it around 2 or 3 years after production date.</p></div>		</li>
