			<div class="markdown"><p>A number of countries have condemned them, and a few others (Like Germany) stopped selling them weapons.  If you want to know why no one has taken military action against them, I can think of two main reasons. </p>
<p>First, the Saudis provide a commodity that is extremely important to the world's economy. Disrupting that, even a little, isn't worth the economic trouble it would cause.  </p>
<p>Second, even if the world wanted to intervene militarily, without the US that would be really difficult.  Almost no other country has the power projection capability that would be required. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>There's also balance-of-power concerns. It's not just about disruption - if the US took over Saudi Arabia, even if the oil kept flowing, rival nations would not be happy, because now the US has a major strategic advantage. They would seek to gain their own protected oil resources. These sorts of things tend to have domino effects into war. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In large part because they‚Äôre US backed and in other large part because lots of countries are reliant on their oil. It‚Äôs like there being a horrible gang in the old west and when the sheriffs of the region look into how to deal with it they find out that gang also owns the coal the railroads which several of their towns depend on need AND they have the marshals on payroll so there aren‚Äôt really any options, besides say the gang is bad, that do much besides fuck themselves and their town. If either of those factors change then the question of ‚Äúwhat can we do‚Äù opens up a lot possibly even putting options on the table (and if the oil reliance goes away then the US backing will likely disappear too and both changing puts all the options on the table) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically Saudi Arabia was invited by the Yemeni government. </p>
<p>Yemen is in a civil war right now, and still has a President who fled the capitol after rebels seized the city. So technically Saudi Arabia is helping the current legitimate government of Yemen fight the rebels. By international standards the war isn't illegal.</p>
<p>The question that is popping up is whether US participation is legal. Once again, the US is invited and by international law is not fighting an illegal war, however by domestic law that becomes a grey area.</p>
<p>The US President is technically required to seek Congressional approval before committing the military to combat (even the law that states that is controversial) and Congress never actually said President Obama or President Trump can commit forces in Yemen. Hence, if the President doesn't get approval to be in the war, then the war is illegal (from a US involvement persepctive). </p>
<p>As a sidenote: Afghanistan and Iraq are not illegal under US law by these standards. In both situations, President Bush got Congressional approval. However President Clinton sending forces to Kosovo is illegal because he never got Congress to ok it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that &quot;illegal under international law&quot; is a bit like &quot;violating the bro code&quot;. Since there is no governing power with the responsibility and authority necessary to impose a penalty for violations of the law, it's not really 'law' at all. In a very real sense, the only international law is &quot;might makes right&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not <em>really</em> true - it's akin to private law, especially contract law. Where parties (States) enter into a contract with one another, they also contract for remedies for any breaches of that contract (i.e., the type and manner of the imposition of penalties).   </p>
<p>Penalties for breaches of international law are usually <a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-are-economic-sanctions" target="_blank">economic sanctions</a>, and they are certainly enforceable. There are plenty of ongoing economic sanctions. They have a <a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/un-sanctions-mixed-record" target="_blank">mixed-record</a> for effectiveness. There are also options to bring lawsuits against sovereigns for violations of their international law commitments (often treaties or conventions that the sovereign was a signatory to) in either an international arbitration forum or a domestic court with relation to the dispute. A judgment (or &quot;award&quot;)  against a sovereign state can be used to freeze that state's (and their citizens') assets in countries with financial institutions that have access to those assets. For example, a judgment against Saudia Arabia for their role in 9/11 could be used to freeze the amount of the judgment in reach of U.S., UK, and European financial institutions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except this still falls under the &quot;might makes right&quot; category: the major powers are imposing standards on everyone else that they are not subject to themselves. Moreover, those standards aren't really &quot;laws&quot; so much as &quot;whatever we feel like at the time&quot;.</p>
<p>If what a minor nation is doing is helpful to one of the major powers or is merely beneath the notice of all of them, then there are no repercussions. If what a minor nation is doing is harmful to the interests of the major powers, they'll trump up some technicality to justify their involvement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I tend to agree with this - international law is ‚Äúsoft law‚Äù and when I first studied it, I couldn‚Äôt believe that I‚Äôd been living in this fallacy that international law was some kind of set in stone, serious kind of law. Maybe that‚Äôs a pessimistic view of public international law, and I know this is probably the best that can be done, but I have no faith in international law beyond private commercial law ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è </p></div>		</li>
