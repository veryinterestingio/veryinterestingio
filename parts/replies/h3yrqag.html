			<div class="markdown"><p>To piggy back on OP's comment.</p>
<p>In addition, when you think of the Liver &quot;growing back&quot; it's not quite what you're probably imagining. Say when someone donated a part of their liver to someone else. People usually say the liver halves will grow back to &quot;full size&quot;, which is actually a misnomer because the liver has 2 lobes, and when you donate a part of your liver you are in actuality donating one of your two liver lobes. Those individual liver lobes then grow into a &quot;full size&quot; liver consisting of one large lobe. </p>
<p>This just means one person cannot donate their liver more than once.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vascular structures are different from person to person. I'm assuming that you can't grow a one size fits all liver. Possibly at some point they can make a frame of some kind, and use stem cells to grow a new liver for a particular patient, so it wouldn't be rejected.</p></div>		</li>
