<p>Inexpensive is relevant when you are talking a cost of roughly $1,000 per lane foot to pave. The beauty of asphalt is that it is recyclable and ready to be driven on as soon as compaction has been completed. That being said, there are some caveats to that as well. Asphalt prefers to be when it's warm (if it cools too quickly it will crack). Concrete paving on the other hand sets up too quickly in the heat and the water can freeze if it's too cold.</p></div>		</li>
