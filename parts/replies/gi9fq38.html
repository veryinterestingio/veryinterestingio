			<div class="markdown"><p>We didn't have an eye rolling thing in the household either while I was growing up. Instead, my sister and I intentionally picked it up through media because it's a wonderfully condescending gesture to people who know what it means but don't have a culture of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was hugely snubbed by a three year old once, the eye roll, the raised eyebrows, the shrug... when I asked her where she was going alone in a hotel lift with 20 floors! Pissed me off, but then I was adult enough to call the reception. Yup, had no wish to meet the parents.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always felt the meaning behind eye-rolling on a base-level is a gesture of looking for social confirmation of one‚Äôs opinion that what you just heard or observed is ridiculous. Like you are doing a quick check for eye contact with other people who would obviously agree with your assessment, whether there really are others around or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do a stare into the void, followed by a slow blink (to see if maybe I fell asleep without realizing), while I think about what I just saw or heard and whether I believe that it actually happened. Maybe a quick moment of introspection on how my life has lead to that moment. </p>
<p>My mom rolls her eyes and sighs a lot. I haven't asked what her coping process involves, I'm scared that she's possibly getting more processing accomplished in a shorter period of time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't seen anyone see it for themselves but it's unlikely to be used in isolation (there will be other audiovisual cues, such as groans, grunts, posture, or other facial expressions) so I guess the feeling still gets across.</p>
<p>But it's still novel enough that you can find blog posts explaining eye rolling and shrugs to people who want to become better at speaking English, or to people who want to enjoy English TV shows/movies more.</p></div>		</li>
