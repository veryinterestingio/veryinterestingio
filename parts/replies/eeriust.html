			<div class="markdown"><p>The main point it's frequency.</p>
<p>You will not be there every day for a year hitting the rock every second.</p>
<p>In the very same way you will not use metal tools on your teeth every day 3 times a day, and so..</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The benefits of having your tartar removed overweight the few scratches you get from the metal since you do it once a year.</p>
<p>Using every day, 3 times a day, a toothpast with brushing granulates can erode your enamel in the long run.
A toothpaste that degrade your teeth even if it takes 10 years is not a safe bet as a toothpaste.</p>
