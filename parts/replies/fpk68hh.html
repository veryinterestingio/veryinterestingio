			<div class="markdown"><p>And we can't forget the exceptions. The mid-century modern style usually associated with Eichler (and frank lloyd wright, I suppose) also had this vision of huge, open living spaces with smaller bedrooms and the like because they wanted the family to be out there with each other and not isolated. Fighting. Yelling. Arguing about the fucking TV. The stereo. Stop touching me. No you stop touching me. Mom! Leave your sister alone. Jesus christ shut the fuck up! GO TO YOUR ROOMS.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eichler homes had extra small bedrooms, when eichler would stage the model home for the neighborhood he would bring in custom smaller furniture to make the rooms look larger....just enough smaller to pull off the illusion, but not too small that it was noticeable lol
(I Grew up in an eichler home, and my family business maintains the heating systems in the eichler homes in the SF Bay area)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed awesome! I think the other part may be home heating and cooling. A lot of older homes used baseboard heating which is less efficient <a href="https://www.homeadvisor.com/r/baseboard-heating-options/" target="_blank">https://www.homeadvisor.com/r/baseboard-heating-options/</a>. It is likely cheaper to heat small rooms separately with that inefficiency and depending on the controls, only heat selected rooms. Similarly, the 70s was the start of the real home AC boom. Those were window units. Buying individual units adds up. So often people would just cool selected rooms / parts of the house. Smaller rooms also help with that, as you could have less powerful units and therefore cheaper units, while still cooling selected rooms effectively.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Temperature control was definitely a big factor. Windows weren't as good at insulating and they might have even had small cracks at the sides. It was easier to keep a small room well heated, and spend most of the day there. Then have heavy comforters for sleeping.</p>
<p>Not in the US, but my grandparents would spend all day slowly boiling something for food or for tea in the kitchen and only warm up the rest of the house if they had guests.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We <em>have</em> to have wall-to-wall carpeting because so much cold air comes up through the (not very nice) original wood floors from the cellar. Switched to gas heat about 25 - 30 years ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't see mentioned anything about the kit homes that you could order from the Sears catalog.  A lot of the Craftsman bungalows of the 30's, 40's could be ordered as a kit from Sears, shipped on rail to you and then you could assemble/have it assembled.  Obviously this would be smaller, more affordable housing of the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One twist I got through while reading : how you expressed it means &quot;more smaller rooms (than bigger rooms, for the same surface)&quot;. Considering the chosen answer here, it seems to be smaller rooms as less surface. </p>
<p>So I think you should have wrote : &quot;<strong>Why do older homes, like everything pre 70's especially, seem to have</strong> <del>more</del> <strong>smaller rooms?</strong> &quot; :)</p></div>		</li>

<p>In AZ it's interesting, the pre fab came out like an explosion. Like pre-196X all rafters and post-196X all pre fab trusses regardless of builder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. The 60‚Äôs saw some enormous changes for timber construction - an the prefab was a big part of that. They also do pre-fab wall panels too, not sure how new that is compared to the trusses, but it lets a crew frame up an entire house in an astonishingly short time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always wondered why this isn't more common. When you're building 50 or 100 houses with 3 or 4 floor plans, it seems like it would be cheaper to factory-build the wall panels just like you do the trusses, and then just assemble on site.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>House I grew up in came prefab. Built in 66-67, I believe it was designed by National Homes. One of my earliest memories is watching them pull the walls out of the open-top trailer with a crane. But it was more of a short-lived fad, as most of the construction I watched in the booming Chicago burbs of the 70s was done on site, with the exception of the prefab trusses.</p>
<p>Edit: A lot more than a fad, it was popular for starter homes in the postwar era. <a href="https://jamesfigy.com/2014/08/22/why-mass-produced-national-homes-are-interesting-to-me/" target="_blank">https://jamesfigy.com/2014/08/22/why-mass-produced-national-homes-are-interesting-to-me/</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Building off that (lol), standardization was big too going into the 90s. Same size stuff in all homes means builders can design homes with certain expectations in mind, which reduces cost and time to completion of a build for everything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh definitely. I worked with a guy that came from a production builder and it was interesting to hear his insight. Said all the selections was like herding cattle through an IKEA. Except instead of a futon, it was all the new build items. </p>
<p>I wish there was more variety in new homes, but I get it. So much more efficient with only a couple floor plans. There was a development by my old house and I swear they were framing a two story, 3000SF home in like 10 days. Just wonder how straight those walls were!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Standardization: Traditional Japanese homes were highly standardized. The tatami (woven straw) mats that made up the floor came in standard sizes. So much so that rooms were measured in mats: four mats, 10 mats, 5 1/2 mats, etc. Doorways, ceiling heights, etc., were standardized. I don't know how far back into the past that started.</p></div>		</li>
