<p>The tl;dr is that electromagnetism appears to be a fundamental property of the universe. We can explain lots of other things in terms of electromagnetism, but we can’t really explain electromagnetism in terms of anything else. In other words, it really is just like that.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Can you elaborate on this? You mentioned that no energy is being used to create the force, so why do they seek the lowest energy state? What's the point in that? To have the lowest/highest amount of force being applied to it, perhaps? </p>
<p>I'm confused.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you let a ball fall mid-air ball will fall to the ground. That's it's lowest energy state.</p>
<p>You need energy to lift the ball of the floor.</p>
<p>Similiarly, if you let two magnets near one another, the opposite poles will connect, and you need energy to pull them apart.</p>
<p>Like another comment said, that's just the way it is in a gravitational/magnetic field.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, but when they connect they move other magnetic objects <strong>from rest</strong>. </p>
<p>Where does the energy come from to do <em>that?</em> I'm totally confused.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can think of two examples a regular person might relate to.</p>
<p>The 1st is gravity. What makes gravity? Why does mass want to be together? These are questions answered by quantum physics. But the easy answer is the same: mass together is the lowest energy state and therefore over time, it congragates. </p>
<p>The 2nd is diffusion. Think about spraying air freshener. Why does it spread out? Theres not energy input. Nothing is pushing the air freshener molecules with energy to spread out. Yet it does. Why? Same reason. It's the lowest energy state.</p>
<p>Theres a slightly more complicated answer involving entropy which helps me a lot more. Essentially: the most likely state of matter, statistically, is also the lowest energy state. So aor freshener and air mixed evenly is the most likely state (what are the odds the they arrange themselves separately by chance? Very low) and that's what everything trends to over time. It TAKES energy to separate gasses. Therefore, mixed up gasses provide the lowest energy state. It's a chicken and egg explanation but one I find helpful.</p>
<p>Magnets work like these two examples, just a different quantum principle that you and I wont get. Many things happen without external energy input due to gradients. Magnetic, gravitational, concentration. Whatever. The truth is some external energy was provided to create a non-optimal state and the action you're confused about is simply using that energy to return to the lower energy state. Something pushed magnets together before they separated. That's where the energy came from; its stored as potential energy which is very conceptual but very real. Someone pushes a rock up a mountain; then it falls down &quot;on its own with no input&quot;. Same thing.</p>
<p>Theres plenty of short YouTube explanations on what actually causes magnetism but it's all very boiled down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So why doesn’t all matter act like air freshener particles and just float around aimlessly?</p>
<p>But I figure the answer to that is that air freshener particles will eventually settle on a surface. Which brings it back to the “why do air freshener particles spread out?” Because the kinetic energy of their release from compression applies force to them and they just sorta bounce around until losing all kinetic energy and then settle on various surfaces.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is incorrect to assume that diffusion happens without energy input. The energy required to spread droplets of air freshener around comes from the motion of air molecules. The amount of motion of molecules is what we effectively call temperature. So when the droplets spread, they take some energy from the air molecules, thereby lowering the temperature and increasing the entropy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of a ball on a hill. Being at rest at the bottom of the hill is a lower energy state than being at the top of the hill or being in motion down the side. When the ball rolls down the hill, then comes to a stop, it has reached the lowest energy state it can. That doesn't mean any energy was destroyed. The energy was simply dispersed among the air and ground molecules via friction and such. Energy tends to disipate or spread out until it is evenly distributed across a system. It's a thermodynamics thing. There isn't really a point or reason for it. That's just how the universe seems to work.</p></div>		</li>
