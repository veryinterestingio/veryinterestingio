			<div class="markdown"><p>Am I right in recalling the size of a galaxy is related to the size of the black hole? If so it doesn't mean anything special I suspect other than bigger galaxies have more matter to form more massive black holes but you seem like someone who could provide some detailed info.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah the most likely idea right now is that the SMBH and the bulge grow together from the same source of matter - it comes out that the SMBH is on average 1/1000th the mass of the bulge. But there might be feedback effects where the hot accretion disc affects how the bulge grows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait....<em>the dark matter</em> collapses into a ball? As in, our entire galaxy, and everything in it, is in a big ball of dark matter that acts as an invisible sort of black hole, dragging in other matter and dark matter? Or am I misunderstanding what you're saying?</p>
<p>I think I understand that a non-supermassive black hole is made by a collapse of incredibly high density matter in on itself, is this similar to what the dark matter is doing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The galaxy is indeed inside a giant halo of dark matter. The density of the dark matter is really low though - it just adds up to a big mass because it fills up so much volume. </p>
<p>The dark matter doesn't collapse down to a singularity like a black hole. It's a big fluffy ball of dark matter particles. If you look up pictures of elliptical galaxies, then that's the loose shape of it - just with dark matter rather than stars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, so it just kind of collects due to the gravity of the big fluffy ball, and this helps to hold all the matter within it, like a feather duster holds dirt particles in it?</p></div>		</li>
