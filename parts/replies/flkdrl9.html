			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the right explanation, lots of bad explanations on here.</p>
<p>Water can enter the system 10's to 100's of kms fron the source. So far that people don't realise the entry point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes sense. I hiked to the highest point in Utah, almost 14,000 feet and just a few hundred feet from the top there was quite a lot of water flowing and was September.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's really unlikely that's a spring that high. Near the top of King's peak, since it's the highest point, it's almost certainly missing a higher source of hydraulic pressure to create a spring. There can certainly be hollows in peak that cause seeps, though.</p>
<p>While at a molecular level, water can be pulled against gravity by capillary action, it cannot be pushed above its point of origin by mere gravity and atmospheric presssure.</p></div>		</li>
