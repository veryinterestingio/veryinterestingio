			<div class="markdown"><p>Glad you’re interested! On the technical side, mechanical, electrical, and civil engineering skills with a marine/ocean focus are valuable for the industry. Experience in deploying, recovering, and maintaining marine systems will become more important as more projects go into the ocean. You also need an appetite for working on open-ended problems in challenging environments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you elaborate on this? What does it mean to, “deploy, recover, and maintain marine systems”?</p>
<p>Something I’ve learned is that appetite doesn’t matter so much as who you know, unfortunately. Who do we need to know?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Join INORE (the International Network on Offshore Renewable Energy)!! They're a networking group for grad students and early-career professionals working in ocean renewable energy. They host workshops, networking events, and symposia along most major MHK conferences. Even if you're just getting started, it's a great group to get involved with and meet others interested in the field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Deploying, recovering, and maintaining marine systems are part of a broad category of marine operations or maritime jobs. A university education isn’t necessarily required for these, though the majority of jobs right now are in science and engineering for research and development. Think working on a research vessel or at a port or shipyard. And, yes to the post about INORE! It’s a great organization for networking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are always labor and boating/shipping jobs that will be involved that don't require a degree. Marine mechanic. Marine welding. There are options.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely not! As this is a growing field, there is an expectation that these types of jobs will increase across all education levels. There are already jobs in marine energy in particular places and may not require a college degree. That being said, I'd consider <em>how</em> you want to be involved, as education may be the ticket to getting into a particular position. </p>
<p>Message me if you want more details :)</p></div>		</li>
