			<div class="markdown"><p>Often, I find, its less about not wanting to do the task on the whole. I still want to do it. I still want it done. What I don't want is the person who gave me an order to think I take orders.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the theory of psychological reactance covers that! Typically people won't completely stop the task, they will restore their freedom in-part or in-full. So, you may still do the task but like mutter to yourself. </p>
<p>Reactance is an interesting thing measured with an intertwined model of cognition and emotion (anger).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Theory of Reactance and the other main theories in psychology are so intriguing! Reading about them helped me to better understand people’s reasoning behind their actions and how to battle negative reactions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious how anger, in particular, relates to instances of reactance and whether anger presents itself as a response to such instances or rather as a precursor to them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me it's not so much the feeling I'm taking orders. It's more that I enjoy taking the initiative, and maybe surprising someone by having done something earlier or better than expected.</p>
<p>If someone nips in and asks me to do it before I get the chance to do it off my own back, I just feel like all I'm doing is what's expected of me, which is boring, and not going to impress anybody.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is more like me as well but I can't figure out why it is so important to me for people to be impressed by me.  I mean in general it is a good thing but I worry it is too important to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Had to go far down for this. I believe this describes the phenomenon op is asking about more accurately than other responses. You can read about it in Eric Knowles’ book resistance and persuasion.</p></div>		</li>
