<p>I find that video a bit obnoxious. The criticism at the start is disingenuous. The model he criticises is not bad in the way he implies by calling it wrong because it comes with the assumptions of being a linear model. He then presents a more generalised model which of course is going to be more accurate, that is the nature of relaxing assumptions. It is not difficult to take the same approach as he has and just say his model is wrong as he makes assumptions which he has not mentioned in the video (and he may not even be aware he has made them). It is a silly approach as all models are wrong but that does not make them useless as we can learn things from them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, all models are approximations, but some are better approximations than others. He does make several assumptions and simplifications, and he states them at the beginning. The fact is the hydrostatic pressure mode provides a better explanation than the &quot;water being stretched&quot; model.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He states some assumptions but not all! There is a rather major one he has completely neglected which mans his model can not predict the tidal amplitude! What he misses is that there is a constant of proportionality between the gravitational potential and the tidal deformation amplitude known as the tidal Love number h (I prefer to be explicit and say the tidal displacement Love number so as not to be confused with various other Love numbers relating to the response of a fluid body to a force). Now h is a nontrivial thing even for a homogenious body, he specified that his object is nonhomogenious and hence one would have to consider what h is in order to make a more accurate prediction of the tidal amplitude. This is just one of a great many assumptions the video has made and failed to mention, just like how the video criticises the linear model because not all assumptions are explicitly mentioned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would also say I have as much disagreement with the term squeezing as I do stretching but am happy to use both when trying to provide a more understandable explanation to someone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just to add. Not saying the content of the video is wrong, but how it is presented is acting like all the other explanations are wrong and gives an air of superiority despite not being all that shit hot in their own explanation!</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is true, but readers take note that better does not necessarily mean more accurate. The reason we use approximations in the first place is because they're as accurate as our use case demands and they're easier to work with than an exact solution. If three equations yield the exact same answer, but one takes 100x as much computional power as another, and the third 10,000x, which is the best?</p>
<p>Aside: this is also why Einstein didn't prove Newton wrong, or why Einstein will never be wrong himself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was an excellent video. I know the broad details about tides=squeezing water, but there were a lot of details and examples in there that were great viewing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Isn't that the same type of figure of speech as saying &quot;lift or stretch the oceans&quot;? </p>
<p>I mean that's both the end result of the sum of those tidal acceleration vectors.</p></div>		</li>
