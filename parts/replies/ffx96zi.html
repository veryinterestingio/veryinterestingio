			<div class="markdown"><p>To change the RF (radio frequency) power! SAR stands for Specific Absorption Rate, and it essentially is a measurement of the amount of RF energy your body absorbs when your phone is near it. If your phone outputs more RF energy it can send/receive better signals which is good, until you stick that phone next to your head. A SAR sensor will detect whether your phone is near or in the presence of your body (head, hand, body or free space which is no body detected) and change the RF accordingly. The trick is reducing the RF output so that it falls within safety standards, but not so much that you drop a call every time you put your phone to your ear!</p>
<p>I test Over The Air performance but have done some SAR testing for various devices at work. Itâ€™s a really neat field if you are interested in antenna design/performance!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a handful of reasons. One of the bigger ones is to tell if the phone might be against your ear. If it is against your ear and the screen is on, your face can tap buttons. If it <em>was</em> against your ear and now it's not, you might want to see some buttons or a keypad so it should bring the screen back.</p>
<p>It also enables a handful of other weird features apps rarely use. For example, Waze has a mode where you can initiate some commands by waving your hand over the phone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Considering it's called SAR sensor, my guess would be for the device to pass SAR (Specific Absorption Rate) test required by most regulatory certification bodies such as FCC in the US and CE in EU. There is a limit to the amount of radio energy you can send out to a human like body. But reducing transmit signal strength means you'll have poorer radio performance for the phone. So in order to meet both requirement, they added this sensor so that they could reduce the transmit power when sensor is activated, and pass the SAR test, then blast at whatever power level it needs to when the sensor is deactivated and pass the performance tests. I'm very curious what kind of phone would do that though. How bad would the antenna design be to having a need for this.</p></div>		</li>
