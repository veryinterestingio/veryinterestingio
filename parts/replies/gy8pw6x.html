			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder about your point about ARR: &quot;doesn't inform your audience much unless they are familiar with the odds of it happening in the first place&quot;... some things to think about:</p>
<p>If ARR is 25%, I don't need to know anything else... my risk is 25% subtracted from my risk, no matter what the baseline risk is. 50% &gt; 25%.  70% &gt; 45%.</p>
<p>If RRR is 25%, I have absolutely no idea how much &quot;real&quot; benefit I get unless I know my baseline risk -- as you suggested above was needed for *ARR.  Is my risk reduced &quot;a lot&quot;, like 40% &gt; 30%, or not reduced much at all, like 1% &gt; 0.75%.</p>
<p>ARR is much more descriptive of the total magnitude of benefit, and why we talk about NNT (numbers needed to treat) which is calculated from ARR.</p>
<p>Also, I agree ARR can't be compared across studies, but neither can RRR.  Numbers shouldn't be compared unless from a head to head trial, or otherwise highly scrutinized for confounders as to why they might be different based on how they were each studied (i.e. basically don't do it).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hello, fellow pharmacist! You’re not wrong, but I was thinking more along the lines of 1) a more layperson-heavy audience, and 2) instances (like COVID) where the control event rate is very low.</p>
<p>Jumping back to the above numbers again, an ARR of 0.7% can look deceptively unimpressive <em>without any other information</em>. That’s a number needed to treat of ~143! Which is in turn a bit high. And with no context, a lot of people could reasonably decide that’s not a shot they’d be willing to take (pun intended).</p>
<p>BUT, once you let them know the risk in that study was only 0.736% to begin with, NOW they get it! It basically eliminates their risk. Or, you could just report the RRR in the first place.</p>
<p>Complicating all of this is the way vaccines are studied. The study durations are event-driven, i.e, “we will analyze data once X cases occur in Y placebo participants”. Even with a <strong>perfect</strong> vaccine, your ARR is now capped at X/Y. Setting higher targets for that number in your study to intentionally get a higher ARR is... questionably ethical at best, and an insult to public health at worst.</p>
<p>And you’re right, you can’t blindly compare RRR across studies, because of design differences (like the event cap, in this case). But if the study design factors all lined up, (or if you control for them, as in a meta-analysis) you should theoretically be able to look at a single treatment across different baseline risks, and the RRR should stay relatively consistent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>hahaha of course the pharmacists find each other on here.</p>
<p>Yes I agree with all that you said there, good points.  Not sure the vaccine would be accepted if it dropped our risk from 57.6% to 57.1% haha. It would've been really interesting see the vaccines studied in a setting like India right now, with higher infection rates overall.</p>
<p>I think giving ARR is important though even when risk is higher.  For example, people with uncomplicated hypertension still take treatment even though benefit could be similarly small in some cases -- although that might be due to a lack of proper risk/benefit discussion as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But a reduction from 26% to 1% is very different from a reduction from 85% to 60%. ARR and RRR both require careful context.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point, when discussing risks, its best to have an understanding of both/all -- the baseline risk and the ARR (and RRR as a consequence)</p></div>		</li>
