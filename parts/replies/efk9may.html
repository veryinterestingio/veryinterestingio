			<div class="markdown"><p>To piggy back on this, one reason for such an extent of lowlands and barrier islands and continental shelf is that the Appalachian mountains were dumped into the Eastern part of the continent over millions of years. Which makes the extent of the barrier island a rather unique feature to North America (though, really, every bit of land and sea has it's own story that lead to what is now). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like to think of everything east of the Appalachians to be a very very very very slow mudslide into the Atlantic. I know that's not exactly accurate but it's pretty close. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A great idea, but you can think bigger!  All land (even that below water) is a 'giant mudslide'.  The only exceptions will be active tectonic areas (plate boundaries mostly, but a few mid plate hotspots).  And even these cut both ways.  The Himalayas rise, the Great rift in Kenya sinks.  </p>
<p>If water and gravity had their way, the Earth would be as smooth as a babies butt...</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Though, there is an &quot;Eastern Continental divide&quot; &amp; everything to the west of it flows into the Gulf of Mexico. The Appalachians are among the oldest mountains on Earth, in some places over 1 Billion years of age. They have found it's ancient sediments as far away in Arizona along what is now the Colorado River. In their youth, The Appalachians were purported to be as high as the Himalayas, and the modern day Atlas Mountains of North Africa; The Scottish Highlands, And the Northern Alps of Scandinavia were all part of it before the Super-Continent, Pangea, broke up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep! You can see it when you look at the North and South forks of long island. They were formed by two glacial moraines, and if you have a topographic nap, you can see it continues along the length of the entire island. That's also why North shore beaches are rocky, but South shore beaches are sandy. The North shore is made up of coarse glacial till, but the South shore is the outwash plane where all the sand and silt was washed away from the melting glacier. Geology is neat!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>CA surf is solid on south facing beaches with good breaks, for the most part. Everything from Huntington to Malibu was solid, especially because they’re protected by the Channel Islands and major predators are on the far side of those islands. </p>
<p>West and north facing beaches give killer rip currents and tough sets. Anything north of Half Moon Bay is a no-go for me</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd also add the Appalachian chain has been the result of multiple orogenies (mountain building periods) and predates the dinosaurs.  The ice age scoured the northern sections and left terminal continental glacial moraines in the form of long island and cape cod.  Coasts like Maine's are the end result of ancient volcanic periods, uplifts, etc and then scoured by glaciers.  What is left is very hard, ancient rock.  South of that you get banks formed from millions of years of erosion of the Appalachians and silt like in North Carolina.</p>
<p>The Pacific coast is much younger, the mountains are more recent and like the parent comment said is a subduction zone, unlike the East coast where there is no such zone or trenches. </p></div>		</li>
