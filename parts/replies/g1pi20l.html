<p>Which makes sense. If you are doing enough to limit COVID, you are doing more than enough to limit the flu.   </p>
<p>If public health measures weaken enough to have a flu season, COVID will have a devastating impact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an American, that would reassure me more if the US actually was consistently doing enough to limit COVID. I am far from an expert, but the sentiments I have heard from the experts I do know seem to suggest that the fragmented, reactionary, and regionally inconsistent nature of the US COVID response means the flu could more easily establish a foothold here and began to circulate than it would in more countries with more effective public health responses.</p>
<p>Edit: grammar, also lockdowns -&gt; public health responses</p></div>		</li>
