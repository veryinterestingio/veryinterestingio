<p>Mastering is the process of ‘evening out’ a track or a group of tracks into a coherent single/album that matches <em>all of the rest of recorded music</em> so that it does not sound out of place. So that the Equalisation of the entire mix fits with other material in the same genre. So that the dynamic range fits with other material in the same genre, so that the overall amplitude fits with other material in the same genre.  </p>
<p>It is also the process of producing the ‘original copy’: “The Master”. In the past, this would often be a physical artefact like a gold record or a glass CD. Nowadays, a 96kHz 24-bit wave files could be considered the ‘Master Copy’ (as this is what is required to get the “mastered for iTunes” stamp on the iTunes Store)</p>
<p>Re-mastering may well go back as far into the process as re-mixing the original recordings and then mastering it again. But often it’s really just the process of digitising analogue masters and bringing them up to a modern level and EQ balance so that they fit better in context with modern music. (Older recordings are quite a lot quieter than modern ones).</p>
<p>This makes sense to do when things like shuffle play on Spotify exist, you want all of the songs you listen to to be roughly the same loudness level. Listen to an old Bowie recording and then Skrillex on the same speakers at the same volume at their original mastered loudness and the difference is stark. </p>

<p>Edit: wow, more upvotes than the comment I replied to and more even than the original post. Thanks fellow Redditors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, 'remastering' often means 'squash the life out of the music by applying a compression filter', so the entire piece of music has the same loudness, and max out cheap in-the-ear headphones. See, the Loudness Wars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, I’m well aware of the Loudness war. </p>
<p>Recent ‘loudness incentives’ have actually gone towards eliminating the need for a loudness war. </p>
<p>Most streaming platforms have a normalisation level, usually around -14 LUFS (Loudness Units Full Scale). Which means no matter how ‘loud’ you master your tracks, they will be brought to this new ‘unity’ level. </p>
<p>Which means, any compression you have applied to squash the dynamic range and push it to -6dB RMS (Root mean squared), is going to make your ‘loud’ master just sound squashed compared to a nice dynamic -14dB RMS master. Cos they’re both gonna be played back at -14 LUFS anyway the lower RMS track will just sound more dynamic, and better. </p>
<p>See: EBU R 128 (Fairly recent broadcasting standard, set at -23 LUFS, intended to eliminate the ‘advert effect’, you know ‘why do the adverts sound so loud compared to the show I was just watching?’) </p>
<p>Unfortunately, this standard doesn’t apply to physical media, streamed media or individual track downloads. Most platforms specify their own. </p>
<p>As a person who makes a living by using those evil evil ‘compression filters’, I can tell you that there are many ways to make compression sound ‘transparent’ and hundreds if not thousands of physical and plug-in compressors. I have my favourites, and ones I don’t like at all. I’m all about nuance, others in my field are about blasting people’s eardrums, go figure. Mastering engineers are the Dark Wizards of the music industry. </p>
<p>It’s usually the labels that push for loudness rather than the artists. And hey, a remaster is a way of pushing more product to unknowledgeable consumers! </p>
<p>NB: LUFS and dB RMS are both ways of measuring an ‘average level’. </p>
<p>NB: Audio compression is not the same thing as Data compression. Not even close. They just have a similar name. Most people are familiar with Data compression and unfamiliar with Audio compression, so equate the latter to the former. </p>
<p>NB: An avowed Nirvana fan, I’ve got the original Nevermind on Vinyl. (Vinyl mastering is a different class of dark art because there are other technical considerations because of the physical limitations of the medium. Don’t even get me started on mastering for cassette because that’s something I’d never wish on an enemy).The original vinyl sounds fantastic. I listened to the digitally remastered version of Nevermind and I also got the remastered vinyl. I have to say, while they didn’t do a bad job, it certainly lost its rawness. And the remastered vinyl just sounds kinda, thick, small and squishy, where the original sounded open, raw and honest. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a seriously fantastic explanation. I kinda got it before, but I didn't <em>get it, get it</em>. And now I do. Kudos good sir/madam. </p></div>		</li>
