			<div class="markdown"><p>If you don't mind some friendly advice...  There are a lot of places that automatically discard applications where you check &quot;prefer not to say.&quot;  I can't speak to whether those places are somewhere you'd actually want to work or not.  But be advised that you aren't going to get very many responses if you're checking that box.</p>
<p>Feel free to ignore me, obviously.  In the end it's your call.  But I've worked several places where checking that box means that no human being is ever going to see the application, which means it was a complete waste of time for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I figured as much, but until I get done with my online studies, my earning potential is only so high(looking to work for myself,too, but still in the research stage)so really for now it's just trying to find the job that sucks the least.im the person who, when police ask,&quot;can we search your car's I say nooo... remember going shopping and the cashier would ask,&quot;may I have your telephone number?&quot; I say what do you need my number for?as for discarding my application, they could see that I'm 47 and throw it away because I am over 45-right now I'm starting over from scratch (thanks alot,corona) and these jobs only really require that you can read,write,lift 50-75 lbs repeatedly, and stay on your feet all day.thrres no ladder I'm looking to climb,I'm truly grateful for the roof over our heads and the things that we still have, like our health and each other; what a lesson this past year how quickly that can vanish.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the entry-level jobs that are most likely to discard an application with unfilled boxes. Jobs where you have to meet significant requirements are more likely to overlook what they see as &quot;blank&quot; boxes because you have other qualifications that matter more.  But for low-level positions...  You're less likely to get a job leaving those blank than if you tell the truth up-front.  And if I'm stuck choosing between two lousy options, I'd rather work for the place that doesn't like blank applications than the one that throws out people over forty.</p>
<p>And, anyway, they're going to figure out how old you are when you come in for the interview.  Do you want to waste your time like that?</p>
<p>I only speak up because you said you've been filling out applications &quot;for a while&quot; now.  This choice may be actively slowing your job hunt.</p>
<p>Sorry, I'll go away now.  I know the rule about unsolicited advice.  Good luck!</p></div>		</li>
