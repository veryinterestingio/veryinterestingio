			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel similar to you im 29 and my childhood seems like a complete blur when I try to think about it. I remember bits and pieces (almost all negative) but overall I can't really focus in on anything. </p>
<p>Don't really have much else to say I just felt better reading your comment and if I ever have kids I want them to have the best life possible too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m 24 and I feel similar. Most of my childhood is a blur except for big traumatic events. Also friends tell me all their childhood memories of getting into trouble and I just have... nothing. I’ve always had weird memory though, always remembering unimportant details but big important things get lost.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's crazy. It really is. I genuinely try to remember..i just can't. </p>
<p>I love being a mom. I just can't imagine treating my kid the way I was. </p>
<p>I try really hard to be humble. If I make a mistake, I'll be real quick to admit it and apologize. I think due to my childhood, I definitely overdue the apologies. </p>
<p>I wish you happiness and health. Stay safe!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. </p>
<p>I worry so much. That's typically a good sign that you care and may be on the right track.</p>
<p>The conflict is my face. My kiddo will look at me and say, &quot;mommy, why does your face look like that?&quot;. I need to work on the resting B face lol. Haha</p></div>		</li>
