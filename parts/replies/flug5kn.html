<p>So yes you can technically use <strong>any soap</strong> for <strong>anything</strong></p>

<p>Since you mentioned laundry detergent in your post, I just wanted to note that you <em>canâ€™t</em> use laundry detergent for <em>any</em> purpose- particularly not on the skin or anywhere near the eyes. Modern laundry detergents have ingredients in them like chlorine bleach, ammonia derivatives, optical brighteners, and other preservatives and chemicals which are definitely not safe for use on the skin or near eyes and oral/nasal cavities.</p>
<p>Though I am sure you (and anyone with two brain cells) know this. But you just never know on the internet these days...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point, also soap that goes in your dishwasher instead of like the dish soap you use by hand should also NEVER go on your body. It has all kinds of abrasives and stuff in it because it's used in a machine and is never meant to touch humans</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think you should attribute lack of knowledge about this fact to lack of intelligence. I wouldn't have known if you hadn't said it. Yes, I'd certainly be hesitant about using laundry detergent as body soap, but I wouldn't know if this had any validity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>None of these are soap. These are all synthetic detergents. Soap is made from Oil and Lye. It can be hard, like bar soap (Sodium Hydroxide) or Liquid (Potassium Hydroxide). 99% of bar soap on supermarket shelves is soap, Dove is the only exception. All the liquid stuff is synthetic and not soap. </p>
<p>Shampoo is a different thing anyway as hair doesn't do so well with true soap. </p>
<p>What Lush sells is soap, apart from their shampoo bars, which are just SLS noodles stuck together.</p></div>		</li>
