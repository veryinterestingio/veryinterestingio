			<div class="markdown"><p>To piggyback off of this, typefaces have different measurements where specific letters or parts of letters line up to. This is why all &quot;small&quot; parts of lowercase letters all appear to line up at the same spot (called the x-height). Uppercase letters and tall lowercase ones actually have two separate measurements that they meet (the caps-height and ascender, respectively) specifically so that there is a way to differentiate letter pairings like I and l (even if our brains usually differentiate them based on context).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Full crossbars -- as in the width of a T -- on an uppercase I are not serifs. The serifs would be little tags on the ends of the crossbars.</p>
<p>Of course, big serifs on a straight I would look similar to short crossbars.</p></div>		</li>
