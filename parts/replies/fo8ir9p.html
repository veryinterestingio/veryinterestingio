			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, genius. Explain the perception of near perfect flatness without employing temperature in the explanation because...you know...the differences between air masses is temperature and the colder mass is more dense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;The lifting mechanisms associated with cloud development are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Surface heating and free convection</li>
<li>Topography</li>
<li>Convergence of surface air</li>
<li>Uplift along fronts</li>
<li>Convection (thermal development)&quot;</li>
<li><a href="https://digitalatlas.cose.isu.edu/clima/imaging/clddev.htm" target="_blank">https://digitalatlas.cose.isu.edu/clima/imaging/clddev.htm</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Boundaries between air masses (frontal lifting) is only one source of uplift that can lead to cloud formation. </p>
<p>Density is central to the story and cloud formation can't be explained without invoking temperature, you are correct. </p>
<p>But the flat cloud bottom is there because that's where the lifted condensation level is there. The LCL is where it is because of the absolute humidity of the air and the adiabatic lapse rate. Clouds do not float on the LCL; density does not at all explain what keeps cloud droplets suspended and to imply that clouds are buoyant is misleading.</p></div>		</li>
