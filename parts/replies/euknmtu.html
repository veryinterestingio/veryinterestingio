			<div class="markdown"><p>The other type, for those wondering, is called Metoidioplasty. They're different both in surgical method, and results, though both typically involve scrotoplasty, and both require any implants to be inserted in a separate procedure after healing to lower the chances of rejection. </p>
<p>Instead of using skin grafts to create a larger penis, 'meta' as it's nicknamed, creates a micro penis by releasing the clitoris tissue from the pubic bone, as well as using mucosal tissue to extend the urethra through it. There is no option to choose size, size is dependent on physiology, as well as growth already experienced from taking testosterone. The end result is a micro penis that's fully sensitive, able to harden with out implants, able to be urinated through (peeing standing up can still be difficult however because of lack of length), even has some foreskin, but is incapable of penetration. Scrotoplasty is typically performed as a second stage for phalloplasty, but in metoidioplasty it's completed as a single procedure. </p>
<p>To give you an idea of the difference in complexity of the two procedures, phalloplasty takes about 8-10 hours for the first surgery, and is usually done in three stages, phalloplasty, scrotoplasty, then implants, with time for healing inbetween each. Metoidioplasty can include scrotoplasty in its main operation as one surgery performed in approximately half that time or less. </p>
<p>You can't get metoidioplasty if you already had phalloplasty, but you <em>CAN</em> still get phalloplasty after you get metoidioplasty. I personally chose, for multiple reasons, to have metoidioplasty as my first procedure and phalloplasty as my second, instead of having phalloplasty as the first procedure, and scrotoplasty as a second procedure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What is the recovery time/process like, if you don’t mind answering? Admittedly I only know a little about MTF bottom surgery options because of a friend of mine, and it seemed intense and prolonged (although she was really happy with the results, so I’d imagine the process was worth it).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't mind at all, though it's been several years so my memory isn't perfect. Out of the three surgeries I had, that one was the longest and toughest recovery (I already chest surgery and a total hysto, can tell you about those too lol). Immediately after the surgery I stayed at the clinic for two days, and then on the third day moved to the recovery house next door where I stayed for about a week and change (I actually had my birthday during my stay there. Best. Present. Ever.). You aren't completely bed ridden during any of that, in the first day they already have you get up and walk around and every day they get you to walk around more, it keeps the scars and skin from healing tight. </p>
<p>During that week and a bit I had two drains and a catheter and a nurse would change my bandages for me as well as applying antibacterial ointment to the stitches. (No joke, so many different doctors and nurses looked at and handled my junk in that time that I went from being incredibly shy about being naked around strangers to being totally unfazed). They don't like to give you too much painkillers so to help keep you from getting constipated you have to drink a glass of prune juice at every meal. The recovery house is very much a house, though the rooms have hospital beds, there's a living room with couches and a tv, and the dining room has a large table where everyone recovering eats together. They give you an inflatable rubber donut thing to sit on to keep the pressure off your junk. I went home two weeks after I arrived, with no drains but the catheter still in, my rubber donut, and all the bandages and supplies I'd need to care for it myself. The catheter was the worst of it, I had to have a catheter in for like a month while it healed so it was like a whole month of constantly feeling like I need to pee.</p>
<p>In terms of how much pain I experienced from 1-10, my personal threshold is seriously skewed so don't take it as a universal experience (I don't mean that as a brag, I had an extremely abusive childhood, I developed severe compulsive self harm in the form of ripping off my own toenails). I never went above 7, and on average I classified my pain level as a 4, while the woman next to me was regularly hitting level 8 or 9. I don't know if that's cause we had different procedures or pain thresholds or both.</p>
<p>By far, the most prolonged pain/discomfort was the flight home. Airplane seats aren't comfy even when you aren't recovering from surgery and have to sit on an inflatable ring.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure how it comes into play for FTM surgery, but there are penile implants for ED that are inflatable, and others that are more rigid and don't deflate. This website has some diagrams showing how they work: <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/penile-implants/about/pac-20384916" target="_blank">https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/penile-implants/about/pac-20384916</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s two major kinds of implants, one is an inflatable tube that fills with saline from a reservoir placed in the pelvis (my friend has this kind and the pump in in one of his balls! It’s cool) and the other kind is a rod with a series of connections that make it flexible. There’s pros and cons to both. The rod can be troublesome because you might end up looking like you have a  boner, but I think it’s stiffer for penetration, so some people like that. The pump can give you a nice tactile difference between flaccid and hard, and you have the option of controlling how much it’s inflated but it might be more prone to wearing out. more research is needed, bc all studies thus far have been in cis male patients.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to be clear. What exactly is a &quot;cis penis&quot; isn't cis normally put in front of gender denoting how they identify?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It comes from the chemistry adjectives cis and trans:</p>
<ul>
<li>cis - denoting or relating to a molecular structure in which two particular atoms or groups lie on the <strong><em>same</em></strong> side of a given plane in the molecule</li>
<li>trans - denoting or relating to a molecular structure in which two particular atoms or groups lie on <strong><em>opposite</em></strong> sides of a given plane in the molecule</li>
</ul>
<p>(emphasis added for clarity)</p>
<p>So therefore cisgender means that the physical gender and the personal identity of gender are the same, whereas transgender then indicates they are opposite.</p>
<p>In this case, I'm presuming that &quot;cis penis&quot; refers to the penis of a cisgender male, i.e. one that has not had gender reassignment surgery.</p></div>		</li>
