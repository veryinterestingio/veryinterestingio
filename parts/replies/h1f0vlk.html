			<div class="markdown"><p>Beekeepers learn not to move a hive even several feet away during the day.  It confuses the bee coming back.  What‚Äôs more interesting is when a bee comes back to the hive after securing some pollen, you can watch them do a little dance wiggling their butt ( I‚Äôve been known to show people myself how they do this.  They lose all respect for me) in reality this dance is telling other bees exactly where the pollen is.  Sometimes several miles away</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Beeks use a ‚Äúwithin 3 feet or over 3 miles‚Äù rule when moving our hives. Under 3 feet of movement and they can still find home. Over 3 miles they take a new orientation flight to get their bearings and they‚Äôre fine. In between 3 feet and 3 miles they get confused and try to fly back to the original site and get lost.</p></div>		</li>
