			<div class="markdown"><p>u/pinebug it’s basically this, with a catch. First question in burn treatment is if the lungs were damaged. Second is how bad the damage across the body is. In an oven, your skin will go first if not hot enough to completely kill your lungs. This leads to what the above says, BUT what’ll probably kill you first? </p>
<p>Potassium. All of our cells contain and need it, when they die they release it into the blood, and once at a high enough level your heart can’t function. Much less most of your nervous system. </p>
<p>Things most of the other comments are making like cooking your nerves or organs is for radiation style burning, oven and convection starts external and Potassium straight up is what the lethal injection is. This won’t happen with “smaller” burns, but diffuse, whole body burning? Yes, very easily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a thread making the rounds in the medical subreddits (r/medicine, r/ems) showing the ekg progression of a terminal burn (no gore, just the heart tracing). In 30 minutes, it progressed from a mostly normal heart to terminal rhythm due to the process you mention (release of potassium from the cooked cells).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup! I saw the progress in reverse once in the ER, showing the T wave in an EKG slowly over ~4 hours go back down to normal. Very interesting and more fun to watch when in reverse...don’t know if I’d like to work on the burn unit. It happens slower and over time in burns that don’t pretty much kill you in minutes. That plus losing water makes for a really bad time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yeah, too much salt is bad. But the natural balance of the body is to already have had the sodium in the blood/extracellular, whereas there is much more of the potassium in the cells and when they get out it’s way too unbalanced for the heart to handle. So yeah, it’s not “only” potassium, but it’s like comparing a train load with a car load of potassium vs. other jobs being released which is why I only mentioned it. You’re right though, eventually due to fluid shift and furthered cell damage pretty much every electrolyte becomes a problem, sodium and potassium above all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but intracellular Na+ and Cl- concentrations are negligible. Releasing them wouldn't be as bad as the potassium. Main mechanism for cardiac arrest would be the myocytes entering a refractory state due to the elevated potassium. I'm not saying you're wrong, but saying &quot;but.. Also sodium&quot; suggests sodium plays a role.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>But you're also releasing ionic Sodium and Chloride</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Potassium is more concentrated inside the cell than outside (~100 mM vs 4 mM), whereas both sodium and chloride are less concentrated inside than outside (10 vs 140 &amp; 10 vs 100, respectively) so the net effect of massive cells popping is a rapid increase in serum potassium.  Theoretically I suppose you would get drops in serum sodium &amp; chloride, but in practice these aren't overly relevant in this situation.  Mostly because your K going from 4-&gt;8 can easily kill you, whereas sodium dropping 140 -&gt; 130 (or even 120, really) isn't going to kill you acutely.</p>

<p>Overall isotonic, but not with respect to individual ions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My theory is that the dehydration interferes with the signals that your brain gives to the rest of your body. So your heart stops beating, blood stops flowing, then you pass out and die from oxygen deprivation because you’re not breathing at that point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would imagine the timescale of dehydration wouldn't allow it to take priority as cause of death. Also, your brain sends electrical impulses which depend on the relative concentration of ions (as they, along with nucleic acid and proteins, establish the electrical potential across the membrane, and the flux of ions propagates the wave/signal). You'd expect a signal blockage when extra cellular potassium is too high for example, but with dehydration, the concentration of everything rises so the effect of potential wouldn't be so dramatic. Besides, your heart does not need a signal from your brain, the HCN4 proteins within your sinoatrial node (as the primary pace maker) generate their own self-sufficient rhythm at 90 bpm, the vagal signal from your heart actually only serves to lower this rate. In its absence, your heart rate goes up.</p>
<p>Edit: it just occurred to me you might be talking about environmentally induced dehydration (like lost in the desert). I was responding in terms of OP talking about an oven haha. In heat like 60 degrees or so, yes death is due to dehydration. Water lost due to sweating urination and breathing, blood viscosity and osmolarity (concentration of everything) go up, blood pressure drops and toxic substances accumulate (like urea), your heart has a hard time maintaining perfusion to the organs, organ failure for non vitals (you're likely passed out by now), then total organ failure and death.</p></div>		</li>
