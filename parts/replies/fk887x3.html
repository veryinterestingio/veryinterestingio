			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess that's true.</p>
<p>Basically, you want the chase cam to follow the car in a smooth and dynamic manner. First thing would be to adjust the distance from the camera to the car based on the current car speed: the faster you go, the further away the camera, and vice versa.</p>
<p>To make it more dynamic, you can use the car's G-forces to make the overall car movement look more impactful: you land a high speed jump and the camera bounces down, you crash into a wall and the camera moves appropriately to imitate the car impact.</p>
<p>You can also alter the camera movement based on the car's velocity vector (basically travel direction in combination with speed), for example to anticipate turns or look into the direction the car is drifting in. A lot of this can be annoying, so subtlety does the trick here.</p>
<p>By the way, I don't actually develop - at least not professionally, but I did implement most of this into an experimental racing game of mine. I get annoyed when certain games don't do this well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You left out smooth positioning, where the camera wonâ€™t just go straight to its desired position, rather it will move towards it with its own set velocity. Most great cameras have these feature.</p></div>		</li>
