			<div class="markdown"><p>That seems to be a reason for vaccine backlash. When there are outbreaks of disease and harm is visible, people do change their minds about vaccination and demand it. In the past, countries like the UK viewed vaccination as something you did when there was an outbreak rather than something that was a routine yearly thing. Although this effect can be short-lived. Even when polio vaccination was demanded and people queued up around the block in the 1950s, the enthusiasm quickly waned and people had to be reminded it was something they had to carry on doing unless they wanted to see the disease again. Unfortunately, I think uptake for a potential COVID-19 vaccine could be a challenge because of the suspicion of ‘new’ vaccines or because people don’t think COVID-19 is too bad. It has also been tied up with a lot of conspiracy thinking that could put people off. On the upside most people will probably still want to take a future COVID-19 vaccine to return back to ‘normality’ and because the lack of treatment and the risk (especially for older age groups) makes it a feared disease. My concern is if there is have the supply and access to a vaccine for everyone who may need it and how controversy (whether real or not) related to a vaccine could seriously undermine a vaccine campaign.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also the future of vaccine technology is an area to pay attention to in order to consider public reactions and what sort of acceptance there may be.</p></div>		</li>
