			<div class="markdown"><p>In fact, in early attempts at mRNA vaccines this was a problem. The immune system would destroy the mRNA before it could replicate the viral proteins and immunity wasn't achieved. The mRNA is actually modified to bypass the immune system slightly so that it doesn't get destroyed before making the proteins and provoking a response.</p>
