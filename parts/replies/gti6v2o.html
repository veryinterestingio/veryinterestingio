<p>The basic tool to be used here is a well-known comparison theorem. ^(4)</p>
<p>Footnote 4:  Where, of course, &quot;well known&quot; means &quot;it can be found in the literature if you know where to look. &quot;</p>

<p>then:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because the two-electron system can dissociate into a free electron plus electron bound in a hydrogen ground state with energy <em>–Z</em>^(2), both <em>H₀</em> and <em>H = H₀ + V</em> have a continuous spectrum  beginning at <em>–Z</em>^(2).^(6)</p>
<p>Footnote 6: Most physicists would consider this intuitively obvious</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see. So the question is about if it would be energetically favorable for them to get together? I can understand that. I will think i little bit more about and try to read the articles you presented. Although i can't speak German kkk. But thanks anyways. You have given me a new perspective to think about.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Exactly. The two electrons bound to the proton are in a lower energy state than if they were free. </p>
<p>According to that paper I linked, apparently all anions (negative ions like H-) have finite spectra (finite number of bound energy states), whereas all neutral and positive ions have infinite spectra (meaning an infinite number of bound energy eigenstates).  I did not understand the proof well enough to understand why H- only has one bound state. Very weird. It means H- has no spectra. To understand why that's so counter-intuitive, it's like a guitar string that can only vibrate at a single frequency (i.e. no harmonics).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see. I will read the articles very soon, but i imagine that the reason for the non existing higher energy levels must simply be because they would be greater then the energy of the isolated components. Of course this is just speculation given that i haven't read it yet, nor have i done the calculations myself. But what do you think about my idea?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it's that surprising or counter-intuitive. You could argue, and I believe this is argued in the article, that for H- there exists only one bound state because simply the other (&quot;Harmonic&quot;) states exist at energies in the continuum. They have been &quot;pushed&quot; into the continuum by the potential of the system. The article explicitly says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>V1 [the new potential] must contain enough of the original repulsive V0 to push all but one of these levels up to -1..... Stated another way, V1 must retain enough of the original V0 to preserve shielding: If one electron is in a hydrogenic ground state with the second electron far out, the far out electron must see, after the replacement of V0 by V1, a potential which cannot support an infinite number of bound states.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this stems quite nicely from our understanding of cations and neutral atoms: for cations or neutral atoms the energy states are &quot;pulled&quot; lower in energy by the potential in such a way that the energy spacing between them becomes infinitesimal as you approach the continuum, leading to an infinite number of bound states. You could argue that an anion intuitively &quot;flips&quot; this effect and the energy spacing between states gets larger (&quot;pushed&quot; apart) as you approach the continuum, leading to a finite number of bound states.</p></div>		</li>
