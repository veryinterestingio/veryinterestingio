			<div class="markdown"><p>My work makes a big deal about how everyone gets a raise once a year and it always at least matches inflation.</p>
<p>But on the flip side I've been there 3 years and I'm still about £5k below what the going rate is for what I do elsewhere.</p>
<p>EDIT: To those people saying &quot;well go elsewhere then&quot; things aren't always that simple. I'm in software support, getting to the level I'm at required learning my companies software. That's not a transferable skill. I can't just swap into another job, it'd mean taking a pay cut to go back to entry level and working up again somewhere else. And more to the point, why should I have to uproot myself every couple of years just to keep up with the cost of living?</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you're just matching inflation, it's not a raise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Trying to create hard cut offs between generations is superfluous and missing the point entirely. The whole idea if a &quot;generation&quot; is to look at things in a broad, big picture view. It's not about tedious cataloging of each individual into a set group.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. Gen Z actually came of age halfway through one of the longest economic &quot;bull markets&quot; in US history. Wages are a big issues but job opportunities are not. Unlike those of us graduating college a few years earlier.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This IMO is the single most important point and can not be emphasized enough.</p>
<p>The heyday of the USA, starting from the 50s, was operating on being able to exploit Asian countries, and when Europe was in postwar shambles. This sheer dominance allowed a standard of living that was entirely not consummate with the US population's education level.</p>
<p>This has changed, because the other countries have caught up. And because the US ran for far too long with the &quot;what worked in the past must still work&quot; paradigm, there are now large parts of the population who have no education to speak of, thus not allowing them to execute high-margin jobs that would allow for the continued standard of living.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As it never should. I'm a Euro, but never have we grown up with &quot;a college education guarantees good living&quot;.<br />
Someone who goes into an apprenticeship at 16/17 to become a master electrician or plumber can easily make a better living than an average college graduate. As a German we learned that in my time in school. Learning a craft is important, too.<br />
Educated people struggle because of competition and availability of positions.</p></div>		</li>
