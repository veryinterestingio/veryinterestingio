<p>If you're curious look up Nixon's Saturday Night Massacre as an example of what happens in this kind of situation.</p>
<p>During the Watergate scandal Nixon ordered his Attorney General, and then the deputy Attorney general to fire the special prosecutor that was investigating him.</p>
<p>He believed that he was well within his right to do so, but it was a MASSIVE conflict of interest. Both his Attorney General and the Deputy refused the order and resigned rather than carry out the immoral order.</p>
<p>Eventually the 3rd in line at the justice department fired the prosecutor on Nixon's order. But it was later determined by the court that the firing of the prosecutor was illegal as it was ruled obstruction of justice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting irony: you know how people are always talking about how we have three &quot;co-equal&quot; branches of government? This is not true - ultimate power resides with Congress. Congress creates executive power; the executive cannot create legislative powers. Also, the President can't fire Congress, but they can fire him. </p>
<p>The concept of &quot;co-equal&quot; was mentioned satirically during the ratification debates in the 1780's, then again in 1820 or so, and then not again until . . . it was popularized by none other than Richard Nixon. He kept vetoing spending bills in an effort to fight inflation, he kept hammering this point that he was &quot;co-equal&quot; with Congress, and Congress never really disputed the point. It's now &quot;common knowledge&quot; that the branches are &quot;co-equal&quot;, and this is largely due to Nixon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also doesn't help the perception the congress is more powerful when a lot of their responsibilities over the centuries they have notably decided not to act upon and leave it up to the president and executive branch or in some cases explicitly grant the executive branch with more power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is fundamentally wrong. Congress does not create executive power (although, they have abdicated many powers to the executive over the past 200 years). Your entire conception of government as created by the constitution is flawed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Fun fact:  Robert Bork was the 3rd person appointed and he did fire Cox. Further, his actions in the firing were part of what kept him from being a supreme court justice.</p>
<p>&quot;Reagan nominated Bork to the  Supreme Court in 1987, precipitating a contested Senate debate.  Opposition to Bork centered on his stated desire to roll back the civil  rights decisions of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Court" target="_blank">Warren</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burger_Court" target="_blank">Burger</a>  courts and <em>his role in the Saturday Night Massacre.</em> His nomination was  defeated in the Senate, with 58 of the 100 Senators opposing his  nomination. That Supreme Court vacancy was eventually filled by another  Reagan nominee, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Kennedy" target="_blank">Anthony Kennedy</a>. &quot;</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It's the only <em>substantive</em> course of action. They have investigative power; they can issue subpoenas; they can declare acts of censure. But these are powers used mostly to sway public opinion. The real power lies in impeachment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If POTUS steals a bike, is the only option to either impeach or do nothing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>in which case the President gets away scot-free?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. The Founders were hoping that the American people would avoid electing bike thieves as a matter of course.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What happens after impeachment? Is POTUS immediately charged and arrested?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's up to the head of the controlling legal authority. This could be the AG, a State's Attorney's office, a DA, etc. So it depends on what he did, and where.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Impeachment is the action taken by the House to determine if a trial should take place. Upon impeachment, the president is put on trial in the Senate. If convicted by the Senate, the president is removed from office, and at the Senate's option, may be barred from ever holding office (of any sort) again. Legal action can then be pursued by federal and/or state law enforcement for the crimes committed.</p>

<p>The possibility was very much there. 69 other people were charged, with 48 of them found guilty.</p></div>		</li>
