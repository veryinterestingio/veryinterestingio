<p>I do realize that things like blue whales are evidence to the contrary. But I don't know why. Something at the floor of the ocean is still facing an astounding amount of pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, back in the Carboniferous we had giant insects, but studies in the lab have shown that it takes several generations with elevated oxygen levels to increase the size of insects, which means you'd also have evolutionary components happening simultaneously to help successive generations deal with all that size. As oxygen levels decreased after the Carboniferous you see the reverse effect, insects started getting smaller with successive generations, so all the giants are dead, and only the fittest to survive have passed on their genes, which likely selected for smaller insects during the transition.</p></div>		</li>
