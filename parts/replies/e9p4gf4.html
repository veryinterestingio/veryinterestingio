			<div class="markdown"><p>This vote never happened.  The idea of cable TV and satellite TV was about getting more programming options.  I remember when my family got one of the first LARGE dishes installed at home.  This thing was as big as my living room and a large motor turned the dish.  We got every channel on that thing.  Every got every sports team, every event, and just about every local channel in many areas.  The thing is every one of these channels had ads for their local area.</p>
<p>The idea of pay TV was never about removing ads.  It was all about adding programming options.  Local TV antennas picked up just a handful of stations.  Pay TV picked up hundreds of channels.</p></div>		</li>
