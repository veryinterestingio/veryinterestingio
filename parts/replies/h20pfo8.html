<p>Ooh, that was me.  I had total recall as a kid.  I distinctly remember being in 2nd or 3rd grade, and a beekeeper came to our school and gave us a 20 minute talk about bees.   I found it so fascinating.  When I saw my grandfather that weekend, he suggested we walk down to the creek, and then he asked me what I'd learned in school that week.   </p>
<p>I don't remember the bee presentation anymore, but I do remember thinking &quot;Oh, he'll find this fascinating, I'll just repeat what the beekeeper said.&quot;  I remember the utter confidence that I could repeat everything I'd heard a few days earlier, even the words I didn't know, and I remember it took the entire walk plus a bit to recount it so it must have been a long speech.   I also remember how big a fuss he made when we got back from the walk, pulling my mom and grandma aside to tell them that I'd given a really advanced lecture about bees and that I was correctly using words that I didn't actually know.</p>
<p>Anyway, yep - I lost that ability by 6th grade or so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hm seems like a quirk of language centers getting to certain stages of development. Children around that developmental window can still learn other languages when immersed (more quickly than an adult)</p>
<p>Maybe more than a quirk , an insight, into how those regions in the brain related to language and short-ã€‹ medium-term memory formation</p></div>		</li>
