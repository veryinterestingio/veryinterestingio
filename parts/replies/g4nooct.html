			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m a physician as well, and I do much the same thing. I’ve seen too many patients who refuse to accept a terminal diagnosis because “we’ve been told he had six months to live ten years ago. He’s a fighter!” Hard and fast predictions tend to be wrong and tend to breed mistrust in the medical field which is to no one’s benefit. I just tell people that “no one has a crystal ball, but based on what I’ve seen, in the majority of cases x or y will happen in likely A or B amount of time. I could be wrong though and people have surprised me before.” </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think there are many doctors like you who realize the amorphous nature of medical diagnoses and try to temper their responses, as you do.</p>
<p>And then, understandably, all the patient and their loved ones hear is:</p>
<p><del>no one has a crystal ball, but based on what I’ve seen, in the majority of cases x or y will happen in likely</del> <strong>A or B amount of time.</strong> <del>I could be wrong though and people have surprised me before.”</del></p>
<p>I don’t think either side’s at fault here, it’s just that the matter is viewed through differing emotional lenses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For sure - and I’ve definitely been pressed for an answer before as well because they just need something to anchor on. I usually then say something to the effect of “I’m happy to be wrong, but I would be surprised if it was more than X amount of time.” </p>
<p>I know it’s deliberately vague, and sometimes families are frustrated with that, but the emotional rollercoaster of “they won’t make it to tomorrow”, to then have the patient surpass that deadline, only to have another arbitrary deadline presented is excruciating. Having these conversations is always tough and emotionally draining for the providers and for the patient/family.</p>
<p>EDIT - the strike through wasn’t there when I started commenting. I see what you mean now. That sequence has also occurred numerous times, and can lead to anger and outbursts at the system “being wrong” or “giving up on their loved one”. When that happens you just have to keep perspective that you are dealing with people at the absolute lowest points in their lives, and just try to be supportive through it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m a nurse and have worked with hundreds of doctors across many states. I have witnessed an untold number of terminal diagnosis and have never heard a doctor give a specific timeframe, I just assumed that was a tv trope. I have heard things like “people with this condition in your stage of illness live on average of xxx time” I’ve only heard “you/they will never walk again” a few times, usually they share the statistics. </p>
<p>Good to hear you don’t do it, but also sad to hear you verify there are doctors that do this.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Bingo. The media we consume shapes our expectations, all the way down to death and dying. We're primed by our medical dramas to receive prognostic information in that way, so even though a provider in this day and age probably <em>doesn't</em> explain it that way, it's likely to be how a patient interprets the news.</p>
<p>I'm a physician and I can't tell you how many times patients or their families have used Grey's Anatomy or House as an explicit anchoring point in our conversation. Given that it is verbalized so frequently, I am sure unconsciously this anchoring happens all the more regularly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I was at a particular stage of terminal cancer I would like to know the average lifespan at least, as long it's worded in such a way.. e.g. &quot;On average patients at this stage in your age group live X-X months&quot;, as long as the patient knows they may live longer (or shorter). I'd rather know the average then have to struggle blindly with life decisions, personally at least.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fortunately or unfortunately (depending on how you look at it) a lot of cancers are studied well enough to be able to provide “5 year survival rates” which is essentially how many people with that particular diagnosis are alive at 5 years. It’s a nice way to be able to give some kind of expectation to a patient without slamming the door shut on being an outlier or having a chance. Preserving hope without providing false hope is a very tricky tightrope to walk.</p></div>		</li>
