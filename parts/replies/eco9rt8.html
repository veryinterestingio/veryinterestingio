			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll say this is a bad idea though. People are worried about credit card skimmers and what not, there's no guarantee that the crackers haven't put some extra code to monitor input and all that.</p>
<p>For me, the $99 is worth the assurance that there's no hidden rootkits, loggers, or other malicious software - especially when I deal with my wife and I's taxes. With that, to each their own and I applaud those who are brave enough to do this!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha I tested to see if the free version is any different than the Deluxe version of a popular tax prep software and I think the Deluxe got me like a couple extra dollars back somehow. Not really sure, didn't affect me at all so I just filed it through that. </p>
<p>For anyone wondering how to pirate software, I've heard that there is a bay for pirates that can be visited on the internet, where one could hypothetically type in keywords. Provided you have a good torrenting software (for sharing your own files quickly with your large group of peers of course), it should be pretty simple. I'm not implying that the torrenting software and the bay for pirates are necessarily related, but perhaps it's worth looking into before visiting the website. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>additionally for CA and other state specific taxes they (at lobbyists discretion) make online forms very difficult to submit.  While tax softwares offer free online submission for federal taxes, they tend to charge an extra fee if you want to submit online for state because they are essentially the only way to submit online.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except the government DOES NOT have all of your info. They only have information from forms that have been submitted to them like W-2's or 1099's. A huge number of people run their own businesses and the government has no way of knowing their revenue vs deductions until it's reported via their tax return. Same goes for itemized deductions and credits. Also, I see people in this post continually blaming the tax preparation companies but it's actually in the government's best interest to keep doing it the way they are; especially now that they've doubled the standard deduction for individuals. Tax payers are not required to file unless they have income greater than the standard deduction so now there are going to be tons of people who have withholdings from their wages but will not file for a return because lazy/or whatever reason. It would be a lot of extra work &amp; money for the IRS to send everything out automatically, and they would lose the money from people who would otherwise decide not to file. Plus they'd have millions of people disputing their returns on the basis of itemized deductions and self employment.</p>
<p>Everything else aside, I do agree that us individuals are getting screwed cuz the process is not in the best interest of the average individual tax payer, nor are the laws.</p>
<p>Source: I'm an accountant.</p>
<p>Edit: when I say millions would dispute over itemized deductions, I mean that almost everybody is stupid when it comes to taxes and they have no idea of what is or is not tax deductible &amp; whether they could even itemize to begin with, so the IRS would have millions of idiots sending in their bullshit saying &quot;well I donated $10 to the salvation army so don't I get something for that?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also, everyone knows what deductions are allowed because they are listed in the online form we use to submit our taxes. The only reason people need tax agents in the US is because their entire system is fucking stupid.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Every other westernized country can separate self employed taxes from employee taxes. There's exactly zero reasons the US couldn't do the same.</p>
<p>Your arguments all the way through here are &quot;it is because it is, and changing would be too hard because it is&quot; which is seriously weak sauce.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Seriously, you've got to be kidding. Have you never looked at the ratio of 1040ez filers. There's no need to inconvenience the vast majority for the minority you serve. It wouldn't cost a rounding error of the IRS budget to implement it.</p></div>		</li>
