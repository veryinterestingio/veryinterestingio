			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't try to crush it. In my experience, that never works.</p>
<p>Watch the feeling come on. Feel it, without <em>being</em> it. Let it exist for those few seconds, and just watch it, as one watches a storm in the horizon. It has no interest in hanging around; how can it? It's just a stray memory. Then watch it leave, just as quickly as it arrives.</p>
<p>You are not your thoughts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do I do this with racing thoughts that are intrusive and repetitive? I've been doing a lot better, seems like its not a mental constant for me, but just something that happens when my CPAP machine is busted. Either way, if I'm overall anxious, it is a constant shower of these.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like to think I'm the watcher of my thoughts. Not my thoughts themselves. When I recall a thought or many thoughts in a row, I almost envision the watcher is in a tower, and the thoughts are just racing by like a highway.</p>
<p>Get the &quot;power of now&quot; audio book, pop that sucker in and listen for a while. It changed my life 100% and he talks about the watcher.</p>
<p>My parents made fun of me but it seriously was the best thing I ever did. Meditation is key. You have to put work in to be able to train your brain like any other muscles. I have gone minutes now without a single thought in my head and it's... Refreshing to say the least.</p>
<p>Try that audio book, it's really great for anxiety.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me:</p>
<p>Say, verbally, what you are feeling. say why you are feeling it. If it is a past event say that it is over and no longer needs to effect you. if it is a current event find one thing you can do about it and say that.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm angry/sad that i worked a long and stressful shift. that shift is done, i'm going to get some water and a snack and watch an episode of show X&quot;</p>
<p>talking forces me to breathe, and putting the thoughts into sentences helps organize them a bit.</p></div>		</li>
