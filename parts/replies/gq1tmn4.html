			<div class="markdown"><p>The deeper you get into science, the easier it gets because the names of almost <em>every</em> enzyme, compound, etc. literally tell you what they are</p>
<p>For instance, ‚ÄúLipoprotein Lipase‚Äù</p>
<ol>
<li>Lipoprotein is a specific type of protein that carries fat around in the blood</li>
<li>A lipase is an enzyme that breaks down fat</li>
</ol>
<p>Lipoprotein Lipase = enzyme that breaks down fat carried by a lipoprotein</p></div>		</li>

I have occasionally over the years poured myself a glass of milk to combat heat and found it didnt help very much. Only now am I realizing that's probably because I prefer non-fat milk.
