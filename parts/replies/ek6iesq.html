			<div class="markdown"><p>No kidding. We fired a cannonball at an asteroid... like space pirates. Just to see what kind of crater it'd make. Basically one degree of separation from &quot;for the lulz.&quot;</p>
<p>I live for experiments like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you think about it, this is actually a sort of form of Asteroid mining.</p>
<p>They're shooting the asteroid to get rid of the superficial layers, see what's inside, grab some samples and return them to Earth.</p>
<p>If we could do this with asteroids that actually contain valuable metals, then we'd probably see a boom in space tech development.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing is, with an asteroid that small, chances are good that it's a &quot;rubble pile&quot;--an asteroid comprised of loosely connected stones and space dust.  What's a good way to figure out if it's a dust ball?  Shoot it with something rigid and watch the splatter.</p>
<hr />
<p>If you're interested, that's also how NASA decided to see if there really <em>is</em> water buried under the regolith of the moon.  See, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter was getting responses off its spectrometer that suggested there's water hiding near the poles of the moon, but all indicators suggest that sunlight would boil any water right off that giant rock, so NASA got to thinking: maybe if we dig up some of the soil that hides in shadow most of the time (like in the bottom of a crater), we'd get some clear answers.</p>
<p>But <em>then</em> the question was how to dig up that soil, and how to test it once it's dug up.  Their solution?  Pack a rocket with two parts: a spectrometer that could analyze soil and...a bomb.  Well, technically, the booster part of the satellite with more fuel than it'd need to get the spectrometer into position, but...yeah, a bomb.</p>
<p>So NASA launched that rocket, let loose the analyzer, dropped that rocket in a crater, and send the analyzer through the ensuing dust plume.  Of course, they also timed the bombing so the LRO would be watching--and that the crater in question would be edge-on to us her on Earth so every telescope that could see the moon could see the explosion.  You know...for science.</p>
<p>Incidentally, NASA found what they were looking for.  That explosion kicked up about 55 liters of water (or, about 1/3rd of a bathtub) into the lunar sky.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh, I wouldn't say super easy to carry out. But nevertheless, this operation is significantly more than just orbital mechanics. You've got asteroid rendezvous, mapping, exploration and so on, then when you finally decide where to impact the asteroid you have the following series of steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Maneuver Hayabusa2 close to the surface so the impactor hits the right part of the asteroid at the right time (asteroid is spinning, so time is important).</li>
<li>Eject the impactor cannon, which must maintain at minimum power and orientation in space, and must be ejected without excess momentum.</li>
<li>Move the spacecraft away some. Eject the remote camera, which needs power, attitude control, and comms, and is (like the impactor cannon) not much bigger than a softball.</li>
<li>Move the main spacecraft around the asteroid to protect it from the impactor blast and then from debris from the impact itself. Must maintain comms with Earth and the remote camera.</li>
<li>The impactor must fire. The explosive charge will malform and shoot off the copper impactor itself, and must be pointed perfectly and explode symmetrically so the impactor flies in the right direction. Also hopefully the camera is oriented properly to image the event.</li>
<li>Wait for debris to clear, move spacecraft to a safe waiting position. (weeks)</li>
<li>Move spacecraft in to examine impact site.</li>
<li>Take sample of impact site. Requires similar precision in approach to ejecting the impacter, and a really impressive collection system.</li>
<li>Return sample towards Earth (orbital mechanics)</li>
<li>Send sample to Earth surface, needing heat shield and parachute.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Realistically, detonating the charge while still attached to the probe would probably have punched a hole clean through the latter in the direction diametrically opposite to where the impactor was propelled... or simply reduced the whole spacecraft into a cloud of debris.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An EFP is really just a bomb designed to direct a significant amount of kinetic energy in one specific direction, rather than equally in every direction like a grenade.  The case still explodes outwards in all directions though, and would damage anything close to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It wouldn't have punched a hole through it. Just blown it to bits. An EFP like they used is generally only designed to project a slug in a single direction </p></div>		</li>
