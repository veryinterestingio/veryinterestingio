			<div class="markdown"><p>not sure where you learned  that, but it's wrong.  humans  - mammal in general - produce uric acid.  I suspect you learned of the difference of the urine metabolism where birds final excrement is uric acid and humans is urea.  This doesn't mean  uric acid doesn't exist in humans or mammals (or  bears though), it does....in all of us.  If you have gout  you have too much and  tests for serum uric acid levels are common in diagnostics because levels to high and too low are indicators of all sorts of problems.</p>
<p>In this case, the hypothesis is that  in the absence of urination the high level of serum uric acid is converted to aminos that stave off muscle atrophy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, I was thinking about nitrogen waste in the context of urine. Thanks for clarifying the uric acid vs. urea point.  </p>
<p>I was also thinking of urea because you mentioned that bears can generate amino acids from uric acid. I've only ever heard of urea being recycled into amino acids/proteins through urea nitrogen salvage, and know very little about uric acid nitrogen salvage. Do you know if uric acid nitrogen salvage happens via conversion of uric acid to urea, or if it's a completely different pathway?</p></div>		</li>
