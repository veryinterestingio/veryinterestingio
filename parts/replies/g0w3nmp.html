			<div class="markdown"><p>Grew up in a community downwind of a test site (desert southwest). Knew 3 (including myself) at my high school of ~1200 students that were diagnosed with leukaemia as teens in the last decade. These were all in the student population my senior year.</p>
<p>Personally I'm dubious as to whether this is directly a result of nuclear tests so many decades later, but I got my degree (somewhat ironically) in nuclear engineering, so I may be biased. Radiation science is in most ways a probability game; these are notoriously hard for humans to play.</p>
<p>Edit: let the record reflect, none were fatal. I lost a couple seasons of cross country running, and JJ lost a season of baseball, but other than that no casualties in that limited group.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does nuclear engineering map so well to predicting how experimental bombs the full design of which is presumably classified may have affected the environment?<br />
I would assume you'd be more about power plants, and modern, safe-ish ones at that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I honestly know next to fuckall. I know how to solve to the differential equations and know what constants to neglect. I've taken classes about how radiation safety and how much is statistically safe for the population not engaged in the the industry. </p>
<p>So, considering the radiation safety courses I'd taken would ensure I'd theoretically know how likely one likely is to contract a radiation induced disease based upon how much radiation how they'd recieved in the last 5years. But I'd not personally bet on that. </p>
<p>To answer your question directly: Perhaps? How certain do you want to be? I'm certain that it's less harmful than other renewables assuming we can store waste in a geologically stable environment.</p></div>		</li>
