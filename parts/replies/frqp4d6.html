			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey I can add to this a bit. I've got a degree and work in the industry!</p>
<p>This is correct in that this issue is physical damage to the muscle cells along the Zline and others, and not lactic acid. </p>
<p>The pain is delayed by a degree due to the time it takes your body to respond to that damage. Your body sees this damage as an actual &quot;injury&quot; even though it's self-inflicted through intense exercise. In responding to an injury the body sends all of the inflammatory markers it normally would for a cut or gash. </p>
<p>Some of these chemicals can make your nerves slightly more sensitive. The increased blood flow to the area will also cause a degree of swelling, but this is all normal.</p>
<p>This is also why emerging research says NOT to take Advil (ibuprofen) to help with DOMS. The adaptation that you hope for in response to exercise is actually brought on by this inflammation. Suppressing the inflammation with NSAIDs can actually decrease the adaptive response (getting stronger) due to exercise. </p>
<p>In this case, it's quite literally &quot;No pain, no gain.&quot;</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
<p>Edit: Hey first silver! Thank you!</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>High doses of ibuprofen have been shown to inhibit muscle protein synthesis after a bout of resistance exercise. </p>
<p>We conclude that a moderate dose of ibuprofen ingested after repeated resistance training sessions does not impair muscle hypertrophy or strength and does not affect ratings of muscle soreness.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That study used too low dose ibuprofen to reduce pain perception or hypertrophy.  There may be other issues in the study, but it basically says you need to take enough IBU to be effective for it to work.  Kind of like how drinking a sip of beer is different than the whole six pack.</p>
<p>In science, sometimes your experimental design doesn't work out, but you still have to publish the results.  The authors would have done better to include a dose of IBU that other people had already shown to be effective.  Then we would know whether their lack of difference is because the low dose drug really doesn't work or because their other methods were too inconsistent to resolve differences that were actually present.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to add on the &quot;no pain, no gain&quot; part. Although DOMS is a good indicator that you worked hard, it shouldn't be the goal of exersizing. It only occurs in movements that are new to you. So it is possible to get DOMS while building very little muscle, and it is also very normal for people that build a lot of muscle to not feel any DOMS at all. </p>
<p>So the bottom line is, it is a sometimes necessary side effect of exersise, but it shouldn't be the goal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Active recovery and dynamic stretching are your best bet.</p>
<p>Get blood flowing to help stimulate the healing that needs to happen to get back to normal. Movement will also help loosen up some of the stiffness that is caused post workout as well. </p>
<p>Make sure your diet has enough protein as well. Being light on free amino acids will slow down recovery substantially.</p>
<p>Interestingly L-carnitine supplements seem to show benefit for DOMS but that research is really new and I don’t quite understand how that mechanism would work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just like what the other response said,  stretching is honestly what will make DOMS go away. You get DOMS because when you go to sleep you don't move and your muscles get extremely stiff, the stiffness is why you arms or legs &quot;lock&quot; in place. Doing stretches before you go to bed and do them several times the day will help mitigate DOMS, it just gets worse and worse if you don't stretch. The muscle will still need to heal and you it will still be fatigued but it won't be as painful to move.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But micro-tears keep going on all the time when we continually work out, that's how we build more muscle. But the biggest soreness and pain disappears after a few weeks of continuous workouts, even with progressive overload and more effort.</p>
<p>So if micro-tears were the reason, surely we would feel sore and painful after every single hard workout, but we don't. For some reason the body adapts to the workouts and doesn't feel like it's necessary to notify us of the soreness and pain that much anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was looking this up a few months ago, and I settled on this answer (I feel like it was because of a paper I read, but I can't find it now)</p>
<p>We experience inflamation as something bad, but functionally, in wounds, cell repair etc. inflamation is tissue expanding as it fills with fluid and the intercellular matrix opens up. In other words, it's like your body is putting your muscle on jacks and opening up the bonnet.</p>
<p>In injury, we send in macrophages and white blood cells to absorb damaged cells before their biproducts do any damage to surrounding ones, and the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Daniel_Freidenreich/publication/230643818_Immune_Responses_to_Resistance_Exercise/links/0912f511d2e591731b000000/Immune-Responses-to-Resistance-Exercise.pdf" target="_blank">same occurs</a> in exercise recovery, except we also send in things called <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Goran_Paulsen/publication/230643819_Leucocytes_cytokines_and_satellite_cells_What_role_do_they_play_in_muscle_damage_and_regeneration_following_eccentric_exercise/links/09e41502b76cf946a1000000.pdf" target="_blank">satellite cells</a> which are fast reproducing proto-muscle cells that will fill in the gaps, sort out fibres etc.</p>
<p>Basically, it's not all about &quot;damage&quot;, you can still have satellite infiltration of muscle without any significant quantity of the &quot;clean up crew&quot; being there, but both types of cell need room to actually get in there and start working.</p>
<p>This could explain why DOMS happens a day later; your body is assuming that while whatever exercise you were doing is going on, it's probably better to just leave a note and get back to it, like hearing a weird sound from the engine while on a long drive, and remembering to go to the garage on the way back. This also gives a a suggestion of why DOMS occurs more when doing unusual exercise; because you're remodelling the muscle structure to optimise for things you haven't previously emphasised.</p>
<p>TLDR: Inflamation is a sign of your body at work, either because something is actually damaged, or because you need to do some serious remodelling of your muscle fibres.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like to think of it as your cells are lazy.  If you're not exercising, they build up a lot of unnecessary cruft - sarcomeres that are imperfectly structured, membrane that's too tight, extra connections between membrane, T-tubules and sarcolemma - that are extra sensitive to mechanical loading.  Those first, unaccustomed exercises focus damage there, and encourage the trash to be thrown out, so the muscle is better prepared for subsequent contractions.</p>
<p>No evidence for this, AFAIK, and it would take some really incredible, quantitative electron microscopy to prove, but it's consistent with what we do know.  The repeated bout effect is not just pain, but also inflammation and everything down to structural derangements like Z-line streaming.  There probably is some accommodation in the nerve endings that actually report pain, but I'm not sure people even agree which endings those are.  There's so much muscle in muscle, it's hard to see anything else.</p></div>		</li>
