Would it improve the economy if jobs had more worker friendly policies regarding sick days (ie. less money spent on healthcare; increased worker productivity; less overall sick days needed since less people get sick)?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes. Less transmission means less illness.</p>

<p>That's something that can only really be answered with a proper study, and I can't seem to find one from a cursory search. However I'd imagine that, as one ill worker can infect many colleagues, even if being ill causes only a small decrease in efficiency then the negatives of coming in to work ill would offset the positives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also don't forget about the original antigenic sin. When you get infected by a slightly different antigenic variant of the virus, the immune response will be slightly weaker than the last one (due to preformed antibodies against the previous virus trying to unsuccessfully attack the new virus). So your immune response may actually be weaker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The explanation they gave in the comment you replied to is that the response is weaker because it's using the response for one that's meant for another.</p>
<p>Say you're infected with 1a, and develop antibodies for 1a.  Now you're infected with 1b, but your immune system thinks it's 1a and throws your 1a antibodies at it instead of developing 1b antibodies.</p>
<p>I have no knowledge on the veracity <em>of</em> the claim, but this is the mechanism as described in the comment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your comment is misinformed. Antigenic variants can indeed trigger a weaker immune response. This is especially true in the case of viruses that frequently undergo antigenic drift and/or shift like flu. That's why vaccine development for like diseases focuses on covering a variety of serotypes at once.</p></div>		</li>
