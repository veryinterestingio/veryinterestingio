			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. All it takes is something to trigger a miss fold of the necessary protein, which is how these started in the first place, and no one knows exactly what causes that. I've also seen speculation that naturally occurring prions are actually a relatively common occurrence and the body simply has methods to eliminate them, and it's only when those methods break down or the body gets an influx of too many at once (from infected meat) that they actually become a danger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had an aunt pass away yesterday from spontaneous CJD. 4 months ago she was fine. 2 she was displaying minor symptoms. A month ago she was admitted to hospital, non-verbal, physical deficits etc. And now she's gone. Spontaneous CJD is a bitch and is aggressive as fuck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Prions do adapt. There are conformational differences between 'strains' which have the same amino acid sequences. The different strains have different traits and the conformational changes are passed on to new prions when misfolding occurs. There is variation, heritiability, and differential fitness. Selection can and does act on prions.</p></div>		</li>
