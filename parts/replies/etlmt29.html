<p>But the above paragraphs are just explanations for the widespread <em>idea</em> that the majority of animals used to be bigger in the past, so let's look at some actual data.  Giant arthropods like the <em>Meganeura</em> shown above and even larger terrestrial species like <a href="https://i.redd.it/wnvfqpyzfhq01.jpg" target="_blank"><em>Arthropleura</em></a> are certainly impressive, and the most commonly given explanation for their large size is due to high levels of atmospheric oxygen during their time.  The logic here being that if these animals are limited in size by the amount of oxygen they can get through their tracheal systems, then more oxygen should equal larger body size.  While it is true that this may be part of the explanation, oxygen levels don't seem to fully explain these large arthropods alone, since there were other periods of history with increased oxygen levels but no corresponding increase in insect size (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1502-3931.2008.00094.x" target="_blank">Okajima 2008</a>).  Additionally, the same groups of insects reached more or less their present size not long after that period, so there's many more normal-sized fossil insects giant ones; there is no real trend towards either larger or smaller sizes over the past 65 million years (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/evo.13302" target="_blank">Waller and Svensson 2017</a>).  And finally, on a similar note to blue whales, it's worth noting that the <a href="https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/c14e9d11-bc34-42aa-a328-e7f79e7328ae/dcnjrxw-7fad0887-5226-486c-a1cb-6c28ed1f116c.jpg/v1/fill/w_1024,h_521,q_75,strp/giant_squid_and_colossal_squid_size_by_harry_the_fox_dcnjrxw-fullview.jpg?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7ImhlaWdodCI6Ijw9NTIxIiwicGF0aCI6IlwvZlwvYzE0ZTlkMTEtYmMzNC00MmFhLWEzMjgtZTdmNzllNzMyOGFlXC9kY25qcnh3LTdmYWQwODg3LTUyMjYtNDg2Yy1hMWNiLTZjMjhlZDFmMTE2Yy5qcGciLCJ3aWR0aCI6Ijw9MTAyNCJ9XV0sImF1ZCI6WyJ1cm46c2VydmljZTppbWFnZS5vcGVyYXRpb25zIl19.u1Wak7i6qdTWf1VE3Braedz5HCZrb6ho1d5hi8DjTcI" target="_blank">largest known invertebrates</a> from any time period are alive right now.</p>
<p>Moving on to dinosaurs, we reach the group with the largest land animals to have ever walked the Earth, so it is fair to say that <em>some</em> dinosaurs were of course much larger than their living relatives.  Trends in dinosaur body size over time have been studied extensively, but at least some recent studies fail to find any evidence of strong trends one way or the other during the course of dinosaur evolution; <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/pala.12329" target="_blank">Benson et al. 2017</a> describe these trends as mostly constrained exploration around an overall mean that rarely changes, rather than a steady increase or decline.  Of course, these giant dinosaurs did all go extinct, and the end-Cretaceous extinction did cause some pretty dramatic filtering of species by body size.  It is fairly well established that smaller animals do much better in major extinction events like this (known as the &quot;Lilliput effect&quot;), and dinosaurs were no exception, since only the small theropods we now know of as birds survived to the present.  Check out <a href="https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/67/1/1/3960267" target="_blank">Berv and Field 2018</a> for an interesting approach to studying this effect in birds.</p>
<p>Mammals seem to go in the <em>opposite</em> direction of a trend from larger to smaller body size.  The earliest mammals that co-existed with non-avian dinosaurs were all relatively small (ranging from mouse/shrew size like <a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8M36lI_sPgE/WrKTTTSzMHI/AAAAAAAABoM/h6jO6jnvYigiF6BTOw-zn1RSNfv4FsnvwCLcBGAs/s0/Megazostrodon_sp._Natural_History_Museum_-_London.jpg" target="_blank"><em>Megazostrodon</em></a> to the roughly badger-sized <a href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/dinosaurs/images/e/eb/Reponomamus.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20151026215522" target="_blank"><em>Reponomamus</em></a>), and it was not until the end-Cretaceous mass extinction that mammals really started to get larger.  And indeed, it does seem like there may have been a detectable <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/112/16/5093/F3.large.jpg?width=800&amp;height=600&amp;carousel=1" target="_blank">trend towards larger body sizes</a> in mammals throughout this period (<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/112/16/5093" target="_blank">Baker et al. 2015</a>).  The main reason the largest mammals are not alive today is likely due to hunting by humans, and it can be seen in the fossil record that the arrival of humans is strongly associated with a <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Large_Mammals_Africa_Australia_NAmerica_Madagascar.svg/1024px-Large_Mammals_Africa_Australia_NAmerica_Madagascar.svg.png" target="_blank">drop-off in large mammal populations</a> independent of other factors such as ice ages, etc.  Though, as others have mentioned, blue whales are still around (<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Blue_Whale_Population_v1.svg/800px-Blue_Whale_Population_v1.svg.png" target="_blank">despite our best efforts</a>) and are still the largest known animals of any time period ever!</p>
<p>So to wrap up, there are definitely many examples of extinct species that were larger than their modern equivalents; that's not up for debate.  However, the evolution of extremely large species happened at different times in different groups, and the success of such forms seems to have been brought to an end by different factors as well.  And furthermore, these giants tend to be eye-catching outliers within a much larger field of relatively average specimens that just tend to receive less attention, so the idea that there could be any single explanatory trend responsible for all large extinct species doesn't really hold up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I definitely think sources are important!  I tend to see a lot of generalizations and oversimplifications related to this idea which, while not strictly wrong, don't quite tell the whole story either.  And luckily enough there is a pretty huge abundance of literature on this subject so it wasn't all that hard to track down some relevant citations :P.</p></div>		</li>
