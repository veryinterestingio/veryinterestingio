			<div class="markdown"><p>Mole is a quantity. Just like a dozen eggs is 12 eggs, a mole of eggs is 6.02214076Ã—10^23 eggs.</p>
<p>This is a huge number, but it is used to measure tiny things, like atoms and molecules. So one mole of hydrogen atoms is only about 1 g in weight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Moles <em>are</em> particle numbers.</p>
<p>The reason why we count particle numbers in units of moles is because it's actually simpler than using single particles as the unit. Particle numbers would be extremely large numbers when referring even to fractions of a gram; moles easily avoid this.</p>
<p>It also simplifies mass calculations, because the number of gram per mole is about the same as the number of nucleons per molecule.</p>
<p>An oxygen nucleus (usually) has 16 nucleons, so it has a mass of about 16 units per atom. Atomic oxygen therefore has a mass of about 16 gram per mole. To me, this seems like a pretty simple way of doing calculations, and it works just great.</p>
<p>Without moles we'd need to calculate grams per atom instead of per mole. I don't know of any clever way to to this without having to memorize additional constants and throwing around powers of ten in your calculations.</p></div>		</li>
