			<div class="markdown"><p>Could a collider be built from the ground-up to be modular, such that different firing mechanisms can be &quot;slotted&quot; in and out to change say from ion/ion to electron/ion or other types of particle collisions?</p>
<p>Or are the physics too different and require radically different collider designs for different types of interaction?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My work is on detector experiments as opposed to the accelerator itself so take what I have to say with a pinch of salt. It seems within the realm of physical possibility to do something like that, but maybe outside the realm of physical practicality. Historically the LHC uses many of the same accelerator components that were used by LEP (large electron positron collider) but I don't know of any colliders that were able to switch from electrons to ions at will.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The LHC collides ions as well, it's normally p-p, but it can also do heavy ions. I'm not sure if there's a reason it couldn't do electrons except for the issue of synchrotron radiation, making electrons curve will cause them to radiate photons and slow down. This effect is related to the mass <del>squared</del> to the fourth of the particle, so you normally don't use circular colliders for electrons. However, there are some projects which aim to do just that, e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Circular_Collider" target="_blank">FCC</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The big difference between these particles is their charge to mass ratio. It’s not so hard to adjust the accelerator between protons and different nuclei, but the mass is so much smaller for the electron that it causes a problem. It’s mass is so small that at high energies radiation caused by the acceleration from curving around the circular accelerator leads to large energy losses. All of that means different different accelerator designs are necessary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It will provide information to better inform physics that is done in the future, but I have the feeling that you are asking about some practical application. There might be some spin off developments in things like computing or magnet technology, but any application of the physics studied is almost impossible to predict.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most people aren't answering you seriously here, but there are a couple real answers to this. The EIC isn't really expected to do as much &quot;exploring the unknown&quot; as a machine like the LHC. </p>
<p>The main questions the EIC seeks to solve are about gluons, which are responsible for much more of the visible mass in the universe than the Higgs is. </p>
<p>How do gluons contribute to the proton mass? How does the gluon spin contribute to the proton spin? What are the properties of extremely dense gluon matter in nuclei, do they reach a &quot;saturation scale&quot; where the recombination of gluons balances their splitting apart? These are all questions the EIC will be able to contribute to significantly.</p>
<p>Without an EIC, our knowledge of the proton and nuclei will remain somewhat hazy. This directly effects new physics searches at proton colliders like the LHC because currently our lack of knowledge of the proton is actually the largest uncertainty in constraining new physics.</p></div>		</li>
