<a href="https://www.nrel.gov/pv/cell-efficiency.html" target="_blank">https://www.nrel.gov/pv/cell-efficiency.html</a></p>
<p>One thing you'll notice from that figure is that there are many research cells with efficiencies higher than what would be considered the shockley-queisser limit.  These devices aren't &quot;breaking physics&quot;, they're really just playing around the fact that the shockley-queisser limit applies to a single band gap semiconductor.  If you use multiple different semiconductors with multiple different band gaps, you can productively absorb more of the sun's spectrum to produce power.  </p>
<p>So you use a material with a high band gap stacked on top of a material with a lower bandgap and the high band gap material absorbs high energy photons while being transparent to the lower energy photons.  The low band gap material can then productively turn those lower energy photons into electrons and holes to also generate power over a part of the sun's spectrum that the other material wouldn't be able to use.</p>
<p>Practically, these multi-junction solar cells are very difficult to make because a single junction device is a single thin film (or wafer) with electrodes on either side (think of a sandwich).  When you start stacking these up, you need electrodes between every junction (think of a club sandwich), so you need many thin films stacked on each other which becomes increasingly difficult to manufacture, and increasingly expensive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s more than just mechanically stacked tandem cells as well, the use of optical splitters is a cheaper option: placing a splitter at a 45 degree angle would reflect certain wavelengths to one solar panel on a 90 degree while letting other wavelengths pass through the splitter to a different panel. This way you don’t have to stack the cells in any weird way. Similarly, you don’t have to worry about dark spots on subsequently stacked cells due to the electrodes from higher cells blocking light from passing to the next cell, which eliminates a whole slew of inefficiencies present in tandem cells. </p>
<p>As a matter of fact, using optical splitters is probably the more effective way to build tandem cells - theoretically, a splitter could separate light into an infinite amount of wavelengths directed at an infinite amount of panels with different band gaps, resulting in near 100% system efficiency. Obviously this won’t happen, but I believe that optical splitters are the way to go with tandem cells. </p>
<p>Side note, the average increase in efficiency of tandem cells when taking into account the increased parasitic loss and cost to manufacture, looking at the decrease in cost per watt, is about 4% at its best right now. </p>
<p>Also, some of those research panels that NREL posted are doing much better because they aren’t testing with “one sun” of energy - many of the use 2, 3, sometimes 100 times the energy of the sun. Consequently, a solar panel that tests at 35% efficiency in the lab under those ideal conditions could very well only perform at 15% or less in real world applications. </p>

<p>Edit: thank you for the silver kind stranger! Fun fact, silver is a pretty darn good conductor and certain alloys are actually used as electrodes in experimental solar cells! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm coming from a materials science background, so I wasn't familiar with optical splitting as an option for tandem cells.</p>
<p>However, optical splitting requires you to put more area down for your full device (2x area for a tandem cell).  So your power output/area would be smaller with an optical splitter than even just putting down a full area of a single junction device, no?</p>
<p>And, yeah, I didn't notice that those top areas of the NREL chart were concentrator cells.  Most of the people on the materials  research side of things are dealing with the bottom right of that chart :(  .</p></div>		</li>

<p>What I'm hearing is that we should concentrate solar, recollumnate it, run it through a prism, and have a differently designed solar panel for each color.</p>
<p>Am I hearing right?  I have very little context on this.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not entirely convinced it won't, actually.  If, rather than a discrete set of more conventional splitters, you were to use diffraction or dispersion to separate your light, you could achieve a continuum distribution of your wavelengths.  You'd still have the issue of electrical connections to your junctions, and how to effectively extract that array of slightly different voltages though... which I don't have a solution for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I assume this is a case of science imitating nature, since this stacked functions system is very similar to the way in which plant chloroplasts utilize light to maximize efficiency. The main chlorophyll pigments absorb at their specific frequencies, but chloroplasts also have many accessory pigments with different absorption spectra for the purpose of picking up more incoming light. After the accessory pigments, the excited electrons are cascaded back to chlorophyll, since chlorophyll has the main mechanism for post photochemistry energy storage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is awesome. Any other time i would have glossed over this and thought &quot;meh cool i guess&quot; but right now the stars aligned with me watching Steve Moulds video yesterday and reading this post while studying for my material sciences of metals exam. So suddenly i feel like I understand solar cells!</p>
<p>Edit: does this mean we can adjust what light is absorbed by heating/cooling solar cells or by applying mechanical stress?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now there's an engineering student type of question!  Semiconductor mobility is changed by temperature.  At low temperatures you can &quot;freeze out&quot; the doping of a semiconductor. A normal doping of silicon will be n type or p type based on what element you dope into it (alloy in a very small amount). Those impurity atoms have an extra electron or hole which increase the conductivity of the lattice because they have energy levels near the conduction band or valence band of the semiconductor.  The key word there is &quot;near&quot; the conduction band and valence band.  At room temperature, atoms have something like 30meV of energy.  This energy is enough to promote those dopant electrons and holes into the conduction/valence band from the band gap of the material.  When you start cooling the semiconductor down, though,  these dopant carriers effectively become &quot;stuck&quot; on their parent atoms because they are stuck in an energy well. </p>
<p>At high temps though, what happens in a crystalline semiconductor is that you also decrease the conductivity because the charge carriers (electrons and holes) will begin to collide with the semiconductor lattice, effectively reducing your conductivity by blocking their movement across the lattice.  So there is a sweet spot for conductivity in terms of temperature range for semiconductors, and solar cells depend on that conductivity to transport charge carriers to the electrodes.</p>
<p>With respect to mechanical stress, it is possible to change the band gap of a thin film semiconductor by putting it on a substrate material that it is epitaxial on.  This is limited by how much strain the thin film can tolerate, and by the thickness of the thin film.  So, it may be possible to tune, but even at the hundreds of nanometers of thickness you need for a thin-film solar cell, I would think the lattice would relax back to its unstressed state through the thickness of the device.  I would have to think about whether it would be possible to just mechanically compress a solar cell material, though my instinct is no, because they tend to be brittle (so they don't tolerate much strain compared to a metal/polymer).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone else replied to me about doing that.  I think theoretically, yes, but in that case you're effectively increasing the area of the device for every split of the spectrum that you do.</p>
<p>Someone could correct me if I'm thinking about that in the wrong way.  Like, if you're generating power, you would want the highest power/surface area you could generate, and by splitting the spectrum you are increasing the area of the device that needs to absorb those photons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily, a multi-juntion is, optically, a vertical spectrum splitter. People have looked at horizontal diffractive splitters, where the colors are &quot;focused&quot; into a specific sub-area, where a cell with the correct band gap is located. So you more efficiently use the original area. Also, you could use verically split with some angled filters and cells on the side of the stack. Unfortunately, that turned out to be too mechanically complex to complete in the span of one PhD.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw a talk a while ago about using organic-coupled nanodots to convert two low-energy photons into one energetic enough to create an electron-hole pair. The nanomaterial doesn't absorb much above 1.1 eV, so you don't need to separate the light at all. </p>
<p>I'm sure there are technical challenges with that (it's not really my field), but something like it is possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The trick is doing that without increasing the footprint.  In principle you can win by using multiple absorbing species in a stack or whatever, but in practice it's both complicated and expensive.  You're generally better off for the foreseeable future just putting up more Si panels.</p></div>		</li>
