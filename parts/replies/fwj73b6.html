			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if 100 TB HHDs will ever come. <del>If you can read and write that at a solid 100 MB/s it would take over 9 months to fill or read the drive according to my napkin math. What needs that much storage and can tolerate a 9 months data copy copy to get the data back off for backup purposes?</del></p>
<p>edit: bad math is bad</p></div>		</li>

<p>consumer HDDs are &quot;still&quot; 1TB/2TB, with rare exceptions.</p>
<p>consumer NAS HDDs are 4TB/8TB</p>
<p>I don't think they'll ever bring that kind of capacity to the consumer products</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll remember your comment in 5-10 years and see where we are then lol</p>
<p>But we are on the backend of consumer HDDs only being 1-2TB. They're starting to rise up past that now.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The thing is there is not so much need these days as you can use cloud storage and let economy of scale take care of the costs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Idk, the &quot;you don't need that much storage&quot; argument has literally ALWAYS been proven wrong with time.</p>
<p>I get that your argument is a little different with cloud storage, but even still, file sizes keep increasing and increasing, and most company roadmaps have consumer drives in the tens of terabytes in the next decade or so.</p></div>		</li>
