<p>Except that cream stays in foam form quite a bit longer than soda does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Err... maybe.  With artificial flavors, you can get most of the way there.</p>
<p>The big challenge is the acidity.  That's what gives that carbonated &quot;bite&quot; to it.  However, acids and cream don't get along well: that's how you get curdled milk/cream.  So you would have to be pretty careful with that part.  Something like a sweat creamsicle whipped cream?  Totally doable.  Root beer whipped cream?  That'd be tricky.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does that mean that the only thing inside the can is the ingredients, plus N2O?   So when the can is spent, there's useable, expanded whipped cream inside, equal in volume to the can?</p>
<p>Would it be more efficient to have, say, a sliding bottom inside the can, and a similarly pressurized volume of plain or N2 between the moveable inner floor and the outer floor, so that the inner floor slides up and  100% of the cream is dispensed?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is liquid cream and n2o in the can. Since you dispense it with the can upside down you'd have to run out of n2o before cream to leave any behind. The cream isn't whipped in the can, it gets whipped as the gas comes out of solution when it's dispensed.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>But you said n2o is fat soluble, so it can move inside the cream.</p>
<p>I assumed that meant that there's not separate volumes of cream and gas, but that they were uniform in the can.  That's why we shake before serving, right?</p>
<p>So why would there still be pressurized gas in there after the last bit of cream is already dispensed?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of what used to be solely aerosol products now have a bag containing the product in the can and a pressurized gas between the bag and can. When the pressure is reduced in the bag from the valve opening when the product is being used, the pressure between the can and bag pushes the contents out. I don’t know for certain that also applies to whipped cream but it seems likely. </p>
<p>Source: a friend’s family business is operating an “aerosol” canning facility and he has told me this setup is pretty ubiquitous in the industry. They use that setup for pretty much everything now, according to him.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is how aerosol cheese is done. There is a separate chamber for the gas and the product.</p>
<p>Yes, the nitrous and cream are in direct contact. The gas acts in two ways.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It pushes the cream out of the can when you have it turned upside down because there is a gas space volume.</p>
</li>
<li>The gas dissolved in the cream expands very quickly when it passes through the gasket and nozzle, thereby shearing the liquid into a semi-stable fluffy cream. </li>
</ol>
<p>NIST Office of Weights and Measures performs random checks to ensure the stated net weight labeled on the front of the can is what can actually be dispensed. The extra (if any) is chalked up to giveaway and yield loss.</p></div>		</li>
