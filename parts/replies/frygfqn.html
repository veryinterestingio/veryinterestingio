			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, as I wrote I gave the numbers explicitly on HFS with 76% carbohydrates and 24% water. A quick back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that if you remove the water out of the calculation, you'll end up with 3.70kcal/g for the fructose itself.</p>
<p>Same for honey: There we get 3.71kcal/g for the extracted carbohydrates alone. Which is important especially with honey, as the sugar:water ratio varies a lot.</p>
<p>Regardless, in the end, 4kcal/g is a good approximation, but the real values are a tad lower.</p>
<p>And so you'll end up with 43g fructose x 3.70kcal/g = 159.1kcal, which is close enough to the stated 160kcal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, I only mention it cause when people say 1 gram of carbohydrate ~= 4kcal it doesn’t include water molecules.</p></div>		</li>
