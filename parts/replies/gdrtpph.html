<p>To get the pedantic part of me out of the way first: Do something about what? :) That said, I suspect you're referring to the ecological problems of our planet?</p>
<p>I am not qualified to give a comprehensive policy proposal or answer, so I'll just share something from my experience as a citizen science practitioner.</p>
<p>To echo <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/k1zw8e/askscience_ama_series_hello_im_dr_penyuan_hsing/gdszozh/" target="_blank">my other comment</a>, I have been greatly inspired by grassroots citizen science initiatives like <a href="https://publiclab.org/" target="_blank">Public Lab</a> or <a href="https://safecast.org/" target="_blank">Safecast</a>. These are concerned <em>citizens</em> who wanted to investigate environmental problems that affected them and took upon themselves to learn the skills needed to do so (including building their own scientific instrumentation as open source hardware!).</p>
<p>Importantly, they not only produced scientific discoveries, but also used that knowledge in civic engagement that lead to positive change in their communities.</p>
<p>In other words, I always like to say that citizen science isn't just about citizens collecting data for scientists, it's also about how science can be a tool to help us be more engaged citizens.</p>
<p>(Caveat: There is a spectrum of expertise from an amatuer (for lack of a better word) citizen scientist to a highly specialised professional scientist. Everyone can play different, useful roles while recognizing and respecting those important differences)</p>
<p>I'll mention this <a href="https://youtu.be/5gK2EEwzjPQ?t=53" target="_blank">cool clip of Neil deGrasse Tyson</a> (<a href="https://invidious.snopyta.org/watch?v=5gK2EEwzjPQ" target="_blank">non-YouTube link</a>) talking about science literacy and critical thinking where (to paraphrase) he said by having those things you can be more engaged in the democratic process.</p>
<p>I suspect that if we are more scientifically literate, not just via facts but also with critical thinking skills, we can effect positive change in public policy.</p></div>		</li>
