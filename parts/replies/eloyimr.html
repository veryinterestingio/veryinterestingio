			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not an engineer, but my understanding is that most dams have the hydroelectric generators as part of the main structures.</p>
<p>It seems that this is the case at the <a href="https://www.usbr.gov/lc/hooverdam/faqs/powerfaq.html" target="_blank">Hoover Dam</a>. I believe what the other person was saying was that the turbines at the end of the tunnel were put there because they already had water flowing so “why not?”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, they’re definitely in the main structure as well. The tunnels were just used for turbines to increase the amount of power generated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For both the Glen Canyon and Hoover dams, the generators are inside the dam, at the bottom. I’ve been in them both. I’m pretty sure that the diversion tunnel does not generate power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. The turbines were not placed on the diversion tunnels! One tunnel on each side is still open at the bottom and these tunnels were, after the construction phase requiring diversion was complete, connected to the spillways on either side of the dam. The last time the spillways carried water was in 1983 (the reservoir is currently around 140 feet below full!)</p>
<p>The turbines are connected to a separate system, which uses 30 foot diameter steel penstocks to carry water from the intake towers to a gallery behind each powerhouse. There, smaller tubes (relatively speaking as each is still over 13 feet diameter) connect to the big tube and deliver water to each turbine.</p>
<p>The far ends of the penstock systems are connected to a discharge structure that has a set of butterfly valves on each side of the canyon. They made an impressive show when they were turned on shortly after the dam was completed but IIRC they have not been used since.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the penstocks from each side were converted from 2 of the original diversion tunnels. Also, the spillways haven’t been used since the last flood in the 80s but they do have a pump system at the bottom so they can still send water from it to surrounding areas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean I'd argue it still is an engineering marvel. It's absolutely enourmous. A lot of people died during construction though, over 100. According to Wikipedia, the <em>last</em> person to die during construction in 1935 was an electrician whose father was the <em>first</em> recorded death in 1922 (he drowned surveying for a location for the dam). That's nuts.</p></div>		</li>
