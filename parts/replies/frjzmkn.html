			<div class="markdown"><p>No harm at all! How most NSAIDS work is by blunting the production of some of these signalling molecules that make you feel bad. Aspirin for example blocks an enzyme that produces leukotrienes, which contribute to the gross feeling you get during the flu. There have been some stories circulating that NSAIDs are bad for you when you have the flu or coronavirus, but these have not been backed up by proper science, so do not pay them any heed! Your inflammatory response can do its job to kill the pathogen even when you're taking these meds. But rest is important too ðŸ˜Š</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answers however I'd like to point out that Prostaglandin production rather than Leukotriene production is inhibited by NSAIDs (via COX-1/COX-2 inhibition of the Cyclooxygenase pathway, Leukotrienes are produced via Lipoxygenase and are not affected by NSAIDs, it's actually thought that bouts of Asthma caused by NSAID inhibition of the Cyclooxygenase pathway is stimulated by increased Leukotriene production as they both have the same progenitor molecule in Arachidonic Acid).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this also apply when taking NSAIDs for joint inflammation after hard physical exertion, ie lifting weights? Some say that taking NSAIDs will prolong the healing process by decreasing inflammation, but make it more bearable - never researched it myself. Is there any truth to this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also a theory that the symptoms of psychological depression--withdrawing from people and the world, not wanting to go outside, being tired all the time, even trying to hide how bad you feel--are caused by &quot;sickness behavior&quot; being triggered even though you're not sick.</p></div>		</li>
