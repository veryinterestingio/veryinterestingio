			<div class="markdown"><p>For what it's worth, hard drives are not affected by any sort of magnet that would realistically be possible to someone like you or me. In fact, inside of them are incredibly strong neodymium magnets to control the read/write head.</p>
<p>The other things you said are true, though</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, technically you could... But that would be one hell of a magnet. So maybe the one on Breaking Bad would work? Who knows. From what I've seen, it takes a magnet with upwards of 450 pounds of pulling strength to damage it.</p>
<p>... Which at that point, I think you're more likely to physically damage it than electronically, anyway</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many years ago I worked in a shop that built Point of Sale computer stations, and we would just image HD's all day long.  At the &quot;imaging station&quot; was a big old device that wiped drives with a magnet. I recall you'd turn it on and it vibrate or hum or some kind of noise and we'd place the drive ontop of it.  This was in the 90's.</p>
<p>15 years later I worked on a data center floor, and all drives had to be destroyed. No matter what condition. I have a photo of a push cart, piled high with 1TB IBM enterprise drives. All worked fine, the project changed, and some department had to get all new hardware. Dozens of perfectly good 1TB enterprise class drives getting sent through a grinder (like a small scale one you see a junk yard) was the saddest day of my life.</p>
<p>I doubt that's relevant, but it was just sad. Still affects me to this day!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Static magnets behave very differently on magnetic medium than an electromagnet or degausser with a varying field. </p>
<p>Hard drives work by using an electromagnet to magnetically move a bit  and then later read its direction. Wave a magnet furiously over it or an electromagnet that changes direction 60 times a second and it scramble all those saved bits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was something called a magnetic degausser, there were electric magnets made to wipe old media like that. I have one I inherited that kind of resembled a clothes iron, but never found a use for. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degaussing#Magnetic_data_storage_media" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degaussing#Magnetic_data_storage_media</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, this isn't new. The Palm Pre back in 2009 used magnets to align itself on its wireless charging dock. I've always been a little annoyed that the Qi standard doesn't provide a spec for optional magnetic positioning.</p></div>		</li>
