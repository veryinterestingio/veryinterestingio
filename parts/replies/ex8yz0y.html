			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like a hand waving bit of pop evolutionary psychology.   The real answer probably has something to do with releases of signaling molecules, and interacting agonistic and antagonistic feedback loops.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd wager this is more accurate. The nerves that receive the offending signal, and the motor neurons that execute a purge, don't tend to operate in a continuous manner. Signals reach a threshold, fire off to the next nerves, and there's a recovery time for neurotransmitters. Even at the most rapid firing, I doubt there'd be a sustained, continuous signal...neurons would get &quot;burned out&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm guessing you've never been pregnant? Having just experienced 3 months of constant nausea, I can assure you that while it does indeed become a primary preoccupation, this particular kind of nausea most certainly is not possible to &quot;correct&quot; and does not go away (except with blessed medication, for me anyway. Some people vomit fairly constantly even with medication and need to be hospitalized).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hyperemesis gravidarum is what it's called when it becomes so bad you need to be hospitalized. I was in and out of the ER constantly my first trimester and lost a significant amount of weight. The vomiting lasted my entire pregnancy but it was much more manageable by the 3rd trimester. It also took me about that long to get over my embarrassment of puking in public.</p></div>		</li>
