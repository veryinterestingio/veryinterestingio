			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. The DMUs I know about have two gears and an automatic gearbox. They've got a Voith transmission with a fluid coupling but the speed they change from low to high depends on the class of DMU. </p>
<p>A class 172 had a six speed mechanical gearbox.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the U.K. the class 158’s and 170’s use 3 speed gearboxes and hydraulic transmissions. These are from 80’s/90’s and possibly up to early 00’s I believe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many many years ago I travelled from Patras to Athens on a Greek train made up of about 6 DMUs.</p>
<p>That has a three speed manual non-syncromesh transmission. Imagine a gear selector rod running down 6 cars...</p>
<p>Train would pull away in first, hit peak revs, driver then attempted to double declutch into second, crunch, crunch, grind. Train would lose so much momentum driver would have go back into first. Repeat several times, eventually into second. Peak revs in second, repeat again going into third. Quite amusing.</p>
<p>Explains why we were about 4 hours late into Athens.</p></div>		</li>
