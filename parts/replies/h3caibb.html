			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to add to this comment that phosphorylation of a protein is not a binary on always. It can function as a on or off switch and single phosphorylation events do not necessarily cause the intended affect. Sometime multiple phosphorylation events (and in specific sites) are needed to activate or deactivate and a combination of the sites can lead to different functions.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Or two phosphates when necessary, generating AMP.</p>

<p>This allows it to be used as a tool to give up one of the phosphate groups to a protein as needed (phosphorylation, the “on switch” for tons of proteins), the breaking of this unstable bond provides the energy needed.</p>

<p>Phosphorylation of proteins is an important use for ATP, but it's also used in lots of other reactions. And it belongs to a general pool of NTPs - GTP, UTP, and CTP are all used for more specific things. There are enzymes converting between these to balance out all four &quot;energy currencies.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
