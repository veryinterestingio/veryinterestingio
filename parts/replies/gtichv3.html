			<div class="markdown"><p>Continued from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/mktc1g/eli5_what_are_acts_in_a_moviefilm_and_how_are/gtichv3?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank">PART ONE</a></p>
<p>So here are a few concrete examples:</p>
<p>Star Wars:</p>
<ul>
<li>Act 1 ends with Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru's deaths. This is the point at which there's nothing keeping Luke on Tatooine, allowing him to pursue his goal: to save the princess. Directly after their deaths, he sets out on his journey to find a pilot and go off on his heroic quest.</li>
<li>The midpoint is then finding the princess. Prior to this, things kept going well for the heroes: they find some allies, get a ship, take off into space, reach the Death Star, conveniently go unnoticed while sneaking about, find the holding cells, free the princess...everything seems to go well in act 2a. But then things all go to hell: as soon as they find Leia, the Imperials become aware of their presence! They almost die in a trash compactor! They get split up! BEN KENOBI DIES! They get chased by tie fighters! And Han and Chewbacca abandon Luke as soon as they get their money! Luke succeeds in rescuing the princess, but Act 2b doesn't end triumphantly; rather, despite achieving the goal, act 2 ends on a down note.</li>
<li>With the princess saved (our initial goal), act 3 then provides a new goal: destroy the Death Star. Our sci-fi fairy tale about a knight's quest to save a princess suddenly turns into a WWII aerial combat film about a ragtag group of pilots going on a suicide mission to destroy an enemy base.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Matrix:</p>
<ul>
<li>The point of attack is pretty obvious here: when Neo takes the red pill. Morpheus literally tells him that it's a point of no return. Thus ends act 1. Our goal? It is not to stop the robots, to free humanity, or anything quite so grand; rather, the goal is simply to discover whether Neo is &quot;the one&quot;.</li>
<li>Once again, Act 2 follows a pattern of positive action then negative action. As Neo learns the truth about the Matrix and goes through his kung fu training, we're told that he's unlike anyone they've seen before. Things are looking up. But then we reach the midpoint, when Morpheus takes Neo back in to meet the Oracle...who tells us NEO IS NOT THE ONE! (That was literally our goal!) Then, it gets worse: Cypher is a traitor! And he kills Mouse, Switch, Tank, and that other guy! And Morpheus (our Obi-Wan Kenobi equivalent) gets captured! Everything has gone to shit! So at the end of Act 2, we are at our lowest point.</li>
<li>In act 3, we get a new goal: save Morpheus. Now, Neo goes on the offensive, and along the way, we find out that the resolution to our initial goal -- that Neo isn't the one -- was false information (thanks to YukariYakum0 for correcting my memory of The Matrix).</li>
</ul>
<p>Thor: Ragnarok</p>
<ul>
<li>End of act 1: Hela's arrival and Thor's landing on Sakaar. Thor's immediate goal, then, is to escape Sakaar (and in this case, we already know what the third act goal will be: to defeat Hela)</li>
<li>Here, we get the opposite pattern from Star Wars and The Matrix, as we begin Act 2 with negative action, as act 2a gives us Thor with no agency, unable to accomplish anything, and being forced to fight in the arena. But after the match (which is the midpoint), we switch to positive action as Thor goes proactive, finds the Quinjet, gains allies in Bruce, Valkyrie, and Loki, steals a ship, enters the wormhole, and successfully escapes.</li>
<li>Act 3 gives us the new goal of defeating Hela and saving the Asgardians.</li>
</ul>
<p>So that's the basics of the three-act structure. But you can even break it down further! Go back to that image of Pegg and Wright, and you'll see that they not only break their outline into 4 acts, but each act also has two &quot;sequences&quot;. Sequences are narrative units that can be grouped by a consistent concern, goal, or subject matter; it's a narrative unit larger than a scene, but smaller than an act. And &quot;3-act films&quot; (which actually have 4 acts) almost always have 8 sequences. So, to revisit some of those previous examples:</p>
<p>Star Wars</p>
<ol>
<li>Getting the droids to Luke</li>
<li>Finding Obi-Wan Kenobi</li>
<li>Finding a pilot to get them to Alderaan</li>
<li>Finding the princess once they're on the Death Star</li>
<li>Getting back to the Falcon</li>
<li>Defeating the tie fighters and escaping</li>
<li>Preparing to attack the Death Star</li>
<li>The attack on the Death Star</li>
</ol>
<p>The Matrix</p>
<ol>
<li>Setting up the mystery: what is the Matrix?</li>
<li>Meeting Morpheus and leaving The Matrix</li>
<li>Learning the truth</li>
<li>Training</li>
<li>Going to see the Oracle</li>
<li>The ambush</li>
<li>Rescuing Morpheus</li>
<li>Fighting Agent Smith</li>
</ol>
<p>Thor: Ragnarok</p>
<ol>
<li>Fighting Surtur</li>
<li>Finding Odin</li>
<li>Being introduced to Sakaar</li>
<li>The arena fight</li>
<li>Finding a way to escape</li>
<li>The escape</li>
<li>Saving the Asgardians</li>
<li>Defeating Hela</li>
</ol>
<p>Broadly speaking, the two sequences in each act often follow a pattern of set-up/preparation and execution, though that's a very rough generalization.</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say Matrix's 3rd act instead begins when Neo decides to go in and rescue Morpheus. This is demonstrated by the setting of going back to the Matrix and the mental change he has undergone to believe the Oracle and take the chance at doing what no one else would try which is also the constant conflict of this final segment: directly confront Agents, even if he might die for it. This continues until he returns to the real world to kiss Trinity. The resolution is then him contacting the machines and giving them a warning about his new power and his willingness to use it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've used this as an example in class several times, so I went back to the timeline of the film that I created for a PowerPoint slide, and you are correct -- my memory of the film was clearly faulty. The midpoint occurs before going to see the Oracle, and the third act begins when Neo and Trinity go back in to rescue Morpheus; saving Morpheus is the first half of Act 3, and fighting Agent Smith is the second half.</p>
<p>Thanks for the correction! I'll fix my comment.</p></div>		</li>
