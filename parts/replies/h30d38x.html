			<div class="markdown"><p>Na, I got over that pretty quick. Most of the time maggots take it off in a few weeks if the cyotes left anything. If I had to clean it off it was usually about the consistency of Jeky from the air, and boiling it for  30 minutes on my forge cleaned it off nicely. I bleached em, and then sold them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the animal but I was getting $35-50 for K9 skulls, $30 for does, 15ish for small mamals. And bucks can get really pricy If they have good antlers.</p>
<p>Also male raccoons have a boner bone, that was something that I was offered $25 for from a weird goth chick. And there is a very healthy market for them online I guess... don't know why. I just supplied the demand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, I genuinely didn't know there was a market for animal skulls. I'm a bit baffled though; what on earth are they using them for? I have weird visions if like some sort of Satanic circle with skulls ðŸ˜…</p>
<p>Then again, I live in the Highlands of Scotland and I suppose certainly things like buck and doe skulls aren't exactly rare. I see all sorts of animal remains on my walks, I've just never thought of cleaning and selling them lol.</p>
<p>Fair play for making money on them, if someone wants to buy them then why not</p></div>		</li>
