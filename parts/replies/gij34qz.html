			<div class="markdown"><p>Same reason why scratching a mosquito bite feels so good. A mosquito bite is a constant itching sensation and pressure you put distracts that itchiting sensation and all you feel is pressure. Temporary change in pain basically and it gives a sense of relief from that constant itch but at the same time introduces another pain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe it has something to do with pain gateways in the brain. There was an episode of House that touched on it, where he had pain in his leg but made a bet that he could go a week without Vicodin. It became too much so he smashed a dumbell on his hand, relieving himself of the pain in his leg.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard that applying heat helped relieve itching on bug bites and what I used to do was take a very hot shower and in between showers use a lighter to generate heat.</p>
<p>Well I have a better heat generator now. My pocket flashlight is good for 1000 lumens (which is definitely bright enough to cause actual eye damage but also not nearly as bright as other pocket lights).</p>
<p>Anyway... put that little bastard on high and hold it over a bug bite. It heats up slowly but still within a couple seconds. Or you can use a lower output setting. Anyway if you hold that against an itchy bite until you think your skin's on fire... no itch for at least a half hour. Maybe longer. And... no noticeable damage to the skin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a recovered self-harmer, yes, but also really no. I'd say about 90% of the time I harmed, I couldn't actually feel pain from the injury, what I felt was relief, which is the endorphin/ adrenaline rush. I felt calm after, but not for long.
Its a horrible double edge sword. :-(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can only speak for myself, I wasn't conscious of any 'high' or relief. I just felt like I deserved it.<br />
Later on I started to wonder if I was a violent person, and if my self esteem was better would I have taken it out on others? (thankfully I've never hit anyone since I was ~10 years old).</p></div>		</li>
