			<div class="markdown"><p>UK Immunology/ID Dr here - Studies so far seem to suggest that it takes 28 days after the infection to be start producing detectable levels of antibodies - so called seroconversion. This time period is pretty typical. </p>
<p>No idea yet how long these last, antibodies against other Coronavirusus seem to last about 12-18 months</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I should clarify a small mistake/potential confusion on my comment above.  Antibodies injected from a donor will last about 3 to 4 weeks. As others have mentioned, if you inject antibodies(plasma) from a donor, these antibodies will help fight the organism but the host will not produce any more. For lasting immunity you either need the host to be infected or vaccinated. The antibodies produced from either will last a varying amount of time depending on the organism. Varicella seems almost life long for example but influenza/Coronavirus only last 1 to 2 years. This could of course be even shorted if the main circulating strain mutates making the previous antibodies useless (which exactly the problem with the seasonal flu vaccine).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>28 days? Is this correct? Surely atleast IgM should be detectable in most cases in around 8-14 days, some patients(20% or so) even before that, right? Even IgG starts to be detectable in just few weeks after start of symptoms?</p>
<p>Edit: ..or is it 28 days because of long incubation period before symptoms?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically yes! </p>
<p>So we take a thing called a titer. It’s a measure of how much antibody is present in your blood. It’s a blood test. (You May have heard on the news talk of developing a “serology” test or an “antibody” test or a titer) </p>
<p>We obviously don’t know for sure how high of a titer is ideal for production of an IG for COVID 19, but in general there is a target concentration. </p>
<p>We do the same for tetanus, hep b, rabies, etc... and for each antigen, the goal concentration is different. I think it’s going to take some trial and error. </p>
<p>The good news is that there’s no such thing as TOO MUCH antibody!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially the antibodies are like little guys running around with a big “I’m with stupid” sign and they latch on to anything they recognize as stupid. That encourages the fighting cells to come and beat up the stupids. </p>
<p>Eventually the recipient of the transfusion is able to develop their own “I’m with stupid” guys who can identify this particular virus and they can handle themselves. </p>
<p>The idea isn’t to cure the patient but to give them enough of an edge —and enough time— that they can develop their own antibodies for this virus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. I work in the plasma industry for the company that is doing this with COVID-19. We also did it with Ebola, and we have several other disease associated programs. Finally, we have several immunization programs that essentially work the same way. (Tetanus, rabies, hep B)</p>
<p>The antibodies given to a patient stay in the body for a while fighting off the antigen, but do not trigger the body to make more of their own antibodies. </p>
<p>This is why people with other immune deficiencies (think SCID or similar) rely on plasma-derived immune globulins for their entire life. The IVIG is essentially a mixture of a bunch of different antibodies to a million things - common colds, etc. They protect someone for a while, but not forever. People with immune deficiencies receive plasma treatments on a regular recurring basis to keep a sort of “baseline” of antibodies to help protect from all the random pathogens they come into contact with on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Edit: a word and also this note: </p>
<p>SCID is severe combined immune deficiency </p>
<p>IVIG is intravenous inmune globulin. (Sometimes written as one word- immuneglobulin)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you mean as a preventative measure? Because PPE and hygenic practices will do much better at preventative measures then plasma will.
If you mean to give them a whole bunch of plasma to use to help treat people, then that's in the works! I'm a phlebotomist at a plasma center and we just released new protocol to process donors who have recovered from COVID-19. Kind of exciting!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm. I would think it would for a short time. With two caveats: </p>
<p>1) we don’t know the level of antibody needed to be protective for COVID yet. So a pool of normal source plasma may not be enough. </p>
<p>2) we don’t know how long the average joe is protected. It may not be long which means the donor pool wouldn’t be immune (generally speaking) after some time. </p>
<p>That’s all my opinion of course. I think we’ll have to see and learn more about the disease once were able to really watch and study recovered patients.</p></div>		</li>
