			<div class="markdown"><p>I came to the comments to say this: I'm surprised you're the only one I've seen mention this since I was always perplexed until I learned this. It works the opposite way as well. When the float hits the bottom of the tank, it'll read empty even when there's another gallon more or less in the tank. It just isn't enough to float.</p>
<p>EDIT: Caveat--this is contingent on which type of sensor your car uses. If it reads empty, treat it as empty just in case your car has a sensor that reads all the way to empty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And probably psychological / marketing. Right after you fill up, while it's fresh in your mind, your car looks like it gets kickass mileage.</p>
<p>Probably not the real reason but definitely doesn't hurt or else they'd have designed it out by now.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I always assumed it was because car makers knew there average driver was an idiot and wouldn't get gas until it was too late, so they built in a cushion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're probably right. I feel like it was initially a limitation of the technology that had the extra benefit. Probably why manufacturers never bothered fixing it when they realized it helped people not get stranded. I wouldn't be surprised if newer cars with non-mechanical sensors still add a fudge factor to give people a grace period on 'empty.'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is like pyramid scheme logic. It only works if you do it first. Otherwise, while you &quot;saved a few bucks&quot; on <em>your</em> refill, so too did the person before you, so you're still paying for the same amount of fuel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the same reason, the float bottoms out before the tank is completely empty, which is why it seems like you can drive on “empty” for a while.</p></div>		</li>
