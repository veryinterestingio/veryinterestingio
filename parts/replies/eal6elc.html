<blockquote>
<p>The VAB is so large, in fact, that it has its own weather. On humid days, rain clouds can form below the ceiling, requiring about 10,000 tons of air conditioning equipment to control the moisture. With this setup, the total volume of air in the building can be replaced in only one hour.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So when clouds start to form inside, they crank up the AC to absorb the moisture so it doesn't rain. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cooling is actually measured in terms of tons. Or btu. Or kw.</p>
<p>So ten thousand tons isn't that much, about 35megawatts. For comparison, the new data center I'm going to work at is rated for 100megawatts of load.</p>
<p>If they're measuring the weight of the equipment, it's even less actual cooling.</p>
<p>Nitpick. Cranking up the ac doesn't absorb moisture. It would actually raise relative humidity. But the cooling coils act as a point for condensation, which can be drained away.</p></div>		</li>
