			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right, to an extent. The full picture is a bit more complex.
The bacteria have optimum salinity at which they reproduce. A bit over or under the optimum does not mean the water just leaks. It means the bacteria need to spend energy working those sweet Na pumps to bring back the optimum salinity. So it can't reproduce, because it doesn't have energy.
Another way is, Na was shown to damage the DNA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess it's possible to say that it is the result of an osmotic effect. To the best of my knowledge, bacteria can't regulate their aquaporins, so the water would naturally transition between intracellular and extracellular environments, thus changing turgor/osmolarity of the bacterium (it is often mistaught that water just diffuses through phospholipid bilayer - in reality, there are millions of aquaporins that allow water to readily pass through). However, it is also possible that salinity can intervene with different enzymes and a bunch of other things</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a situation where you are rubbing salt in your wounds, an idiom for being awful and painful, you are probably on your last resort. This is the type of thing that while it works is probably best as a last resort and don't have a better option.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Salting the wound won't promote healing, but it will discourage infection. If you found yourself in a situation where you were wounded and had no proper wound care creams or bandages available, but had salt, rubbing salt in the wound can stave off infection long enough for you to get somewhere that allows you to properly treat the wound. </p>
<p>I wouldn't counsel someone to turn to salting their wounds as anything other than an absolute last resort, however, it is valuable knowledge that could be (but hopefully, and probably will never be) useful. </p>
<p>Same kind of thing goes for ethelyne glycol poisoning - if you suspect someone has been given, or has purposefully or accidentally drank ethylene glycol (found in most antifreeze) it can be useful to know that absent the availability of any other medical care, such as a hospital (which is where you should take them immediately if at all possible) ethanol can be administered as an antidote to ethylene glycol. There are far better antidotes available today and proper supportive care and medical monitoring is obviously highly important, but if you were ever in a situation where someone was drinking antifreeze and you could not get them to the hospital but you had drinking alcohol (absolutely not denatured alcohol!) You could get them very drunk to treat the antifreeze poisoning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really.  But good old drying (dehydrating) has the same effect, and works by much the same mechanism.  The water percentage isn't what is most important, what matters is a characteristic called &quot;water activity&quot;.  Salt decreases water activity, as does drying foods.  Adding another food to rice wouldn't necessarily be very effective, especially if the food is very most and the particle size is large.  Water activity is essentially a measure of how free moving the water is on a molecular level - how much energy it takes to use it in a physical or chemical process.  The value ranges from 0 (no water) to 1 (pure water) and is equal to the relative humidity the food would create is the air space of a closed container if left to equilibrate (75% RH in a jar with food with a water activity of 0.75).  This is all a bit beyond an explain it like I'm 5 answer though.</p></div>		</li>
