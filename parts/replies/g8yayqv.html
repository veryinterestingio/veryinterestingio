			<div class="markdown"><p>There is even a change in how blood flow when you are born.</p>
<p>There is a hole that lets blood flow between the left-right part of the heart before birth so all of it does not need to go through the lungs. It is closed by a shunt after birth. It is called the ductus arteriosus  and connect the aorta and pulmonary artery</p>
<p>The flow around the liver is also a bit different as it is there oxygenated blood from the placenta Wenger the body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He most likely had a different type of hole that didn't seal, a patent foramen ovale or PFO. Apparently, around 25% of the population has this hole not fully sealed, and most people will never know that they have it, because it rarely causes any problems. But, it's <del>known</del> (edit: suspected, and still being researched) to cause exactly the problem you described if a member of that 25% happens to be a scuba diver.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Babies also practice breathing. If you have a high risk pregnancy they check that weekly. </p>
<p>Also, the ductus arteriosus is what keeps babies with hypoplastic left heart syndrome alive until surgery. They have a special medicine that keeps it from closing up. And, that hole between the left and right atrium gets made permanent. It’s terrible to have a child go through this, but it’s also near the way body works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can mean a few things. My son has what you could call three holes in his heart. One is a PFO, what's described here. The other two are ASDs, just two little perforations in his atrial septum. The former being a hole that was meant to exist (but failed to close), the latter being a defect. Ventricular septal defects are another possible &quot;hole in the heart&quot;. </p>
<p>He's 7 now and you'd never know it if you weren't actively staring at his cardiology records.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, shoot. Yeah, good question.</p>
<p>Edit: Looking at diagrams, it looks like they're different but they have the same effect. The hole is just in a different spot, basically, and the &quot;hole in the heart&quot; one looks like the hole shouldn't even be there.</p></div>		</li>

Years later, in his early 30s, his older brother was dying of cancer. He went to visit him one last time and after he left, he was so sad and stressed that he passed out and died.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When they break the surface of the water in the tub the same thing happens. The reason the baths &quot;work&quot; is because it simulates a continuation of the womb and is supposed to be less stressful on the baby as they make the transition. I for one would not want to be swimming around half naked with all the things that come out of you during birth, but people live their best lives I guess...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Home birth midwife here (certified nurse midwife). Babies won't breath because of the hydrostatic pressure (water pressure) against their face. They have baroreceptors (pressure sensors) on their cheeks. </p>
<p>Blow on a newborns face, activates those receptors and they reflexively will breath hold for a second. </p>
<p>Taking baby out of the water, you gotta bring them up, facing the water so it runs down and away from their faces so they do not breathe in the water as they will take their first breath as they come out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a few moments, it's fine.  The umbilical cord keeps working until the baby is fully delivered.  I had a friend who had a water birth and they delivered the head, took a short break (like a minute) from pushing, then delivered the shoulders and body.  Babies don't take their first breath until out of the water and in the air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My baby decided she was okay with being born and didn’t cry so they had to take her from me and deep suction her lungs (she had meconium too). When they suctioned her there was one single wail and then she was back being quiet again. She’s 6.5 weeks now and still doesn’t cry a real cry that often. She mostly just fusses when something is wrong.</p></div>		</li>
