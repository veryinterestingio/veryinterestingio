			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, impressive answer! I haven't heard about hallucinogens reducing the time window for visual comprehension. It definitely makes sense and I'd love to read more about it. Do you have any sources? Google isn't being too forthcoming.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Research with hallucinogenics is scanty, and a lot of the good ones are relatively recent / ongoing, and focused mainly on its utility on treating psychiatric illness (depression, anxiety, etc). So that part of the comment is really more of conjecture, but really good conjecture IMO and consistent with my lived experience. Hallucinogens probably also affect how the mental representation is stitched together and how the &quot;gap filling&quot; of this mental image (your brains fills in a lot of details your eyes &quot;overlook&quot;) is done.</p>
<p>The part about the physical specifications and behavior of eye movement / tracking is well researched. Im just not sure how accurate the 8k resolution for the macula is, but it seems pretty reasonable as well.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A human eye is about 120 pixels per degree, 80-90 degrees is optimal for a cinema screen, so you're looking at between 9 and 10k pixels across. I used 8k because we'll probably never need 16k, manufacturers will focus on dynamic range and refresh rate in the next wave of screen enhancements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes sense why I get so tired driving. My eyes are darting around so much because of what's in front of my I generally try to constantly paint a 360 degree canvas around myself. It gets a lot easier when I drive the same path often so I have the landscape saved in memory, but days with heavy traffic especially in new areas are the worst.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should definitely point out that the psychology and philosophy of perception remain highly contested fields and that different schools and traditions will interpret the empirical data we have differently. Many people working in embodied cognition, functional contextual psychology, and pragmatist philosophy — to name a few — would take issue with your very cognitivist description of visual perception as perceiving a “model”. </p>
<p>I’m not saying your wrong, but it feels dishonest to present your opinion on something highly controversial with no indication that the issue is contested, it misleads people into thinking what you said just <em>is</em> the consensus view.</p></div>		</li>
