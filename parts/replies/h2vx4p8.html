			<div class="markdown"><p>This was my thought process, after a certain amount of mass, the gravity would be strong enough to retain all of the gaseous elements. Now, I'm assuming this is in the context of normal planetary formation and not just a super-advanced race pouring matter into a ball until it does cool stuff.</p>
<p>In regular planetary formation, your answer seems the most realistic since after that mass it would just end up a gas giant.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What kinds of elements would be the coolest to throw together in a planet? I’m thinking pure plutonium or something, but that seems too basic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer, thanks.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: after it 'becomes' a gas giant, how much more mass do you have to 'add' before you would expect it to become a star (IE, heat and pressure start to support fusion)?</p>
<p>In other words, if:</p>
<p>Earth --&gt; Gas Giant-sub-Earth = 5-to-10(Earth)</p>
<p>Then:</p>
<p>Gas Giant-sub-Earth --&gt; Star-sub-Earth = x1-to-x2(Earth)</p>
<p>(sorry, IDK how to do sub-script on mobile  XD )</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At around 11-16 Jupiter masses (3500-5000 Earth masses) you get Deuterium fusion and thus a brown dwarf (nicknamed “failed stars”). At ~70 Jupiter masses you can start fusing Hydrogen and you have a star.
But these values only make sense with “classical” stars, aka no rocky core, all Hydrogen and Helium.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fascinating!</p>
<p>So is it fair to say that between 3,500 and 22,000 Earth-masses the possibility of anything that can be considered a &quot;terrestrial&quot; &quot;planet&quot; disappears?</p>
<p>Would that be roughly the same mass range if (somehow, despite what we know about planet formation) the planet's mass was all rocky core and very little thick atmosphere?  Or is the calculation completely different?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The smallest possible mass for a star to be able to sustain hydrogen fusion is thought to be around 7% to 8% the mass of the sun – about 1.5x10^(29)kg, or about 25,000 times the mass of the Earth, or about 79 times the mass of Jupiter.</p>
<p>I glossed over this in my previous post (in fact assumed this wasn't the case for the sake of simplicity and because you can fudge the numbers more easily for smaller planets) but as bodies get more massive their density increases due to the action of their own gravity, and the sizes don't scale linearly in the way you'd expect them to, especially for stars. The smallest known star today is a red dwarf with the catchy name of OGLE-TR-122B and it s diameter was measured to be only 20% larger than Jupiter's – which also means it would fit comfortably within the diameter of Saturn's rings.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Assuming it is similar to Earth in every other regard – similar temperature, atmospheric composition, surface water etc – probably. A planet with 10 times Earth's mass and 2.2 times Earth's diameter would have around twice Earth's gravity.</p></div>		</li>
