<p>There is not enough ice available to initiate such a strong negative feedback mechanism today.</p>

<p>Mechanisms of AMOC shutdown are infamously poorly understood and there is no good evidence that this is likely to occur, at least not imminently. However, I do not think it's accurate to say that the science indicates that a lack of ice is necessarily the cause. The most recent GCMs have demonstrated significant AMOC sensitivity to freshwater fluxes which are physically entirely possible (<a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018GL078104" target="_blank">Jackson &amp; Wood, 2018</a>) and indeed, there is extensive literature tying freshwater fluxes from the GIS to overturning strength (e.g. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms10525" target="_blank">Yang <em>et al.,</em> 2016</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms6752" target="_blank">Boulton <em>et al.,</em> 2014</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0007-4" target="_blank">Thornalley <em>et al.,</em> 2018</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All that said, the 5C temperature drop you cite comes from ice core 18O measurements - so Greenland and antarctica. we know that the poles warm and cool much faster than the global average (today the arctic has already warmed by 2-3C since preindustrial compared to the global average of ~1C). this means global temperature change during the YD was also more like 2-3 degrees, not 5.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is completely correct and it's something that I think is worth reiterating. On top of that, palaeoclimatic reconstructions strongly suggest that although there were global teleconnections, the most significant climate change was concentrated in the North Atlantic region. It was a much more regional event than the global environmental change occurring today.</p></div>		</li>

<p>While the wikipedia article gives a good background on the YD event, i think it fails to describe all of the effects and observations in the context of the background warming occuring during the overall deglaciation. </p>

<p>Could you maybe consider adding this to the wikipedia article? I would, but I don't think I have the expertise to ensure that my edit would be correct.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Honestly, Finishing my PhD thesis before my stipend runs out is kinda Priority No 1 for me at the moment.  Maybe after then...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, while it may be unlikely for NADW to shut down from modern ice melt, there is a lot of evidence that indicates it is slowing down (see papers authored/coauthored by Rahmstorf), which is also cause for concern since this process controls other important weather and climate phenomena (warmer waters along the Gulf Stream leading to more frequent intense hurricanes in the US, for example).</p></div>		</li>
