			<div class="markdown"><p>Different molecules have different modes of vibration when struck by electromagnetic radiation from the sun, much like a guitar chord will resonate at a different frequency if you change its length or composition.</p>
<p>When the molecules oscillate they emit radiation too, and we measure this. Carbon dioxide is a particularly strong absorber of infrared radiation, for instance.</p>
<p>Using these properties and some really clever engineering we can image gases, not just on earth, but in the atmospheres of distant planets too, by looking carefully at the EM radiation they emit when illuminated by the sun or star they're nearest to.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In fact, this is exactly why carbon dioxide is a very efficient greenhouse gas. It has modes of oscillating (asymmetric stretching and bending) with frequencies that are right in the mid-infrared spectrum, coincidentally lining up with the color of infrared light that Earth emits most strongly out to space in an effort to cool itself off.</p>
<p>Symmetric diatomic molecules such as N<em><em>2</em></em>, O<em><em>2</em></em>, or H<em><em>2</em></em> only have only one mode of oscillation (symmetric stretching) that does not produce a dipole moment, meaning they're not greenhouse gases, but also notoriously difficult to detect spectroscopically.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Unless you're talking about other solar system planets, we're still mostly arguing over whether or not they are hazy (<a href="https://astrobites.org/2018/03/20/hazy-experiments-exoplanet/" target="_blank">example</a>). And we definitely can't study them in emission--instead we look at how the spectrum of their star changes when they transit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This might be a dumb question, but how do you know that you're getting one specific gas and not just a mix of other stuff that has the same properties? Does every element have a unique signature? </p>
<p>Also, how can you look at a specific area without picking up other gas (or solid ground for that matter) sitting behind it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back in the 70's my company made these and put them on rockets.  They would launch the rockets into the atmosphere with the device recording all the way up to get an idea of levels all the way up through the atmosphere.</p>
<p>There are also devices called mass spectrometers.  They charge up atoms or molecules and then accelerate them through a magnetic field.  Depending on the mass of the atom/molecule they will fly differently.  You can then set up a detector on the other side to measure how many of each weight hit the other end.  You can also detect carbon dioxide using this method.  It's a little harder to do as the level changes throughout the atmosphere and in order to measure them you would have to send planes flying at different heights all over the world.</p>
<p>It's much easier to have a satellite measure it using reflection/refraction/absorption of light from the sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the wavelength and space/cost concerns. A dispersive grating or prism based spectrometer allows you to measure the entire spectral range simultaneously, while an interferometric spectrometer takes time to scan across the spectrum but can often give higher resolution. A grating spectrometer also requires a detector array instead of a single detector, which can increase cost considerably especially in the mid and far infrared. In the near infrared &lt;2 microns it isn't that much of an issue and many spectrometers use a grating and a silicon or InGaAs detector array. Most gases have strong absorption bands in the 2-20 micron wavelength region, so detection can often be more complicated and requires things like cooled InSb or HgCdTe detectors.</p></div>		</li>
