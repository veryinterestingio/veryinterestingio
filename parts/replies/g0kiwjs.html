			<div class="markdown"><p>It could be that you have installed a 32 bit version of Windows on a 64 bit capable PC. Early on that was quite common, as a lot of software didn't yet work on the 64 bit versions, and many hardware suppliers didn't have drivers for that system. That's been mostly fixed now. If you can tell me what the processor is called (you can probably find it in your system properties, or download a little tool called CPUID) I could tell you if the CPU is 64 bit capable. But if your system came preinstalled with a 32 bit operating system - it's probably at least 10 years old. Most of the time though older systems can be given a second lease on life with a bit of extra RAM and possibly a better hard drive (putting in an SSD can really make a difference). For home office and light gaming use, that will make a decade old system perform reasonably.<br />
For most applications though, there's not a big difference between 32 and 64 bit processing as far as speed is concerned.</p></div>		</li>
