			<div class="markdown"><p>I usually go for the Avalon full fat organic cream if I can find it with about CAD$5-10 worth of premium butter. Oooooh man.</p>
<p>I also am a prissy fuck and use a lava rock mortar and pestle to work down coarse kosher and sea salt to fine grain and use that for everything in a little salt pig. It's great.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep - I've started buying literally the most expensive butter I can find and the difference is incredible. I'm also slowly getting my wife comfortable with &quot;no no, a little more. No cows died for this, you don't have to be stingy.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

You just need a bowl, 4 fingers and about 10 minutes  to make enough for a few rounds of toast.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I made two currys once, one was a recipe from a bloody decent chef the other I just poured a jar and added some sugar and a bit more spices to mask the extra sugar. Every one but me preferred the sugared one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How much of it is olfactory satiation, I wonder? This is to do with the phenomenon of &quot;it tastes better the next day&quot; - the idea being that if you've spent an hour+ labouring over a dish in the kitchen, your sense of smell becomes somewhat dulled to that particular dishes profile which lessens your taste of it as well when it comes time to eat.</p>
<p>Giving your palate time to &quot;reset&quot; so-to-speak can enhance the flavour of a dish (even more reason to let that poor steak rest after searing it before you dig in!) by allowing your olfactory to acclimate to a more &quot;neutral&quot; profile.</p>
<p>As an addendum to this - a little dash of Fish Sauce and Maggi/MSG can really bring out something special in a dish I find.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never thought of olfactory satiation being a thing, but it makes sense. I've worked in a few restaurants and at each one, all the menu items eventually started to smell the &quot;same&quot; to me and mostly lost their appeal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aye - at some point all you smell is &quot;the kitchen&quot; - doesn't matter what's being made unless it's the kind of place that does rotational menus or something. Interesting!</p></div>		</li>
