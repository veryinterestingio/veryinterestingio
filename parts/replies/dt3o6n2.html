			<div class="markdown"><p>I think one point you passed over is that a lot of time at a young age people are taught that sex or masturbation is naughty, so you grow up attaching that context to it. Maybe it's a way to express rebellion. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Until 1975, &quot;the heat of the moment&quot; was a legal excuse for killing someone in France (under very specific circumstances, a husband had to find his wife with a lover in flagrante delicto and kill one or other of them on the spot). The murders weren't forgiven, just punished by a lighter sentence. A few other Mediterranean countries had similar laws up until the 80s. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is still true most places, including New York where I live:</p>
<p>&quot;Manslaughter is a form of homicide -- conduct which causes the death of a person -- committed when a defendant recklessly causes death or, with an intent to cause serious physical injury, causes death. For example, someone arrested for drunk driving after causing an accident in which a passenger or another motorist is killed would also likely be charged with involuntary manslaughter. But <strong>where there was no initial (or premeditated) intent to kill someone, such as so-called &quot;heat of the moment&quot; crimes, such a homicide may be charged as voluntary manslaughter.</strong>&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find this interesting.</p>
<p>You say telling ourselves we would never and the following regret is a defense mechanism but for what?</p>
<p>I grew up in a relatively prude catholic household so it was a bit of a thing for me to change this personal identity and understanding of sex. Humans are sexual beings and as a human so am I. There's still this small part of me that I don't even really identify with anymore that feels disappointed in me for being sexual. </p>
<p>I could understand trying to protect this world view and self identity our surroundings cultivated during our childhood. It's part of our fundamental understandings of the world, but just like the rest of them, they get challenged as we get older and the cracks show. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not a sociologist or anything, this is just my understanding. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance" target="_blank">Cognitive Dissonance</a> is something that happens when a person holds two or more contradicting beliefs. Our brains don't like cognitive dissonance. A huge part of what the human brain does is pattern recognition so that we can form habits that allow us to best respond to those patterns. They do everything that they can to make our interpretation of the world as consistent and seamless as possible, so when that breaks down we get some seriously negative feelings. When we do things we consider shameful or disgusting or whatever else it's tough to look at ourselves in the mirror (cognitive dissonance). The sense of shamefulness can be and often is completely irrational because we know that there's nothing inherently wrong with what we do (in bed/while masturbating/whatever), it's just how we get our rocks off, but we've been taught by society that it's not how we're <em>supposed</em> to get our rocks off. The thing is, everyone has fetishes and they're all highly, highly personal so beyond &quot;stimulating your genitals&quot; there <em>can't</em> be any way that you're &quot;supposed&quot; to do it. </p>
<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/28w95c/my_girlfriend_wants_a_speghetti_bath_is_that_safe/cif9gxc/?context=3" target="_blank">Exhibit A</a> right here (seriously, read this story it's fascinating). The amount of detail that this guy went into has me convinced that this wasn't bullshit, meaning there are actually people who get off on being fucked in a spaghetti bath. Society would tell you this is weird and disgusting and (insert derogatory term here), but if you look for an actual, objective answer to what is &quot;wrong&quot; with wanting to be fucked in a spaghetti bath you're not going to come up with anything. The risk of infection from getting it inside your gooey bits <em>could</em> be posited as an answer, but let's be honest nobody read /u/forseti1590's  question or /u/C1V's answer and thought &quot;This is gross because of the risk of infection but if they took care of that somehow it'd be totally fine.&quot; We think it's gross because we've been taught that it's gross, which is an inherently fallacious line of logic but it's good enough for us we'd rather not think about it in the first place (same thing as why being gay used to be viewed as inherently bad for no particular reason and why being trans is viewed as that today). If you're cool with your fetishes then they don't cause any cognitive dissonance. If you're not cool with your fetishes then you'll act on them when you feel less disgusted (dissonant) by them (when you're horny) but <em>afterwards</em> you get that post-nut shame. A significant enough level of cognitive dissonance can stay with you way after that initial shame because it's based on how you view who you are as a person and you can end up carrying it around with you everywhere you go as this low-level stress because you feel there's something &quot;wrong&quot; with you.</p>
<p>Basically, we tell ourselves we would never do something like that to align how we act with how society tells us to act so that we can walk with our head held high all the time. We tell others that we would never do something like that to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue_signalling" target="_blank">virtue signal</a> which makes you better liked by groups who share those virtues. It's all about not feeling shitty around others and in your own head.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a big reason why society says &quot;this fetish is disgusting&quot; is because it's not their fetish. Common fetishes like spanking or leather bondage are hardly considered offensive or disgusting. Maybe vaguely taboo but not really in today's culture. Hollywood has been making tons of money with their movies that explore the subject, proving it's common if not popular.</p>
<p>But having sex in a bed of spaghetti? Definitely a rarer fetish. And if it doesn't get you off it grosses you out because what other reaction is there to have? Acceptance? Even though people lick whipped cream off their lovers all the time, somehow a spaghetti bed is just too foreign. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You were given a very screwed up view of sexuality by abnormal men and women.I grew up Roman Catholic too. I went to 12 years of Catholic school. I have yet to find a nun or priest that I would consider normal. People who willingly take vows of Chastity, Poverty and Obedience have something wrong with them. Trust me. I have been there thousands of times. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That frustrates me too because denying such a normal and healthy part of human existence isn't good. It's like denying yourself the sun. Sure some people are allergic to the sun and some people are asexual. Nut the majority of people need some amount of sun somewhat regularly to feel healthy.</p>
<p>Its so self prescribed too. I don't believe Jesus ever preached that men and women who truly believed should never have sex. That to prove your love to him you must remain abstinent. It's bullshit. And it's frustrating. </p></div>		</li>
