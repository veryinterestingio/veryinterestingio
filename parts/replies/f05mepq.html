			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been curious about that.  I'd swear there's a difference between what I can see on a standard eye chart and what I can see on a mirrored eye chart.</p>
<p>Are they truly <strong>exactly</strong> the same?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it's not <em>exactly</em> the same.  </p>
<p>To make a mirror they spray silver or aluminum onto the <em>back</em> of a sheet of glass. Air and glass have a different refractive index, and whenever you have a refractive index mismatch, you get some reflection at the interface. For a slab of glass, if you shine a laser beam directly at it, then roughly 4% of the light will be reflected at the first interface and 4% at the second one, resulting in the reflection of 8% of light and the transmission of 92% of light. If you then go to increasingly shallower angles, more and more light will be reflected, and with a multiple-mirror setup, the line of sight is definitely going to be angled, or else you would end up just looking back at yourself. </p>
<p>The divergence is very, very slightly different at each reflection, so each one produces a slightly doubled/offset image when it recombines with what gets reflected back from the silver. This happens twice at each mirror: once at the air/glass interface as light travels into the glass, and again at that same interface after it returns from the silvered layer. The effect is cumulative, so as it enters and exits the next mirror, not only does it double the original chart twice, it also re-doubles each of the reflections from the previous mirror(s), each with very slightly compounded divergence.  </p>
<p>In addition, no glass is perfectly clear or pure, no layer of silver is a perfect reflector, and no mirror outside of a clean room is going to have a perfectly clean surface, and a small amount of light is lost to each of these imperfections. Just imagine looking through three layers of glass, it won't be as clear as without them in the way. In fact, because of the reflection sending light through each pane twice, three mirrors (like u/x31b saw) are almost like looking through <em>six</em> panes of glass.  </p>
<p>It's not the same as an unobstructed view.</p></div>		</li>
