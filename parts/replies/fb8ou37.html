<p>Arthropods display a wide range of nervous competency, just like vertebrates, with eusocial Hymenopterans and jumping spiders being the pinnacles of arthropod intelligence. As a few notable examples:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/news/bees-learn-football-from-their-buddies-1.21540" target="_blank">Bumblebees can learn and improve upon new skills</a> that wouldn’t be used in the wild by watching humans or other bumblebees.</p>
<p>Honeybees can learn to count to 4, and, more impressively, even <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05354-z" target="_blank">understand the concept of 0 as a numerical integer</a>, which otherwise is something only humans and dolphins are known to be capable of.</p>
<p>Spartaeine spiders, which prefer to target other spiders, approach prey in complicated detours; they display an understanding of object permanence, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4751061/" target="_blank">the ability to plan in advance</a> and memorize attack routes. </p>
<p>Intelligence is a spectrum; some arthropods are more intelligent than others, just like how dolphins are more intelligent than koalas, and the most intelligent arthropods are absolutely not reducible to “reaction machines”.</p></div>		</li>
