			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd love to pick your ...brain. (Sorry, had to!)
I had a tumor removed 2 years ago, seizures since. Lately, I often can recall memories so far back, and so clearly. What area are long term memories stored? I was recently describing an incident, my mom said I was too young to remember. Both parents were looking at me weird and agreed that I was under 2, and proceeded to fill in a few gaps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Long term memories are initially stored in the hippocampus. However, after time it seems that they shift to being stored in the anterior cingulate cortex or possibly called the neocortex (although that seems to be more for general knowledge than episodic memories). There are a couple possibilities off the top of my head :) that could be causing you to have such clear memories: </p>
<p>1) the tumor was removed close to one of those parts of the brain and as your brain is adjusting and making neural connections, it’s sparking those old memories again
2) if the memory recall is more involuntary, it’s possible you’re having seizures localized to that area of the brain. Seizures don’t have to make you lose consciousness or shake, and in fact it’s very common to have an “altered awareness” seizure where you have a feeling of deja vu, an intense recall of a very old memory, or an emotional reaction to a memory</p>
<p>There are plenty of other explanations (many of them harmless!) but it’s definitely worth bringing up to your doctor. I assume you’re already on seizure medication, but if they are seizures the doctor might want to adjust your meds depending on how frequently this is happening. And if it’s just weird restructuring of the neurons, you’ll have peace of mind, and explanation, and (probably) a fascinated doctor!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! Yes, 2 meds as of now. I've had a few tonic clonics (new term for grand mal) but the rest are the other things you mentioned and happening enough that I'm followed closely by my Neuro. </p>
<p>I never try to remember, a memory just pops up and BOOM! I'm stuck on it. </p>
<p>It's all terrifyingly fascinating, tbh.</p>
<p>Edit- tumor was ping pong ball size, temporal lobe? Right side, behind ear\eye. EEG shows two distinct areas of epileptic activity, one R side, one L side.</p></div>		</li>
