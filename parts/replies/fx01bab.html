			<div class="markdown"><p>He uses coefficient of friction to calculate the whole bike coasting thing... but the bike isn’t really sliding along, it’s rolling. Does that make any difference in these calculations?</p>
<p>Like I could put a cup of water on a glass surface, and lift up one edge of the glass surface to a point where the cup starts sliding.</p>
<p>I could also put the cup of water on a section of pavement i mysteriously procured from the street outside my house... I feel like I could tilt that slab of pavement up quite a bit higher than the glass surface before the cup would slide. In fact the cup of water might not even slide down the slope, it might just tip over from it’s rather vertical weight distribution.</p>
<p>Wonder how that comes into play when thinking about a bike which is more “rolling” and less “sliding”.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If that speed is below a certain level (maybe 2mph) then you won’t be able to balance your bike and will find cycling very hard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't think this can be the answer. If the problem were that you need a minimum speed to remain upright on a bike, you could solve that by riding a tricycle. But riding a tricycle uphill is difficult relative to walking in just the same way as riding a bike. The same is also true of, say, rollerblades. It's easy to go slowly or even stand still in rollerblades, but it's extremely difficult to rollerblade uphill.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the issue is with momentum. When cycling (or rollerblading) you don't have a continuous power output, you rely on forward momentum to bridge the gap between pedal strokes. But when you're going uphill that momentum pretty much disappears, you've got to accelerate again with every pedal stroke, requiring a lot more force than just maintaining your speed. Even worse on rollerblades as you generally spend more time coasting between power strokes.</p>
<p>You never really 'coast' while walking though, so going up hill doesn't make nearly as much difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this thought experiment is misleading as tricycles tend to be heavy. Imagine a 7kg tricycle with a gear ratio fit for climbing hills, would that be more difficult to ride up a hill than walking up? Probably, but not by a wide margin.</p>
<p>Legs are just very efficient at climbing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has more to do with how the bike is geared. When a slope gets steep the force you need to push the pedals with get higher and when you try to exert that force you end up lifting your body up. This puts your body in a super awkward position where your muscles are stressed in unfomfortable ways. This is why it gets easier when you stand up on your bike so you can push on the pedal with your legs straight.</p>
<p>If you have a bike that is geared for it, it's not actually all that exerting to ride up a slope at walking speed, if you can maintain balance at that speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but even with any sort of mechanism that prevents the bike from rolling backwards, aren't you still 'pushing' against more weight than you normally would be 'pushing' against on a flat surface?</p>
<p>Ie, if I try to roll a ball on the ground it's easy, but if I try to roll it up hill its hard. Even if you somehow prevent the ball from rolling backwards and flattening my fat ass, I still would require a LOT more energy to roll that thing uphill.</p>
<p>This obviously removes the balancing a bike thing out of the equation, but my <em>intuition</em> says this <em>feels</em> right (obviously intuition can be misleading).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This idea was super helpful. I am now imagining the bike more as like a pulley system, you rotate the pedals to move a distance and there is no momentum aiding you. The energy you put into it is independent from the potential to roll backwards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also to add, when up a slope, due to the pedaling, although on average the bike and person goes forwards, in reality the person would go forwards and then backwards due to how the pedals function. Not sure how much this contributes to making it hard to pedal uphill but it probably knocks off quite some efficiency in the system</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. This is actually the real answer as it is the most significant effect. Basically, when walking you are aided by friction keeping you from sliding back. On a bike you are not (its very low).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only aid that friction provides is to keep you from sliding back when you are not moving. Could be your shoes, or the brakes on the bike.  </p>
<p>Friction does not help you to move forward and the lack of friction does not introduce a rearward force impeding your progress.</p>
<p>Think of it this way, if you are on a hill in a car and you put the car into neutral it will roll backwards. Hit the brakes to make it stay put. Do you think that the car would go uphill more easily when in gear if you also had the brakes on? </p>
<p>Of course not, you want the least amount of rolling resistance possible. When power is removed is when you want lots of friction (if you want to stay still), not when in motion.</p></div>		</li>
