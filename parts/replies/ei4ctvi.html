			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s different. Early ethnographers studying the use of space by the Bedouin tribes of Arabia recorded tent designs that left some sides open. Despite the strong cultural prohibition against men seeing uncovered unrelated females one writer recorded an experience where men of the tribe came upon an open side of the tent she was in and she was uncovered, they simply ignored her presence and never mentioned the infraction against the social code. They in essence pretended that a wall was there the whole time. </p>
<p>Because dwellings are so culturally specific it’s hard to pin down any specific instinctive behavior. Most of it seems culturally driven. Uncontacted groups of humans still have dwellings but they are dramatically different from what we expect from a home.  Most commonalities among different culture’s structures might just be due to coming to the same conclusion about the most efficient way to solve a problem.  The elements faced by humans are similar all over the globe. It makes sense that most of us figured out that putting a roof between us and the sun and rain was a good idea.  Other species also seek shelter and some can build their own just like us. It’s hard to draw the line between instinct and culturally distributed knowledge. </p>
<p>Testing this would be difficult. It’s not really possible to raise a human in isolation and watch what it does. Our young are defenseless for so long that we really only exist as communities. We need many individuals to successfully raise children. Adults carry cultural information already and would pass it on to children. A single queen can start an ant colony. Every ant raised there might never come into contact an individual outside the colony and it wouldn’t make much difference in their behavior. Their queen doesn’t instruct them on how to find food and build their nest. They already know </p></div>		</li>
