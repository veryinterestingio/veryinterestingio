			<div class="markdown"><p>I found out a few years ago my dad only invites me to go to the beach with him on days the wind is blowing from the direction of the dunes (aka when the bugs are on the beach). He knows he won’t get bitten if I’m around. When I realized I was always with him on buggy days even though he’s meticulous about checking wind and weather, he was only slightly ashamed to be using me as human bug repellent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's because you have more reactive antibodies to the saliva and/or mouth parts of the mozzie. You and your friends might get bitten at the same rate, but because your immune system reacts by recruiting cells and fluids of the immune reaction to the site of the bite, you get a wheal and redness and itchiness which the friends don't get (or maybe more slowly).</p></div>		</li>
