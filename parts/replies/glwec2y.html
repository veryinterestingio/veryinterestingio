			<div class="markdown"><p>It is strange to me that this neglects to consider Neuropilin-1 as an important receptor, even though evidence as far back as June of last year shows that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-020-00460-9" target="_blank">NRP1 also potentiates infection like ACE2</a>.</p>
<p>Neurons absolutely <em>are</em> vulnerable to attack, as confirmed in autopsies, but they aren't as vulnerable as the epithelial cells.</p>
<p>My guess would be that there are 2 distinct mechanisms for loss of smell:</p>
<ul>
<li>Damage from inflammation of the epithelial cells</li>
<li>Damage from direct invasion</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes the olfactory nerves get borked by a virus and they die, totally destroying the sense of smell. They can regrow (albeit slowly), at which point strange smells can be a sign of progress.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A prof mentioned that the mechanisms how new nerve-axons find their respective glomeruli isn't really understood. If they die in quantity it's quite probably faulty, which causes weird wiring -&gt; weird smells. Weirdly enough over time the nervous system seems capable of regenerating a normal sense. The brain is wild!</p>
<p>Huh, didn't know that about nrp-1.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something I've been curious about, but haven't been able to find much information on, is whether a competitive ACE inhibitor would be able to reduce the number of infected cells by occupying the receptors. </p>
<p>I'm probably just not using the right search terms, but what little I have found seems contradictory and doesn't really delve into the mechanism at play; I'm mostly just curious as to whether blocking ACE receptors with something else affects the virus's ability to infect the cells, and if so how.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not sure if this answers your question exactly, but I found it interesting! It at the very least, answers part of your question (spoiler: from what I gathered, I think the answer is no because it would keep it from infecting cells but blocking the receptor would still be harmful). The article does a great job of delving into the mechanism though!!
*edit: I’m on mobile and can’t figure out how to link the article. I’ve added a screenshot of the title instead so you can find it yourself. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/QhluaCf.jpg" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/QhluaCf.jpg</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well explained and comprehensive!
They do say blocking ACE1 (which upregulates Angiotensin II) could help prevent harmful inflammation/sever tissue damage. This article isn't exactly recent though.</p></div>		</li>
