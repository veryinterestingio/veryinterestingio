			<div class="markdown"><p>HIV is almost universally fatal without ART. </p>
<p>While VZV reactivation is not uncommon (shingles), deaths due to VZV reactivation are rare (although nonzero), even without antiviral therapy.</p>
<p>Latent VZV is also not contagious unless you have reactivation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>90% was recorded in small outbreaks where people received 0 treatment and   data collection was poor.</p>
<p>with the most recent outbreak a few years back, the biggest so far, it was closer to 50%. still plenty scary</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, even if you don't die, it's still bad internal hemorrhaging. It's why I get so irritated every time people try to say Covid isn't worth worrying about because it kills so few people... but don't take into account that it can easily put you out of work for a couple weeks and then there is the lasting damage to consider, like the folks that have trouble with stairs for months afterward.</p>
<p>It's be like telling people chill out because it only makes you lose a few fingers. Losing my fingers is not an acceptable risk my dude!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>SARS didn't spread because it was only contagious while symptomatic. So it was pretty easy to set up an effective quarantine measure for those who are sick.</p>
<p>COVID spreads even when you are asymptomatic, but then you can be dead weeks later.</p>
<p>What selection pressure would stop a virus with asymptomatic spread but a high eventual death rate?</p></div>		</li>
