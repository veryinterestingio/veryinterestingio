			<div class="markdown"><p>This is so accurate. I'm no nuclear engineer but the amount of misinformation is crazy. </p>
<p>My fiance and I were watching Chernobyl and I had to explain while the show is fantastic, it takes serious liberties with radiation. Also she had thought they worked the same as a nuclear bomb somehow because it's explained as &quot;powered by the same thing as nuclear bombs&quot; which is obviously it's own fallacy. </p>
<p>Wind and Solar are great as SUPPLEMENTAL sources of power but in 90% of the world they are far too unpredictable to provide a steady power source. Hydro is great if it weren't for the massive ecological impact and obviously risk of dam failures exists. </p>
<p>I mean every power source has some sort of pro and cons to it. Nuclear actually has a lot of positives while also generating an immense amount of power. People just can't think logically cause of how they have been conditioned to fear radiation, the word nuclear, and Chernobyl especially is so widely publicized, however with a little thought you can tear those apart, x-rays use radiation, nuclear is just a word used very broadly now, and Chernobyl was much more to do with severe incompetence and mismanagement of a dying regime than it did with the engineering of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You aren't wrong. But at the same time, you don't escape that from other power sources. Oil and natural gas are also highly dangerous and have had way more incidents. </p>
<p>I mean nuclear power probably isn't the absolute end all be all but it's certainly about the best we have right now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The biggest obstacle to increased use of nuclear power is the time to build and bring online a new nuclear plant and the related public resistance.  Nuclear is cost competitive with Wind and Solar on a levelized basis and should probably be consider as a synergistic source.  But public safety concerns and well organized opposition to nuclear - particularly since the Fukishima accident has pretty much killed the political will to advance a nuclear program. </p>
<p>I watched the Chernobyl series as well, and thought it was very well done for a docu-drama.  The Chernobyl RBMK reactor did have some serious engineering flaws, not the least of which being that it had a 'positive void coefficient' - meaning that as the coolant (water) boiled, the reactivity of the core increased.   In most other - light water,  boiling water and heavy water reactor designs, water is both the coolant and moderator, so as the coolant boils, the moderation also decreases and the reactivity of the core slows down.   The reactor design was also very unstable and difficult to control at low output levels (and indeed the operating procedures required it to be shut down if power dropped below a certain level).  Then there was the lack of a containment structure (which would have made it difficult to extract the fuel rods for weapons production) and a flaw in the control rod design that as the rods were inserted the first several feet were made of graphite not boron so it actually increased the reactivity at first.   Finally - there was a massive cover up of the faults and flaws of the design so that even if the operators had been more competent and experienced, they didn't know about the engineering flaws and (after a certain point) likely would have made the wrong decisions anyways.  </p>
<p>Western designs - be they American, British, French, German, Canadian or what have you, are much safer.   The US uses special breeder reactors for weapons production so they don't have to compromise the safety of utility reactors for weapons production.    The Canadian Candu design can be refueled while operating, but Canada doesn't produce nuclear weapons (but China and India do using similar designs), so again didn't compromise the design to exclude containment structures.   The British Advanced Gas Reactor also features a containment structure and a far more fail safe design.</p>
<p>That said, Three Mile Island and Fukushima were both US designs.   The TMI accident was caused when a relief valve failed to close, but instrumentation in the control room didn't notify operators.   Operators then made a series of mistakes - based on inadequate training and inadequate instrumentation that led to the melt down.   At Fukushima Daiichi, was more a failure to plan for site specific disasters.  The reactors shut down properly when the earthquake was detected, but the plant lost auxiliary power when the Tsunami took out both the electrical grid and the auxiliary diesel generators.  Without electrical power to operate the cooling systems, the cooling pools for spend fuel slowly boiled off.   Oxidation of the zirconium cladding in steam released hydrogen gas and a lot of heat.  This led to a series of explosions - which are generally not helpful at nuclear power plants.</p>
<p>I believe the remainder of nuclear accidents have either been at experimental or military reactors - which are a different beast all together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. And my knowledge is not nearly that advanced in nuclear reactors. </p>
<p>I knew that a lot of that was pretty accurate in Chernobyl, but the parts showing radiation were extremely imbelished. </p>
<p>Thanks for all the clarification on the other accidents!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Lobbying.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that, over the same period of time, coal has killed more people than nuclear even when you count Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just fossil fuel but some green energy sources as well. The better and cheaper nuclear power is, the less appealing inefficient solar panels that take years to produce more power than they took to manufacture are. Or giant unsightly wind generators that require a lot of upkeep and strike down birds. Basically nuclear power is by far the best green energy  but it has to fight politics and greed from all directions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your insights. How would you compare the efficiency of the most present renewable energy methods like solar, wind, hydro towards nuclear? </p>
<p>Would it be possible to take the material either used for the nuclear plants or leftovers after usage to built a „dirty bomb“ ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First, the dirty bomb question. Yes, freshly used nuclear fuel would make an excellent dirty bomb, which is why people are pretty serious about keeping it secure right after it comes out of the reactor. However, it's usefulness drops quickly, and after about 20 years it's not a super effective dirty bomb any more without huge amounts of material.</p>
<p>I would suggest that solar, wind, and hydro all have their place. Solar is a good choice for relatively small power requirements to be used at the point of generation (like lights on a street sign, sensors under a road, etc). It is a terrible choice for any grid-scale production for many reasons. Wind is similar to solar, though it produces more power than solar would and is good for building or process (like a foundry) power augmentation, and works a little better for small grids. However, because of how much power you lose to get it onto the grid (to change frequency and smooth it out), I wouldn't recommend it for large grid-scale production either.</p>
<p>Hydro is excellent for grid-scale power source that requires access to water and land. Dams require significant maintenance to avoid a catastrophic failure, but they provide smooth power that works well with a grid. I wouldn't recommend them for point-of-use like I would solar and wind.</p>
<p>Nuclear is the best grid-scale power production method by multiple measures, and can be pretty good at point-of-use (see nuclear powered subs and ships, small modular reactors, and microreactors). Nuclear can be carefully controlled and tuned. They also require regular maintenance, and the fuel is challenging to handle after it is used in the reactor. Current reactors (pressurized water reactors and boiling water reactors) use water as the coolant and to control the energy of the neutrons to improve how the reactions proceed. These types of reactors require incredible amounts of water to operate, which could be problematic with scarce resources.</p>
<p>Overall, solar and wind require orders of magnitude more raw resources (purified silicon, neodymium, rare earth metals, steel) than hydro or nuclear, especially when compared to the power they produce and when weighed against the full life cycle problems (from building it to tearing it down).</p></div>		</li>
