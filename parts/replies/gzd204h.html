			<div class="markdown"><p>Tit is literally the old English pronunciation of teat, from the German Zitze. </p>
<p>Boob is a fairly modern term for breasts. The older form was bubby. Nobody is quite sure why bubby came to mean breats, but many etomologists have suggested that it's simply because they sound alike (bubby was prossibly how a child learning their first words would pronounce it). </p>
<p>The fact that some birds have rude-sounding names is a total coincidence. They have completely separate etymologies. For instance, some birds are called tits from the old Norse tita - which means small bird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;-Tit-&quot;, as in small, is derived from Latin, which predates even the oldest forms of Norse. It's still survived in &quot;Petit&quot; in French. At whatever point germanic tit started to be used to refer to &quot;teat&quot;, it's still an adaptation</p></div>		</li>
