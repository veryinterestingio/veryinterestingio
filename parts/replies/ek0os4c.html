			<div class="markdown"><p>So does that mean that animals with eyes on the sides of their heads have a blind spot similar to ours, but immediately in front of them rather than to either side? So a horse could see you if you approached from the left or right, but if you stood right in front of it, it could walk right into you without realising you were there?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Horses have eyes on the sides of their heads which gives them close to a 360 degree field of vision. They do have a small blind spots directly in front and behind them but they can cover these by moving their head around. I have read that these blind spots are about 3 feet wide directly in front and 6 feet wide directly behind them. From my own personal experience I have no reason to doubt it.</p>
<p>They can use both eyes together, in what is called binocular vision. This gives them depth perception allowing them to judge distances. They can also move each eye independently and watch two different objects at the same time, even if one's in front and the other is behind. Being able to see in front and behind at the same time gives them the advantage of watching where they're going while keeping an eye on a predator behind at the same time. There's been many a time where I've tried to catch a horse that didn't want to be caught and watched him walking away with his head turned to the side, with one eye on me and one looking ahead. I have seen horses running at a full gallop through the woods and underbrush with their heads turned to the side to monitor my whereabouts and not miss a step.</p>
<p>If something moves suddenly into a horse's blind spots it can startle the animal causing it to shy, kick or bolt away. You can walk in front of a horse a dozen times and it will remain standing in in place, relaxed and content. But, if you raise your arm and stick it out in front of you while you are passing directly in front of the animal you can spook it and cause it to pull away. The horse knows you are there and is expecting you to show up on the other side . It can not see you lift your arm in its blind spot though, so your hand becomes an unexpected object appearing suddenly which frightens it. You could be standing directly in front of a quiet, relaxed and contented horse, and have it quickly jerk away when you reach out straight ahead to pet it. Because of its blind spot, the horse is unable to see your hand moving toward it until it magically appears out of nowhere, next to its head or eye. The horse will do what it does naturally and spook. For this reason it is always best to talk to a horse before you pet it, giving it time to move it's head and see where you're standing first.</p>
<p>We had a horse that we originally named Midnight as a colt because it was jet black with no markings. We used him as a pack horse to carry our supplies inside packboxes tied on his sides. By the time he was 5 years old his name had been changed to Sleepyhead. The horse would be moving along down a trail and walk head first into a tree, over and over again. As he was walking along he would spend more time watching the horses behind him than the trail ahead. When the trail made a jog around a tree, the tree would end up in his blind spot and he wouldn't see it in time to avoid it.</p>
<p>I have found that keeping a tight rein on a horse may cause it to trip or stumble. There are times when riding a green or rank horse you don't trust it enough to let it have a free rein. A horse can not buck unless it can lower it's head so by keeping a close rein on it I can prevent it from lowering it's head and start bucking. But by holding it's head tight and high I am also hindering it's ability to see what's in front and below it. When I first started breaking horses it took me quite a while to learn it wasn't the horses fault for stumbling, it was mine. I originally believed that the horse was deliberately doing it to annoy me or dump me. So with the erroneous belief that it would try to unseat me if I wasn't cautious I would exacerbate the problem by holding it's head in tighter. After about three months of doing this I was griping about one particular horse to my dad, who quickly told me why it was me causing the problem.</p>
<p>If you are walking behind a horse it may have one eye looking ahead and the other one looking back. If the eye looking back is toward the direction you're traveling it will appear to the animal that you have appeared out of the blue and spook it. Many people have been kicked because of this. The rule of thumb I have always followed is to talk to a horse I am behind and stay either as close to it as I can or far enough away that it can't kick me. By staying close I run the risk of getting kicked but am close enough that the foot doesn't have momentum, so it pushes me away instead of giving me a painful whallop. It is always best when walking around a horse to place a hand on its back and keep it there as you circle around. Once again this is because though the horse knows you are there it may not be expecting you to suddenly appear on its other side, causing the horse to jump, spook or kick.</p>
<p>My father's business depended on horses for transportation and we could only reach our home by horses or airplane when I was growing up. We kept a herd of 100 or so head of horses and rode them, packed them and put them in harness almost every day for seven or so months of the year. I kept and used my own string of 12 horses until about ten years ago, though I still have a few of my old favorites living a good life, pensioned off at a friend's farm.</p>
<p>Thanks for the silver kind stranger!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was crazy and really interesting to read. I had no idea about any of it. I'm thinking about horses completely differently now. Is this in the US? Have you ever been kicked by one? I saw one buck in my grandad's face once and miss by  a few inches. </p></div>		</li>
