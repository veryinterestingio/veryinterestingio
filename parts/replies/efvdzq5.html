			<div class="markdown"><p>Also depending on the school, CS, cis, bis/mis/it and business are a spectrum.</p>
<p>CS being pure computers, cis having a few business classes, bis/mis/it being more business focused and fewer cs classes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At my school CS pretty much covers the whole spectrum, and depending on electives you take as a CS major, you can end up learning the stuff that a CIS or IT major would learn at a different university, by picking a business “emphasis area”, which is basically 12 hours of business classes, and CS classes that are related to that.</p>
<p>Personally I’m going full CS, taking classes on AI, a math emphasis area (getting a math minor along the way, with 2 extra classes), and a second minor in cyber security because why wouldn’t I want to learn that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At mine they were in two completely different departments. CS in science and CIS in business.</p>
<p>However, at least at my school, CIS had a heavy programming path. Except we didn't have the math, physics, or theory stuff. We took accounting, finance, accounting, and other computer courses like OS or networking.</p>
<p>I think it's a totally viable path. Everybody I knew that took it - and stayed in programming - has never had a problem getting work. Usually working in the same positions people with CS backgrounds.</p>
<p>Used to work at a software consultancy company. We (the devs) had a wide range of degrees. From none to CS.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>CS is where you learn the math and logic of bits, code, and compilers. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Software engineering is where you learn to use bits and compilers to maintain scalable CRUD. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CIS is where you learn how to actually deal with lots of data. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Networking and security is where you learn to give the good guys access and keep the bad guys out.</p>
</li>
<li>IT is where you learn how to support the data going all over the place because no one else can keep things neat and tidy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then again not every school has 5 different disciplines that are this similar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I took CIT because I didn't wanna take 2 years of calculus.  Now I'm stuck with 4 more of these retarded business school classes that sound like they're teaching a pyramid scheme.  One semester they taught us Salesforce.com which I thought was a huge waste of time, but there is no oversight here and the professors can essentially do whatever they want.  I've got another year of the bullshit.  I'd rather take classes on programming or anything else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I took a program called IT Management in university, technically a business degree, and I've been employed as a software developer for all but two years of my 10+ year career so far... so if you want to make the jump it's definitely possible.   </p>
<p>I think it's a little easier now with the high demand for software developers and the increase in willingness to hire developers who did not come up through the traditional path of a 4 year computer science degree in certain types of development jobs (probably not going to get hired to write a high frequency trading app or self-driving car anytime soon)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that's more specific though and definitely a different curriculum, if you're in computer engineering you're working at the component level and that's going to involve more applied science than CIS or CS. </p>
<p>for example, taking an assembly language course would likely be a requirement for computer engineering but only an elective for CS or CIS and would most likely require some physics classes as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At my university CS students had to take at least two classes that dealt pretty heavily with assembly, namely computer organization and compiler design.  There was also a computer architecture class taught by the electrical engineering department that used to be required, but I think it was made an elective a while ago.  We also had to take a couple of physics classes, though I don't think they were actually prereqs for any of those classes.</p>
<p>So, there definitely is overlap between CS and CE at some schools.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Us CE majors took 1 extra programming class and got 1 elective (which we could pick from either the EE curriculum or the CS curriculum) while the EE folk had an extra EE class and 1 elective that could be picked from Physics or Math. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. At my university we have a School of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) which offers a CS and a CE degree which are only about 3 classes different in the majors courses. The CS degree is in the College of Arts and Sciences and the CE degree is in the College of Engineering so they have different general education requirements but other than that they aren't too different. In the EE department there is a concentration on embedded computing systems but they are only allowed to take the non-majors courses offered by CSE. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm:  I have a bachelor's degree in Information Systems (so &quot;IT&quot;).  The degree was offered by the business school, as opposed to a CS degree which is a degree offered by either the school of mathematics or engineering, depending on where you are.</p>
<p>My degree is purely practical: &quot;How to do stuff.&quot;  Obviously, many CS graduates also do stuff, but that education also includes a bunch of theoretical topics: high-level calculus, game theory, etc. that mine didn't.  By contrast, my degree plan included the stuff you need to succeed in a business organization: writing, finance, macroeconomics, etc.</p>
<p>One quibble about the description above: there's a lot more to IT than, &quot;up-to-date software installed, the servers keep running, the network is secured, etc.&quot;  Those tasks often don't require a degree.  Architecture, analysis, design, optimization- those are also IT.</p>
<p>Edit: I've been schooled that in many places a CS degree is math, not engineering.  So my bad.  Corrected above.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Close. </p>
<p>IT would include people who know what technology to use and where. How to bridge the business need (non tech) with the correct technology. </p>
<p>IT includes the architecture/design, project planning, implementation/configuration, management/administration, patch/upgrade, end user support, end user education, disaster recovery, and more. </p>
<p>DBAs are their own special breed...</p>
<p>IT security, IT legal, IT finance, IT HR, have also popped up more recently where they know a specific business area as well as IT. </p>
<p>My experience, terms like IT, MIS, IS are all over the place and not universal on what we do. Companies will rebrand IT with some buzz words, but it could mean your replacing toner in the printers... </p></div>		</li>
