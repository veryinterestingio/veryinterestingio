			<div class="markdown"><p>tangentially related, you dont just 'blow' through a brass instrument to make sound you 'buzz' your lips. to buzz your lips you blow air across your lips to cause them to vibrate, kinda like blowing a raspberry. the tension in your lips actually determines the pitch of the note, this is how brass players play a wide range of notes with only 3 keys (or the 7 slide positions on a trombone). unlike a woodwind instrument where there are as many key positions as notes (mostly).  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is worth elaborating on slightly. On a brass instrument, the keys are designed to add incremental length to the horn such that the pitch is decreased by one half step (2nd valve), two half steps (1st valve) or three half steps (3rd valve). Adding these together allows you to achieve any pitch reduction up to six half steps below the “open” pitch, for a total of seven used combinations.</p>
<p>One caveat here is that the added length necessary for each half step is actually multiplicative, meaning each half step requires slightly more tubing. So the length of the 1st and 2nd valves combined should be three half steps, equal to the 3rd valve, but is actually slightly shorter. In fact, the 3rd valve is typically tuned flat to accommodate lower pitches, and the 1st valve is given a small slide to give players the option to lengthen it to correctly tune the 1+2 combination.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Umm - only use 7?  Are you trying to suggest 1+2 is the same as third?  Because it's not, and you know it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which of the 8 do you not use? I regularly use all combinations. I assume you're referring to just 3rd valve, but that is used very often :)</p>
<p>Source: have now played French horn, trumpet, mellophone, other brass for over a decade.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The goal is not to have some kind of airflow that would make a sound by passing through, but to get the air inside the tube (which is an open-closed pipe) to vibrate. It is the oscillation at the open end of the pipe that is transmitted to the atmosphere. The way an open-closed pipe behave when resonating depends on its length (the lenght of the pipe and the wavelentgth, and thus the fundamental frequency generated are directly correlated). With instruments that use a reed, such as woodwinds, the frequency at which the reed vibrate is constant, the player only providing a steady source of energy to get it to vibrate. In the case of brass instruments, the lips of the player act as a reed and he has control over the frequency at which they vibrate, this is why woodwinds usually generate each note by using slides or holes, while brass instruments use a combination of modifying the length of the pipe AND the frequency at which the lips vibrate. If it sounds tricky, it is because it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not exactly what is happening though. This can be best compared to the string on a violin. While the lips &quot;buzz&quot;, two of the larger factors are because of resonant frequency and harmonics. The tension of the string does not change, but the length of the string can be altered (using the bridge and left hand to depress and thus shorten the length), combined with the strength and speed of the bow to change volume. This is easier to illustrate on a didgeridoo and a jumprope. If you tie a rope to a doorknob and move the string up and down that's the lowest frequency. If you move it up and down faster, you'll get 1, 2, 3, etc. nodal points the faster and faster you move the rope. This what is happening on brass instruments as the speed of the air increases. Assuming 12 tone western music tuning, if you play an &quot;open&quot; no valves depressed note on a brass instrument, a C below the staff will be the basic note (depends on key of instrument, but just relatively speaking). The second harmonic note will be g in the staff, the third is C in the staff. The fourth is E in the staff, G above the staff fifth, and Bb above that, and a C above the staff (I think it's 6x at this point). The notes become closer and closer together as you go up and the intervals I just described are respectively, Perfect Fifth, fourth, major third, minor third, minor third (not perfect, slightly flat), and major second.</p>
<p>The second aspect is the valves, or in the case of a trombone, the slide. Both of these mechanisms change the length of the instrument, thus moving the harmonic series by varying the length of the instrument. Each valve can be represented by the numbers 1, 2, and 3. The instruments are designed to have the right hand operate the valves, and the valve with the pointer finger is usually called first valve, middle finger second valve, and ring finger third valve. The second valve is 1  &quot;unit&quot;, the first valve is 2 &quot;units&quot;, and third valve is 3 &quot;units&quot;. The first valve extends the length of the instrument by exactly 2x the distance of the 1st valve and so on. There are 7 basic valve combinations, and some alternate ones that don't typically play as in tune. They can be represented between 0-6, using my above &quot;units&quot;. 0=no valves depressed, 1=2nd valve, 2=1st valve, 3=1st and 2nd valves both depressed, 4=1st and 3rd valves both, 5=2nd and 3rd, 6=all 3 depressed.</p>
<p>Alternative fingers include for example 3rd valve is 3 units, which is the same as 1 and 2 together. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theyre called horn-loaded speakers, and yeah!  Speakers can also use transmission lines to provide load (like a flute does) or resonant volumes (like a drum).  However horns are the best way to get maximum volume.</p></div>		</li>
