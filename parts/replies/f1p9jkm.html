			<div class="markdown"><p>True.  Watched a lecture by Brandon Sanderson about this.   Whether or not the book is a success depends on how well it does vs how well it was expected to do.   For example, if you sell 100k copies of your book but the expectation was that you would sell 120k then that book is considered a flop; however if I sell 5k copies of my book and the expectation was only 1k then my book is seen as a better seller even though you sold 20x what I did.   Its a weirdly broken system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t think I would really consider that broken, since the expectations determine the amount of time and resources that a publisher puts into a book, and their overall financial plans are based on how they expect the books they have coming out to do.</p>
<p>If they pour enough effort into something to justify a 120k run and it comes up 20k short, that’s maybe an indication that they should have been allocating more resources to something else that could have sold better as a consequence, and means they don’t have money they were expecting to have in their budget.</p>
<p>If something that they put comparatively little effort into does unexpectedly well, that’s fairly impressive, didn’t cost them anything and adds some unexpected padding to their income which is a nice surprise.</p>
<p>The expectation of success is generally there for a reason: the book is usually coming with some built in advantages often including an existing fan base, prominent media attention, more advertising, etc. given those advantages, it <em>should</em> sell more, and if it doesn’t that’s not a good sign.</p>
<p>A first time book by someone no one has ever heard of that doesn’t have a big campaign behind it is going to have a harder time doing big numbers, and if it sells significantly better than most books do under those circumstances, that’s pretty notable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's kind of exactly how movies work. If something with a $20m budget makes $100m, that's a hit, but if a movie with a $200m budget makes $300m, that's a flop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh man, nothing like that.  </p>
<p>I have a variety of podcasts I listen to that I really like though.  Business Wars, Hardcore History, 538 Politics, Opening Arguments.  Those are my main ones along with Darknet Diaries.</p></div>		</li>
