			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, encrypted, something along the lines of how you're not too worried about how the network traffic carrying your banking browsing session could be read by others because it's encrypted so reading it doesn't do much good on its own</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I understand it (which isn't very far), there's nothing that technically stops you from monitoring all cellular communication that's in range of your device. It would just be a matter of having the correct software. It's also possible there are firmware restrictions that prevent your phone from passing traffic not intended for it up into the OS or other software.</p>
<p>The process would be similar to how you would sniff wifi or wired ethernet traffic. Some wifi adapters and most wired NICs can be put into &quot;promiscuous mode&quot; (wifi might use different terminology) and once in that mode, using the right software (such as wireshark), you can look at all of the network traffic in your area. Usually that will be stuff on the same switch or set of switches that your computer is plugged into or any wifi traffic within range of your antenna.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It remains to this day incredibly difficult to view the unencrypted contents of cellular traffic. I'm not talking like Wifi traffic etc. Cellular encryption has proven really effective and firmware and software migrations continue to do a good job keeping things safe.</p>
<p>It basically hasn't been broken. I think just a couple times by security engineers before being patched, and I think the conditions to pull it off made it difficult if not impossible to do in practice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nothing. This is the physical transmission layer I'm talking about. (Or possibly Transport layer in the case of CDMA or NOMA.) Encryption (if any) comes at higher levels. HTTPS in the browser is the session layer, and encryption in WhatsApp etc is in the application layer. AFAIK phone calls and SMS messages aren't encrypted at all, so technically yes, anyone can listen in.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t believe that’s the case. Cell tower technology is a bit different than standard computer networks. I believe I read somewhere that all data is transmitted with encryption. Though, the govt does have those stinger devices that can covertly intercept cell transmissions, so perhaps that’s the case. But I believe it is encrypted, including voice and SMS.</p>
<p>Edit: indeed, it does seem to be encrypted, albeit perhaps not using the strongest of ciphers. </p>

<p>Though, once the SMS or voice is received by the provider, it’s Possible that the routing to the receiving provider is unencrypted, though I would hope that’s not the case, and would sort of expect some sort of protocol to exist for this.</p>
<p>Edit #2: yeah it seems like a lot of providers route the voice data unencrypted once it reaches the tower, so your provider could access the data, but not other cells using the tower. Also it seems like those stingers operate by negotiating an unencrypted connection with the mobile devices, but evidently that’s supported on GSM.</p></div>		</li>
