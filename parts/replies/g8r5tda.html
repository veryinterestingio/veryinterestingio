			<div class="markdown"><p>It would have to be very strong, iirc as long as the HDD is in the case, you run a higher risk of bricking the drive by dragging the computer across the desk while its on (which is way low)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And as things like Seagate hamr technology becomes more common at the consumer level, a magnet by itself probably won't do much. Since the media needs to be laser heated to allow the write head to actually change the magnetic field.</p>
<p>So very low probability that a handheld rare magnet would damage the media of a drive still sealed in the case. Damaging other parts like miss aligning the read/write head or the motor is theoretically possible.</p>
<p>And of course industrial equipment that produces high magnetic fields are a different story.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>we had a couple tesla power rated degauser as one step in destroying hard drives. about a 90 second charge then POP. Never did test if it was still usable after that since they went straight into a crusher.  </p>
<p>Edit: Looked it up, and the Degauser we used is around the same strength magnet as a typical MRI machine. 1.5 Teslas. Which is actually stronger than a typical scrap yard magnet, which are usually 1Tesla strength magnetic fields. Granted the big difference is the Degauser is fired for a very short time with a large capaciter. where as these machines run constantly(and are larger magnets as well) </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The magnets are part of a linear motor/actuator to position the head. The coil and magnetic field allow for precise positioning. (Before they used stepper motors and gearing.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Used to work on repairing crts and other electronics in the navy. On a ship one of the biggest issues was color bleed. My first class was like see this how you got your blotch here? He took out a speaker magnet and started waving it in circles in front of the tv and sure enough the blotch started moving off screen/disappearing. </p>
