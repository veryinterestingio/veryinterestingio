			<div class="markdown"><p>Hm. My handedness is quite pronounced (like, I can barely get a spoon to my mouth with my left hand) but I have trouble with right and left. Not that that disproves that people who are ambidextrous also have trouble -- I'm just musing. I do have trouble with numbers, like someone mentioned in another thread.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had issues as a kid, my mother fixed it for me and I still recall MANY years later. It only works in left hand drive cars and it went like this.</p>
<p>She sat me behind the drivers seat and asked me what would happen if she got out of the car?
Answer: Iâ€™d be LEFT alone ðŸ˜‚</p>
<p>It worked lol so perhaps it will help you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>: )  lol I think as an adult I've mostly worked it out. Like I may have to stop and think about it but I can do so pretty quickly at this point. But it's still clear to me that even that momentary hesitation isn't present in others around me and I'm basically relying on 40 years of experience at this point in compensating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Guugu Yimithirr people of Australia are interesting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The language is notable for its use of pure geographic directions (north, south, east, west) rather than egocentric directions (left, right, forward, backward), though such &quot;purity&quot; is disputed. Still, it has given its speakers a remarkable sense of direction.</p>

<p>So instead of saying &quot;The pot to your left&quot; they say &quot;The pot to the south of you&quot;. They don't have left and right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I will often give directions in north/south/east/west and normally get a blank look in return, I guess some people just don't know where in the world they stand.</p>
<p>On a side note it took a long time to come to terms with it all being arse about face when I moved to the northern end of the world</p></div>		</li>
