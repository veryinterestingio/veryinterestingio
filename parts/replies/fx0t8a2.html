			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. At a certain slope angle walking simply becomes more efficient. The reason is that on a bike you need to apply force to stop you from rolling backward AND provide power to go up. The person walking only needs to provide the latter thanks to the much higher friction between their shoes and the ground.</p>
<p>Imagine sitting on a tricycle with no breaks, and it's in a slope. You need to apply force to the pedals just to remain where you are, otherwise you would roll backward. Imagine the slope angle increasing, then you need more and more force just to remain stationary. A person standing does not experience an increase in force needed to remain there. The friction between sole and ground does the job for him. This extra force required to combat going backward for a cyclist makes the bike less efficient at some point, and that is clearly noticable in real life as OP has experienced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But standing on a slope also needs to require force (but not work) not to go backwards. You do it by using your muscles to balance and keep your knees straight, etc. Friction keep you from sliding backwards, but it doesn’t keep you from falling backwards. Gravity works on you just like it works on a bike.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No you just lean forward and static friction keeps you from sliding back. Walking up hill is like a ratchet. While you’re running or biking you’re maintaining momentum</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but they do not balance out the effect I described. Ultimately, what OP is experiencing is that a bike wants to roll backward with increasing force in steeper slopes which at a certain point makes it more demanding than walking.</p></div>		</li>
