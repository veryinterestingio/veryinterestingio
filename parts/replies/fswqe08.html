			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I guess the closest thing to it would be if we used an external apparatus such as respirators and air tanks, but even then I don't think it'd work, cuz birds are just so much better at oxygenating the blood than we are. </p>
<p>The avian respiratory system is complex af, and it's kinda hard for me to explain why we can't simply apply any of it to ourselves without writing a ten page dissertation on avian anatomy. But to put it in ridiculously simplistic terms, think of it like this: Birds are like bagpipes. You gently blow air into it to keep it going, but the instrument itself does all the work for you. Because of the way the air flows from the main chamber into the smaller pipes branching off of it, it creates air pressure over the reeds, resulting in an effortless, uninterrupted chorus of sound. We're more like a saxophone: It only has one reed that you have to blow directly into. You have to do all the work, so it can only produce one short doot at a time. </p>
<p>So you see, the bagpipes are vastly more efficient, cuz they can play multiple, continuous doots, simultaneously, without having to put much effort into it at all. It is a poly-doot instrument. Us saxophones are strictly mono-doot only, and it's pretty laborious to play, too, you gotta blow pretty hard in order to doot at all. The bagpipes will always have a superior air-to-doot ratio.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because it's a better way to utilize as much space inside the body as they can. The air sacs also are what allows the bird to create a continuous air flow to maximize blood oxygenation, kind of like the chambers of a heart, or like bagpipes, as I described in the comment just before this one. I apologize for the inherent silliness in advance.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I guess I don't see how &quot;air sacks&quot; take up appreciably less space than &quot;lungs&quot;.</p>

<p>From the diagram I saw this wasn't a valid analogy. The chambers in the heart pump from one to another, whereas the air sacks pumped both to and from the main lungs. In a continuous circulation, you need an entrance port and exit port, but bird respiration does not have that.</p></div>		</li>
