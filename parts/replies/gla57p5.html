			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a French method of poaching. You put the protein in a bag (heavy duty ziplock) and boil the bag in a pot of water.</p>
<p>Long before I knew what sous vide was, my grandmother would make us all omelettes by cracking eggs in a bag and boiling it for 5-10 minutes. It was about 3-5 bags at a time with 2-3 eggs each and whatever add ins, and it took a grand total of 30 minutes to prep and cook for 4-7 people.</p></div>		</li>
