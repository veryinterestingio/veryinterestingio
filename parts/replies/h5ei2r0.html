			<div class="markdown"><p>There's different phases of sleep.  After phase 4 (rem) you cycle back to phase 1 which is just at the threshold of being awake.  I suspect you don't talk or sleep walk during phases 3 or 4. And, if your brain detects you are walking it will probably not allow you to go back into deeper sleep until you settle down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you had a sleep study done? How do you know you don't have phase 2-3 sleep unless you have brainwave data to backup this claim? You're unconscious during sleep so you can't know unless it's being measured</p></div>		</li>
