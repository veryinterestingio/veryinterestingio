			<div class="markdown"><p>Black holes and the start of the big bang are both singularities. Due to the way the relativity equations work, if a finite volume exceeds a certain mass, it collapses down into an infinitely dense point. There's not really much more to it than that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Current best models for gravitational fields have points at them where the gravitational field approaches infinity, and you have points where the density of space is infinite. Basically, there is something like &quot;g = 1/r&quot; in the equations (where g is the field strength and r is the radius), so at r = 0 the maths is unhappy.</p>
<p>That is probably a weakness of the model; the main place this appears is at the exact centre of black holes, but General Relativity isn't great at very small scales.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A singularity may have a discontinuity.  But not necessarily the other way around.</p>
<p>Discontinuity at <code>x=0</code> example: <code>y = roundUp(x)</code>.  <code>x=-0.1</code> then <code>y=0</code>, <code>x=-0.01</code> then <code>y=0</code>, <code>x=0</code> then <code>y=1</code>.  There is vertical line at <code>x=0</code> so it's not a smooth line.</p>
<p>Singularity at <code>x=0</code> example: <code>y = 1/x</code>.  <code>x=-0.1</code> then <code>y=-10</code>, <code>x=-0.01</code> then <code>y=-100</code>, <code>x=0</code> then <code>y</code> is <strong><em>undefined</em></strong>, <code>x=0.01</code> then <code>y=100</code>, <code>x=0.1</code> then <code>y=10</code>.  The line is smooth until <code>x=0</code>, so no discontinuity (it is differentiable).  But at <code>x=0</code>,  <code>y</code> is not defined because it has two values.  But also, because these values are thought of as positive and negative &quot;infinity&quot; which are not numbers at all.</p>
<p>In math a singularity and a pole is just about the same thing.  There is a pole at <code>x=0</code> for <code>y=1/x</code>.</p>
<p>Fun task - find a function where there is a pole at x=0 but is well behaved when approaching from the negative side and the positive side (hint: used complex numbers).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dirac and Heaviside developed a workaround to analyzing these functions: the unit step function. That is defined as:
x &lt; 0: 0
x &gt;= 0: 1
The workaround is that the integral is the unit ramp function and the derivative is the unit impulse function. When using these functions, poles and zeros are clearly defined.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a bit more general than that: singular points are points which are not <em>regular</em>, in some sense that depends on the context. For example, you may also say that f(x)=|x| is singular in 0 (since it has no well defined derivative there).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A singularly is the point beyond what we can understand and/or observe.</p>
<p>For artificial intelligence, it's like an ape watching humans in the beginnings of society. At first all the tribal togetherness and hunting and gathering would make sense to an ape, but once we started farming, it would start to be incomprehensible. Flash forward thousands of years and an ape would have no idea how to function in a human's world.</p>
<p>So for AI, once it reaches singularly, at first it might make some sense when we see machines solve things we never achieved. And maybe down the line it might be interesting to see a machine inventing time travel or teleportation much like an ape might enjoy a car ride or food from the grocery store... but eventually AI may do things that are beyond our wildest imagination much like TV would have been beyond the imagination of some Egyptian pharaoh.</p>
<p>As for a singularly in a black hole (assuming a five year old understands black holes) it is the point beyond what we can observe. Light is the fastest thing in the universe and yet it cannot escape the singularly. So nothing else can. No rockets, no radio signals, no lasers... nothing. Imagine a world without submarines and sinking to the bottom of the ocean without a way to float up and no way to communicate where you are. Once you dive in, no one will ever know what truly happened. From their perspective, you sunk to the bottom, but what if from your perspective you found a door to a hidden room or what if there was no bottom? You could never communicate this and all anyone could do on the other side is make guesses.</p></div>		</li>
