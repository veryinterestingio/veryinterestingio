			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm fairly certain shaped charges need to be with high-explosives which detonate faster. Black powder is not high explosive even under compression. </p>
<p>I looked it up: a conical shape will increase yield for black powder but it doesn't have the same properties of a shaped charge. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaped_charge" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaped_charge</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Looking at some late 16th century manuals I still haven't come across any sort of rule of thumb for the amount of gunpowder you're supposed to use for mining, but they do recommend that the cavern be dug about 7 feet wide and 9-10 feet tall with the idea being that it would better direct the blast upwards and do more damage to whatever structure you are trying to destroy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you honestly think someone who makes offhand comments like those has a sense of historical politics? He/she surely does mean Tory as it is now acceptable to want Tories dead. I'm talking in general when I say this, it baffles me how people nowadays have no qualms insulting and wishing the death on someone who they disagree with politically. So much for tolerance. These sentiments are nothing out of the ordinary, especially on r/ukpolitics. </p></div>		</li>
