			<div class="markdown"><p>So why does it itch? The question wasn’t answered. What is making the wound itch? Yes there’s sensitive nerves there but why does it itch? Why not tingle? Sting? Burn? Why does it itch? Is it the cells dividing? Is it the cells reconnecting?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I left out some information.</p>
<p>When a wound is being healed histamine is sent to the target location. This histamine causes the affected area to become irritated through some allergic reaction within the proces. This substance is essential for <strong>wound healing</strong>, as it triggers cellular movement, which I was talking about before, that helps develop new tissue around the wound and at last close the wound up.</p>
<p>Histamines are a chemical your immune system develops. Histamines actually work like bouncers at a nightclub -&gt; They help you get rid of the things that aren't supposed to be there.</p></div>		</li>
