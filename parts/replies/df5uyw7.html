<p>There's the visible universe and the observable universe. The visible universe is what we can see, what you described. The observable universe is what we can predict exists based on observable maths, which is something like 90bly. </p>

<p>Where on earth are you getting this information? Where is this idea coming from that there is a &quot;visible&quot; universe that isn't synonymous with &quot;observable&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I studied a bit of astrophysics a couple of years ago. I don't remember all the details, but basically it's just a difference between what can be seen by visible light and what we know to exist based on expansion. </p>
<p>EDIT: I looked back over my notes and apparently there is no distinction between visible universe and observable. They are the same. I was right in the measurements though. More than 90bly in diameter. </p>
<p>EDIT 2: Wow, there's a lot I forgot. The 90bly is about the only thing I'm right about. I really need to brush up my knowledge every so often. </p></div>		</li>
