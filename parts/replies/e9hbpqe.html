<p>Source: I work in a university sculpture facility with a Saw Stop. I've seen them deploy on wet wood. It makes an awful sound and everyone knows you fucked up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds exactly like an aluminum bat hitting a light pole, and then a loud <em>clunk</em> when it drops. All of which goes off and is heard within fractions of a second.</p>
<p>Had one in my high school advanced shop/wood class.</p>
<p>It only stopped once the whole 4 years we used it before graduating. I was on the band-saw about 15 feet away and about cut myself when it deployed as i jumped like a school girl seeing a rat.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If I remember right it's about $100 worth </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an owner of one of these saws....</p>
<p>Yes it will cause the safety mechanism to trigger and pull the blade to a safe position if you cut metal with it. This is because metal is conductive and thus changes the small current running through the blade. It can also cause the safety mechanism to trigger if you cut very wet wood with it. There is a bypass mode you can enable if you need to cut metal or really wet wood with it. I’ve had the safety mechanism trigger with wet wood before. It was terrifying to hear this happen. But it was so fast I scarcely knew what was happening. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since you've owned it for a while - in hindsight, do you think the purchase was worth the additional expense?  Seems like once you get past the novelty of the feature you can better judge the value of such a thing, especially since professionals have gotten by safely and consistently using push blocks, featherboards and sliding jigs for nearly a century prior to this invention.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I use power tools all the time, it's not just a weekend hobby for me.</p>
<p>I also like seatbelts, airbags, smoke detectors, circuit breakers... haven't needed those yet either, but glad they're there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A friend lost the tip of her finger to a table saw. This was at a shop at work, I’m really glad my university has a saw stop. I’d say saw stop is worth it. It’s especially worth it at institutions where people are learning how to use a table saw. So fuck ups cost a replacement blade and cartridge instead of fingers and massive medical bills.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it does not damage the appliance when the safety mechanism triggers. The blade is destroyed and the firing cartridge is expended. It can cost anywhere from $150 - 250 when this occurs. Depending on the blade you were using. The most expensive being a dado blade set and cartridge. But that pales in comparison to losing finger/s or a whole hand. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. We have one in our shop. All 3 instances of triggering this were from either wet wood, cutting acrylic, or hitting a piece of metal (like a wood staple).</p>
<p>This is why we have rules of no wet wood, no resawing / reclaimed wood, no acrylic. You need a key to ovveride the saw-stop mechanism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We’re not exactly sure. Other users experiences from Woodworking forums have said they have triggered theirs this way- maybe static electricity trips the system?</p>
<p>We don’t allow acrylic or plexiglas to be cut with the system engaged.</p></div>		</li>
