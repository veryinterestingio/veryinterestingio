			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as how standard we are talking, I used to be a manufacturing engineer with a couple FANUC robots in my area. They had weld torches on the end.  A change in the radius on the corner of a rectangular tube was enough to screw with weld quality.  Hell, we could see if the saw three stations up the line needed a new blade because the burr would make a difference. Normally you wouldnt even notice it because a human welder would just adjust.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a human welder couldn't do 13&quot; of weld (with a transition from vertical down to overhead) in 6 seconds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is how to get a proper input signal. Some things are extremely visual, some aren't. A machine learning model is only as good as its training dataset and its input signal.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It will get better, but it's not there yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A robot that has to correct on the fly will always be slower than one that doesn't. Especially on a major assembly line, seconds matter and having scheduled calibration or maintenance during downtime is far more cost-effective</p></div>		</li>

<p>Cost. The sheer complexity of a machine capable of performing all those tasks will make it big, and expensive to buy and maintain. This is sure to put off most restaurants.</p>

<p>It's not just expensive, to support automation of that complexity a restaurant would have to turn their entire kitchen into an assembly room factory. Like a car factory but on a smaller scale.</p></div>		</li>
