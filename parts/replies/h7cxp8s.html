			<div class="markdown"><p>Even a fiberglass hull? I ask because my father, an engineer, always told us we were safe in a boat during a lightening storm because it was much more likely to hit the water and the water was a much better conductor than our boat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>im curious about this as well.  I have seen lightning strike the mast of a sail boat before.  In this situation how would the lightning ground?  Is there some type of lightning conduction system built into sail boats.  In the case of a motor boat, how would the strike be conducted through the hull?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lighting will travel whatever path has the lowest resistance. This is why it is never a straight line from the ground to the cloud since changing air properties change the resistance. </p>
<p>The full effect is actually more complicated but the short answer is that the mast on a boat is an excellent conductor and allows a shortcut. Wet (salty) lines, stays and other fittings are also quite conductive and so there is a good chance the best path is through the boat.</p>
<p>Fibreglass is &quot;non conductive&quot; but this property is not a binary thing. If you stand on a metal plate and hold up a long rod during a lighting storm, wearing thin rubber gloves would not help enough. The strike would just jump across that gap.</p>
<p>There is a possibility that at some point the thin hull will allow lighting to jump the gap through fibreglass but I have no idea how good fibreglass is as an insulator.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been on a fiberglass-hulled catamaran in the Atlantic before while it was being struck by lightning. I was leaning with both hands touching a fiberglass section of the boat when lightning hit the mast. It threw me back about ten feet and shattered every instrument on the boat, forcing us to send a distress call to be towed back to shore by another boat hours later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;...it isn't nearly as sudden as most people think.&quot;</p>
<p>So I'd always assumed I'd feel the static buildup in my hair, followed by a half-second to dive to the ground.... So how long are we talking here? 15s?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends really, but yea it could be anywhere from 5-10 seconds to maybe a minute or longer. In fact you would definitively be able to feel the static buildup in your hair and it would start standing up when dry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if it really would have helped but when I owned a fiberglass sail boat, if there were storms in the area, we would connect ground cables from the mast stays and trail them in the water.  Fortunately we never had to test them in an actual strike.</p></div>		</li>
