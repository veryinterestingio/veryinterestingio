Llamas, alpacas, guinea pigs, turkeys and Muscovy ducks.  Pretty crazy considering the list of domesticated animals in Eurasia and Africa probably numbers in the hundreds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Time doesn't matter much. We know what animals were in the Americas before the westerners came, most of them are still around (or made extinct by westerners). If they were good for domestication there is no reason we wouldn't have found out by now. Just poor luck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's not forget the fact that Northern Africa was pretty well established for a few thousand years with high populations, making it difficult for a country to sweep through and take over the continent. And a lot of Africa is frankly not super hospitable to humans in general, given the whole drought cycle, big animals and malaria. North America is ez peezy to live in and colonize comparitably.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Europeans didn't have technological superiority over North Africa in the 16th century when they started to colonize the Americas (well they might have been better at some things, but not hugely, and they were also worse at others), this only happened later. The Sahara created a massive natural barrier though and sub-Saharan Africa was underdeveloped compared to Eurasia and North Africa.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The extent of this effect can also be seen in another way: Europeans were just as evil to africans as they were to americans, but, bluntly speaking, today Africa is still full of africans</p>

<p>Years ago I visited South Africa. During a conversation where we were comparing elements of our respective histories and colonial fuckeries, one of the people I was talking with summed it up thus:</p>
<p>&quot;You all killed your natives; we still have to live with and deal with ours.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Ouch.</em></p></div>		</li>
