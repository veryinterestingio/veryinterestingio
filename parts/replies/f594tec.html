			<div class="markdown"><p>I do it with milk. I'm taking a pregnancy vitamin which is two big tablets and an oil capsule. All three go down at once with no problem if I do it with milk but water makes the tablety ones sticky and harder to get down.</p>
<p>Perhaps the fat in the milk coats them and makes them go down easier?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hadn’t ever thought of using milk, but you have a good argument. Our pediatrician once told me that milk isn’t <em>really</em> a liquid in the same way as water or juice. Maybe that has something to do with it.</p></div>		</li>
