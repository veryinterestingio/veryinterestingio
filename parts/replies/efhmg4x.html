			<div class="markdown"><p>The surgery part is left out of a lot of testimonials of people who &quot;cure themselves&quot;. There is a person who has the same type of cancer that I do who has made a tidy living saying he cured his own cancer by juicing and exercising. Only by really reading into his story, buried real deep, can you find that he had surgery and just opted not to do chemo. I hate when people recommend his program. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The best ones are where someone goes to the doctor and the preliminary result is cancer. Then they go to church and everyone prays for them. Then they go to the follow-up at the doctor and after running further tests it turns out to be benign. Ergo, Jesus saves.</p></div>		</li>
