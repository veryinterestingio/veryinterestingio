			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in Machine learning and we too have a thing  called transfer learning which has actually gained a lot of popularity. Essentially you use one neural network to extract useful features off of the image and another as a classifier. It's interesting to note that the idea might have been inspired from natural beings</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To adapt this for comment for those that don't understand:</p>
<p>You take a network that's good at recognising lots of different things in images (generally a convolutional neural network) and strip away the outer edges of the network, and adapt it with the learned base results to instead just recognise the differences between two things.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I expect it's somewhat difficult to prove a negative in that sense, but something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichoplax" target="_blank"><em>Trichoplax</em></a> might be a potential example.  These animals are multi-cellular, but have no neurons at all, yet they still manage to organize behaviours through peptide-mediated cell signalling (<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0136098" target="_blank">Source</a>).  I would conjecture that this method of signalling does not lend itself well to any sort of long-term memory, but can't find any research that has actually tested it, so who knows.</p></div>		</li>
