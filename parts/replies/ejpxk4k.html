			<div class="markdown"><p>Watch the BBC show Life on Mars! It's about a police detective who gets hit by a car and wakes up in the 1970s. </p>
<p>But the show makes it a mystery whether he time traveled, is in a coma, dead and stuck in limbo, or just regular insane . </p>
<p>Yes there's an American version, but the British was better.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But, it's probably the fact that our brains are tuned to detect patterns, and they'll try to do so every chance they get. Your brain hears some air blowing around or something and decides it's a pattern that sounds like your name. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>not quite, humans have binaural hearing as well. What makes owls unique is different.</p>
<p>Owls have a face shaped to divert sound to their ears, which are asymmetrically placed to pick up sound better. </p>
<p>They have exceptional hearing and &quot;focus&quot; on sound by looking at it due to the shape of their face. Some owls have more disc-shaped faces than other, like barn owls for example. </p>
<p>Owls can also use their hearing to &quot;picture&quot; an environment, not like echolocation but more like they are just very good at &quot;processing&quot; sound. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look up fletcher Munson equal loudness.  </p>
<p>We hear ~20Hz to ~20kHz but we’re not equally sensitive to all frequencies, and the relative sensitivity changes with amplitude.  Eg, were more sensitive to bass at higher amplitudes.  </p>
<p>It’s old research but pretty well agreed upon. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;head related transfer function&quot; is the buzzword here. Their inverse characteristics are considered for dB(A) rating for loudness (instead of just the measurable pressure of the acoustic wave).
Funnily, there is also dB(B), dB(C) and dB(D) that use slightly different values for &quot;equivalent loudness&quot;</p>
<p>psycho acoustics is a really interesting field!</p></div>		</li>
