			<div class="markdown"><p>Fair point. Edited above to cover it a little more. With respect to the &quot;scott free&quot; part, that leads into OP's question about PE investments signaling the &quot;death&quot; of a company, which again, is a conversation outside the scope of ELI5 in my opinion.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I understand that everyone involved wants to make the loan and receive the loan since generally it’s a profitable transaction for all. </p>
<p>I’m also not really commenting on whether PE investment is good or bad for the target company. My company was bought out by PE which increased investment and ultimately led to a lucrative exit when it was bought by a mega Corp. </p>
<p>The question is about how the liability is assigned. The PE buys a company using debt, the collateral is the acquired company just like a mortgage. Makes perfect sense, just like buying a house. </p>
<p>But the key difference is that if that company has a major failure that crushes the value of their assets, maybe a hack, maybe malfeasance, maybe a contested patent and their CF goes negative the company fails. The loan defaults. But the PEs other assets are protected because the loan in on the companies books, not on the owners books. </p>
<p>Carrying the homebuyer analogy forward, it’s as if a homebuyer created a LLC and had that LLC borrow the money to buy the house. And then if the mortgage payments stop the LLC declares bankruptcy and the individual gets to walk with his assets and credit intact.</p></div>		</li>
