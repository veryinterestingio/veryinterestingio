			<div class="markdown"><p>So the major interaction occurs in the beam splitter depending on the phase of the 2 reflected beams?
Im not sure if im being silly but if you could shine 2 lasers to the same spot with a 90 degree difference would the same thing happen? (Probably not so its probably something to do with the beam splitter).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re right that the measurement is coming from the phase difference. But you can’t get two separate lasers to be perfectly in phase. Rather they have a single laser that is perfectly in phase with itself. Then half shines through and half bounces at a right angle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So phase difference of the two reflected beams affect both the intensity of each output path and the interference pattern observed at the detector.</p>
<p>To be honest im still confused as to what sort of interference pattern I would be looking for at the detector. Is it some sort of screen that shows bright and dark or areas or is it more a counting machine that measures intensity. What exactly are we observing and measuring? I get that there's constructive and destructive interference due to path differences but how do we tell?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes you can (depending on your definition of &quot;perfect&quot;, but a laser doesn't have an infinite coherence length either). That's not the reason you can't do what he said, the reason is that it would violate unitarity. You can interfere two different lasers on a beam splitter though, but in that case (in the quantum description) the photons that interfere are actually in a superposition of being emitted from both lasers.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The interference is occurring after the beam splitter. When the two beams recombine at the beam splitter and begin to travel to the detector is when they interfere with each other. The result is one new combined beam that produce an <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Michelson_interferometer_fringe_formation.svg/300px-Michelson_interferometer_fringe_formation.svg.png" target="_blank">interference pattern</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think im getting confused, some people are talking about intensity in a different way from each other. I guess I need to learn the actual definitions. </p>
<p>The actual power output of light is the same no matter which output direction right because the beam splitter only splits along 2 directions 50 50. But the measured intensity of light at the specified positions differ due to path difference?</p></div>		</li>
