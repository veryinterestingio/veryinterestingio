			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m the same exact way. I used to have mini panic attacks at the barbershop when they use a hair dryer and blow it at my face to rid it of shavings, but now I no longer freak out because I focus and concentrate. It’s funny because every time before it happens I tell myself “find your heart of stone” and pretend I’m some kind of fantasy book hero overcoming an inner demon, but it’s really just wind lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back when I had to have my wisdom teeth out, I memorized the Litany Against Fear (from Dune). I know it by heart ever since. It's good because it's just long enough that it takes some concentration to remember it all, just enough to keep my mind off what I need to endure. </p>
<p>(Helpful too, I hear, if you have someone with a poison needle right behind your arm). </p>
<h2>Litany Against Fear:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I will not fear. Fear is the mind killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will let it pass over me, and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.</p>

<p>This is a fallacy. You absolutely can override a physical condition with mental power. For one example, simply look at the placebo effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Woh woh woh there! This is incredibly misleading! </p>
<p>The placebo effect works great on things you SUGGESTIVELY feel. </p>
<p>Saying this sugar pill cured my headach is not the same as taking this sugar pill cured my cancer! Pain is suggestive and not thinking of pain is a way to reduce it so taking something you THINK made it better, will make it better.</p>
<p>The way you phrase it, you seem the kind of person that would think you could use the placebo effect to make your leg grow back after it's been cut!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe I'm just strange but even a very light but constant breeze will do this to me. I can't run on the treadmill with the built-in fan on because it's so uncomfortable. I do have asthma so that might have something to do with it. However, if it <em>is</em> explained by the diving reflex that would make sense in my personal life too because I have a pretty bad phobia of water, specifically having my face/head under water. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are both actually correct in that they both happen. But while the end result is the same, the reason is different for both. In the case of the wind, it's the pressure difference. In the case of the divers reflex, it's from liquid entering the nostrils. It's like if the answer to a math problem is 10, just knowing that it's 10 doesn't mean we know how we got to that answer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both are right in a general sense. Breathing in and of itself is a passive event based on pressure differences. When your diaphragm (muscle separating chest cavity and abdomen) contracts, it creates a lower pressure in your chest cavity causing air to passively enter your lungs. That's why you dont have to remember to breathe. Once air is in, your chest cavity has a higher pressure than ambient air, you exhale.</p>
<p>In the case of strong wind or jumping in very cold water, your body reflexively acts to protect your lungs from damage. Commonly called the mammalian dive reflex. They both apply and work as a team. </p>
<p>Edit: I am a paramedic, rescue diver, and dabble in sciencey things</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's probably why I couldn't breath when I went into a Finnish sauna.  I've never been in a sauna before and discovered I could not breath at ALL.  They took a scoop of cold water and told me to put my mouth and nose right above it and I would be able to breath.  It worked!!  </p>
<p>Made no sense to me logically, but it makes sense that I was unconsciously trying to protect my lungs from the hot and humid air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess i don't know whats passive about inhaling. My muscles contract. It takes energy. When I go limp, I naturally exhale, and I think that this happens when people die too, unless I'm a victim of Hollywood. Think of a balloon.  It doesn't fill with air when you open it, but it will have all the air rush out when you open it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're thinking of &quot;passive&quot; in a different way here. The point is that air entering your lungs is because of the pressure difference caused by the diaphragm. It's passive in that air isn't &quot;pushed&quot; into your lungs, but it goes in to maintain equilibrium. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The balloon doesnt have a lower pressure when empty as the opening still allows air to be the same as the air on the outside. And by contrast again it has an elastic outer material fighting to get back to normal which is exerting a force on the inside air when filled. </p></div>		</li>

<p>No, it's because there's sort of an autopilot for the diaphragm. And inhaling is not a passive process. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is though. You can stop it or force yourself to not inhale or inhale deeper, sharper etc.... and same with exhaling. But if you're doing other thing it happens naturally as an instinct. Passive might not be the best term but for ELI5 I thought it worked ok. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My guess is that its a combo of both. At every day normal air speeds (ie, sitting on your couch), if you stop breathing but keep your airway open and just relax, nothing happens. The air in your lungs/airway stays completely still. </p>
<p>This is your base state. Relax your breath and air doesnt move. </p>
<p>However, with air running across your face, theres a slightly lower pressure outside. This means that when you relax your breath and expect no air to move, the air actually moves out of your lungs. You feel like youre exhaling (akr <em>is</em> moving out of youe lungs) even though your body is telling you that youre not actually partaking in that action. </p>
<p>This sets off alarm bells, and your diaphragm sort of doesnt eeally know what to do or how to handle the situation. </p>
<p>This, combined with the scuba diver explanation, probably accounts for this phenomena...</p></div>		</li>
