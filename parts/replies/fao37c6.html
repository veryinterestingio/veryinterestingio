			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it really is quite different based on the animal. Like we could have been obligate carnivores like cats and so a healthy complete diet would consist entirely of meat and maybe organs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well we intentionally over-feed livestock that will go to slaughter, so that's how they get fat. Not very many overweight herbivores in the wild. Humans <em>can</em> get fat from eating too many vegetables, but vegetables have a very low density of calories, so over-eating on a veggie-only diet would be a challenge.</p></div>		</li>
