			<div class="markdown"><p>Why are we even not talking about the main reasons behind this? Yes, it's man made. But why did the &quot;man&quot; do this? That's the important point. We did this to clear land for CATTLE RANCHING AND SOY BEAN PRODUCTION.  These two are the main reasons for deforestation in Amazon. Cattle ranching exists to produce beef. Soy beans are primarily used to feed livestock. Brazil thrives on selling beef and soy beans. </p>
<p>Why are we hiding these two main reasons? Cattle ranching happens because people are not willing to give up eating beef. Soy beans produced will continue to be unsustainable as long as there are billions of livestock out there damaging out environment in every way possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not trying to say you’re wrong (because you’re not), but I think it’s important to say that <a href="https://thebrazilbusiness.com/article/countries-that-import-meat-from-brazil" target="_blank">the US does not import beef from Brazil</a>. </p>
<p>That is not to say that beef production in the states has no effect on the environment, on the contrary: meat production is a sinkhole of resources and major producer of greenhouse gasses like methane and carbon dioxide. It is important for us to decrease our meat consumption (even if you ignore the moral question).</p>
<p>You don’t have to suddenly become vegan to help, though. That’s very difficult if you’re not used to it. You can try some more gradual implementations (e.g. shifting away from red meats, meatless days, etc.) as well as supporting and promoting policies that put our meat production in check (I’d look to champions of things like The Green New Deal for that.) A single person has such a small impact on the world, but as they say: “No single raindrop thinks it is responsible for the flood”.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So these fires are deliberate, but are they legal or illegal? I don't understand why media headlines are &quot;Amazon rainforest is burning for two weeks&quot; and not &quot;Amazon devastated by arson&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the current Brazillian president ran on opening the Amazon for resource extraction and has already, amongst other things, fired members of his own government for showing satellite pictures that show the extent of the deforestation. If these fires aren't directly endorsed by him, they are at least being set under the expectation that no action will be taken against those responsible because it serves the president's political goals.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Whatever they are, they are encouraged by the Brazilian government. Whether they are technically legal on paper doesn't matter.</p></div>		</li>
