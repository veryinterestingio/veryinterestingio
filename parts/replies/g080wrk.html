<p>In small scale experiments, increased CO2 does accelerate plant growth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You need to be a little careful with statements like this.</p>
<p>This claim is usually based on studies of plants in greenhouse conditions that have had CO2 artificially raised - but the claimant generally neglects to point out that water and available nitrogen fertilizer have also been raised in those studies. What's far more relevant are studies of Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) when only CO2 has been increased, and they all find that the increase in crop yields is much less than in greenhouse studies. Invariably it seems that plants are far more nitrogen-limited than they are CO2-limited.</p>
<p>Moreover, there's a very different response to increased CO2 depending on the photosynthetic pathway a plants uses. C4 plants such as corn, in general, do not gain any benefit from increased FACE. While some C3 plants do gain some benefit from increased FACE, many also become less nutritious, with a significant drop in protein production from rice and wheat.</p>
<p>Finally, any benefit these C3 plants gain from increased FACE is negated by increased heat and drought...which is exactly what increased CO2 in the atmosphere will bring.</p></div>		</li>
