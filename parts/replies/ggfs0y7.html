			<div class="markdown"><p>It has not been proven to be more infectious. It could be more infectious is the wording being used over and over.</p>
<p>This &quot;new variant&quot; is also around since September.</p>
<p>The only thing we know is that it's proportion of confirmed cases has become higher, this is not the first variant to do this, a Variant in Spain became the most common variant in Europe over the summer.</p>
<p>We also know that cases are rising in areas where it is dominant, but this could be explained by human behaviour and seasonality.</p>
<p>Similar rises are seen in Wales and large portions of Europe and the US.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this.
Some actual critical thinking.</p>
<p>So far I have seen exactly zero data presented which support the loudly repeated increase in transmissibility.</p>
<p>Until there is evidence of these set of mutations increasing the rate of transmission of this variant, increase in the growth of this virus significantly beyond the ate of growth of the other variants, then why should we think it is anything other than a naturally occurring set of accumulated mutations??</p>
<p>I am struggling to see any evidence supporting this.
Until then (and unless)...the reasons for the loudly and often rhetoric of the increased transmissibility is likely to serve a different purpose. Scapegoat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A change in the spike protein doesn't necessarily mean a new vaccine is needed. Earlier mutation to the Covid-19 spike protein definitely had no impact in that regard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unknown. Dont say that as though it is fact.</p>
<p>It is unlikely to prevent the vaccine working due to the vaccination leading to the generation of antibodies against multiple epitopes, so the confirmed mutations in the spike region present in this variant may reduce vaccine efficacy but is therefore UNLIKELY to render immunisation with the vaccine ineffective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question: If it is mutation of genes coding spike protein and Pfizer vaccine (and other vaccines but I don't follow all of them) targets spike protein does it mean there is a risk vaccine would not work with this mutated form?</p>
<p>Edit: I can answer myself, I found it in the article you've shared:</p>
<p>&quot;Mutations to the spike protein lead to questions about the vaccine because the three leading jabs - Pfizer, Moderna and Oxford - all train the immune system to attack the spike.</p>
<p>However, the body learns to attack multiple parts of the spike. That is why health officials remain convinced the vaccine will work against this variant.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes thereâ€™s a risk vaccines fail on new strains, then those strains become dominant and you need a different vaccine as well as the old one. Kind of how the annual flu vaccine programme works.</p></div>		</li>
