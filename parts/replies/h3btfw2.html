			<div class="markdown"><p>You are not wrong, but you are not right either. Only a small percentage of static is the actual CBR, probably less than 2%. It would be like describing Superman and saying &quot;it's the guy in the yellow costume&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really.  CBR is <em>present</em>, but isn't what you are hearing.  As another parallel, the same way listening to the noises in a city you can hear noise from the wind; although you can hear wind, the wind likely isn't what you are hearing in a noisy city.</p>
<p>The vast majority of the static is coming from the world around you. Much is local, just everyday electrical noise and interference. Motors, generators, power lines, and so on. It is also from storms around the globe, natural electrical noises bounced around ionosphere, and tons of other sources. Radio signals get bounced around the entire globe by bouncing off the ionosphere, it's possible to pick up remnants of radio stations on other continents, or to hear electrical bursts from lightning on other continents. Signals can bounce around for quite a long time, reflecting and echoing off earth's features.</p>
<p>When we're not drowned out by local sources or distant planetary sources, radio signals from the sun tend to dominate much of the day. The sun generates a broad range of frequencies, and the interplay of all that noise hitting our atmosphere, as well as atmospheric items across the globe (like clouds), are also picked up easily in radio static.</p>
<p>Radio systems can be focused out to space, they'll pick up all kinds of radio noise as well. It takes listening at night, focusing out into deep space and filtering out other noise if you want to get it down to being just CBR.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The vast majority you are hearing is coming from within your own radio. A 1 MHz effective noise bandwidth on your receiver is a 60 dB increase in noise above the thermal noise floor. Checking out some ITU docs on noise, once your over 100 MHz man made noise is about 30 dB over kt, and galactic noise and atmospheric noise is less than that. So in the fm example, your thermal noise from the channel bandwidth assuming a perfect filter at 200 kHz is 53 dB over the fundamental noise floor. Unless there is a close by electrical storm, you are just listening to your own receiver.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>So would radio static be different during the day and night?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. You can even use the Terminator to make signals go further.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Significantly, yes.</p>
<p>Many stations that are difficult or impossible to receive during the day are available and clear after the sun is beyond the horizon. An extra hour or two past sundown improves it further.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Meant to add: since there’s no data in the signal that your radio can recognize and interpret, your radio just plays “static,” incomprehensible electromagnetic noise</p></div>		</li>
