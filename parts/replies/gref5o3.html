			<div class="markdown"><p>Bees will actually do this for themselves. Some queen cells are &quot;supercedure&quot; cells, which are queens that will take over the hive when they mature, superseding the old queen. Other cells are swarm cells, which contain queens that will take over after the old queen leads half the hive away to start a new hive.</p>
<p>An experienced beekeeper can tell one cell type from another. If they find swarm cells in the hive, they might destroy them to keep the hive from swarming, or they might make arrangements to capture the swarm when it happens so they can make a new beehive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is how beekeepers grow their apiary, by making &quot;splits.&quot; A strong, usually chill hive to work with is flagged as a split candidate. Then the queen and a couple frames of egg, brood (larva that is ready to hatch out as a young bee) some honey and pollen, and is put into a small box called a nucleus colony ( or just a nuc). The keeper then leaves eggs for the donor colony to raise a new queen, as they will realize quickly they dont have one. Eventually the nuc will grow in size to be as big as the donor colony, and voila! You have 2 hives!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>there are multiple ways this happens  </p>
<p>If you have eggs/larva from the existing queen you can remove her and let the hive try and make a new one, you put her and other bees in another hive to start over (split)<br />

<p>If the workers think the queen isn't good enough (not enough eggs, sick, etc.) they will raise new queens to replace her. (supercede)<br />

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If the hive is too crowded, not enough food, etc. the queen can signal it is time to split and workers make a new queen.  (swarm)<br />

<p>The queen controls the workers but the workers control making queens.  </p>
<p>btw their are many  beekeepers that much of their business is just raising queens to sell not just honey.<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  You see those multiple white bee hive boxes placed out by crops?  The bee keepers have either split hives or purchased separate queens to make each of those.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>When the queen dies, the pheromone stops</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This happens even before the original queen dies. Once the hive gets too 'strong', it overpowers the original queen's pheromones and multiple new queens are created (by feeding royal jelly to pupae). In practice, queen cells are larger and distinct from the standard honeycomb cells that typical brood are born in. So, it is standard practice to pinch off those new queen cells as they form to prevent new queens from forming and causing the hive to split in a swarm.</p>
<p>Hives can really be thought of as a single organism. Reproduction truly happens when a new queen is born and the hive splits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A friend of mine who keeps bees told me something like that. The hive is the organism, and the workers, drones, and queen all exist to serve the hive. The queen exists only to lay eggs, and when she can’t, the hive replaces her. Drones exist only to mate, and when they aren’t needed, the hive kicks them out to die.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, individuals are more like cells within the organism of the hive. </p>
<p>Lone (non-queen) bees have no means of reproduction and just die within weeks. They are not a viable 'organism'. And even a lone queen will immediately die without the hive to support her.</p></div>		</li>
