			<div class="markdown"><p>What about those cameras that do close ups on animals <em>while they're running</em> then? With lenses that zoom in so close, moving the camera by just one cm, it looks like it's one metre on screen. How does that work?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you can link me to a particular shot, I can probably try and narrow it down. There are plenty of techniques, but this is probably quite simple camera movement - if the subject isn’t small or really far away, it’s not that hard to track a moving animal. </p>
<p>The camera would usually be on a slider or tripod so that the movement is smooth, but I’ve shot lion chases handheld on a 400mm lens, because you have to move the camera so little, it’s not that hard (heavy though).</p>
<p>With modern high resolution cameras, it could also be done by a digital zoom for extreme close ups. For examples you might shoot an animal at 8K, but you’re publishing at HD, this means in post production you can zoom in up to 4x before you lost too much detail. So the wide angle and the close up could be the exact same shot at different zoom levels.</p>
<p>And of course, maybe only 1 or 2 seconds from a 10 second shot is actually usable because of erratic movement or whatever, but it can be recovered in editing.</p>
<p>Im not an expert - I have some video production experience, but all my wildlife shooting comes from a recent trip to Africa.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the BBC stuff, they have some amazing massive zoom lenses that are stabilized and helicopter mounted.  In the <em>Life of Mammals</em> series they show some of the behind the scenes stuff and the show a sequence with wolves where you think you’re right next to them, but the camera is on a helicopter several kilometers away.</p>
<p>Often they’ll use tamed animals as well for truly up-close shots.  A good example of this is shots of migratory birds, especially ducks and cranes flying.  Those are often ones that have been raised in captivity and are either imprinted on the follow vehicle or trained to fly right next to it.</p>
<p>Lastly, they have <em>really</em> good and experienced camera operators.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In reality, though, it‘s mostly trained animals in zoos and pens.</p>
<p>As David Attenborough points out though... Filming in controlled situations is kinder to the animals and you get better shots.</p>
<p>Examples from this article:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/bbc-david-attenborough-nature-documentaries-fake-a8291961.html" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/bbc-david-attenborough-nature-documentaries-fake-a8291961.html" target="_blank">https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/bbc-david-attenborough-nature-documentaries-fake-a8291961.html</a></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[1997] a sequence with a bear and her cubs was filmed in a zoo in Belgium  </p>
<p>[2011] BBC was forced to admit that scenes featuring a polar bear and her cubs in <em>Frozen Planet</em> were actually filmed in a zoo in the Netherlands and not in an Arctic environment.  </p>
<p>[2011] <em>Human Planet</em> series showed a young camel being killed by a wolf, but later <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/bbc/11956891/BBC-dragged-into-another-fakery-row-as-it-admits-wild-wolf-featured-on-documentary-was-semi-domesticated.html" target="_blank">it emerged</a> that because the filmmakers couldn’t find a wild wolf, they used a semi-domesticated animal brought to the location on a lead.  </p>
<p>[2013] Doug Allan, a distinguished wildlife cameraman who has worked on many of the BBC’s series, revealed that most sequences involving small mammals <a href="http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/bbc-fakes-wildlife-shots-all-the-time-says-cameraman-doug-allan/news-story/1ae196e92eefd6b7a3aec633d2127e14" target="_blank">were filmed in controlled environments</a>  </p>
<p>Chris Palmer has written two books about the tricks used in wildlife photography, revealing that sweets are used to entrap subjects, and even train bears. Close-ups are routinely shot in zoos or pens at wildlife parks. Fish are shot hatching at research centres, a long way from the ocean. Predators are attracted within range using carcasses. Sharks have been attracted towards cameras by using a fake seal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One fun example of complete nature documentary bullshit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Human Planet</em> in 2011. It emerges that the treehouses the tribe built high above the tropical rainforest back in 2011 <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/tv-radio/bbc-fake-scenes-human-planet-documentary-tribe-living-rainforest-treehouse-a8289251.html" target="_blank">were constructed especially for the cameras</a>, and that the locals don’t bother with anything so ridiculous, preferring to live much closer to the ground. In other words, they built a camera-friendly treehouse (described in the commentary as “their new home”) for a sequence which won the BBC loads of awards for their fearless coverage of an exotic way of life</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know if this is what they use, but for sports, especially gholf, they use what is called a parfocal lens, which mantains constant focus as you zoom in and out an pan around. These lenses, or any telephoto lens, also compress perspective the closer you zoom in, which makes it look like your panning really far</p></div>		</li>

<li>&quot;Dangerous&quot; animals aren't necessarily that dangerous as long as they're not hungry, nor feel threatened (e.g. if you're trespassing on their territory).

Although the guy who's been following it for years put some injection when she became sick. But how she tried to procreate with two different males so that both of them will believe that its theirs (and so they will not try to kill it) was a wonder strategy. Although the baby leopard died because of a snake....</p></div>		</li>

&quot;Unfortunately lizards, snakes and iguanas aren't good at 'takes'.&quot;</p>
<p>However the BBC refute that and say it was real, and shot with two cameras - one on the snakes and one on the iguana with a few close up shots added in later:
