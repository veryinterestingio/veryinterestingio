<p>Planes have been built with square windows for a while, because they were small and weak. They worked fine, so it became habit. As the planes got bigger, they didn't think about it. They would have eventually, as inspections would have picked up the damage, but apparently it didn't take much, and the accident happened first.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Early airlines didn't have pressurised cabins. Take the example of the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junkers_Ju_52" target="_blank">Junkers Ju-52</a> which had square windows. </p>
<p>Pressurised aircraft had only existed since 1937 and there wasn't so much experience with them. The first pressurised cabin passenger plane, the Boeing 307 Stratoliner was not a jet and flew slower/lower.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The rivets were bad, but even still, none of the crashes were caused by the windows, but by an - also square - opening in the ceiling of the hull that was made for tech equipment and communications.</p>
<p>Don't have a source right now, it has been a while and I am on mobile, but yea.</p></div>		</li>
