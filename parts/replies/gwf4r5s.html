<p>Also, the modern terms are CE (common era) and BCE (before common era) because not everyone is Christian.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Only in certain circles. AD and BC are still the most preferred and widely used by the majority.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand this, but originally it was Before Christ on the presumption he was born around 1 AD, correct?</p>
<p>But now we assume his birth to be around 4-6 BC? What new knowledge do we have now that we didn't then when the BC/AD concept was invented?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The AD/BC system was invented by Dionysius Exiguus and the problem is: he never explained how he came up with his own number. He just came up with a number and started using it for his own purposes. His system of years caught on and became popular.</p>
<p>But without knowing how he came up with his number, we can hardly compare it to modern day research.</p>
<p>But generally: We have a far greater collection of historical records over a wider geographical area we can use to correlate and calibrate the dating of mentioned events. It's probably unlikely that a scholar cloistered in some attic worrying about how to date the years of Easter without referencing Romain tyrants was concerned about cross-referencing his own research with anyone else's.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s dumb as shit. The date still marks the life of Christ whether or not you call it ad or ce. The numbering system didn’t change at all, just the naming. Literally the perfect example of a completely hollow gesture.</p></div>		</li>
