			<div class="markdown"><p>To elaborate on this theory: how is ’positive’ behavior encoded for the future generation of bugs? Flight path is not recorded for future use, so when a bug dies from flying in a ’wrong’ direction, every experience dies with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are literally billions and perhaps trillions of small flying insects on the planet at any one time.  In a given species in a given area, they tend to behave largely the same way (because that's how they're programmed, so to speak).  A few however, have somewhat different &quot;code&quot; - just random tweaks and mutations.  Most or all of them die out, so the different code tends to not propagate through the species in successive generations.  Every now and then however, there's a change in the animals or plants they feed on, the environment, or some other thing that impacts the reproductive effectiveness of the bulk of the group.  But the few with different programming might be ideally suited to thrive and reproduce successfully now and they spread their different code.  That's how that works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Being prone to certain types of behavior is genetically encoded. If humans started eating any bugs that came close, the behavioral pattern &quot;When flight-path takes you towards big animal, change directions&quot; would be advantagous for bugs, but as it is, this kind of reaction would just waste energy most of the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, the bad exoperinces die, the good ones live and have off spring with other ones that had good.</p>
<p>It's not a 100% perfect, but more bad die then good, and the genetics of the good become more prominent over generations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then I wonder what the programmer is planning, they always fly at my only closed window and some fly outside, turn around and fly back in - even tho they won't find anything in here and end up sitting on my paper lamp.</p></div>		</li>
