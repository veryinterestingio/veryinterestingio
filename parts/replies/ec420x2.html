			<div class="markdown"><p>Sitting here trying to write the fancy “g” and it just looks like an alien symbol.  Maybe we deduced the same thing in 4th grade and gave up on it?  Fancy “a” is definitely the way to go though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to do my 'a's like that, but when I started volunteering with younger kids I had to switch to the easy read 'a'. When I type for adults with learning difficulties I have to use comic sans as it's a universal easy read font (whoever I send the document to for edits will definitely have the font on their computer).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't do that, but I did start crossing my zeds, sevens, and zeroes, to distinguish them from two, one, and oh, respectively. I try to make my writing as unambiguous as possible, for things like writing down WiFi passwords.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did this once on a restaurant receipt. The waitress claimed later she thought my crossed Zero in the tip line meant I had made a mistake so she created a new tip by recalculating 30%(!) of the total. </p>
<p>When the manager told me this over the phone, I had a cow. </p></div>		</li>
