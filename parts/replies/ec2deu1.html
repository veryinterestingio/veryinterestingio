			<div class="markdown"><p>The more worked an animal is, the tougher the meat. However, the same is true for lean. What you want is slow, lazy animals. Wild turkey legs are like beef jerky straight out of the oven.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>he would be a tough chew, but more flavorful.  its like eating shank. you'd cook it slowly but its really tasty. fatty who watches TV and over eats may be easier to eat, but less flavorful, like filet mignon. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well think of it in terms of a cow. </p>
<p>One that weighs 2000lbs and is obviously roided out,
Would it taste differently then another cow in the same field thatâ€™s normal grain fed and 1200lbs?</p>
<p>Personally I think the fake one would taste more processed and have more wasteful meat.</p></div>		</li>
