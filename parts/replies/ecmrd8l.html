			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand this one much better than the other answers here. Thank you! At some point somebody needs to actually acknowledge that we made up an answer to some question, else it sounds like there’s some other reason why i is the square root of -1 or whatever and us non-math people just can’t see it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is the general process with discovery in maths. You find an apparent paradox or conundrum. You presume that there is an answer to this and assign that assumed answer a name and some rules how to it might act with other stuff (i in this case).
Now check if this might fit with the existing logic. If it does, you just expanded maths. If it doesn't, discard the idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ALSO ”discard” doesn’t necessarily mean straight throw it in the trash, just that it doesn’t fit with the assumptions you’re using at that time. You can always start from other assumptions, and get a different system</p>
<p>You can get some real cool funky stuff this way!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know nothing but the basics about math and have just wandered into this thread but if something doesn't fit is it because it's objectively incorrect or is it just because we have built up a limited interpretation?</p>
<p>Could this mean that there may be some concepts in the universe that we can never fully comprehend because our framework for understanding it doesn't have enough flexibility? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing is, though, that by making this ridiculous statement, it uncovered a whole new branch of mathematics which includes, for example, the mathematical definition of trigonometric functions (prior to this, they only had geometrical definitions). It would basically be like saying &quot;I never use my wiper fluid, so what if I just fill it with orange juice and soda?&quot; but, then, after a few days, you discover that, not only can your car now fly, it also produces a cure for ebola.</p>
<p>Conversely, trying to set x/0 to mean something is the equivalent of filing your gas tank with sand: everyone told you it was a bad idea, you did it anyway, and it turned out to be a bad idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>0 * 0 is 0, but you could do this with any number. </p>
<p>0/0 = 5 because 0 * 5 = 0. </p>
<p>So 0/0 is indeterminate, rather than undefined. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>because if you want to use that reasoning, we could just as easily say 0/0=X for any X, since 0=0*X for all X. the expression 0/0 still doesn't define a unique, definite value.</p>
<p>or try this. if you have no apples and divide them up among no people, how many apples does each person get? it doesn't really have an answer...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are cases in upper level math where we call 0/0 an indeterminate form. Some equations end up being 0/0 after some work is done to it, but you can apply some math tricks (e.g. L'Hôpital's Rule) to show that the equation actually has an actual value. In essence, 0/0 can be a bunch of different things based on the original equation that arrives at it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that this is a bit misleading. The only reason 0/0 'makes sense' as an indeterminate form is because it is used to calculate a limit. &quot;0/0&quot; doesn't actually happen, it's just that we're calculating values REALLY CLOSE to 0/0.</p></div>		</li>
