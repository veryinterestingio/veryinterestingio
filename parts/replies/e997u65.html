<p>In the spring, when we lose an hour of sleep, we see a <strong>24% increase in heart attacks</strong></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading an article or maybe watching a video on this at some point. What it does is actually just delay or advance the heart attacks that would have happened anyways by a few days. Over the week, it's a normal week, and the effects aren't much notably stronger than just general Monday = heartattack correlation iirc</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, I'm 28 and I've had sleep issues since my late teens. Rarely do I get 7 hrs, usually closer to 5-6 and for a period of a few months it was as low as 4 hrs.<br />
My sleep app suggests I average 6 hrs a day over the last 2 months and while I don't feel amazing, I feel perfectly acceptable, if a little tired on average.</p>
<p>I know what you mean, It felt like a... Wall of fog was in my brain between me and things I wanted to remember. I'd literally forget people's names I worked with on a regular basis, and the number of times I'd have mental blanks was quite high.</p>
<p>However, even an average of only an extra hour or so has helped greatly, and there can be other things impacting sleep.</p>
<p>Anyway, I don't think you'll be screwed, however it does slowly sap away your motivation, your ability to perform in all parts of life, and your ability for your body to regulate your emotions.  </p>
<p>So if you feel you have issues sleeping, don't downplay it and accept it, look into getting something done about it, talk to someone. It can be addressed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always had sleep issues as a child. I struggled with insomnia every night for the entirety of my education. </p>
<p>Miraculously, the problems ended pretty much as soon as I moved out and lived by myself in a small town. </p>
<p>All it took was letting myself sick to my own schedule, don't get distracted by others from the household, and live in a place with less light pollution and noise.</p>
<p>I still ended up sleeping around 6 hours every night due to job-related issues, but I still was much more rested than ever before. </p>
<p>When I think how much health and intellectual performance this had cost me, I only hope my kids will have a better chance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, this describes me except I’m 29. I cycle between “good” (6 hrs.) and bad (3.5 hrs.) sleep behavior. October’s average was around 4 hours.</p>
<p>I associate my sleep issues with ADHD (trouble transitioning to bedtime, falling asleep, staying asleep, sleep quality, etc. are all affected).</p>
<p>I’ve always associated the brain fog, emotional dysregulation, forgetfulness, and motivation with the ADHD, too.</p>
<p>Maybe some of those are only indirectly the ADHD. Time for a big, difficult sleep experiment to see how many of my problems could be fixed by more sleep!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same.. for about 5 years + by now.. if i'm not tired i won't go to bed. Why should i? i'd just lie down and wait until i am which takes about as long as just doing something else, more productive, and going when i'm actually tired.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>There's a lot that can affect this. Caffeine after morning, alcohol, the amount of time you spend in front of a computer/phone/tablet/tv screen, disruptive ambient noise, anxiety, racing thoughts, eating late... </p>
<p>All very solvable though.</p></div>		</li>
