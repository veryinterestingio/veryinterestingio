<p>At the moment the evidence we have seems to indicate that this is infinite, it keeps going on forever and ever.</p>

<p>Wait, is this correct? The current scientific consensus is that the universe is infinite in size?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On very large scales we talk about the curvature of the universe. It could be flat, hyperbolic, or elliptical. If it is elliptical, then it is finite, otherwise it is infinite. The curvature has implications for lots of things, but generally only on very large scales (much larger than the scales of galaxies or galaxy clusters) as local effects dominate on small scales.</p>
<p>We'll talk about the curvature as a number, which we'll call k:</p>
<p>If k &lt; 0, the universe is hyperbolic</p>
<p>If k = 0, the universe is flat</p>
<p>If k &gt; 0, the universe is elliptical</p>
<p>Our observations are so far entirely consistent with k = 0. But all measurements in the real world have uncertainty. You might know how tall you are to the nearest centimeter, but probably not to the nearest nanometer. And any deviation from k = 0, no matter how small, would make the universe non-flat in one direction or the other. So if the universe is exactly flat, we will probably never be able to know that with certainty, as we could always ask about the next decimal place. The only way to definitively know the universe is infinite would likely be to confirm that it's actually slightly hyperbolic. </p>
<p>The universe is very close to flat, and I certainly <em>think</em> of it as infinite, but we might never be able to conclusively demonstrate that it is infinite.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the universe was infinite, would that mean that there is infinite matter in it as well? What about the big bang? How do those things work together? How would the big bang have been able to happen if the universe is infinite?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Measurements of the curvature of spacetime so far indicate that the curvature is zero. This would mean that the universe is infinite in size. If the curvature is positive then the universe would be finite in size. Of course there's the problem that a measurement always has some amount of error so we can't really ever be sure that it's not flat and that therefore the universe isn't infinite</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't understand the infinite universe.  The Big Bang happened 13.8bn years ago, right?  We generally know the pace of inflation afterwards to the present, and that inflation is at a &quot;non-infinite&quot; pace, right? So how can the universe then be infinite? When did it become infinite, the day after the Big Bang? A week?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the universe is infinite, then it has been infinite for as long as there have been spatial dimensions.</p>
<p>That's not a problem for the Big Bang - even in a finite universe the Big Bang is something that occurred at all points in space at the same time. So it operates in the same basic way regardless of whether the universe is finite or infinite.</p></div>		</li>
