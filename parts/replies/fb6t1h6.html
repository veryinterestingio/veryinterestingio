<p>Im 40+ years old and finally decided to fly somewhere and was damn sure gonna look out the window at every moment like a child!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a pilot and both of the answers above are the only 2 reasons I've ever given. The pressure, sleep, and thermal issue. The APU on some planes like the crj-200 is really weak and can't power the air conditioning well enough on a hot day. The heat is no problem, but the cooling just can't keep up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed! I fly the CRJ 200/700/900.  The APU is absolutely terrible on the 200.  When it is near 95-100F, there is no way for it to keep up, especially once you fill the plane with people prior to getting the engines running.  We can sometimes put the low pressure air into the galley service door to help get things cooled down quicker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd love to know what they could assess during such a fast-paced emergency. </p>
<p>My gut says, not much. I'm also doubting that they are taking the time to get on eye level ground with the windows and staring at the plane with binoculars to determine what is going on.</p>
<p>(Plus, I'd assume in the majority of cases... the crew has already radioed the situation. If they hadn't, then something has majorly fucked up... so assuming the plane has safely landed in this emergency situation with no contact.... idk, I'd be hesitant to prevent emergency personnel from going in.)</p>
<p>I mean honestly..... what are they going to see that would make a difference?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's a night flight I guess it could be to allow passengers to sleep? Or there's some natural phenomenon outside that could cause passengers to freak out even tho it's completely harmless? Tbh I really don't know on this one</p></div>		</li>
