<p>AC has to start high enough to get enough spin to the equipment that it doesnt just judder back and forth in between the pulses of current.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah electric cars have a DC battery cause you can't store AC. the drivers take this DC power, chop it up to high frequency AC and -usually- spit it back out into 3 phase sinusoidal. Fancy word for saying regular AC that youre used to, only three of those up and down curves laid on top of each other at the same time. Way cheaper to manufacture, way lighter, smaller motors for the same power factor.</p>
<p>But the 3 phase only comes from industry standard, where commercial power feeds buildings just like at your house. Because these motors are only driven by the car's motor drives and never to be connected to commercial power, there's really no need to stop at 3 phase. On paper, any number of phases can be done, so id be curious to see what's actually driving these things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I started doing when I realized that flooring it from a stop hardly affects an electric car's efficiency at all.</p>
<p>Just about every time I get in my Volt I switch it over to sport mode for the zoom zooms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do the same in my leaf and actually realized that with the power mode in my 2012 prius. I could get the best efficiency by limiting braking but as long as I wasn't spinning tires fast acceleration didn't impact my mileage.</p></div>		</li>
