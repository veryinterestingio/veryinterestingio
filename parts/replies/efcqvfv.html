			<div class="markdown"><p>We will never replace the concept of plastic (lets use a better term, consumer polymers. Plastics are a fuzzy lay term for thermoplastic elastomers, a technical term for certain polymers). However we are trying, with some success, to make consumer polymers that mimic the properties of the nondegradable polymers that are widely used today out of degradable or more recyclable feedstocks.</p>
<p>Its an immense technological challenge. The big 3 consumer polymers (polyethylene, polypropylene and PET) have been intensely studied and optimized for decades. They are about as cheap as anything can be, their material properties are very reliable, their production is scaled all the way up, and they are easily obtained from oil.</p>
<p>It takes, frankly, a lot of energy and technology to convert them back into feed stock monomers. More than it takes to just make more from oil.</p>
<p>Cleaning up may take a life time :(. I was in Bali last year and saw so much plastic waste while snorkeling, it was heartbreaking.</p>
<p>We can do it though! The expertise, ingenuity, and technology do or will exist to fix all this, we need more money and willpower.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here is a seed article if you have the time and desire to read more about some light on the horizon. <a href="https://www.popsci.com/bacteria-enzyme-plastic-waste" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.popsci.com/bacteria-enzyme-plastic-waste" target="_blank">https://www.popsci.com/bacteria-enzyme-plastic-waste</a></a></p>
<p>The interesting bit is:</p>
<p>The new studyâ€™s origins are tied to the <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6278/1196" target="_blank">2016 discovery of a bacterium</a> in a Japanese waste dump that had evolved to use PET (polyethylene terephthalate), commonly used in the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/trevornace/2017/07/26/million-plastic-bottles-minute-91-not-recycled/#11eb6ddc292c" target="_blank">1 million soft drink bottles sold every minute</a> around the world, as an energy source. The team of scientists originally began running tests to see how the bacterium, <em>Ideonella sakaiensis</em>,  managed to produce an enzyme capable of degrading PET. Those tests, it  turned out, inadvertantly made the enzyme, PETase, even <em>better</em> at degrading PET. The resulting mutant PETase now takes just a few days to break down PET, compared to the <a href="https://www.des.nh.gov/organization/divisions/water/wmb/coastal/trash/documents/marine_debris.pdf" target="_blank">450 years it takes</a> for the stuff to degrade naturally. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, I saw this when it came out. Great stuff, very impressive. Gotta be careful with stuff like this though, you don't want to have a bacterium so robust that Gatorade bottles start leaking on the shelves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the nature of CO2's bonding would not allow a polymer made purely of CO2 except under exotic conditions like very high pressure. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05593-8" target="_blank">40 gigapascals to be exact.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are numerous research efforts to find replacements, from mycelium from mushrooms to using methane as a feedstock by a company called Mango Materials.  None so far, as I know, are ready for market. Packaging profit margins are small so any increased costs makes it difficult for new products to replace plastic.  Replacements are complicated also because some are ok for some uses, but others may not be -- packaging for food items has to perform differently from packaging for things like electronic goods. As for &quot;reverting&quot;  plastics, they're all hydrocarbon-based polymers and I have not heard of any way to reform existing plastic. Mango Materials does use hydrocarbon feedstock, however, so there are ways to build hydrocarbon-based products that do biodegrade. Regarding strides, lots...from beach cleanups to more and better recycling.  However, so far these are inadequate to deal with the huge amount of plastic that gets into the environment every year.  <strong>--Chris</strong></p></div>		</li>
