<p>This happens about every 75-90 min until your next meal. This is what we commonly call having your stomach &quot;gurgle&quot;. (It is interesting that we often associate this with hunger, when actually it has nothing to do with being hungry).</p>
</blockquote>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've read the sound is your stomach rubbing together. So I assume you hear it more often when your stomach is empty which is why it's associated with being hungry. </p></div>		</li>
