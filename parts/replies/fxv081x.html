			<div class="markdown"><p>Oxygen doesn't degrade it much though. It may oxidize some and get off flavors over time (I assume), but why liquor basically lasts forever even after opening, while wine turns to vinegar and beer turns into a science experiment, is that not even with oxygen can spoiling bacteria grow once it gets to a certain ABV.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The aging process occurs in the cask because the distilled product absorbs and reacts chemically with the charred interior of the barrel. Once the distillate is bottled there’s nothing present for continued reaction and the aging process halts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A barrel breathes, like your lungs. The wood pulls whisky in, and then lets it out. When it goes in, it mixes with wood flavors, which smell a lot like vanilla. When it goes out, it leaves behind heavier oils, smoothing out the flavor. This takes time, but heat is the big factor. So chilly Scotland takes longer, while hot Kentucky is faster. Glass can't breathe like this. It's a &quot;non reactive&quot; container.</p>
<p>Whisky can still change in glass, but typically only for the worse. Light can damage whisky very quickly. It's why whisky was bottled in dark glass for many years. Now people can sell it fast enough and want to show off the color.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Single malt is a blend of only malt scotch whisky from barrels all produced by one distillery. Single cask comes from only one barrel, no blending. Blends contain scotch from multiple distilleries.</p>
<p>For anyone curious as to why both single malt and single cask are produced, the position of a barrel in the warehouse has a big effect on the flavor of the whisky. There are temperature and air flow variations that results in each barrel having a different “angel’s share”, which is the term used for how much liquid evaporates during aging. The whisky in the barrels has a much higher alcohol percentage than what the you buy at the store. </p>
<p>There are really cool programs where you try samples from different barrels and choose your favorite one. They then bottle the barrel and put your name on the bottle as well. They also send you the barrel with a commemorative plaque. You do have to buy every bottle from the barrel so it’s not exactly cheap. It averages 150-200 bottles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why don’t they just leave it in the barrel until they need it? At least that way unused barrels continue to age.</p>
<p>Edit: I mean sell all years. Next year sell it as 8, if there's still not enough demand, keep it and sell it next year as 9. Eventually you'll have an inventory of every age and anything that doesn't sell stays and get added to the older group.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is not necessarily a positive outcome financially. Some of the whiskey evaporates each year it is in the cask, so you get less and less that can normally sell for more and more. However the increase in price does not always follow the decrease in volume.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because it can drastically change the flavor, for one. And if it's a cheap whiskey, odds are more age don't do good things for it. And the other is that you lose more and more from the barrel as it ages. Which is a big reason very aged whiskeys are so expensive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The aging process loses volume, as the alcohol evaporates. </p>
<p>A barrel that starts at 42 gallons, doesnt produce 42 gallons of whiskey after 7 years.  Depending on all sorts of conditions. But age it for 30 years, and it can be as low as 25 gallons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That seems like a lot. Do the alcohol and water diffuse through the wood and evaporate at the same rate? And why doesn't the air that is drawn in oxidize the whiskey? It can't be vacuum in there.</p></div>		</li>
