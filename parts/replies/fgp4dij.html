			<div class="markdown"><p>From someone in the middle of the US, that seems so interesting that your weather doesn't seem to change as much as it does here. It goes from 40c (104f) in the summer down to -18c (-0.5f) in the winter. It can be more or less extreme depending on the year</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And if you go further west, you'll even have days that have a 50 degree (F) swing just from day to night, sometimes more. The biggest ever swing happened in Montana going from -54 to 49F, more than 100 degrees in less than 24 hours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe that, we had some pretty big swings too but I dont know if it was that big. I think it was more of the range of 0f to 70f and then a few days later back to 0f. We usually dont get below -10f</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seas and oceans moderate weather - soil and rock are good insulators - if you measure temprature a few metres down it doesnt change much from middle of summer to middle of winter. Water on the other hand mixes so 20 or 30 metres of it changes temprature, but this in turn means it acts like a sponge soaking up and releasing heat both day/night and summer/winter.</p>
<p>Basically water can buffer much more heat than soil. Phase change of water also buffers a lot of heat (freezing/thawing) which can be an influence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well you have a continental climate where swings are a norm. Especially if you are near a mountain or in a basin. For extreme extremes watch the video about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1noUh2NrLI" target="_blank">Oymiakon</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a similar feeling.  Calling a 55* day in the winter here a &quot;summer day&quot; is insane.  Summer here is 75-100+ and dropping down into the 50s is pretty common.  I wouldn't call a 50* day in the summer a &quot;winter day&quot; like I wouldn't call a 55* day in the winter a &quot;summer day&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah agree completely, OP hypothesis is plain wrong. The day I can go out in short in February then I'll consider it a summer day in winter</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you live in the NE US, that's entirely possible. We've already had a 75f degree day and snow in the same week and we're not even a full well into February.</p>
<p>Hell, it was 18f at 6am and it's currently 45f at 9:45am.</p></div>		</li>
