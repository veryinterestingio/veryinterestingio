			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea flu, well influenza A which is the most common one, is mainly a bird virus. It lives in water fowl and spreads across the world when they migrate. So it's effectively impossible to get rid of with our current technology.  If our behaviors change we may reduce the amount of flu. More hand-washing, staying home when sick, better anti-microbial practices in public spaces, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The seasonal flu strains are human strains, we can eradicate them, but in maybe 10 years some new bird (or swine) strains will probably adapt to become human epidemic. </p>
<p>Moreover severity of influenza is greatly diminished by year to year partial immunity, we should be cautious to not cause a severe pandemic strain because people lacked immunity for 20 years.</p>
<p>Also the B influenza reservoir species is human.</p></div>		</li>

Microorganisms mutate quite rapidly and are often rather hardy. So I would expect them to hang around in some form</p></div>		</li>
