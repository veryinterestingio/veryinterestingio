			<div class="markdown"><p>It's crazy how many hormones and other chemical messengers we have in our body. We commonly only hear about one at a time, testosterone, estrogen etc, etc. The truth is that there are whole systems of hormones, with multiple hormone intermediaries whose sole purpose to to activate another series of hormones/messengers. </p>
<p>It's pretty wild. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can tell why fiber will help lower your cholesterol:  Bile is a digestive juice secreted by the gallbladder into the small intestine during digestion. Bile is an emulsifier, meaning its action allows fat to be able to dissolve in water. (Dishsoap is an emulsifier to grease.) Anyway, bile is made from cholesterol, and does not get excreted, rather, it gets recycled. However, bile has tendency to bind with the roughage of fiber. So a person with a high fiber diet is subsequently excreting a lot a bile, therefore new bile is needed to be produced and is done so by drawing on cholesterol stores in the  blood. Plus if you are eating a ton of fiber you are inherently eating less saturated fats.</p></div>		</li>
