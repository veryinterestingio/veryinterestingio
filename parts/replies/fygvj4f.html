			<div class="markdown"><p>Same. Speaking as someone with my particular mix of asthma and environmental allergies, flowers and perfume are strictly categorized with the &quot;bad&quot; smells and I really can't handle them any better than smoke or rotten stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not asthmatic, but I do the same with smells that I know trigger a migraine. It can be a plant, perfume, or even a particular food. More than once I've been somewhere with my husband and said in a panic, &quot;It smells like a migraine and we need to leave NOW!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yeah.  And I'd rather suffer through a mild asthma attack than a migraine.  I've never had a little migraine.   Thankfully I haven't had one in years, but I remember wanting to die every time I had one just to make it stop.</p>
<p>I know it's not possible to have everyone know ahead of time the entire alphabet soup of conditions that I or anyone else may have, but the smallest bit of consideration makes a huge difference.  I'd rather smell someone's armpit stank than taste Axe body spray in the air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. I’ve gone out to the car while waiting for family members to get my food packed up so I wouldn’t get a migraine after someone got seated nearby who never heard of moderation.  </p>
<p>And fuck servers who douse themselves in cologne. We tip heavily having worked in service industries, and if I have to leave instead of ordering, some other restaurant and server s going to get your tip</p></div>		</li>
