			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always been sceptical of the &quot;everyone has a different fingerprint&quot; claim. Is there a theoretical reason why there couldn't ever be, by coincidence, two people with the same fingerprint? The odds might be 1 in a billion and there'd be a few people sharing fingerprints now that we don't know about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s a bit of a blurry area between “fingerprint” in the sense of the absolute physical arrangement of ridges etc at the tip of a finger, and “fingerprint” in the sense of what a forensic specialist considers.</p>
<p>It’s very, very unlikely (probably never occurred) that any two people share the exact same pattern on their fingertips, but it is far more likely that two people’s fingerprints are close enough that if they were compared forensically (or more accurately that the marks they left behind were compared) a specialist would consider them a match.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After my post I did some googling and found one estimate of about a 1 in 64 billion chance of another person sharing your specific fingerprint, which translates to about a 1 in a billion chance of there being two people with the same fingerprint. I think of course there would be differences at a microscopic level. Probably nothing we can see is ever truely identical. I saw a good point that the majority of people never have their fingerprints recorded in a database. A few countries do it for everyone, but most places only do it for criminals and tourists.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is wrong. The forensic print would be even less likely to be the same as another because the forensic print would take into account other blemishes like scars that are also unique. Also the whole point of using fingerprints in forensics is their uniqueness and if multiple people could have the same fingerprint it wouldn't be used.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In mathematical terms, I'd say that the assumption that &quot;everyone has a different fingerprint&quot; is axiomatic. We assume it without proof as part of the foundation that our system is based upon. Just like two parallel lines never intersect in Euclidian geometry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m pretty sure there have been case where people were falsely convicted because they had the same (or technically close enough for forensics to consider them the same) fingerprints.</p>
<p>If you go to a small enough scale there will always be some difference but in there are people who have practically the same fingerprint.</p></div>		</li>
