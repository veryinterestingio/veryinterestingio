			<div class="markdown"><p>I would add that the quality of the final product will be regularly checked. Usually on a batch by batch basis. While I don't know how this is checked for vaccines, when it comes to regular medicines, this might include checks on the purity of the product. This is sometimes subcontracted to laboratories that have to adhere to Good Laboratory Practice (GLP). To get any type of GxP accreditation, the organisation is required to open themselves up to regular (and sometimes unannounced) inspections by the authorities. These GxP organisations also have their own Quality Assurance groups. If you're interested look up ALCOA+ and you get an idea of what is expected in terms data integrity which is vital to maintain GxP standards.</p></div>		</li>
