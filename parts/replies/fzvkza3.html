			<div class="markdown"><p>I am also Caucasian. And I got really into spicy food from eating with my Asian friends. I spent like a year eating hot sauce everyday. Now I can eat almost anything. A friend of mine got me Carolina Reaper sauce. I drenched some chicken wings in it. I actually thought I might die. But it gave me the rush that suicide wings used to. I love spicy food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is not universal. I love spicy food and have never once had this experience - I honestly used to think people were making it up for jokes. Once it’s past my mouth the capsaicin sensation is gone. (Doesn’t apply to eyes, etc - that still hurts!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a big spicy food guy. The hotter the better. All my friends would ask me this question. They even had a joke about it &quot;how do you know when sublimefan2001 is hungry? His asshole stops bleeding&quot; and I can't relate to it. I've never had a shit like that. I guess some people just digest spicy stuff differently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it’s really a regional thing. The idea of white people not being good with spice is because the lower spice regions tend to be white. You are coming from a pretty spice heavy area, but even just going one state over is a huge change. Crawfish boils in Houston are practically unseasoned to me compared to what I’m used to getting even just in Lake Charles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whites come from Europe, which doesn’t have many native spices, so the traditional cuisines there tend to the bland side (though not so bland as they were before world trade gave Europe access to spices). That's particularly true for northern Europe. In southern Europe, the warmer climate meant food spoiled faster, so spices were adopted more enthusiastically. (The original reason for spicy food was to help disguise the fact that it was somewhat spoiled.)</p>
<p>I’m White, but have always enjoyed experimenting with strong and unusual flavors, and when my family moved to New Mexico when I was a teen, I took readily and enthusiastically to the spicy native cuisine there, and have enjoyed spicy food ever since. Finished up college in Utah and couldn’t stand how bland the food was there.</p></div>		</li>
