			<div class="markdown"><p>The efficiencies vary hugely depending on the cell type, whether you are using selection such as with an antibiotic resistance gene, and the type of change you want to make. If you use something like puro selection and you just want a disruptive indel, the efficiency is very high, but to make a precise true &quot;gene edit&quot; using HDR, efficiency is lower and it's also a challenge to get clonal lines. There are subtle things that are helpful such as certain bases in the guides at certain locations can increase efficiency and specifically. My impression is that we haven't had a big breakthrough on this front though. Even something like base editing, which I think some folks had hoped would have less off-targets, is proving to face the same kinds of issues.  I do like the nickase system for specificity!</p></div>		</li>
