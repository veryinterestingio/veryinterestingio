			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not true. The trials did differ substantively in how they characterized a confirmed infection, who was tested, etc. Those experimental design choices do impact how we interpret efficacy. But of course Pfizer and Moderna both relied on PCR tests in their definitions of a confirmed infection. The differences across these studies are way more subtle than this comment suggests.</p>
<p>One important difference is that AZ required the presence of at least one symptom to count as a confirmed infection. Moderna started tabulating confirmed infections (in estimating efficacy) 14 days after second doses; Pfizer used 7 days. These are the kinds of choices that hinder our ability to compare estimates of efficacy across vaccine candidates. There are others, but use of a PCR test for a confirmed infection is definitely not one.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, PCR tests were not regularly or even randomly administered to folks in any of these trials, including AZ, making it a bit more difficult to determine whether the vaccines had an effect on reducing asymptomatic covid. People in the trials who wanted a test got one.</p>
<p>But none of these differences are really going to make AZ look &quot;worse&quot; than Moderna or Pfizer. M and P both also released a whole lot of extra data as a part of their EUA authorizations that is worth looking at.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really true. Look at the trial design. The 90% efficacy numbers quoted are for the primary endpoints which was preventing <em>symptomatic</em> covid. They relied on people to report symptoms and then come to the centers for testing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should look at the results of Isreal's data on their population. There have been many studies at this point, across multiple countries. There is 0 evidence to the contrary of any study that has taken place. Across all categories: Severity, death, Lack of Symptoms have been reduced by over 90%.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The data are very clear that the vaccines are highly effective and highly safe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are different vaccines. From what I've read, some are made traditionally and some are made via genomics. Is this not one of the first mass trails of a DNA/RNA style of vaccine? </p>
<p>Have we really had the time to study whether or not there are long term effects associated with that sort of procedure? </p>
<p>How do we know that it's really in the intrest of a healthy young person, who covid is unlikely to hurt severely, to take a vaccine developed with new technology when we don't have long term safety studies?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, there aren't any really long term studies on them yet, because, as you say, they are new.</p>
<p>What can tell you is the long term prognosis for people who have had covid-19 isn't known either.</p>
<p>Of the two, I'll take the one that all current studies suggest is very safe over the well documented dangers of covid-19. For those that survive many are facing severe lung and other tissue damage.</p>
<p>If given the option between an mRNA vaccine and a more traditional vaccine, I'll choose the new technology. Not because I'm assuming there is no risk, but because it has a documented higher efficacy at reducing the risk of contracting covid-19. If given no choice, I'll gladly accept whichever is available.</p></div>		</li>
