			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait. I still thoughts that's why we do it?  Why do we do it if it's not to keep the smell and sickness away from us?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe we can also think of it as an evolutionary trait. Those tribes that didn't bury their dead probably died from the bacteria from an exposed decomposing body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Though it's interesting because they've found Neanderthals that put flowers on the deads grave. one large assumption was that they had some form of sacred ritual, but I could still see this being due to hiding scent as well. Interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if that's evolutionarily the case, that's not mutually exclusive with them doing it for an emotional reason. In fact, I'd argue that in many cases, emotions <em>are</em> the signals that our brain sends us to 'make' us enact our biological imperative.</p>
<p>I don't understand this rather common human impulse to paint our own consciousness as a unique gift existing on a higher plane than our bodies, while passing off other animals' obvious displays of pain and complex emotions as the cold deterministic functions of a biological machine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm of the belief that considering ourselves inherently superior to other creatures and tribes is a natural defense to dull the pain of needing to murder them. It counteracts our sense of empathy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even from an evolutionary standpoint, empathy has proven to be a hugely favorable trait in and of itself for various species. Humans are not as unique as they think they are in that aspect. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;We need another and a wiser and perhaps a more mystical concept of animals. Remote from universal nature and living by complicated artifice, man in civilization surveys the creature through the glass of his knowledge and sees thereby a feather magnified and the whole image in distortion. We patronize them for their incompleteness, for their tragic fate for having taken form so far below ourselves. And therein do we err. For the animal shall not be measured by man. In a world older and more complete than ours, they move finished and complete, gifted with the extension of the senses we have lost or never attained, living by voices we shall never hear. They are not brethren, they are not underlings: they are other nations, caught with ourselves in the net of life and time, fellow prisoners of the splendour and travail of the earth.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Elephants are really fascinating. They were also recorded doing moon worship:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Moreover, elephants are aware of natural cycles, as they practice &quot;moon worship,&quot; waving branches at the waxing moon and engaging in ritual bathing when the moon is full (Siegel, 1977c).</p>
