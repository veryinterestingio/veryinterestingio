			<div class="markdown"><p>A few months ago I read about this man: John Hollis didn’t realise he’d been infected with Covid-19. But he later discovered he’s one of the rare people who has developed “super antibodies”. The research claims that you could dilute the antibody in his blood 1 to 10,000 times and it would still kill 90% of the virus. Reading your response, I thought immediately in this man, and how incredible would be if researchers could understand what's the science behind it... What do you think about this specific case? Here is the link to the BBC News video:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Scientists have found &quot;super antibodies&quot; (e.g. broadly cross-reacting, very high affinity antibodies) against several diseases in a handful of individuals, including to HIV and influenza. In some cases (HIV especially -- the very few people who have these antibodies seem to be extremely resistant to HIV infection) these have been known for a long time, and there's been extensive work trying to specifically elicit these in all people. </p>
<p>It's been very hard to get this to work. In some cases, the antibodies seem to depend on the individual having a specific rare allele in their B cell repertoire, and without that rare allele the specific antibodies can't form. </p>
<p>More recently, new techniques for mining antibody repertoire have shown that a surprisingly large number of people may have very low levels of potentially very potent antibodies, and the problem has become how to elicit these antibodies instead of the usual, less-potent ones. (And also, making sure that these potent antibodies aren't also, say, autoimmune or otherwise harmful -- mainly a theoretical concern so far, but no one wants to miss it if it's real).  </p>
<p>Examples of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses:</p>

</ul>
<p>Approaches mainly involve modifying the vaccine antigen in various ways so that the appropriate antibodies are more efficiently made. (This is already done to some extent - e.g. the 2-proline modification of the spike protein in many COVID vaccines drives a much more efficient antibody response than to the natural protein, which is probably one reason the vaccines give better immunity than infection.) For example, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-1118-7" target="_blank">A chimeric hemagglutinin-based universal influenza virus vaccine approach induces broad and long-lasting immunity in a randomized, placebo-controlled phase I trial</a> and many more. </p>
<p>It's very early days for these approaches, but combining protein structure understanding and prediction with antibody repertoire mining is a very interesting and potentially powerful approach to designing much more potent vaccines.</p></div>		</li>
