			<div class="markdown"><p>It is called Impossible Burger. We serve it at work. It doesn't taste like meat at all. If you tasted the burger we serve side by side with the impossible burger it is night and day difference. I can tell the difference from look alone. And the texture is noticeably different.</p>
<p>I like it as an alternative, but it isn't anything like a burger should be.</p></div>		</li>

<p>seems like most people really don't even understand this on a primal level?  </p>
<p>Beef, pork, chicken, and even cheese have a &quot;satisfying&quot; quality to their protein.  It's very distinguishable when I eat them.  Cheese might be cheating here since it has such a low moisture content.</p>
<p>Tofu, and paradoxically eggs, both feel very &quot;light&quot;.  </p>
<p>Fish is in between these two for me.  Somewhat satisfying, but also light.  Chicken and pork are both &quot;lighter&quot; than beef.  Beef feels very heavy, and I don't really eat it unless I feel super hungry.</p>
<p>Black beans feel somewhat heavy as well, even moreso than eggs.  They feel more &quot;meatlike&quot; than eggs, despite being a vegan food.  </p>
<p>What I described is actually not the same as texture, but I think it is somewhat related.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing with tofu is it has a ton of water in it which makes the texture really mushy. If you squeeze the water out of it and freeze it it ends up having a grain/texture that is nearly identical to chicken. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fat content. Eggs and tofu have almost no fat. Fish has a moderate amount of fat. Chicken, pork, and beef are all highest in fat. I wonder if there's a way to incorporate solid fats into seitan dough in laminated sheets or something to nail the texture of marbled fat better? shortening tastes like cardboard and coconut oil tastes like coconuts so neither one is a great choice but margarine is literally a heart attack in a tub because it's so awful for you so idk which fat to use. I'd do it as if it were a croissant dough or something, rolling it and then incorporating fat and then rolling it again. maybe adding some MSG to up the umami flavor.</p></div>		</li>

<p>~5% more calories, 100% more saturated fat, 700% more sodium (this is because it's a processed good and will vary on how you season afterwards.), with 10% less protein.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Meat's advantage and what makes it &quot;healthy&quot; is the fact that it offers a high amount of protein per calorie while still being yummy to eat. Most veggie alternatives simply replace the protein calories with fat and carbs which most people have no problem getting plenty of as it is.</p></div>		</li>
