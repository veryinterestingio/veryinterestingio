			<div class="markdown"><p>There's definitely a bias about which fossil groups are considered popular, and are therefore covered in the media, and which are not. While some groups have legitimately crummy fossil records (sorry jellyfish enthusiasts), many groups are fairly well-represented in the fossil record, especially ones with hard skeletal elements. For an example of this difference in popular coverage of paleo discoveries, check out this amazing <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/amber-fossil-adds-new-dimensions-tale-dinosaur-feathers-180961355/" target="_blank">chunk of amber</a>. It has a section of feathered dinosaur tail and also a complete insect inside of it. The tail headlined all of the stories, but the insect was only rarely mentioned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, we get a lot of insects in amber. A fully intact, near perfectly preserved dinosaur tail covered in feathers, however, is a pretty unique find.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That dino tail was definitely amazing, but it's also true that dinosaurs get more love than other groups. We should get comparatively more insects. They're smaller (which makes them easier to trap in sap) and are absurdly more diverse that vertebrates. But you're argument that this one fossil is uninteresting is based on lumping the whole diverse clade together. I'm not saying we can't play favorites, I prefer my crocs to dinosaurs, but as the initial question shows, when we only report on dinosaurs, it makes it seem like we never find or study anything else.</p></div>		</li>
