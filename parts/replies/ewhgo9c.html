			<div class="markdown"><p>Also many of these companies use shady Temp Staffing agencies, who take care of all the paperwork, ID verification, payroll issues, etc.  I don't know the legality of how &quot;insulated&quot; that makes the factory though.</p>
<p>Sidenote: I used to work with a Mexian immigrant decades ago who used someone elses &quot;papers&quot; for years.  At some point there was a lien or child support garnishment or something where his pay was getting docked a little bit every week.  He just chalked this up to the cost of using someone elses identity.  A few months after the garnishment stopped the actual person reported this guy and he had to leave the country.</p>
<p>He literally paid off some dudes child support (or something else) and then got busted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have follow-up questions:</p>
<p>1) There's some argument down-thread about how important under-the-table cash payment is compared to using duplicated documents.  Just how big is the under-the-table payroll economy?</p>
<p>2) I'd like to know more about duplicated identity documents.  Are most of the documents actually stolen, or are they offered by friends and family, or are they sold by their real owners looking to make a buck?  What does an identity good enough to let you work cost?  What kind of operation usually sets this stuff up?  Friends and family, some guy working out of his living room, criminal gangs, or some under-the-radar part of a legitimate employment business?</p>
<p>Disclaimer: these things are crimes.  I have no intention of doing them, and you shouldn't either: I'm just curious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of small businesses(mom and pop) will pay under the table since they don't make enough to really care. Lots of churches and charities also pay under the table. Construction companies can get around it with &quot;material expenses&quot; to cover it up, or just plain pay the foreman extra and he then pays them cash. A lot of construction subcontractors back in the day would just collect one paycheck, then hand cash to everyone. Pretty similar stuff can happen in other businesses.</p></div>		</li>
