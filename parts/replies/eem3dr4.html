			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if they wouldn't run out of fishing poles, they're doing a lot of useless and unnecessary things, wasting resources in order to keep up with intentionally wasting resources to justify wasting resources. It would be more economical to NOT break the fishing poles, then use the extra labor capacity to do additional useful things such as building and maintaining huts. Then they could sleep safely, even in the rain.</p>
<p>When it boils down, it seems like an argument that you should set your paycheck on fire instead of cashing it in order to boost the economy by incentivizing yourself to do more work to not starve.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This reminds me of the stories I heard of farmers dumping milk during the Great Depression and grain being purchased by the government and stored instead of sold to help the economy (I may be remembering wrong but it was something like that) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't say anything about the specifics of what the US government did during the Great Depression, but that sort of short sighted and local &quot;aid&quot; is very much still a thing.</p>
<p>Any subsidy is an attempt at keeping people occupied with something that, without the subsidy, actually isn't worth doing.</p>
<p>Of course, there's pain involved in transitioning from pre-industrial farming to factory work, and from modern farming to a desk job, but in the end the world as a whole is richer when people spend their working hours efficiently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That isn't exactly a broken window example. There was more to it than that, it was to help stabilize prices for grain. Prices were falling like mad due to dropping demand from the depression and record harvests, so the grain was sold to the government to be stored which helped stabilize prices. In exchange, the farmers got subsidies so they didn't all go bankrupt, stopping the race to the bottom by farmers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love it.</p>
<p>Nobody really gets how mind-breakingly complex supply chains and the economy at large really is. </p>
<p>Barring some sort of perfect super-intelligent AI with near-perfect knowledge of what everyone wants or needs no centrally organized system will ever be able to sustain anything like the economy today. It would be straight back to being agrarian farmers and a 90% reduction in the population.</p></div>		</li>
