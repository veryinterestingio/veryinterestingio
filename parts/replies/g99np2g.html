			<div class="markdown"><p>Happened to me in the early 90s.  I had been to Halloween Horror Nignts at Universal Orlando with a buddy. We left, got in my car (66 mustang) and headed home.  I remember hopping on I-4 and heading toward downtown Orlando, in the passing lane.  Nextthing I remember was realizing I was past Altemonte and almost to Sanford, in the slow lane when I realized I was still driving.</p></div>		</li>
