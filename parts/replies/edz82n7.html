			<div class="markdown"><p>This seems obvious now that you explain it. My friends with thicker heads of hair and curlier hair can't shampoo every day. I have thin hair and it's very straight and even shampooing everyday, it's oily by the end of the day.</p>
<p>People have tried to tell me that I need to stop shampooing everyday because my skin is over producing oil and yeah no. I HAVE gone days without shampooing and I am a disgusting oily creature. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Shampoo Shampoo Skip Shampoo Shampoo Skip Shampoo</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me it varies by strand.  Some strands are huge curls.  Some are tight curls.  Some are mostly straight with weird bends in them.  Some are mostly straight until the end, then it curves like a banking turn in a roller coaster</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup! And I think hair stylists don't really know what to do with it. Wear it long? It breaks because it's so fine. Wear it short? It becomes a horrible, frizzy afro of sorts.</p></div>		</li>
