			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Youtube doesn't care about being fair or reasonable. They care about creating policies that are easy for them and that make them the most money. </p>
<p>Their policies are designed for them, not content creators, nor viewers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, they pick a policy with no grey-area, that they can just throw an algorithm at to catch the majority of material, even if it's fair use.  Then they hire (or subcontract from poor countries) the bare minimum of people to deal with disputes.</p>
<p>They also make sure that the policy has the least chance to result in a lawsuit from the copyright holders.  Uploaders won't have enough money to take them to court over a copyright claim, but big companies like Viacom can take them to court just to waste YouTube's money if the policy doesn't favor them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair copyright law is a notoriously iffy area of the law.</p>
<p>I do think a &quot;fairer&quot; policy could probably be hashed out that is a better all round solution, however any slide in the opposite direction does risk YouTube becoming ground zero for a legal clown fiesta.</p>
<p>I don't think it's a simple fact of them being selfish so much as this is the path of least resistance in an area that has the potential to end YouTube. </p>
<p>It's important to remember that YouTube is still (afaik) a loss leader, or at least has been for a long time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People who upload content have to abide by their rules, people who sue for copyright don’t.  So to avoid billions in potential litigation costs, YouTube has adopted a “the copyright claimant is right until proven otherwise” approach.</p></div>		</li>
