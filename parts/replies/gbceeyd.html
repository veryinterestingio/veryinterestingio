			<div class="markdown"><p>I assume by serum you mean Rh immune globulin.  It will have no effect because the antibodies to D in it disappear with time.  You are not allowed to donate blood for 6 weeks after the end of a pregnancy to allow you to recover and to allow Rh immune globulin to breakdown if you received it.  Right after you received it, and for weeks after, the antibody screen would be positive and the antibody ID would show antibodies to D.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We used RhoGam at my hospital blood bank. It's just a brand of the immune globulin.</p>
<p>For those who have no idea what any of this means, the human body is wild and pregnancy more so.</p>
<p>The fetus is, by definition, a parasite during pregnancy. The mothers body had to jump through serious hoops to accommodate this parasite, including suppressing the immune system. This is perfectly normal in pregnancy and is part of all successful pregnancies. </p>
<p>However, sometimes things happen that the body can't ignore. Antibodies and antigens are part of the body's immune response, right? Well if mom has no <del>antibodies</del> antigens (which is what the - stands for in + or -) and suddenly <del>antibodies</del> antigens start showing up in her bloodstream, the immune system registers an attacker in the body in the form of these red blood cells. Moms immune system will then go to work attacking every instance of this <del>antibody</del> antigen it finds, which includes the fetus. Blood typing is incredibly important; An error in blood bank can be entirely fatal to the patient in minutes. This is why absolutely everything in a blood bank is triple checked at every step, and any error is taken incredibly seriously.</p>
<p>Incorporating RhoGam basically tricks mom's body into not attacking the baby even though, according to her immune system, baby is a dangerous invader.</p>
<p>This is incredibly oversimplified and even possibly a little backwards as I was only on the clerical end of this rather than the technical end and thus have no official training, but blood bank and laboratory do real, actual science like you always imagined scientists to do; mixing reagents in little vials and observing results through a microscope. I hated the busy work of my job, but I loved learning all about the stuff I was supporting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In terms of the recipient's safety? Yes. In practice it will be avoided in women of childbearing age at virtually all costs as the real danger is an Rh- woman with anti-Rh antibodies being pregnant with an Rh+ fetus. The anti-Rh antibodies will cross the placenta and attack the fetal red blood cells and cause serious complications for the baby.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We avoid it whenever possible, especially in people of childbearing potential. BUT there are exceptions to every rule. Mostly that is in cases of massive transfusion. Our inventory of Rh negative blood is much smaller than our inventory of Rh positive blood. So if you, for example, get into a terrible car crash and get your leg chopped off and are taking 50 units of blood an hour (yes they really can bleed this fast, and faster!), it is not sustainable in the inventory to give all Rh neg. And it actually is not that dangerous in those cases - the blood isn't sticking around in your body, it's gushing onto the floor. Once you're stabilized, we would try and switch back to Rh neg. There's still the possibility to form anti-D, but at that point that's our least concern. The patient has to survive first, and then LATER we'll worry about maybe forming anti-D. Better to have an antibody and be alive than to be dead! lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow... I'm learning so much from this thread. Thanks a lot.</p>
<p>Another question. If the person in your example already had anti-d bodies the immune system wouldn't have enough time to act against them right? (what with all the blood coming and leaving just as fast) Would you suppress it after the bleeding is stopped or is there another procedure?</p></div>		</li>
