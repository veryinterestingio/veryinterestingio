<p>You can get a $300 M2 1TB SSD that reads at over 3500 MB/s and writes at over 2000 MB/s (compared to 160MB/s and 90MB/s respectively),</p>

<p>1 TB NVME drives aren't that expensive anymore. I just got one for $150. And yes that's an NVME M.2 not a plain M.2 SATA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah...you're right, I was looking at the more expensive &quot;Pro&quot; series from Samsung which has better endurance per GB/TB and is thusly more expensive.  </p>
<p>I honestly didn't even realize they made a &quot;plain M.2 SATA&quot; version of these drives, I only knew about the NVMEs which is what I used for my comparison :P</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which drive did you get if you don't mind me asking? I just got a 1TB M.2 SATA, because the NVME drives that were near the same price weren't that much faster. To get 2x faster or more seemed like a big jump in price.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing to note, if you look up the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=m.2+ssd" target="_blank">M.2</a> SSDs I'm talking about they are much smaller than SATA SSDs (2.5&quot; form factor) while obtaining equal capacity and much higher speeds. The 2.5&quot; form factor is a standard and looking inside one you will find many things on the PCB that are not storage chips. All these other parts are there to support the SATA data and power interface with the chips along with other features that a microSD doesn't have. You can't simply remove them to make more space.  </p>
<p>I just took apart an old dead 2.5&quot; SSD I have and it has 4 chips, each about the size of a microSSD, with open space for 4 more chips of the same size. If you were to place 1TB chips in every space you would still only reach 8TB before you run out of space. You could make it thicker, perhaps, but then it might not fit inside the 2.5&quot; form factor that many laptops require (though it'd probably still fit in most desktops).  </p>
<p>A quick google search also shows over 2 years ago Samsung had a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/2/20/17031256/worlds-largest-ssd-drive-samsung-30-terabyte-pm1643" target="_blank">30TB SSD prototype</a>, <del>as for why it isn't at market yet (I didn't actually look) could be a number of potential answers that only Samsung would know the full answer to.</del></p></div>		</li>

<p>Remember, the actual drive inside those 2.5&quot; enclosures are often much smaller and the case is simply the form factor.</p>
<p>M.2 are smaller but not as much as you think.</p></div>		</li>
