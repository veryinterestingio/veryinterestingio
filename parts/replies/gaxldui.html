			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. For me it goes hand in hand with our lifestyle. I started working out during the pandemic at home. Started to gain a little weight in the right areas and considering I’ve been skinny most of my life it felt really good. My work has started to pick back up again and I haven’t been able to work out as much considering I’m working 55-60 hours a week now and I haven’t been able to workout. I’m already seeing my mass start to go away and my diet and water intake have both taken serious hits. So now I’m seeing myself as less attractive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That pandemic shut down was a huge eye opener. I can't think of another time that I have felt so physically good until way back before I worked full time.</p>
<p>52-60 hours / week on night shift isn't doing me any favours.</p>
<p>Also realized I don't need much money to live off of and that I am going to LOVE retirement. I can't understand people who need to work. I kept busy, picked up hobbies, worked out, and had the best time with my kids.</p>
<p>It's strange that a global shutdown was an improvement to my normal life.</p></div>		</li>
