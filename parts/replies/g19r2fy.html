			<div class="markdown"><p>I dont have any form of oral herpes but i get mouth sores often. Usually from biting my cheeks or scraping them with a fork or something. Anyway i scraped the roof of my mouth by accident one day and it felt like half my teeth were going to fall out. Its so weird how it didnâ€™t hurt at all on the actual spot but for several days my mouth ached and felt felt like it was on fire sometimes.</p></div>		</li>
