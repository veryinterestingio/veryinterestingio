			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but for the purpose of this question this is how they know how long it should take if all else remains the same. I’m not sure how long it will take for plastic eating microorganisms to become widespread enough to meaningfully change the average time it takes plastic to break down in nature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, maybe not...</p>
<p>&quot;A widely accepted explanation for this peak in coal production is a temporal lag between the evolution of abundant lignin production in woody plants and the subsequent evolution of lignin-degrading Agaricomycetes fungi, resulting in a period when vast amounts of lignin-rich plant material accumulated. Here, we reject this evolutionary lag hypothesis, based on assessment of phylogenomic, geochemical, paleontological, and stratigraphic evidence. Lignin-degrading Agaricomycetes may have been present before the Carboniferous, and lignin degradation was likely never restricted to them and their class II peroxidases, because lignin modification is known to occur via other enzymatic mechanisms in other fungal and bacterial lineages. Furthermore, a large proportion of Carboniferous coal horizons are dominated by unlignified lycopsid periderm with equivalent coal accumulation rates continuing through several transitions between floral dominance by lignin-poor lycopsids and lignin-rich tree ferns and seed plants. Thus, biochemical composition had little relevance to coal accumulation. Throughout the fossil record, evidence of decay is pervasive in all organic matter exposed subaerially during deposition, and high coal accumulation rates have continued to the present wherever environmental conditions permit. Rather than a consequence of a temporal decoupling of evolutionary innovations between fungi and plants, Paleozoic coal abundance was likely the result of a unique combination of everwet tropical conditions and extensive depositional systems during the assembly of Pangea.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m confused on why we would assume that the decay is at a sequential rate versus an exponential rate or something? If we use a year as a model and extrapolate from that, getting a result of 1000 years, isn’t that entirely hypothetical until you got to a more substantial number in comparison to the whole? Like, if I observe an orange rotting over the course of a few months, making my guess as to when it will end anytime in the first hour, day, or even week (without prior experience of an orange rotting) doesn’t make sense to me. The orange might have three weeks before rotting starts, and then rapidly pretty much completely decompose in a matter of 4 or 5 more weeks, less if its in soil. An early calculation will give massively different results- if on day 12, the orange has dehydrated and decomposed .5%, that doesn’t mean it will take 2400 days to decompose. With plastic, is there a way to know we just haven’t hit some decomposition threshold, and in 130 years plastic will start decomposing more rapidly and the process be accomplished after another 200 years? The same thing can go for a log, there are a lot of trees with different chemical makeups and densities, and all sorts of environments said trees die in. Is there something that allows us to assume that the slightest change in plastic chemistry and density will or won’t have an affect on decomposition? I just can’t think of a way to be certain of a calculation on decomposition without having watching the pattern to at least 1/3 of the way to decomposition to see if the time scale is a steady 1% decomposition per year, or has shifted from .01% to 19% and leveled off at 6% per year.... and even then, in my experience of things rotting, sometimes things are just random and take longer/shorter than other similar things to rot. I guess my question is what math is used to extrapolate these long time periods, and why is that math trusted?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine every theory in science has &quot;...prove me wrong&quot; on the end of it. That's how science works.</p>
<p>If we could prove plastic biodegrades much faster than expected there could be a lot of economic impact. If we could make a plastic that biodegrades even faster that'd be a big deal too. People work on that every day.</p>
<p>We &quot;know&quot; plastic takes 1,000 years to decay because that is what we understand of the polymer science involved. A lot of people looked at the research around this, did the experiments themselves, and came up with the same answers. That's why we accept it. We also accept that there <em>might</em> be something we don't know that accelerates the process: if we find that, we'll change what we &quot;know&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We can do our own experiments and record results for evaluation. A simple one is to take different plastic bags or containers. Have some inside, and another set outside with same exposure to sunlight and shade.  Does exposure to different environment (outside vs inside) have a difference in  decay rate?  It most likely would.  The situation thats being presented in life is that the plastic in landfills isnt being exposed to the elements. It gets burried under other debris, and thus taking longer to decay.  This is also why landfills are treated like a sort of time capsule.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They use a wide variety of information such as simulated weathering. Also I highly doubt they are only using a one year period to determine the long term breakdown rate.
I think with the amount of data they have they can give a reasonable extrapolation as to how long it will take. Also no human is going to live long enough to see any individual piece of plastic degrade fully even if their estimate is a couple hundred years off.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Nowhere was this assumption present.</p>
<p>Not an expert in this field, but there are a number of weathering models (neither purely linear or exponential decay) -- I believe the rate is usually taken to be proportional to surface area, although various processes also increase area, and really usually you have a number of simultaneous weathering processes with different rates, although for the long term you can take the dominant one. It's not so simple. </p>
<p>Usually models will have free parameters -- like the weather of course progresses with time but maybe also progresses exponentially with increasing temperature. Those free parameters allow validating the model by accelerated weathering to manageable timescales -- you reduce the weathering time to say 1 month, and then you can test how various parameters (just guessing, maybe water salinity, temperature, turbidity, etc.) make your material breakdown faster or slower. </p>
