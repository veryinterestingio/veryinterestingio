			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not completely true. Labels takes chances on musicians and pay them to make a record, make videos etc. Those are just advances, but if it doesn't end up being a smash hit or the act itself completely bombs they are never going to get that money back.</p>
<p>Secondly, some labels are indeed predatory, especially <del>the</del> major labels, but a lot of labels are run by people who are in it for the music and who don't see the music biz as a get-rich-quick-scheme. Especially in niche markets getting rich is an illusion. And yet there are labels that release albums in runs of 500 copies or even just 100 copies at a time. Really, the people running those labels love the music just as much as you and I do, if not more.</p>
<p>There's one more category that tries to milk the artists for what they can: venues. Once again, not all of them and especially the big ones. There are companies that own many venues all over the world and they'll try to force acts to use only their venues and not those that are run by competitors. (Read this about Ozzy Osbourne and AEG: <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/sharon-ozzy-osbourne-aeg-lawsuit-bite-asshole-729027/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/sharon-ozzy-osbourne-aeg-lawsuit-bite-asshole-729027/" target="_blank">https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/sharon-ozzy-osbourne-aeg-lawsuit-bite-asshole-729027/</a></a>).</p>
<p>Marillion, a British prog band that is completely self-sufficient - their drummer manages the band, the keyboard player runs their own studio, etc.-, once cancelled a show in a large UK venue when the venue <em>demanded a percentage of the revenues of merchandise</em>.</p>
<p>It's true that bands these days have to make money touring. Merchandising is a very important revenue stream as well. Many bands try to generate extra revenues to keep things going like VIP-packages (meet &amp; greets before the show etc.) and selling their own albums (signed, limited editions). For artists in niche markets it really helps to buy things from them directly. As one band recently said:&quot; If you buy direct from our site we make more money/If you buy from Bandcamp we make money/If you buy from iTunes we make less money/If you only stream weâ€™re fucked.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is true in most venues, all the time, to this day.</p>
<p>Consider this: if you wanted to open a clothing store or a music store, you'd have to pay rent on the store, right?  No one would argue with that.  Well if you want to sell clothing (t-shirts, hoodies, whatever) or music within a concert venue, you're basically opening a store there for a few hours.  Why shouldn't you pay rent on that store?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because they already have part of or all of the entrance fees <em>and</em> all of the revenues of food and beverages. But even if you'd want some &quot;rent&quot; then make it a flat fee, not a percentage of the merchandise. Iirc they demanded a whopping 35% of the merchandise. And they wanted 35% of the revenue, but the manufacturing costs were for the band of course...</p></div>		</li>
