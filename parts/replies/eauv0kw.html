			<div class="markdown"><p>MP (induced coma and blitz with tranquilizers and barbiturates, <em>not</em> antivirals) is no longer considered a valid clinical intervention for rabies in humans. it seems that we just got lucky that one time. as it stands current guidelines are supportive care until death. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Itâ€™s important to note that it takes a good amount of time for the rabies virus to transmit from bite to infection. </p>
<p>Everyone who gets <del>bitten</del> exposed should very well get vaccinated.</p>
<p>Edit: below comment makes a good suggestion that exposure can come from many other mechanisms than bites.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not even necessarily bit. Our state's health department insisted we get vaccinated as we woke up to a bat flying through our room that was never caught. In addition to the concern of painless bites that could occur, a bat sneeze was another method of transmission they were concerned about. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct about the inability to swallow. It also causes hypersalivation, but it does also include literal fear of water.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That link clarifies &quot;hydrophobia&quot; means fear of water, however it does not describe that any further.  If you read the citation I provide it clarifies that we call it hydrophobia because they develop an inability to and subsequently don't (or have a fear of) swallowing.</p>
<p>Hydrophobia is not in this case a literal fear of water like arachnophobia is of spiders.  You couldn't chase a rabies patient off with a glass of water for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my epidemiology class, I saw a video of a man with rabies, physically cowering away from a glass of water the doctors were trying to give him. It was along time ago, and I can't source it properly right now though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen videos of rabies patients recoiling in fear when asked to drink water. It does cause fear of water, because every time someone with rabies tries to drink they get extremely painful muscle spasms in their throat. There <em>is</em> a reason it's called hydrophobia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It says in that link that &quot;As the disease progresses, more specific symptoms appear and may include insomnia, anxiety, confusion, slight or partial paralysis, excitation, hallucinations, agitation, hypersalivation (increase in saliva), difficulty swallowing, and hydrophobia (fear of water)&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Foaming at the mouth however is not always caused by rabies. </p>
<p>For example ruminants, especially cattle, are prone to have a foam or frothiness around their mouth because of high levels of bicarbonate in their saliva. </p></div>		</li>
