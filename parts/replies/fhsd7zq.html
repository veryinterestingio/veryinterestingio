			<div class="markdown"><p>Slightly unrelated LPT: Same principle applies for the detergent you put in your washer, so if your washer stinks it's because you're using too much soap in relation to how much water your washer uses. If you're using too much detergent, the washer has no chance to rinse it all out, and the soap will build up and stick to the outer tub (and stay in your clothing), and there's your stench. It's basically soap-encapsulated dirt and bacteria.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Use less detergent and use the extra rinse/water plus functions if your washer has them. Also use a washing machine cleaner (Affresh is a good one) every couple of months. </p>
<p>And no, absolutely do not put Dawn dish soap in your washing machine.</p>
<p>EDIT: If your washer has a Clean Cycle, USE IT. What it does is it spins at a semi-high RPM with water in it (unlike a regular wash cycle where a washer spins to get the water out of the clothing). This loosens up built-up soap better than just running the washer empty on a hot water wash cycle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Slightly unrelated LPT: isopropanol (rubbing alcohol) also needs water to work. 70% is a more effective sanitizer than 99% (the water helps the alcohol penetrate cell walls and slows evaporation).</p>
<p>99% is really only for dissolving stuff, like the resin in your bong, or in chemical reactions where you need as little water as possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>you should also leave your washer open after you are done using it... let it dry out completely so no water loving bacteria can get a foothold. (that old rag smell)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah you dont need cleaner every month, perhaps once a year. Simply run the laundry machine empty with the hottest program available. Warm water makes it easier for stuff to dissolve in said water. (Try this with your tea next time, put as much sugar into almost boiling water as possible. Then sieve out the leftover sugar and chill it, voila you got crystalized sugar again).</p>
<p>Also remember to air your laundry machine. You always close the door after a load of laundry is done? DON'T. Fungi love humid and warm environments. Keep it open so the humidity can escape making possible fungi and bacteria die</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It all depends on how much use your washer sees, and how good you've been with your detergent measurements. I recommend every 2-3 months, because the one thing I can guarantee is that running it more often than not won't hurt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Soap doesn't wrap up anything.  Water is &quot;sticky&quot; (cohesive and adhesive bonds).  Soap is a surfactant: it makes water less sticky.  So that way, any germs on the surface get washed away without sticking.</p>
<p>Antibacterial soap may also have properties that break down cell membranes, effectively popping germs like a balloon.</p>
<p>I know of no soap that operates by wrapping anything up.</p></div>		</li>
