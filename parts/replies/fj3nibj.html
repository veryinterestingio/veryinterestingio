			<div class="markdown"><p>With an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number" target="_blank">R0</a> comparable to or a bit higher than flu, it's only a matter of time before the Covid-19 virus is everywhere. And by time I mean a couple weeks. We'll eventually get a vaccine, though it takes like 6-12 months for development and testing. Until then, it'll be like a really bad flu season. I've read some of my epidemiologist colleagues (I'm a microbiologist) estimate that eventually 40-70% of the world's population will get infected. </p>
<p>I can't speak to how governments or economies will respond, but
I imagine there will be a period of time where people will be asked to practice some form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distancing" target="_blank">social distancing</a>. The [2011 film Contagion](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contagion_(2011_film" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contagion_(2011_film</a>) was a pretty realistic take on pandemics, though the virus in the film was much more deadly than nCoV. </p>
<p>Further out, it's hard to say. It depends on how long natural immunity lasts, how effective the vaccine is, and how well the vaccine can be distributed. It's possible that nCoV is here to stay, joining the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus#Human_coronaviruses" target="_blank">other coronaviruses that already cause the common cold</a>. I can see a Covid-19 vaccine eventually becoming a permanent recommendation for people most at risk of severe disease (the elderly and people with some types of pre-existing health issues).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the answer. Why do you think COVID-19 has killed more people than SARS and MERS combined, even though its not nearly as deadly as other coronaviruses including SARS and MERS (case fatality rate is around 2% for COVID-19, 10% for SARS and 34% for MERS)?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do you have any additional details on this?</p></div>		</li>
