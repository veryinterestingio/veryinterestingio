<p>Favorite element: Sodium, for a really personal reason. Of course, sodium explodes violently with waterâ€”but when we mix it with a lethal gas (chlorine), we get table salt (NaCl). This is nothing new--but one of the early NOVA shoots on &quot;Hunting the Elements&quot; involved visiting author Theo Gray, who actually DEMONSTRATED the explosion (and the table-salt making) on camera. It was one of the first times I witnessed the point of a NOVA script illustrated right in front of my face, and I've never forgotten it!</p></div>		</li>

Table salt is like water- an incredibly benign molecule made from 2 dangerous elements!
I guess my answer (to my pretty dumb question) would be carbon- it gives us diamonds &amp; graphene!</p></div>		</li>
