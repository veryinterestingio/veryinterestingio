			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to finish your last point. When you have a treatment that works and you want to test a new drug you never test it against placebo, unless is a mild disease like a headache, you can only test it against the working treatment. Also if during the study the difference between the treatments are too big you need to stop the study. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This reads precisely like a Kurzgesagt script, to the very last syllable. I'd be willing to believe you write for their show, it's that similar. The way they present a fact, follow-up with the problems facing the situation, and then explain why people may react a certain way to all of this is spot on. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both great sources to model your information sharing vernacular on. They're some of my favorite channels, because they convey information in an accurate, effective manner while also having almost poetic writing styles, and lovely narration.</p>
<p>There's really no better way to teach than that. </p></div>		</li>
