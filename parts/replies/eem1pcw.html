			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! This is what I was thinking. They bring it up in Tom Selleck’s Blue Bloods. It’s really about being visible and becoming a part of the community and less about catching people for small crimes. Where windows are broken, there is usually higher crime rates. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm sure cleaning up areas deters some crime but it's not what turned crime around to the extent that occurred in the 90s.</p>

If you let the spawn and surrounding areas get destroyed even slightly by griefing, then people suddenly get the impression that stealing stuff and knocking people's houses down is okay. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea I think Giuliani pushed this theory</p>
<p>I use it in my own day to day life though. If your apartment is dirty and your sink is full of dishes and there’s dirty clothes it contributes to your mood and your evaluation of self worth. If your surroundings look like shit you’ll feel like shit</p>
<p>So when I’m feeling down I try to make sure my environment doesn’t contribute to that any further. I clean up and replace any “broken windows”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your example at home is how it affects feelings but the theory talks more on how it affects behavior. So by having a sink full of dishes, what's one more dish to add to the pile? Clothes on the floor? Who cares if one adds more? That's what the social theory is about. If you see destruction, you're more likely to contribute to the destruction. </p>
<p>The theory really states that, by seeing broken window(s), people assume authority must not be present and therefore they can do what they want. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Giuliani was just in the right place at the right time, great theory though and it makes a place look nice. Heck it might deter some crime- like the way they dealt with petty crime such as graffiti and subway fare jumpers for instance but the whole country saw a very dramatic drop in crime in the 90s</p>
<p>which is now attributed to lead pollution being curtailed: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2013/01/03/how-lead-caused-americas-violent-crime-epidemic/" target="_blank">https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2013/01/03/how-lead-caused-americas-violent-crime-epidemic/</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. This is why NYC cleans graffiti off subways during the day- so that people don’t see graffiti and add to it. The theory is that if something looks like shit, your threshold for doing something that makes it shittier is lowered. Like throwing a brick at a house that already has several broken windows from people throwing bricks at it.</p>
<p>In this context, it makes sense: keep the public norm high so that expectations for people’s actions aren’t lowered.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it also crossed over into zero-tolerance style policing, which has its problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct take. The theory is completely valid. You're way more likely to litter if the street is already full of trash. You're more likely to commit a minor crime if you see minor crimes constantly going unpunished. And that leads to a scale up in major crimes as well. </p>
<p>Stopping minor crimes is important. But in practice, it's taken too far at times with policies like stop and frisk which are extremely counter productive. </p></div>		</li>
