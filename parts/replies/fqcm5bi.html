			<div class="markdown"><p>Does anyone actually click on ads anymore?  It was VERY rare if I ever did, and now, I don't even notice them.   It is extremely frustrating to have to scroll way down to get to the recipe.   What I do is find the recipe page on my laptop first, then copy the text into a gmail that I just save as a draft.  When I am in my kitchen, I just open my gmail.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It isn’t the story. It’s the fact the story is first. And this is why. </p>
<p>It’s why I typically go to “real” food company sites instead of mom bloggers for recipes. No stories.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people are saying it's just Ad related but another very important factor for SEO is bounce rates. If you go to a site &amp; leave within 15 Seconds, to go back to your results that's a signal to the search engine that you went to the page &amp; didn't find what you were looking for, forcing you to stay &amp; scroll tells the search engine you found the content relevant &amp; interesting.</p></div>		</li>
