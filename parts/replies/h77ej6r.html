			<div class="markdown"><p>A really fine balancing game of keeping people happy and things convenient and keeping people afraid of you. Making it where life is good enough for them that they don't see it as worth rebelling against a person that they are afraid of... If you are too hard on them they will fight back regardless of the risk. If you are too easy on them then they likely aren't afraid of you and will push for more and more. Like you have to show leniency a decent amount of the time, but still make an example on occasion, and when you do make an example you have to be absolutely ruthless.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not super knowledgable on this though so I could be off the mark a bit.</p></div>		</li>
