			<div class="markdown"><p>For purposes of this question, it's best to visualize them as wavefunctions, as is done in non-relativistic QM. Particles being &quot;ripples in fields&quot; is a simplified version of how they'd be described in quantum field theory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Layman here: When you say wavefunction, I think of a mathematical function (probabilities where the particle might be)? But it doesn't say much what the particles <strong>are</strong>, it's like describing where you are on a map using gps coordinates, in no way does this tell me anything what you're actually like. Does it simply not make sense to ask what a subatomic particle is like?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. This is the current view of subatomic physics.  The actual definition of a “particle” becomes very technical as you study more, some physicists prefer to dispense with the term particle altogether and believe it is misleading.  Suffice it to say, “particles” are excitation in fields, which behave like waves</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find it useful to think of an electron orbiting a nucleus as a &quot;cloud&quot; where there is a electron somewhere in the &quot;cloud&quot;. It's not just difficult but literally mathematically impossible to know exactly where the electron is within the cloud. So the &quot;cloud&quot; in this metaphor doesn't represent many very tiny particles like a rain cloud but rather it represents an uncertainty or shadow of what we can't know about an electron's location and velocity. The wave function is just the math that helps us know the <em>likelihood</em> of the particle being in a particular location. A plot of the wave function has ripples in it and the peaks of the ripples are locations where the particle is more likely to be. The dips are locations it's less likely to be.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm fond of the metaphor but the way you've described it here bugs me a little. It's not just that we &quot;don't know&quot; where the electron is, it's that while the electron is in a &quot;cloud state&quot; it's not really anywhere (and yet, it's kinda sorta everywhere at once). It's truly a different form of existence that we lack the vocabulary and experience to adequately describe.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I am aware of the unpredictable nature of electrons, which is why I asked if it applied to the nucleus too. Assuming an atom is a so-so approximate sphere, would the nucleus exist exactly at the centre of the sphere or is it in the corner? You can calculate the probability of an electron's position by squaring it's wavefunction and integrating wrt to position. I was curious about the probability density of the nucleus's location, and is it highest at the centre or at another location? Does the unpredictable nature of electrons apply to the nucleus too? If so, can one determine the probability density of the location of a nucleus via the Schrödinger Equation? If so, is there a graph representing this probability density of the location of a nucleus? Hope I've made my question clearer :)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, it's true of any quantum system.</p>

<p>It's localized near the center.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Yes, in principle, but that would be a difficult calculation for multi-electron atoms.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a very hard question in general, because unlike the atomic model for electrons where the electron orbitals arise from solving the SE with couloumbs potential, the potential inside the nucleus is not very well understood. The nucleus is made of neutrons and protons which are in a potential these again have energy levels by solving the potential which is approximated between the square model and a harmonic oscillator (see nuclear shell model). These potential is assumed to arise due to collective interaction of all neutrons and protons (called nucleons) hence the neutrons and protons are in shells similar to electrons. Furthermore, the moment of nucleus has quadrupole moment which suggest the nucleus isnt exactly spherical and it fluctuates (see collective model). Therefore to overall answer your questions the nucleons inside the nucleus are in orbitals like electrons in quantum mechanics. However the nucleus is so massive compared to electrons it is assumed to be a single central point</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now that I come to think of it, what prevents an electron colliding with the nucleus and assimilating with a proton to make another neutron?

			<div class="markdown"><p>The stationary solutions to the Schrodinger equation corresponding to bound states are wavefunctions where the electrons don't have definite positions or momenta, but the atom as a whole has a definite energy.</p>
<p>These wavefunctions have a spatial extent on the order of Angstroms, while the size of the nucleus is on the order of femtometers (5 orders of magnitude smaller).</p>
<p>That being said, the electron wavefunctions (mainly for s-orbitals) are nonzero inside the nucleus. So you can take that to mean that if you measured the position of the electron, there's nonzero probability that you'd detect it inside the nucleus.</p>
<p>There is actually a kind of nuclear decay called electron capture where an electron does exactly what you describe. It combines with a proton to make a neutron.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I always forget about that particle/wave function duality. Recently came across the question “well what about same wavelength photons colliding, would they annihilate?”, on which the answer was no, because they are wave functions, so they’ll continue as if nothing crossed their path, except for that one point in space of colliding wave functions you wouldn’t be able to witness the photon’s presence. After reading it it made so much sense that a wave doesn’t disappear after colliding with it’s own “anti-wave”, it wouldn’t care and simply carry on as if it didn’t come across anything. </p>
<p>So if I understand your explanation correctly, the reason why they do not usually collide the way I imagine them that they could, is because electrons should be considered excitations in the electron field and therefore could just pass through the nucleus without annihilating with the proton without much trouble? </p>
<p>How can one interpret electron capture decay? Because if there is a nonzero probability of observing the position of the electron in the nucleus, I’d imagine that with the amount of atoms matter requires to build up anything physically significant, that there would be numerous electrons passing through the nucleus at every moment. But matter isn’t decaying through electron capture like mad. </p>
<p>So what’s the difference between electrons just passing through the nucleus, no big deal, and the electron annihilating with the proton?</p></div>		</li>
