			<div class="markdown"><p>Lock washers don't really make it much larger, a standard washer does. Lock washers have a spring like design to them that applies pressure to the threads &quot;locking them&quot;. Typically if we use lock washers we also use a standard washer beneath it.</p>
<p>Also, washers don't do squat for corrosion. It's the material they're made from that's corrosion resistant (zinc/galvanized/stainless).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah in my experience they suck, and don't do squat. I hate lock nuts also since most of the compounds suck and tear out. I just use em, don't study em.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Washers do help for corrosion, galvanic corrosion.    </p>
<p>So if you use a steel bolt in an aluminum structure, you put a washer down so that any galvanic corrosion that occurs does so between the structure and the washer, not the structure and the bolt.</p></div>		</li>
