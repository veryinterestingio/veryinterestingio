			<div class="markdown"><p>I always thought it was from how the grit vibrated the tire rubber which would vibrate the wheels, then Axel's etc. In San Diego, they have ribbed highways that have miniature road bumps to make a sound at a rythym when you drive over them under the idea that till make you more awake</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The bumps likely block an escape route for the air, causing s different quantity to be trapped. For example, there are bumps in roads in many places that will play a song as various sets of bumps are different sizes, producing different notes.</p>
<p>This is half-speculation on my part so take it with a bit of salt and if anyone here is actually qualified to give the correct information feel free to set me straight!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also live in San Diego. I think what /u/heavenpiercingdrill is referring to are called <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumble_strip" target="_blank">rumble strips</a> along the either side of the road (I’ve also seen them across the full width of the road in certain situations).</p>
<p>They are intended to make a loud noise to wake you up or otherwise get your attention.</p>
<p>Edit to add: I think it was Honda that tried to use these types of grooves to make a “musical road” but failed. Here’s a video about it: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ef93WmlEho0" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/Ef93WmlEho0</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also cars are built to fight/dampen specific resonant frequencies, which is why different cars sound different on the same surfaces. It’s more noticeable in higher end cars where more R&amp;D goes into eliminating a larger range of resonant frequencies. This is done from the materials used, the method of mounting items together, installation of noise/vibration dampers or absorbers, types of noise insulation/fill, bushing types etc etc.</p>
<p>Nowadays some cars even use the stereo system to monitor noises in your cabin and then produce a noise cancelling sound to eliminate or reduce your ability to hear that specific noise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Also there are premium tyres which are specifically designed to reduce road noise. For example my Michelin primacy 4s barely make any noise compared to my old sports tyres.</p></div>		</li>
