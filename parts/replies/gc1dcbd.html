			<div class="markdown"><p>I can relate to this. I'm a voice actor, and I once had a laughing fit with a scene I was recording. I even have a semi-serious trick I use in these kinds of situations to stop laughing immediately, but it didn't work, and I started laughing even more every time I looked at the screen. I was laughing for several minutes in the recording booth, while the director and the sound engineer looked at me and couldn't help but laugh as well. Just like you've said, it eventually stopped being funny, but I needed to take a lot of deep breaths and drink a fair bit of water just to get serious again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that's what I was thinking, not only would it stop being funny but continued laughter really strains the muscles around the mouth. even smiling for a good 5 minutes is terribly exhausting.</p></div>		</li>
