			<div class="markdown"><p>(sampleSize==1 disclaimer applies)  I went to one auto dealership, financed a car purchase, and ended up with <em>four</em> hard inquiries on my record that went away two years later.</p>
<p>Edit: According to Credit Karma, my 'hard inquiries' went from the '1-4' range before I bought my car to the '5-9' range right after I bought it (with all 4 car-purchase-related inquiries noted), AND it was noted as a reason why my credit score went down slightly after I bought the car.  Two years later, those inquiries all came off my report, I dropped from '5-9' down to '1-4,' and CK noted that as a reason my credit score went up slightly (again, sampleSize==1).  I wonder if that was CreditKarma just guessing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dealers run your info to many banks. Some sketchy ones will run like 8 then offer you one of the shitter ones and see how you react to 8% financing cause they make more money if you take that. Then if you go no thanks they try to convince you it's due to x reason then if your still hesistant they will go say they will work on it. Come back at 6% and you take it. They could of gotten an offer of 3% on the lowest bank and 15% on the highest</p>
<p>A good dealer will just give you the best rate out of the 4 options they sent. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a dealership do it 9 times to me. As far as I understand it, all similar inquiries in the past 30 days count as one as far as getting a car loan goes so you're allowed to shop for rates. It was really a PITA because I ordered my truck I had them run my credit to make sure I'd qualify for financing, which I did. So they ordered it and by the time the truck was ready 3 months later my score had fallen because of all the inquiries. I ended up having to put a larger down payment and taking a higher interest rate because of it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>INAL... but... That sounds like a scam to me. Not sure who you should talk to about that or if it's even worth it now.</p>
<p>Also, always talk to your bank about getting a car loan. I was qualified for rate that was 0.25% less than what the dealer was offering me. I didn't take it because I planned on paying it off within three years and I was so late in the process when I checked that I just wanted to be done. BUT... when I got my first payment, I found out they sold my loan to my bank anyways...  So I'm paying an extra .25% because I was too lazy to fix it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No! A new credit only affects your credit rating for a short period of time.</p>
<p>Of course the debt stays on your credit file. But assuming you pay everything in time, your score bounces right back. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>772 score here and this is the correct answer. Inquiries are hardly something to worry about unless you have like 30 of them then it raises red flags to lenders that you are trying to commit fraud. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Inquiries stay on your report for two years, then drop off. Plus you are allowed one or two (can't remember exactly) for &quot;free&quot; with no effect on your credit. OP's explanation is correct. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a credit card I paid off and cancelled 10 years ago. It was a mistake I had it maxed out and they cut me off. After paying it off, they continue to report every month that I owe them 0$ but because of this my bad mark is still there. I was denied a car loan because of this.</p>
<p>So just dont trust that everyone will things they way they should. I called them about it but as I no longer had an account, Mastercard wouldn't speak to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not really true. If you're credit is pulled from the same exact place multiple times in a day it will be combined to 1 inquiry. If your credit is pulled at multiple different places, each one will be recorded as a hard pull to the credit and negatively effect your score. The reason being is, credit rating agencies don't like to see you take out multiple debts at once (look up pyramiding) and when your credit is pulled that much in a short period of time, they consider that a possibility.</p></div>		</li>
