			<div class="markdown"><p>because gaming equipment are usually marked up at a premium, moreover a gaming monitor has much more tech inside of it like motion blur and ghosting reduction, not to mention whatever g sync or freesync module u have</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lot of factors: what kind of panel the monitor uses (IPS/VA/TN), how hard it is to produce a high refresh rate display, and how many units they expect to sell (4k TVs sell like hot cakes compared to gaming monitors). Monitors also typically have much less input lag. If you've ever tried to play a game on KB+M on a TV, you'd likely notice a significant delay compared to monitors. Not so noticeable on consoles and controllers with their deadzones and dampened input, but much more noticeable with a mouse's direct inputs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Input lag and because they can. </p>
<p>I own a high end OLED LG and a great 1440p Monitor. </p>
<p>While having basically no input lag and high framerates on the monitor are great, colors are absolutely shit compared to the OLED. I hate PC HDR and desperately long for it to be at least as good as on consoles. </p>
<p>Image quality is also much worse on 1440p and you are sitting closer to a monitor. </p>
<p>I hope good OLED 4k monitors will appear now that the new hdmi and DP standards can do 4k with higher refresh rates to combine the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>And for you guys saying just plug your PC in your TV - no! It doable but the HDR is still shit on PC and I also want to work and play high framerates with it so it is really inconvenient / not really great to connect it to the TV</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OLED monitors won't really happen as the technology is already being superseded (by mini-LED, for an example), and OLEDs have other issues that make them unsuitable for anything other than phone screens and TVs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If OLED will be superseded (in the TV and smart phone area) or not is an interesting question. Mini-LEDs will make our current LEDs obsolete once the price drops enough but from all I have read and my understanding (and its quite easy to understand how it works...), I assume mini LEDs will be the budget version for the future. So yes, might be that monitors will go that route. </p>
<p>What could replace OLED in the high-end TV / Smartphone area is of course the micro LED technology but there is pretty big question mark here. The biggest strengths of micro-LED is that there is no burn-ins and that they might potentially last much longer than OLED. However, who keeps high-end TVs and smartphones for more than 6-7 years? And, OLED technology will not stay the same as it is now going forward. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>My prediction would be Mini-LED for cheaper stuff and an OLED successors with similar technology will keep the high end sector but lets see.</p></div>		</li>
