			<div class="markdown"><p>It's based on the focal length of the lens and the size of the camera's sensor.</p>
<p>Cell phones typically have lens/sensor combination that produces a fairly wide angle of view, so the moon is a very small part of the total image.</p>
<p>'Pro' cameras have a much more flexibility and could  have a lens/sensor combo that effectively magnifies a smaller part of the sky so the moon appears larger because everything appears larger - like looking thru binoculars.</p>
<p>Your eyes are between these two extremes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Slight correction. </p>
<p>It is based on the focal length of your lens <em>and the distance between you and the subject the moon is rising behind</em>. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.photopills.com/articles/7-tips-make-next-supermoon-shine-your-photos#step1" target="_blank">More info here</a></p>
<p>The relevant part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most people believe that the size of the moon relative to the size of a subject (construction, tree, rock) is determined by focal length. But the truth is that focal length has nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>As I explained in the first section of this post, focal length determines how big the moon will appear in the photo compared to the frame (field of view). But, it is the distance between the shooting spot and your subject that determines how big the moon will appear to be in relation with the subject. This is due to the angular diameter of the moon.</p>
<p>Therefore, depending on the image that you have in mind, youâ€™ll need to choose a shooting spot that is at the distance that gives you the desired size of the moon compared with your subject.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is of course talking about photos where the moon looks giant behind some subject. If you are simply taking a picture of the moon in the sky then ya it is just a matter of what your field of view is.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Notice how the background trees look really close at 200mm, and really far away at 16mm. This is the same effect at play with moon photos.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That being said, the primary difference is not the focal length of the lenses in use, it's the human optical hardware. We're hard-wired to zoom out perspective in on things near the horizon. This is why you see a boat off on the horizon and try to take a picture of it and get a little dot. It's the reason that you see this massive sun come up over the horizon (or set) but then take a picture of it and you get a normal sized sun.</p>
<p>The standard test is to take a quarter and hold it at arm's length. You can do this next to a huge harvest moon on the horizon or the same moon when it's tiny directly above, and you'll see that they're objectively the same size as the quarter in both cases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, plus when the moon is near the horizon, you're seeing it near distant buildings, trees, hills, etc. and it can be seen to dwarf those large but far-off things.</p>
<p>When it's high above your head, you're seeing it in isolation, there's no point of reference to tell your brain &quot;this is a large object&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially if you use a telephoto lens and stand back from the foreground, the moon appears bigger. The further you stand back and the longer focal length (let's call it zoom) , the bigger the moon appears compared with the same framing using a wider focal length.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this because when you zoom in the earthbound reference objects like trees or buildings get magnified since you're zooming significantly closer to them while barely making any change in your relative distance to the moon?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. Zooming in isn't like getting closer, it's more like cutting out and magnifying the center part of the picture.</p>
<p>If you were moving closer by just moving yourself bodily, the moon wouldn't really change size. The distance you moved between you and the moon is trivial. The features on the ground that are closer, though, those would get bigger because the distance you're covering is significant in regard to those closer objects. So, you'd have a bigger tree, same-size moon.</p>
<p>If you take a picture of the moon and crop out the middle bit, then scale the picture up to the original size, the stuff on the ground looks like you got closer-- nothing odd there, since stuff gets bigger when you're closer-- but the moon looks larger in the frame. Bigger tree <em>and</em> bigger moon. This makes it look like the moon physically increased in size, because the moon doesn't normally get bigger when you get (trivially) closer.</p></div>		</li>
