			<div class="markdown"><p>For another example of energy recovery for OP, I work in grocery store design.  The coolers and freezers in the store are all linked together in a couple giant systems of compressors and rooftop cooling units - it's basically a giant air conditioning system to move heat from the air inside the display cases to the exterior of the building.  After the coolant is used to absorb heat from the coolers and freezers, it gets pumped up to the cooling units on the roof to dissipate that heat... but on its way there it flows through a heat exchanger.  The exchanger captures some of that waste heat and uses it to pre-heat water flowing to the store's water heaters (so they don't have to burn as much fuel) and simultaneously heat the entire warehouse during the winter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Recovering heat yes, but many of those devices are assuming a system is in place for that heat to go inside the system.  However in this example it seems like op is asking why can't we repurpose the energy, as what you are suggesting would repurpose the heat.</p></div>		</li>
