<p>To be fair, historically Dupont is exactly the kind of company that can do the kind of shit that falls into this category.... So people having them in this case is kind of expected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And what's funny is people then by non-cured bacon that actually contains more nitrates and is actually cured, just using celery salt vs a &quot;chemical&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but we're not sure 100% if it's truly the nitrites in the curing salt used or if it's just the high sodium level in general (since diets very high in sodium regardless of source are associated with an increase in stomach/intestinal cancer), or if it's a diet high in sodium and low in something else that may help reduce sodium's impact. Fiber probably plays a big role in deciding how much &quot;damage&quot; is done, since it both simply dilutes the slush of digested food, and slows the exposure of the intestines to the digesting food as it pulls in the liquids/juices around it to form a gel that passes through your gut much more gradually. What this means in terms of protection is that with a fiber heavy meal you aren't blasting your gut with a massive dose of sodium/fat/sugar etc all at once, instead it ramps up and in theory gives your intestines more time to adjust. Note that's a little speculation on my part in my attempt to put this in layman's terms so that might not be literally the reason - however in any case we know regular fiber-rich food consumption has a protective effect on multiple forms of intestinal cancer.</p>
<p>An interesting look at just how bad salt-preserved foods might be for you in large amounts regularly, look at US gastric cancer rates before and after the advent of refrigeration, and bear in mind that you would expect an increase in diagnoses due to medical advances catching more cases of it, but instead it actually plummeted. Then look at gastric cancer rates in Japan and South Korea, both countries known for exceptional health and unusually good aging otherwise, but what do you know they still consume diets jam packed full of sodium (kimchi and soy sauce being big offenders in the sense it's easy to get an entire days worth of sodium from portions you would consider very small) that would make American's blush, and they have the highest gastric cancer rates in the world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I'm not sure about that. Nitrites are fairly common all around the world, so it's questionable. Once it comes down to food safety, there is sometimes not enough data for a reliable conclusion.<br />
If you eat bacon, and only bacon, yes, it is bad for you, but then again, water has a determined LD50 (lethal dose to kill a human).<br />
Moderation is key.</p></div>		</li>
