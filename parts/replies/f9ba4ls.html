			<div class="markdown"><p>In most practical situations it will be negligible, but if you're doing measurements it's going to be a pretty noticeable effect.</p>
<p>At the equator, if you're going east at highway speed and reverse to go west at highway speed, a 70kg human would weigh about 50-60g more. A little less than a tenth of a percent difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this a large enough difference that it would affect an Olympic sprinter? For instance, I think the 100m is measured down to hundredths of a second. If it wouldn't have a measurable affect, would you then be able to measure it given that the distance was sufficiently increased? Say, running a marathon east vs west?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The centrifugal effect causes a person to weigh 0.3% less at the equator than at the poles. Earth's surface velocity at the equator is about 1667 km/h. Commercial airplanes fly about half that speed, meaning the 0.3% changes to 0.45% going east and 0.15% going west. In other words, a plane weighing 70 ton, &quot;weighs&quot; about 210 kg less going east than going west. Seems considerable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, but only by a little.  Any good industrial scale will do a half-assed job of showing you the effect, and for a few hundred dollars you can make one which’ll do a good job.</p>
<p>Another concern at that point is the local density of the Earth’s crust, which can vary by enough to nudge the scale a similar amount.</p>
<p>Source: I probably still have the schematics around here somewhere...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends how many decimal points you have on your scale. A really good postal scale might be able to. A chem lab scale probably needs calibration to avoid the effect - a good set of calibration weights is handy. But most consumer grade scales just don't have enough precision.</p></div>		</li>
