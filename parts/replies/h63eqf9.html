			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, and a big part of why mental health is such an issue these days is that the nature of our stress has changed significantly.</p>
<p>We evolved to deal with brief periods of extreme stress. The key moment of a hunt. The flight from a predator. Fighting an enemy. A dangerous situation navigating rough terrain. Most of it only lasts seconds or minutes. You feel stress because your body turns everything up to 11 to help you deal with it for a moment and then you come down.</p>
<p>Modern life turns stress into a near-permanent state as you struggle with the everyday demands of life. Work, study, relationships, all amplified by media and marketing constantly telling you your life is subpar.</p>
<p>The mechanisms you evolved for dealing with stressful situations and the resulting memories weren't meant to be running every waking moment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hunter-gatherers did not live a perfect live in Eden, but they did not spend as much time &quot;working&quot; as early farmers or modern humans did, and tasks tended to vary.  They had periods of hunger, but so too did early civilizations.  They also did not live in as individualistic of a society as we did and everyone shared burdens, socialized while they worked, and could rely on their immediate community for support and socialization a lot more than contemporary urbanized culture can.</p>
<p>Working 50 hours a week while studying for your bachelor's degree, sitting in the office performing mind numbing tasks that do not have a direct connection to  your survival or happiness (other than receiving a paycheck) or committing 3 hours round trip or more are recent inventions.    </p>
<p>We're certainly capable for performing the above tasks, but I don't think that kind and that quantity of sedentary labor and mental anguish is something we naturally take to and I'm not convinced it's good for us.</p></div>		</li>
