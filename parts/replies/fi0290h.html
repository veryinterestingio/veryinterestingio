			<div class="markdown"><p>So what happens exactly when I select any one of the &quot;credit&quot;, &quot;savings&quot; or &quot;chq&quot; options. I'm using a debit card with paywave or swipe/chip. Mine goes through fine on all of those options and yet it's just a normal savings account.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on how your bank programs it. The fact that you have paywave and they all come from the same account probably means that you have a debit MasterCard or debit Visa Card (ie not a real credit card)</p>
<p>So to cut down in support the bank may have both the saving and the cheque button linked to the same account via the Eftpos Network; and if you hit credit or use paywave it goes via the MasterCard or Visa network detailed above. In all three cases they still hit your same account. </p>
<p>As you don’t receive loyalty points or any other bonuses using the credit option for big purchases if you want to cut the merchant a break; use the sav or cheque option as they won’t have to pay a transaction fee vs credit card processing fee. </p>
<p>Ie if the item is $1000; and the merchant gets charged 2.2% then they are going to be hit with a $22 bank fee for taking your money when you select credit vs no charge for saving or cheque. </p>
<p>Some merchants you can barter down to a cheaper price with this information eg offering them $990 as they make more money (others simply don’t care or realise)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Haggle. The word you and half of Queensland is looking for is &quot;haggle&quot;, not &quot;barter&quot;. Bartering is trading with other goods instead of currency.</p>
<p>Source: growing up nobody in QLD used the right bloody word and this annoys the piss out of me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing I've also seen in the US, the stores you often visit most (gas stations, discount stores, etc,) typically use merchants to process transactions using very old back-end systems. </p>
<p>The POS may be new, but the network they pay to use is often old as hell and can't tell the difference.</p>
<p>The band-aid fix was banks and CC merchants doing some code fuckery on their end so that it doesn't matter. </p>
<p>(Use card to pay for snacks &gt; machine thinks the newer MC or Visa debit card is like an old school bank card &gt; machine offers multiple choices &gt; ultimately Visa and MC have code that just disregards the selection &gt; Then passes the transaction on from there so the bank doesn't freak out and decline it.)</p></div>		</li>

<p><strong>Cheque, savings or credit?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Savings</strong> - When you select savings at the checkout, that doesn’t mean the money will come out of your savings account. It’s actually coming out of your bank account, which is usually linked both to your debit card and your savings account, so you can transfer money as you need it. When you press savings, the money is transferred out of your account almost immediately through the EFTPOS system. </p>
<p><strong>Cheque</strong> - Hitting cheque works almost the same as savings - the money comes out of your transaction account (or a chequing account if you have one set up) and is processed through the EFTPOS system. Also, if you want to get cash out at the checkout, remember that you’ll have to pick cheque or savings - cash out usually isn’t available with credit. </p>
<p><strong>Credit</strong> - Pressing credit is a little different, in that it can only be processed through the MasterCard or Visa system, and not EFTPOS. The main reason to do so is you’ll have the added security of performing your transaction through the Visa or MasterCard system, which both come with zero liability cover, meaning you’ll be fully reimbursed for any fraudulent activities. Banks generally prefer you to press credit, because they make more money that way, while a retailer will probably prefer cheque or savings, because it saves them money. It can sometimes take a little while for the details of the transaction to be finalised when you press credit, which is why you might see pending transactions on your account.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you know why when I use my ANZ debit card for EFTPOS or at an ATM and I'm offered 'chq, sav, credit' I need to select 'sav' in order to use my cheque account? I have both a cheque and savings account with them and remember being told when I collected the card that it was all very confusing but to just always select sav and it would be charged to chq. It's not a big deal but I'm just curious why their system is so illogical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just go onto a branch and ask them to connect your cheque account to the chq option on the keycard. Should take 2 minutes. </p>
<p>I’ve changed which account mine are linked to several times.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The banks love this as it means they are making money off transactions that used to be chq or sav types</p>

<p>Huh. So if I have an RFID chip in my EFTPOS card and I tap, does that mean the merchant is actually getting slugged with a Mastercard/Visa transaction fee and not the near-inconsequential EFTPOS fee?</p>
<p>The docket that comes out doesn't say Mastercard Debit etc like it does when I tap that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Look on the front or back of your card; it will have a MasterCard/ Visa logo etc and they are the payment processor for credit or PayPass/payWave. </p>
<p>Chq / Sav accounts for eftpos require the pin for authentication with the bank (in Australia). The pin is the second factor of authentication (Something you have - Card; Something you know - Pin)</p>
<p>Credit doesn’t for under $100 on a terminal (insert or tap); and doesn’t for any amount when using it online. This transaction is protected by MasterCard/Visa fraud protection and you can dispute transactions if needed. Someone needs to make money somewhere so the merchant is billed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well i'll be.</p>
<p>Front of my EFTPOS card has the commbank and EFTPOS logo, as well as a bankcard number (6 digits, 9 digits, 2 digits) and chip contacts. Back has the black strip, signature strip with 3 digits, and a tiny cirrus logo, which I assume is a subsidiary of Mastercard.</p>
<p>Here I was thinking I was being a better customer by tapping my non-debit card. My debit card by comparison has the Mastercard logo on front loud and proud.</p></div>		</li>
