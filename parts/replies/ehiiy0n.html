<p>1) On the subject of waves, there has been a concentrated, active effort (primarily in the form of mass lobbying) to reduce collective bargaining on employees parts, and to prevent/deregulate worker protections across the board as 'cost-saving' measures.</p>
<ul>
<li>We're talking a full-on race-to-the-bottom here, the most recent overly-public example being an influential member of the white house declaring they do not believe that most americans want &quot;family-sustaining wages&quot; with their jobs, but that they &quot;want to work for what they get&quot; without a guaranteed minimum.</li>
</ul>
<p>2) While mostly correct for housing, a devastating aspect of the price rises has been increased (particularly thanks to technology, as you can now own land across the world at the touch of a button if you've got the money) by speculators and 'flippers'. I have seen firsthand the effects on a neighborhood of <em>suddenly condos</em>, and the ripple on prices, small businesses and housing taxes (especially municipal) extends disturbingly far.</p>
<p>A few high-rise construction projects can price the locals out of their existing homes and shut down local businesses, especially if said projects get re-sold and the surrounding area snatched up along with it whenever folks shut down (or in the case of apartments get bought by some subsidiary acting as slumlord to get the place condemned within 2-3 years). If the project ends up floundering, it's even worse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actual cost per month on a $225k house is more like $1200-1300, and if the person doesnâ€™t have 20% down ($45k in this case, plus closing costs, etc.), there is an added mortgage insurance that can be another couple hundred. </p></div>		</li>
