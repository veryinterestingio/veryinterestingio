			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, except what stimulates the release is actually a nerve signal, not humoral (endocrine), otherwise that would be too slow. The splanchnic nerves of the sympathetic division innervate the medulla causing the opening of calcium channels and subsequent release of adrenaline from storage granules.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>Simplification: fight or flight response causes a surge of electrical signals in a subset of the nervous system called the sympathetic division. One of these nerves goes to the adrenal gland to stimulate the release of stored adrenaline into the blood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The body physically responds to situations that require immediate action by releasing hormones like epinephrine and norepinephrine that are connected to storage centers in the brain via the CNS(Central Nerve System), which is connected to a primitive part of the brain that some call the reptilian portion of the brain. Called fight or flight, this basically triggers a a compulsory mental process that essentially triggers a stand your ground or back down response. During this whole process stored adrenaline hormones are released in the brain and cause increased heart rate, dilated pupils and contracted blood vessels (among other physical responses) and causes a reaction to an adverse situation that either calls for action or being perceived that way. </p>
<p>Example: An Alligator chases you, you run. If an alligator chased Steve Irwin, he would try and get a chance to catch it and make it look like a pansy.</p>
<p>Example: You know that you want a raise, so you ask your boss. When asked why you get a head rush and your heart rate jumps. So you decide to back down and keep your job or confront said boss and risk losing that job versus getting a raise.</p>
<p>In both of these examples, adrenaline was released in the brain, leaving the said person with an immediate choice to make under the influence of adrenaline.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, sort of. If it was just in your bloodstream or between your nerve endings all the time then you would be. But our normal brain chemicals like dopamine and serotonin <em>are</em> floating around inside us all the time. </p>
<p>They are also gradually produced, but they are stored (inside the nerves) until being released (outside the nerves) by the proper signals, which causes their effects, and then they are (mostly) collected and stored again for the next release.</p></div>		</li>

---- The adrenaline that was just released can be 'collected and stored again' for use again?????  Even mostly?    I assumed that once you used your stored 'batch' of adrenaline, it was gone, and 'new' had to be made. (No particular reason why I assumed that.)  But are you saying that we reuse, even 'some' of the adrenaline we release, after we have released it?  Something in our body sweeps it up (lol) or aggregates it, and puts it back into storage?  --- That surprises me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think he's talking about neurotransmitters not hormones. Noradrenaline is the neurotransmitter (mostly), adrenaline is the hormone (mostly). Noradrenaline is taken up again after release by the presynaptic neuron much like most other neurotransmitters. Synaptic cleft is a tiny space, it makes sense to recycle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>when you see drug withdrawal being explained as &quot;your body ran out of this neurotransmitter and takes time to make more&quot; is both right and wrong, because the state of withdrawal where there isn't &quot;enough&quot; of something is not that simple. One can have enough neurotransmitter reserve, but the receptors neurtransmitters attach to can be desensitized. And this is what happens more often than depletion. It takes a lot to deplete a neurotransmitter, so when you stop responding to a drug or a neurotransmitter, its probably because the post synaptic receptors just got desensitized from the nonstop activation. It can also be that as soon as its released, it gets immediately destroyed (this is stimulated during manifestation of dependence), as a method to starve the receptors, induce withdrawal, and preserve the reserves, so that afterwards - the receptors become sensitive and  come to normal function. Enough reserves, isnt immediately destroyed, the receptors are sensitive - thats when you return to normal and the neurotransmitter does it job 'properly'</p></div>		</li>
