			<div class="markdown"><p>Nitrogenation would be the word, I imagine. Most folks just call them nitro beers, though. Rolls off the tongue better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a silly question. It's called nitrogenation and when it's used for beer they're referred to as &quot;nitro&quot;. They're smoother and don't have the bite of carbonation. Usually only done with stouts or porters probably because it's a weird mouth feel if done with typical ales and lagers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Nitro&quot; beers like Guinness use &quot;beer gas&quot; which is 75% nitrogen and 25% CO2.</p>
<p>So it's still carbonated, a little bit. The nitrogen gives everything a smoother/creamier texture and taste though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Starbucks has a nitro brew that is pretty nice. I've seen it at some local coffee shops as well. Monster used to have a nitro drink as well. It had a nice froth to it instead of being fizzy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Guinness uses a mix of nitrogen and CO2. The CO2 is used to carbonate the liquid making it fizzy. The nitrogen enables them to raise the pressure enough to force the beer through a small orifice to shock the CO2 out of solution in a defined manner to create the super tiny bubbles that create the creamy head. Nitrogen is barely soluble in water, that's why this works. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nitrogen is actually soluble in water, that's what &quot;the bends&quot; is in diving it's when the nitrogen dissolved in your blood comes out of solution. Nitrogen requires a higher pressure to remain dissolved in the water that's why Guinness is kept at higher pressure. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. Lowering acidity does mean you would decrease how much sugar need to balance for a sweet taste. Too little acidity will also affect the flavor adversely as a lot of flavors balance well off of acidity more so than sweetness. Additionally, just because they take out co2, does not necessarily mean the pH will drop as pH is used as a method of control for pathogens and they might have to add more phosphorus acid. Acetic acid, or citric acid to maintain this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nitrogen will definitely make smaller, smoother bubbles. The whole mouth feel will completely change. Think of the difference between a crisp lager and a Guinness draught. The lager will be really effervescent and the stout will be almost creamy. I think it'll be interesting to have a nitrogenated cola, but I don't know if the mass market would accept it. People don't like drastic change like that.</p></div>		</li>
