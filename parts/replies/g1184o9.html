			<div class="markdown"><p>Aye! They are morphologically different, though apparently (at least as per the review article I cite, and what I based my answer upon):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kidneys in marine mammals possess the anatomical
prerequisites (i.e. increased medullary thickness) necessary to
produce a highly concentrated urine, which is especially
important for mammals in a hyperosmotic environment.</p>
<p>However, as stated by Bester (Bester, 1975), ‘the reniculate
kidney does not attain the concentrating ability expected from
a kidney with such excellent anatomical credentials’. A close
correlation between relative medullary thickness and
maximum recorded urine osmolality exists, with pinnipeds
exhibiting ratios between 1.1 and 1.7 (Vardy and Bryden,
1981). However, these low values suggest that the kidneys of
marine mammals are extremely poor concentrators of urine
(Vardy and Bryden, 1981). Using a urine-to-plasma ratio in
osmolality as an index of concentrating ability, values for
marine mammals are only slightly higher than those for
humans, but much lower than those for desert rodents
(Table 1).</p>
<p><strong>Therefore, the variation in kidney morphology
observed in marine mammals does not appear to afford them
any greater benefit than terrestrial mammals</strong>, suggesting that
the adaptation of mammals to a hyperosmotic environment was
accomplished via more conventional mechanisms such as
hormonal regulation of urine concentration and/or the rate of
urine formation. The reniculate kidneys of cetaceans and
pinnipeds probably evolved in response to their large body size
and diving abilities and not to the osmotic challenge posed by
a marine environment (Bester, 1975; Vardy and Bryden, 1981).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which is summed up in the abstract as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The kidneys of pinnipeds and cetaceans are reniculate in structure, unlike those of terrestrial mammals (except bears), but this difference does not confer any greater concentrating ability. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence: &quot;not as good as one might think&quot;. At least for most marine mammals under most circumstances. Sea otters are a notable exception; perhaps too some assorted pinnipeds that engage in infrequent deliberate saltwater drinking.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You know what, I had completely forgotten about this being the more prevailing hypothesis to explain the reniculi (that's what happens when you can't find a job in your preferred field, eh). It was one that my mentor/professor at the time wasn't too keen on. If I remember correctly, she argued that if it was simply a response to their large size, why would relatively small cetaceans (such as the harbor porpoise) have highly reniculate kidneys whereas the large sirenians have smoother kidneys? Her argument being that the manatees (specifically the West Indian manatee) relied on direct consumption of freshwater and therefore didn't require the same structures in their kidneys.</p>
<p>But then we could argue that she's comparing apples and oranges when comparing sirenians and cetaceans. Maybe there's not a lot of selective pressure to move away from reniculi when they comprise a perfectly adequate kidney system. Also, sirenians don't dive the way that cetaceans do. </p>
<p>She was a very old school marine biologist but also brilliant when it came to cetacean physiology, so I often just deferred to her expertise. The study you linked looks very solid but I don't have access to the older cited papers that did the osmoregulation experiments. Would love to see their methodology.</p></div>		</li>
