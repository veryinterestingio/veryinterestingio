<p>It may take that long to switch to complex carbs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With that you're saying that in the first 3ish miles your body is using nitrous so it can't take it too long and once you switch to gas, you'll be more relaxed while jogging?</p>
<p>Also, GREAT explanation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. I trained for a marathon, and even after running 20+ miles in training, my first mile was great, felt fantastic. But the next 3 were horrible. I felt awful and was so tired in my core and was breathing hard. Then once it fully switches my core was fine and the only fatigue I felt (for a long while) was only in my muscles. Didn't feel winded or bad or anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Teach me all the things. I'm training for a marathon and aside from running, I feel like I have no fucking clue what I'm doing in regards to nutrition... despite almost graduating with a degree in nutrition some many years ago. Lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So today was my second day at the gym after taking about a year off. Yesterday I was pumped and felt great. Today after just 15 minutes I was totally drained. Is this the simple/complex carb thing you're talking about?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Potentially. Everything I know about simple and complex is based on endurance training and the stuff I read that pertained to marathons and how the &quot;runners high&quot; works. If you were doing elliptical or treadmill, then yes since I know the body uses the energy in the same way.</p>
<p>But when it comes to weight training if you're focusing more on muscle group (curls, sit ups, bench, etc.) and not core I'm not sure if it interacts the same. <strong>At this point I'm conjecturing so grain of salt and all that</strong>. You're using energy for sure, but now you're looking at lactic acid build up before energy depletion comes into play. As well as how much your muscles have healed between workouts.</p>
<p>I think of it in 2 stages, &quot;bottleneck&quot; and &quot;breakthrough&quot;. My bottleneck was when the thing that slowed me the most was running out of breath or just feeling bad in my core. Once it switched over I could run 10x longer with 0 issues in core or breath. </p>
<p>that's when in the &quot;breakthrough&quot; stage the thing that slowed me down was solely pain in my leg muscles since lactic acid built up and my muscles were tearing more and more. The two feel very differently in my body.</p>
<p>So whenever I'd go to the gym and lift weights (no cardio or core) I almost never faced issues with my breath which I attribute to simple vs complex, and it skipped to the second &quot;lactic acid/muscle tearing&quot; pain immediately with no tiredness issues, just muscle weakness. So a long reply to say I don't know if it is the same or not</p></div>		</li>
