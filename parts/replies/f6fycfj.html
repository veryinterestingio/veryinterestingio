			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you clarify a couple things:</p>
<ul>
<li>does UVB also cause the effects of aging? And how much compared to UVA?
<ul>
<li>does UVA also cause cancer, or only UVB?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>I thought that UVB could not penetrate the skin, and was therefore less harmful than A.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No. Both penetrate skin; they just affect different layers differently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a chem professor who looked like she's 30 (she was actually about 60), is really into outdoor running, and is as pale as a person who hasn't seen the sun in years. She maintains a layer of sunscreen every day, nearly all times the sun is above the horizon. She claims that she's done it since she was in her teens.</p>
<p>TLDR, I'd say: yes, chronically wearing sunscreen makes your skin retain its youthful (but potentially sickly pale) appearance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m 40 and I wear sunscreen on a daily basis. No one believes me when I tell them I’m 40. Wearing sunscreen absolutely halts aging compared to people who don’t wear any sunscreen.</p>
<p>Also, a good skin routine helps along with good genes but the importance of sunscreen cannot be undermined.</p>
<p>I don’t leave the house without a layer of sunscreen on my face and neck, I wear gloves when I drive and a hat when I’m in the sun for extended periods of time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. There have been several small studies demonstrating decreased wrinkles in study groups using sunscreen vs those not, irrespective of exposure to sunlight. I briefly tried to find the largest one I knew of but I couldn't, but several other smaller studies suggesting the same outcome showed up. Feel free to search</p></div>		</li>
