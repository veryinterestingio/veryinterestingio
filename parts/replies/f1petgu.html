			<div class="markdown"><p>For me it would be to tell them about all the amazing applications that maths has. More than just telling them, though, show them. And tell stories. Draw people in to the narrative - the places where maths has really made a diference in people's everyday lives, perhaps without them even knowing it. This is exactly what I've tried to do in the book. I like you want to pull people (not necessarily students) into the mathematical world. To make them see how important, useful and sometimes amazing maths can be!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What are some examples of maths having made a difference in everyday life that most people aren't necessarily aware of?</p>
<p>Also, do you see a link between language and the way it shapes people's understanding of life and maths? Is there maths in language?</p></div>		</li>

<p>There is no security possible on a network without powerful mathematical tools enabling us to encrypt and protect data. </p>
<p>And more generally, computers. Drawing graphics, compressing files, and obviously performing actual computations, everything relies on mathematical models and tools.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So true! Showing people instead of telling them is so much more powerful and convincing. Thanks for the response!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I wanted to be real-world precise, I'd say that without understanding basics of mathematical logic, a bit of statistics, you probably will make a lot of big mistakes.</p>
<p>Though if  you want something interesting, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach-Tarski_Paradox" target="_blank">Banach-Tarski paradox</a> is my favorite. You can also tell them about card counting, hacking machines (like the Russians did with some slot machines; but this applies to machines in general). You could be rich just by understanding some math (not talking about the legal part of it).</p></div>		</li>
