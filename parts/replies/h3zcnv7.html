			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. That's why production facilities have flares- most things that could be released are safer once they're burned.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>25x is the warming potential of CH4 vs CO2 that the EPA uses for calculations, however, CH4 is 16 g/mol and CO2 is 44 g/mol, so when burned you get more CO2 by mass, making the actual different between burning and not burning about 9x, still massively worth it though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something i havent seen mentioned somehow is that methane will decay into CO2 anyways, but while it is still methane it will be a more potent greenhouse gas. If you dont burn it, it stays as methane longer and will eventually turn into the same amount of CO2 either way, hence why burning it is better</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Methane is much worse as a green house gas than CO2.  If the gas isn't lit on fire initially, then you run the risk of a massive explosion as more and more gas accumulates and mixes with the air.  Fuel air explosives can generate massive explosions.  This is why you won't see fire fighters trying to put out a pipeline fire.  They will always wait for valves to be closed and let the fire burn itself out.  If you do see them spraying water onto a fire it is for cooling purposes to try and reduce the damage caused by the radiated heat.  I'm really curious what ignited this leak out in the ocean.  Not sure if the gas generated a static spark or if it was lit intentionally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok thanks I was wondering why firefighting boats were spraying close to the fire. I was so confused as to why they were trying to put out a fire in the ocean with water. We’re they just spraying to keep the methane bubbles contained in one central location? So that the fire was relatively contained?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally true, but context matters. For example:</p>
<p>The leak was near by a well, so presumably it was carrying unprocessed natural gas. Some gas wells are sour gas, meaning they contain H2S, which is a very dangerous toxic gas.  Combusting the H2S produces SO2, which is nowhere near as dangerous, but not great because it causes acid rain. Generally flaring off sour gas is hugely better because even though SO2 is bad, at least it’s not a deadly poison gas plume. </p>
<p>BUT the leak was underwater. H2S is soluble in water, if this gas was just released instead, neither H2S nor SO2 would be released to the atmosphere. </p>
<p>That said, neither case is going to make a big difference as the pollutants would be massively diluted before it reached anyone. Gas disperses very readily so there wouldn’t be much in terms of persistent effects. This also applies to the GHG impact of the methane. It’s just another drop into the bucket of global greenhouse gases. Almost no individual leak, let alone one that is brought under control the same day it starts, is going to be a major contributor. It’s just the accumulation of thousands and thousands of leaks all around the world that’s the issue. </p>
<p>The biggest environmental difference in this case is of course going to be the release of heat. A giant underwater fireball that boils ocean for several hours is going to impact the local environment quite severely. </p>
<p>Just like gas leaks in urban areas. Sure the gas leaking is bad - and in terms of pollution effects, it might be worse than if the gas was flared - but the actual real environmental impact is when the fireball blows apart several buildings leaving behind a crater and scattered bits of flaming wreckage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does it?  I’m not trying to say that there is no impact. Of course there is some impact - but the pithy saying that “dilution is the solution to pollution” actually does hold some merit. Concentrated contaminants have a much greater potential for harm. And of course, where the pollution impacts is a big deal as well. </p>
<p>Spilling a cup of motor oil in a thousand different locations randomly selected locations is nowhere near as bad as spilling a thousand cups of motor oil directly on to the homes of a keystone species in a stressed ecosystem. Both are bad, but one is worse. </p>
<p>Methane releases is bad for climate change. True. But several hours of the ocean going into a rolling boil caused by the fireball is going to have a more pronounced impact on the local environment.</p></div>		</li>
