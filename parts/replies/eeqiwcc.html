			<div class="markdown"><p>For everyone who gets headaches triggered by scents, look into Mast Cell Activation Syndrome. You might have it. I do. The absolute WORST for me are scented laundry detergents (think “meadow breeze” or some other similar concoction), plug-in air fresheners (or gels, etc), certain men’s body washes, deodorants and shampoos... and so much more. It’s weird. Some perfumes or shampoos or whatever are totally fine. But it’s like there’s a certain chemical concoction in others that is just WHAM! Instant headache. I take enough supplements &amp; antihistamines now to mitigate the effects of many of the Mast Cell symptoms (digestive, skin, headaches brought on by certain foods, etc)... but I can’t seem to do anything to help the chemical-scent induced headaches. I just try to avoid. Easy at home. Hard in public. </p>
<p>EDIT: There seems to be interest in this problem, and I’ve been getting private messages asking for more help/advice, too. I’ve responded to most public replies below, but it’s my birthday today, so I might not be able to respond to much more until at least tomorrow. But I’m also going to be starting a blog in the next two weeks, in which I’ll write about my experiences with Mast Cell Activation Disorder and Lyme Disease, as well as other interests of mine. I’ll be sure to include the supplements/meds I take, the diet restrictions I follow and other ways I helped myself when the medical industry was failing me. I’m not sure how to let you all know when I do get my blog up, but if you follow me on Twitter or Instagram, I’m sure I’ll be posting a link there when it’s ready. (If you don’t want to see a bunch of political stuff, maybe stay away from my Twitter. But otherwise, take your pick.) Message me for my social media links. And in case it’s not obvious, I hope everyone can find healing soon! We shouldn’t be (or have been) suffering for so long. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this count for the cause of the &quot;aura&quot; as well? </p>
<p>For the longest time I had no clue what was happening to me until I realized it was the &quot;aura&quot; of a migraine, without the actual pain. I've been trying to figure out what triggers them, but it's so hard to isolate a single trigger when you're constantly developing them in new environments. Not to mention, as a woman, I always have to question what is hormonal and what isn't-because that can play such a big role but it's impossible to measure hormone levels on a day to day basis. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get tunnel vision, confusion, and inner ear/balance issues. Occasionally I’ll see things like dots of light or blind spots. I have increased sensitivity to light and sound, and generally it leads to nausea since I’m so “out of focus” in all my senses. I’ve never gotten the painful headaches, but when I get the aura it’s like an out-of-body experience were I become completely disassociated and unfocused. It usually lasts for 40-60 minutes but then it passes and I feel “normal” again. </p>
<p>I’ve spoken with a doctor about it, and he said it’s the “aura” that comes before most migraines, but in my case I never actually get the classic “migraine” result. It’s apparently not surprising, but it is uncommon, that some experience the aura without the migraine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Migraines and other headaches don’t work the same way at all (anyone that suggests so is wrong, including the user above you). Migraines are not fully understood, but they seem to be caused by a change in the bloodflow in and around the brain. Two hormones in particular, serotonin and estrogen, affect blood vessels when the hormone levels suddenly change. First the blood vessels will narrow, partially strangling the blood flow to a small area, and then later they will open up wide again which leads to a small ”flood” of blood to that area. This is not dangerous.</p>
<p>It is believed that the auras which precedes migraines in many people are an effect of the <em>lower</em> blood flow, and the exact aura you get is determined by the exact blood vessel = the exact area of the brain affected. Auras may be weird visual phenomena, hearing noises, pins and needles sensations and many other things. It’s different for different people. As the auras are caused by a change in blood flow to the brain, they are sometimes misinterpreted as a stroke.</p>
<p>The pain that comes after is believed to be caused rather by the blood flowing on again, ”shocking” the area. The actual pain does not come from the brain by the way, because there are no pain receptors in the brain tissue, but from the outer covering of the brain (the meninges) which are <em>very</em> dense with pain receptors. As is the case with you, not everyone actually experiences the pain, they may only get the aura.</p>
<p>As I said, the cause of the effect on blood vessels often seem to be hormones, with estrogen and serotonin being the main culprits. Estrogen levels only fluctuate in women, while serotonin levels may fluctuate in both men and women, and this might be the reason that migraines are more common in women. The ultimate cause of the hormone levels are complex and looks different from person to person. Stress plays a role, and then many people have different ”triggers” that they’re aware of.</p>
<p>P.S. Someone who knows how antidepressants work is going to come along shortly and say that serotonin is a neurotransmittor and not a hormone. I’ll preëmpt that by saying that serotonin works as a neurotransmittor in nerve-to-nerve connections in the central nervous system, but also works as a hormone in the bloodstream. Sorry for these words, five-year-olds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this! It explains a lot and I feel like I have a much better understanding now. </p>
<p>I'm also on an SSRI so that could explain some things as well, just in terms of my serotonin levels already being messed up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm the same - very bright lights are my trigger. I tend to mainly get the retinal migraine symptoms (tunnel vision, jagged lines that get bigger and bigger until I can see again, spots, etc). </p>
<p>I found it terrifying when I was a young teenager and it first happened, but I'm in my 40s now and I get them maybe a couple of times a year. They aren't a big deal, I just wait for them to pass, which usually takes 30 minutes or so.</p></div>		</li>
