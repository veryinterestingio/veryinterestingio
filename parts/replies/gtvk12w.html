			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the greatest examples of winning by outmaneuvering is Hannibal's victory over Varro at Cannae. Normally you put your best soldiers in the middle so you can break through the enemy's line like a spear.</p>
<p>Hannibal flipped this and put his weaker soldiers in the middle so as Rome pressed, the middle was pushed back and the formation became concave. But this was only a trick and as Rome pushed further in the middle, their flanks were overtaken by Hannibal's strong infantry and cavalry.</p>
<p>Before they knew it the Romans were encircled and it was quick work of the Punic side to destroy them.</p>
<p>It helped that Hannibal basically got to choose the day for the battle. Rome switched command between the two consuls day to day, and so Hannibal chose the day when Varro, the more rash and less tactical one, had imperium. Which just illustrates further that order dominates chaos in battle.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wasn't it pretty much an all day affair to slaughter all those soldiers since they were just stuck there and pinned waiting for death.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The accounts of the battle are horrific.  The Romans were crushed together, unable to even lift their arms to defend themselves.  The numbers given are insane.  Hannibal had about fifty thousand soldiers, vrs more than 80 thousand Romans. Only about 15 thousand Romans survived.  It's still one of the bloodiest battles in world history.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True but what makes it impressive is he did it with a smaller force if I remember correctly. The Romans outnumbered his forces at the battle. Usually the larger force is the one enveloping and pincering the smaller force.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Still pretty realistic. A lot of war is cutting off supply chains so as to make the enemy weak or even surrender out of desperation for food, water, lack of munitions, etc.. </p>
<p>Would you rather attack a heavily fortified location or attack the transport bringing them needed materials from afar? I know which I would pick</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Read Ghost on the Throne. It's a description of the wars between Alexander's generals after his death.</p>
<p>Half the war was finding your enemy and trying to get him to attack you on a place of your choosing. Imagine a chess board with just kings (technically it's a stalemate) trying to catch the other. But neither player can see more than two squares around their piece. Just take turns hopping around trying to find him before he found you.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;We may take it then that an army without its baggage train is lost; without provisions it is lost; without bases of supply it is lost.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also: uniforms, flags and colours were for the longest time a very effective way to tell at a glance who's who, and to a lesser extent what's happening.</p>
<p>EDIT: A LOT of the replies are fixated on the idea of uniforms not being a thing before the 1700s, which has <em>some</em> validity since armies were often enough drawn from the general population and they weren't issued standard equipment and dress, but there's a difference between it not being THE thing and it not being A thing. </p>
<p>Any large kingdom/empire since before Rome would have a standing army, and civilians that knew they could be pressed int service so they'd pretty much always have at least one spearhead to fit into a spear shaft, a cloak of a particular colour, usually a shield, sometimes armor, sometimes bows and arrows, sometimes axes, maces or swords. Spear and shield were THE weapon for massed infantry for well over 4000 years after all, and cloaks were used for about the length of time. </p>
<p>People were generally proud to defend their homes and in expansionist armies, to show their superiority when winning. Also: the idea of the world being brown is a Hollywood trope. Dyes were commonplace and easy to make and obtain (with exception for a few colours like blue and purple). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESsnU-ECYnw" target="_blank">This</a> is a video on some common dyes and the title of &quot;Iron Age Dyes&quot; is pretty self explanatory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was a lesson that the US military had to relearn. For a while it was easy for the enemies in Iraq and Afghanistan to see who was the embedded Navy corpsman in a Marine squad. The embedded air force jtac/taco by the different uniforms. Eventually they figured it out and they all started wearing the same.</p>
<p>But a air force person wearing their tiger stripe, the army in their acu made it really easy to figure out which guy was unique and therefore must have a unique and special role.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now you're talking two different periods. The comment you responded to was talking antiquity to roughly the High Middle Ages. Military uniforms only became common in the mid-17th century, well into the Early Modern Period. Certainly long after the battle dynamic in the comment you responded to had become obsolete.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had always assumed the Romans, with their standardized shields and tall headwear had chosen that style to make it easier to determine their own troops from the enemy. </p>
<p>Even the Greeks had some semblance of military dress that differed from their enemies, right? They may not have been as comprehensive uniforms as more modern armies, but it seems like commanders could still tell the difference between enemy armies by their headwear and armament. No?</p></div>		</li>
