<p>Persistent use of antibiotics just gives the bacteria more time to evolve and adapt.</p>
<p>Short term treatment gives your body some breathing room and time for your immune system to respond and fully clear out the infection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't say 100% but 'close enough' the thing is we aren't in a situation where we can take &quot;x pill&quot; forever eventually it is going to become ineffective, the arms race is literally this,  because it is an eli5 post I have to ...you know I will be entirely explicit. Let's go to the gym, here OP lift 100 kg. You can do it...oh wait you likely can't, you'd be crushed and die</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>but what if we started at 20? next week 25 and so on...eventually you will be able to lift the 100. the biggest difference is that we aren't comparing YOU over a few months but instead generations but because of the way it works it isn't a few months before 100, it is a few months until thousands....and within a few years you are against saitama</p></div>		</li>
