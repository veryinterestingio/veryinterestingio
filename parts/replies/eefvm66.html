			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this. And you can't just rely on mass to tell you how much of a substance you have, because depending on the compound, the molar masses can be wildly different. For example, pure water has a molar mass of \~18.02 g/mol. So 1 Kg of water = 55.5 moles of water. But take another common substance; glucose. That has a molar mass of \~180.2 g/mol - almost exactly 10x more. For the exact same mass of glucose - 1 Kg - you have only 5.55 moles of glucose. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is super-important, because in chemistry, reactions are calculated stoichiometrically, which means the number of starting molecules is used to figure out the expected number of product molecules. Sometimes you need a 1:1 ratio of two reactants to get the desired product, sometimes you need a 3:1 ratio. But that ratio is always with respect to # of molecules, NOT mass. </p>

<p>The mole is the only unit that you can use to reliably &amp; accurately predict the outcome of a chemical reaction. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t think this is a great answer in terms of how the question was framed. </p>
<p>You’re not giving reasons why OP’s logic is invalid in a way they can understand. I think OP understood about molecular mass. He just thinks it’s easy to convert since in many classroom HS settings you often start with a weight to begin with. </p>
<p>Think of helium. </p>
<p>How in a standard environment would you weigh that?  That’s the type of answer OP wants. </p>
<p>It could be done in a vacuum but I think people are skipping right past the why because to them that point is glossed right over in their day to day work. </p>
<p><strong>The mole is used because it represents a measurement that is least likely to be affected by outside factors.</strong></p>
<p>I feel like these answers are going to be filled with a bunch of college students saying similar things. “We do things this way because these are best practices and we start with premeasured quantities.”</p>
<p>When really OP is looking for the why and practical examples to better explain the situation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Best laymans explanation i ever heard for it. Expanding on this analogy having 700gs of buns doesnt really tell you anything usefull but knowing that 700 grams is 7 full buns you now know you have enough buns for 7 burgers so when you wanna make as many burgers as you can you know you can make 7 max. </p>
<p>In chemistry terms if i have 500 mL of an alcohol i want to turn into an ester i dont know how much carboxylic acid i need because volumes, like grams, dont tell you how much you actually have so i need so work out the moles and lets say its 3 moles. The reactions 1:1 so i know i need 3 moles of carboxylic acid. </p>
<p>For those wondering about the reaction its alcohol + carboxylic acid - &gt; ester + H2O</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never really understood why we did it that way it was just one of those things that we do 'because we do' so thanks for clearing that up for me, actually understand it now even though it's useless for me now it's still nice to know haha. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No worries to be honest when i was learning it all for the first time a lot of it boiled down to learning the hows first and the whys last the hows get you marks on your test even if you dont know why. The whys just get you a few marks for context maybe.</p></div>		</li>
