			<div class="markdown"><p>That said, when I was treated with I-131 (thyroid tried to kill me), I was instructed to be careful around children/babies and avoid holding them close to my throat. Similarly, since iodine is eliminated in urine, I was told to make sure that I always flushed the toilet after urinating to make sure I didn't leave any radioactive material around.</p>
<p>If the radionuclide is taken into the body and subsequently eliminated through standard waste channels, it can be transported and deposited elsewhere while also poisoning the transporter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yuparoo, when I was doing my clinicals for medical radiography (which, go figure, isnt my field of employment even though I graduated and got liscenced) nuclear medicine was a great interest of mine. PET (positron emission tomography) was really something to behold, as it involves making the patient radioactive using a radioisotope that's attached to a marker molecule and then seeing where it all decides to congregate at. It's basically a camera where you are the source of light!  </p>
<p>Also stomach emptying studies, radioactive scrambled eggs are pretty cool too.</p>
<p>Lotta telling patients to be careful with their bodily wastes involved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the I-131 was radioactive.  You were not.  You just carried radioactive stuff around with you.</p>
<p>Which is to say if the I-131 was completely removed from your body you would not be radioactive despite having been irradiated by I-131.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Radiation can cause neutron release, which can in turn render non-radioactive materials radioactive. But keep in mind the cross section for such an event is very low for most materials. One example would be gamma radiation of Be-9 to yield two alpha particles and a neutron. It's the neutron capture that can breed new, possibly radioactive isotopes. The alpha/beta/gamma ray itself doesn't induce radioactivity in stable atoms</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a poster above who talks about neutron activation. tl:dr; Scattering neutrons sometimes lodge in other nuclei, making them unstable. A human who is exposed to enough of this to matter is already dead.</p></div>		</li>
