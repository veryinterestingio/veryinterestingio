			<div class="markdown"><p>Aged meat losses water content and in turn shrinks in size. So all of the flavor that was on 2 lbs of meat is now concentrated on 1.2 lbs of meat. This also adds to the flavor of the final product. Think of it as similar to when you add a cup of wine to a sauce and reduce it down to a few table spoons. All the flavor is still there but itâ€™s all more intense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, there <em>is</em> an outer layer - called a pellicle - that results from dry aging, where the meat will oxidize and dry out to an inedible point. You do not want to be eating that stuff, but once the pellicle has been trimmed away, you're left with immensely tender and flavorful meat. Guga Foods/Sous Vide Everything on YouTube have some excellent videos about dry aging - give them a watch sometime.</p>
<p>Dry aged beef can lose up to 30% of its weight by moisture loss alone, which is partly where the extra flavor comes from. With the extra trimming, you're looking at 40-50% less meat than you began with, but the results are so. damn. worth it. Give it a try the next time you go out to celebrate an accomplishment with a nice steak!</p></div>		</li>

<p>As long as the meat is properly preserved, typically with some kind of salt rub, and kept in a controlled environment, it won't &quot;go bad.&quot; <strong><em>It does start to break down but that just adds to the flavour and tenderizes the meat.</em></strong></p>
