			<div class="markdown"><p>Hell Ive looked right at an ice cube as Ive grabbed it and my brain mistakes it for a burning sensation. The pain also depends on the area and whats causing it. Have you ever had an abscess tooth? One of the worst pains in my life, hands down. Its because a relatively minor infection of a tooth has nowhere for the inflammation to go. The pressure builds up in the rigid walls of the gum and jaw, which in turn puts pressure back into the infected area. 8/10 on the hurt scale for me, it would keep me up at night.</p></div>		</li>
