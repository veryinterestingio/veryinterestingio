			<div class="markdown"><p>They have evolved to be able to be in a group. Individuals have ranges for their &quot;voices&quot; and if they hear another voice that is too similar they will both deviate theirs a little so they don't confuse each other.</p>
<p>Like genetics may dictate that each individual could use a frequency between 20khz and 50khz. If two are using 22, one will shift down to 21 and the other will shift up to 23.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes a lot of sense. Kind of how growing up I knew a set of twins, same voice and looks, but because human behavior and interaction, it is more complicated, I knew that the cooler one was way more lax in his social jargon, his humor, and they way he carried himself (not that the other wasn’t cool af, he was but in his own way). I was able to identify that based on my species’ already established social presence and structure. I can’t imagine how weird and intricate natural bat culture may be, but I can understand how they would naturally be able to just figure out who is who amongst the seemingly chaotic blend of noise. </p>
<p>Best example I can put forward are those YouTube videos of newborn 0-3 babies that meet their parent’s twins for the first time. I can’t point any out atm because I’m on mobile, but we’ve all seen them before. The baby isn’t quite sure as to who their momma/papa is so they keep reaching out back and forth for comfort between the two. The baby doesn’t know who is who, but we know based off of how we as a species determine an individual.</p>
<p>In this case, we are the babies observing natural bats in their natural habitat. Do I know how they function? No. Is it confusing when you think about questions like that? You bet your sweet baby ass it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally they use the same frequency, as a colony, when dealing with migration or fleeing from danger. This allows them to stay in a tighter grouping and be more safe/efficient with travel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can identify what species of bat you are &quot;hearing&quot; (it's usually above the human range of hearing, but not always!) by looking at a sonogram of their crusising echo location calls. That is the pulse call they give out several times a second to keep track of their surroundings and search for bugs to eat. Once they spot a bug they switch to a much more rapid &quot;feeding buzz&quot; for a second or two as they close in on the bug and increase their &quot;sonar&quot; pings to get a clearer picture. The feeding buzz isn't as distinct between species. </p>
<p>The cruising call is different between species not just in frequency,  but in the duration, rate of change, and intensity. You can look at the shape of the sonogram and instantly recognize the species, even if there are multiple individuals in the area and they are increasing or decreasing their individual calls to use a clear section of bandwidth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the info! Very interesting. How does this relate to the OP's question of the relationship between voices of parent/child bats, though? I am also interested to know.</p></div>		</li>
