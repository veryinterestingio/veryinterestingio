<blockquote>
<p>Briefly stated, the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect is as follows. You open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. In Murray's case, physics. In mine, show business. You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues. Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward—reversing cause and effect. I call these the &quot;wet streets cause rain&quot; stories. Paper's full of them.
In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story, and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about Palestine than the baloney you just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know.”</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s a good point, but some papers are definitely better than others, and what I read on topics I know in those papers are “simplifications of topics I know, but generally well researched”. </p>
<p>I fear people are taking useful realizations (all news is biased; journalists are not necessarily experts and make errors) and extending that to a ludicrous extreme (all news is equally biased, all journalists are equally prone to error). </p>
<p>Journalists, especially when covering topics we aren’t already experts in, are doing one of the most important jobs on the planet, right up there with school teachers. </p>
<p>None of this has to do with the OP; making claims about what percentage of space is explored is silly, at least without a lot of explanation and caveats. </p></div>		</li>

<p>1) Their job is to write articles and those articles are products to be consumed. The more readers, the more profitable the site is. This means investing a lot in a few deeply researched and well thought out articles, or cranking out loads of pop science level articles for mass consumption.</p>

<p>When I've pointed this out in discussions of &quot;why are these articles so shitty&quot;--that partly it's because the writers have to keep putting out articles at a regular pace, even on occasions when they have little or nothing legitimate to say, so they'll do what they have to in order to produce an appropriate length essay that will attract eyes--it gets ignored.  I've never understood why.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But is the universe REALLY infinite? From what I know it's in a steady expansion, getting slower and slower over time. So it could be 96% undiscovered from what it had expanded till now, although I do understand that we don't know how much it has expanded. On a side note, 96% undiscovered seems like a way too inflated percentage, it seems unbelievable to me that we discovered 4%.</p></div>		</li>
