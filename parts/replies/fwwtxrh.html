<p>A new paradigm for rabies vaccines followed the development of cell culture for virus propagation. <strong>The first tissue culture vaccine was derived from virus grown in primary hamster kidney cells</strong> [18,19]. This was followed by growth of fixed RABV (see Box 1) in a human diploid cell line [21]. The lung-derived cell line WI-38 was used initially, but was switched subsequently to the MRC-5 cell line, which resulted in the development and licensing of a human diploid cell vaccine (HDCV) in the mid-1970s. An alternative to HDCVwas the use of purified chick embryo cells (PCEC) [22]. These vaccines are now used successfully worldwide.</p>

<p>I suppose that would be prevalence shift, not antigenic shift but that's also occurring. Gotta love those tenacious little bacteria.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not your fault.  It's very hard to get a bacteria to hold still for a needle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is mutating (slowly), but the part we will target with the vaccine (the spike) likely won’t mutate significantly. That would make it less able to infect cells, which would be less successful.</p></div>		</li>
