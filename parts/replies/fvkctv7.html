			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is correct.  </p>
<p>I'm surprised at the answers that don't realize this is a vaccination strategy.  In some remote areas, the live attenuated polio vaccine was used because they could just get a few people in a village vaccinated and it would pass onto others as an infection. It occasionally can mutate into a dangerous form.  There's more information here: <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/what-is-vaccine-derived-polio" target="_blank">https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/what-is-vaccine-derived-polio</a></p>
<p>Polio, by the way, should be eradicated in the next decade or so.  They are down to about 100 cases per year.  These are mostly occuring in the Pakistan/Afghanistan border regions where the public health vaccinations can't safely go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, and its a major public health achievement. Most people have no idea what an iron lung is, or how many children were crippled or killed by polio.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of my mother's friends is a woman who was one of the last people in Australia to have polio, and she walks with a limp because of it.  Every year she gives a presentation at a nearby university to medical students where she talks about just how bad not having vaccines actually is, as someone who lived through it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have an uncle who got polio during the US polio epidemic many years ago. He cheated on his wife and got the woman pregnant. That woman is an antivaxxer and I remember him saying to her, 'Do you want our son to end up like me?&quot; He must use a cane and is now facing the end of his life due to complications from polio.</p>
<p>Crazy guy. Snuck the kid to his doctor and got him every vaccination he could. Asked me to do the same for him when he dies (I'm a nurse, although he is the father and can make sure decisions, I don't think I would be afforded such legal protections, not that anyone would report me).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be specific there are two main polio vaccines. The sabin vaccine is the live attenuated one. It's administered as drops in the mouth. There salk vaccine is a inactivated vaccine. It has to be injected into a muscle. The sabin vaccine has been one of the cornerstones of polio eradication since its easy to administer. There is a lot of talk about switching to the salk vaccine for most places now that the risk of vaccine derived strains has become bigger than natural polio strains in most places.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not eradicated fully. We've got it contained down to a few places in Africa and Asia minor. I think Afghanistan and Pakistan are the two main remaining places with wild poliovirus still endemic. Africa  has some vaccine reverted strains running around I believe. I do public health for a different virus (hepatitis viruses) so I'm probably a little out of date on the eradication campaign for poliovirus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you don't mind my asking you instead of using google, what makes these weakened viruses weaker than natural polio? They didn't have gene editing back then, so how did they weaken the virus while allowing it to apparently maintain some ability to infect others?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could gene edit it, but thats more complicated and many of these vaccines were made before it was possible. Most live attenuated vaccines are made by passaging the virus many times in non-human cells or animals until the virus “forgets” how to properly infect human cells. More specifically the virus just wont bind as well to human cells since they’ve been adapted to cells from a monkey etc. </p>
<p>Then comes years of testing and human trials to make sure its safe and works.</p>
<p>Most vaccines are not live attenuated. The shots you get are usually inactivated “dead” viruses. And also other live attenuated vaccines dont usually spread the way the polio one has (which also barely spreads at all).</p></div>		</li>
