			<div class="markdown"><p>Tried that In college for a planned week just to see. No joke. Reason was I was at a tailgate and this frat boy walking to the game in front of me was trashed and said “I need some water” and his buddy said, “it’s alright, beer has water in it” </p>
<p>Got me thinking. So I tried nothing but coors light just to see for that planned week. It was exhausting, felt like total shit, made it to the end of day 3 before I needed water and some pedialyte. </p>
<p>If you think what you said is sustainable for fucking 10 years, I gave some news for you. Try it for a week.</p>
<p>Edit: fuck it alright. I’m still young and not that far out of college and have nothing else to do. Motherfuckers testing me. I will set aside a week to do nothing but beer. It’s coors light because it was 4 percent or whatever and seemed to be the best one with water content.  And I like coors light.</p>
<p>I’ll set up an actual experiment to stave off anecdotes and all that shit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I literally replaced water with coors light. Thing of every time you need or want water. It was coors light.</p>
<p>I may have been able to control it better if I wasn’t working, working out etc. But think of how much you drink water in a three day period and replace it with coors light</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean they are still right, just because it's uncomfortable and you couldn't handle it doesn't mean they are wrong.  You can absolutely sustain yourself by replacing all liquids with beer.  2% or lower beers (which are admittedly somewhat rare) have almost no difference in hydration between them and water and even using up to 5% beer, hydration can be fully restored from a dehydrated state. <a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/jappl.1997.83.4.1152" target="_blank">*</a>  It takes noticeably longer to reach hydration the higher the alcohol content so the stronger the drink the less effective it is at re-hydrating you.  </p>
<p>Also your last line speaks to the fact that you do not have any experience with crippling alcoholism.  You should consider yourself very lucky this is the case.  Speaking from personal experience of watching more than one family member drown their lives in a bottle, you can live a very long time without ever drinking pure water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing I would add to this is that most of the water we need daily comes from food. So between eating food and drinking alcoholic beverages, the average alcoholic would certainly be hydrated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you feed your body beer and no water it <strong>will</strong> adjust. Our bodies are both extremely resilient and also pretty fragile in other ways. It's not like you're gonna just fall over and die if you only drink beer, you might feel shitty for a while but your body will absolutely adjust to the new normal.</p>
<p>Kinda like why alcoholics need more to get drunk, their body has built up a tolerance and deals with it more efficiently.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Until it doesn't and the liver damage takes over. At which point their bodies don't really metabolise the ethanol anymore and so that can be drunk an entire day from just a sip of cardimom extract.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Totally. During my backpacking days I had the same bottle of water by my bed for up to 5 days. Beer was hydration and nutrition most of the time.  The hangover stops after few days</p></div>		</li>
