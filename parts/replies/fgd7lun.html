			<div class="markdown"><p>I can explain exactly why: when you have one thing hitting an immovable object then you have the kinetic energy of that thing that needs to be absorbed by deformation of that thing. If you have two of the same object hitting each other, you have twice the energy but you also have twice the capability to absorb the energy by deformation. So both will deform as if they each hit an immovable object.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a physicist, but here is how I think about it:</p>
<p>Car driving at wall 50mph - it hits the wall. The energy from the 50mph must go somewhere - to cause 50mph worth of ouchies. The wall is pretty solid, so the vast majority of it goes into the car. The car recieves 50mph of ouchies.</p>
<p>Two cars, 50mph each, driving towards each other in opposite directions - they hit each other. There is energy from the 50mph from one car, and the same amount coming from the second. That is the equivalent of 100mph worth of ouchies. Since there are two cars, with equal properties for recieving ouchies - both cars receive equal amounts of ouch. So 100mph/2 is 50mph of ouchies for each car.</p>
<p>Ouch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is going to sound like I'm joking but it's a genuine question</p>
<p>If that's the case, why don't we make cars out of brick walls, or walls out of cars? This explanation seems to suggest that the important factor is the material of what's absorbing the energy, but that doesn't seem right to me.</p>
<p>And wouldn't the amount of damage done to either car depend on the material the car's made out of, not be an equal fifty fifty split? </p>
<p>What am I missing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be less force than both. It’s not immovable, and it’s not head on.</p>
<p>Think of it like this, would you prefer to punch, as hard as you can;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A fixed steel post that wouldn’t move</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A steel post hanging from a rope</p>
</li>
<li>A steel post swinging slowly toward you with the same amount of force as your punch</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's good because you only have the energy from 1 moving vehicle and you have the crumple zones of 2. Plus the stationary vehicle would move from the force, further dissipating energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kinetic energy is proportional to velocity squared though, so one object moving at 100 mph has twice as much energy as two objects moving at 50 mph.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Momentum and kinetic energy are different. Momentum doubles, kinetic energy quadruples.</p>
<p>Which is also why the 100mph hit is worse, there's more energy around to crap up things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but you still have a symmetry condition when you have two of them so each of them will still absorb the energy related to that car.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven’t watched that episode but it feels like you might be misinterpreting something. The force transferred to a baseball is not the same when you bunt as when you smash a home run. </p>
<p>In baseball if everything else is the same but the only difference is the speed of the bat, then there is absolutely a different amount of force acting on the baseball. If the only difference in a car crash is whether one car is stationary vs traveling at the other car, then the force will absolutely be greater. If the question is whether there is more force in a head on collision with another car or a car hitting a stationary, immovable wall, then there are certainly many more variables at play.</p>
<p>It is simply not true that a car hitting a stationary car at 50 mph is the same force as those same two cars in a head on collision with both traveling 50 mph.</p></div>		</li>
