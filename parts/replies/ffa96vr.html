			<div class="markdown"><p>Some more context:</p>
<p>Fast pathway neuron signal a second neuron to open the pain gate, but that fast neuron also directly signals the pain gate to close. So what happens is the pain gate is opened quickly then closed quickly from the fast pathway, then it opens more slowly through the slow pathway, which is likely when you feel the full extent of pain.</p>
<p>A good diagram can be found on the top of this link:</p>

<p>L is the faster pathway (large fiber)
S is the slow pathway (short fiber)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's the purpose of having a fast and a slow signal? Is one to get your attention and the slower one for actually telling you how bad an injury is? (someone else said neither of these signals is related to the reflex that makes you drop hot things)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fast signals are thick, highly insulated nerve fibers that take a lot of energy to maintain. Pain? Knowing where your limbs are? Running from danger? Those are worth the expensive, fast fibers because they keep you alive and need to work quickly. Hungry? Dull, achy pain? Sweat? Those neurons are slower and cheaper to maintain because those functions don't need to be as fast. This is very ELI5, but that's the basics for how we think the different nerve fibers evolved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. There is more to your brain than the &quot;thinking&quot;, conscious part you are most aware of, called the cerebral cortex.</p>
<p>There are more &quot;primitive&quot; aspects of your brain that can function largely without input from your cerebral cortex. </p>
<p>Have you ever performed or observed a reaction that seemed almost perfect? Catching your fall, dodging out of harms way, protecting a kids head as they fall from height? Those reactions do not require &quot;processing&quot; in the cerebral cortex. Certain parts of your brain (the amygdala being the only part I remember off hand) have &quot;direct lines&quot; to act on your &quot;thinking self's&quot; behalf and can issue movement signals faster than if the signals were produced by the cerebral cortex. A wonderful self-preservation mechanism for when fractional seconds matter.</p></div>		</li>
