We know so much less about the ocean than land aside from coastal waters...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Blue whales are not deep sea dwellers.
For something to grow to be the size of a blue whale would require food to be present in abundance. All the indications are that the ocean was pretty close to stagnant, meaning that less nutrients, which means less complex life that cannot support large fauna.</p>
<p>Meaning that we most likely did not have any mega fauna under water back then</p></div>		</li>

Not a period of Earth's history I'm familiar with so this is all fascinating stuff.</p></div>		</li>
