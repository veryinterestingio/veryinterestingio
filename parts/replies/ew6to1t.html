			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, not at all. This happens in vitro because the only factor at play is the reagent antibodies you're using to determine blood type. In vivo, you're going to get destruction of the foreign red cells.</p>
<p>Edit: </p>
<p>To clarify, that agglutination reaction occurs when antibodies bind to multiple red cells, causing the formation of visible &quot;clots.&quot; This is different from true blood clotting, which is mediated by platelets. When antibodies bind red cells within the body, they don't remain clumped together, but instead are destroyed by various mechanisms, such as the complement system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting.<br />
So if the red blood cells are destroyed what happens to the platelets?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You mean the patient's platelets or the foreign platelets? Patient's platelets won't really be involved at all in this type of reaction. Stimuli that activate platelets aren't present in a hemolytic transfusion reaction, unless somehow enough damage is done by complement that collagen inside of blood vessels becomes exposed. In this case, the platelets still aren't going to be problematic, they're just going to attempt to patch up the damaged blood vessel. There may be a chance of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) occurring with a hemolytic transfusion reaction like you said, but this isn't going to be your primary concern. More likely than not, you're going to lose the patient to something else before blood clots become an issue. Foreign platelets may or may not be lysed by the immune system as well, but platelet antigens are not the same as red cell antigens, so an entirely different antibody would most likely have to be present. Typically you transfuse packed red cells rather than whole blood, meaning no platelets are going to be present in the unit you're giving the patient.</p></div>		</li>
