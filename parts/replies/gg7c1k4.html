			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really enough to worry about.  There's perhaps 5 litres of blood, and you are talking about maybe 2 ml, and it's not all sugar.  Your body wouldn't even notice it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>as saggitarius points out - it's to mimic the levels in the blood. It wouldn't be a few cc's of just sugar or just cholesterol - it's mostly water with important proportions of the important bits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cholesterol isn't actually a bad thing, indeed, its very important. It's an essential part of our diet and physiology. Cholsterol problems generally arise due to other problems, for example with the liver, or an extremely poor diet over the long term.</p>
<p>There is nothing to worry about in this case, because not only is it a small amount, but even if it was a larger amount, a one time intake of cholesterol is not associated with any health issues at all.</p></div>		</li>
