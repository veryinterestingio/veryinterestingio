			<div class="markdown"><p>I like the literal breakdown - think about an 'event' in the most general sense. Like a ship disappearing beyond a traditional horizon, beyond the event horizon, you can't observe any events because even <em>light</em> cannot escape to indicate some event has happened.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The most interesting bit of this is that whatever occurs at the event horizon, for as long as you can observe the light traveling from that location, will appear frozen in time from the point it crosses that threshold.  So, a ship moving over the event horizon would appear to be moving at exceptional speed (most likely because of the gravity pulling it into the event itself), and then suddenly stop.  Once the light coming from that object at that point in time has stopped arriving from that location, the object will just fade into oblivion and disappear.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to special theory of relativity, the faster you move the more (relativistic) mass you have. If any objects with non-zero mass reaches the speed of light, it's mass becomes infinite, which is impossible. So the only things which can move with the speed of light are things with no mass, i.e. light.</p>
<p>As to why the speed of light the way it is, there is no reason. It's just the upper limit of speed with which information can travel. The only exception is the space itself, which can and does expand faster than light.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you think gravitational influence is limited to the speed of light too?</p>
<p>For example, if the sun were to instantaneously disappear, we would continue to orbit for the 6 minutes it takes the last light (and lack of gravitational pull) to reach us? I know it's nearly impossible to observably measure the speed of light beyond theoretical reasoning, but is the same with gravitational influence?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Light travels instantly, but there is limit on the speed of reality; a maximum speed at which events in one part of the universe can cross into and cause effects in other parts of the universe. </p>
<p>If you push one end of a ruler, the other end should move at the same time (if the ruler was perfectly hard), but regardless of how elastic the ruler is, it also actually takes some time for the event of the push to propagate through reality to the other end of the ruler. The soonest that the far end of the ruler can know about and react to a change in reality elsewhere (the push which happened at its other end) is limited by the speed of reality across that distance. The ruler end can't move until the new change in reality has reached it.</p>
<p>Because we can see light, and because light is instantaneous, we can thus see the speed of the universe from how long it takes for light to propagate from one place to another. </p>
<p>We call this limit the speed of light, because the speed it restricts light to traveling at is how we observe the speed limit of the universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is for this reason why the way we use &quot;speed of light&quot; is a misnomer and should actually be &quot;speed of causality.&quot; Growing up even into college I always wondered why things depended so much on the speed of light which they don't. They depend if the speed of causality which is the speed in which light is limited to. It's the same value but it's a totally different idea in terms of describing and understanding the universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're always traveling through spacetime at the speed of light. Usually most of that speed is traveling in the &quot;time&quot; direction. You can't ever change speed; you can only change how much of your speed is in the direction of space vs. time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The escape velocity explanation, while easy to understand, is not entirely accurate.</p>
<p>Escape velocity can be though of as the speed at which you would need to be shot out of a cannon in order to fully escape the pull of gravity. It's an initial velocity, not sustained.</p>
<p>Rockets that leave earth do not travel at Earth's escape velocity (which is around 11km/s, ridiculously fast). They don't have to because they have a constant thrust.</p>
<p>The reason you can't escape a black hole, as u/thelosermonster explains, is a separate issue. The spacetime around the hole inside the event horizon is so warped that moving in any direction will lead you to the center.</p></div>		</li>
