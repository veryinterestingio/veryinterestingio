			<div class="markdown"><p>My car does something similarly weird, it can idle at 800rpm when hot and sitting doing nothing, but the air conditioning apparently prefers around 1100rpm because it'll jump to that as soon as I turn the AC on, still just sitting there, I assume it's programming in the engine management</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AC pumps are usually belt driven, so are a direct mechanical load on the engine. I imagine the engine runs up to 1100rpm to help prevent stalling due to the increased load, or be ause the compressor needs to run at a minimum rpm to function.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your right. The ECU ramps up the idle speed when the A/C comes on so that the engine doesn't stall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My guess - when they turn on the rear defrost the engine rpm doesn't change, but something else that uses power from the alternator is changing.  Maybe the cabin heater fan or the radiator fan slows down from the sudden increased load on the alternator so it sounds like the engine is slowing down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, the RPM drops briefly, you can see it visibly with the RPM gauge (at least on my car).   The engine management kicks in and brings the RPM back up to the programmed idle.</p></div>		</li>
