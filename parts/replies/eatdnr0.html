			<div class="markdown"><p>AFAIK there are no absorbent mammal hairs. Wool and furs do not hold water because no mammal can survive soaked in water with no way to dry off. That's why wool is the preferred natural fiber for hiking/camping clothes. Also why getting caught in the rain in your dress slacks is fine because they dry off quickly but getting caught in the rain in your jeans ruins your day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My little husky repels water like crazy. She'll go in the river and soak herself completely and is dry 15 minutes later. When she gets muddy I just take her for a little bit longer of a walk and a quick roll on some grass or snow and it all comes off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The American Eskimo dog has nothing to do with Arctic animals, Eskimos, Canada, First Peoples. </p>
<p>It's a white coat variant of the German Spitz land race of dogs. </p>
<p>Also, Australian Shepherds are not Australian. English Shepherds are not English. Both of those breeds were developed in America. Chinese Crested have nothing to do with China (Mixed from Mexican hairless and other toy breeds).</p>
<p>There are many more examples. </p>
<p>Great Danes and Dalmatians are also suspect for origins in those respective lands. Most breeds are the work of either the British or German kennel clubs. Exotic foreign names have a sense of uniqueness and value, but are rarely accurate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is. And after a while your body sort of adjusts and most people's hair will start to look less greasy/dirty. The same thing happens when using a lot of shampoos without sulfates - it won't strip your hair of all its oils.</p>
<p>Difference is, unlike animals, we shed our head hear much less often. Our arm and leg hair doesn't grow super long before shedding usually, but since head hear just keeps growing and doesn't naturally fall out (<em>for a much longer time, lol), it gets gradually harder for the oils from your scalp to coat all your hair. </em>With at least straightish hair, head hair that isn't washed at least every few days can definitely get gross and start to smell. Without brushing (and detangling/distributing oils) you get clumpy hair mats, like animals will if unhealthy *or not properly cared for, even if healthy (my bad - used to shorter-haired pets). Kind of like dreds, but most current people with dreds also take care of them. Think of it more like dirty hippie guy dreds.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Clumpy hair mats do not happen only if you're unhealthy. They happen commonly in long hair dogs whose coats are not properly taken care of. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note: People with curly hair should not brush their hair unless they are in the shower with conditioner in, and many choose not to brush their hair in the traditional sense at all, instead just using their fingers to detangle.</p>
<p>Many also don't &quot;wash&quot; in the traditional sense, and only rinse with water and/or &quot;wash&quot; with conditioner only, and only use shampoo every couple weeks. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, and that's why people recommend using hair brushes/scalp massaging brushes to distribute the oils from your scalp evenly all along your hair.</p>
<p>Amusing that when people hear you don't use shampoo, they instantly imagine you're a dirty greasy hippy who just doesn't groom at all</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. The issue is that for some people, it really does smell no matter what they do. </p>
<p>A lot of modern hygiene is just to keep us from smelling each other, not for health reasons </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is going to look awful out of context in my comment history, but I completely stopped using soap and shampoo in the shower about 10 months ago and I never went back.</p>
<p>Once I got past the dreadful fear that I would constantly smell, that my hair would be insanely oily or greasy, and that everyone would notice... I loved it.</p>
<p>Turns out, you don't smell, water washes away bacteria in seconds just as well as soap, and your skin feels incredible and soft all the time.</p>
<p>Your body stops freaking out trying to produce enough oil to make up for all the oil you're washing away every day.</p>
<p>My hair is also awesome. If I ever want to give it a boost a little apple cider vinegar diluted in water makes an amazing conditioner.</p></div>		</li>
