			<div class="markdown"><p>This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_and_dependencies_by_total_fertility_rate" target="_blank">data</a> is also relevant. If you follow through to the total fertility rate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_fertility_rate" target="_blank">page</a>,  and scroll down, you can see how the world wide TFR has plummeted by nearly 50% since 1950. You'll also want to scroll down to &quot;replacement rates&quot; on that page, because once TFR goes below 2.1, the population is no longer self sustaining. Going back to the TFR by country page, there are <em>many</em> countries below that point.</p>
<p>While this kinda data doesn't answer the question are people doing this because they &quot;want to,&quot; one can assume that's a significant factor, one way or the other. Another possibility is delayed child rearing decision leading to later life inability to have kids, or kinda just falling out of it. Which is not quite by intention, but not quite by accident, either.</p></div>		</li>
