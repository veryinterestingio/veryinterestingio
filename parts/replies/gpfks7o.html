			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have a mass that is so large that its bottom is at a higher gravity than its top, it can start to have a very wierd tumbling orbit. The object has to be a significant fraction of the size of the thing it is orbiting. For an object in Earth or solar orbit this would lead to stresses that tear it apart. If the object is orbiting an asteroid or something small, it can stay together.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In general, the opposite.</p>
<p>An object in orbit  tends  to orient itself with its  long axis perpendicular to the  plane of the orbit </p>
<p>(it'll be  oriented  &quot;<a href="https://image.shutterstock.com/image-vector/medieval-tower-facade-old-town-600w-1220754670.jpg" target="_blank">like a tower</a>&quot; rather than  &quot;<a href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSY_W_kKqJRz5bEFFG4eqjIeDPvSO-7tSFscw&amp;usqp=CAU" target="_blank">like a train car</a>&quot;)</p>
<p>and that will be a stable orientation  -  it'll stay in that orientation  (as it's orbiting)   unless something re-orients  it. </p>

<p>If a  planet  or other body is  closer to its primary than the Roche limit,  </p>
<p>then it'll come  apart,  but that  isn't  primarily about  the object's shape. </p>
