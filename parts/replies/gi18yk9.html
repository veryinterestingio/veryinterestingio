<p>Edit: it also has some mild dopaminergic activity as well which can boost mood and libido to a minor degree, after consulting lexicomp.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was prescribed it for anxiety, but turns out it’s being prescribed off-label for low-libido in women. I do not have a low libido. The first three months I was on buspirone I was so horny I thought I was losing my mind. I was beating it three times a day just to be functional. Eventually it settled down to a more tolerable level.</p></div>		</li>
