			<div class="markdown"><p>I do this to fill up my boat. For whatever reason the boat can be pretty much bone dry with a 40 gallon tank. If I pump it normally it will stop all the time, if I flip the handle upside down it will fill up as normal. Inevitably this results in a little bit of spillage at the end but it’s very minor and worth not having to spend 45 minutes at the pump trying to fill.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily for the purpose of overfilling but custom designed vehicles like work trucks will usually have oddly designed fuel lines that often cause a splash back which triggers the fuel stop. The different angle can prevent this so you're not resetting the trigger several dozen times while refueling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And as a former gas station manager, DON'T do this. You ever had the pump overflow on you while you were cleaning your windows and things? That's because the last person at the pump either did this or kept clicking to &quot;top off&quot; their tank. When you do this, the air bladder that shuts off the flow automatically gets filled with gasoline and will not work properly for the next person.</p>
<p>There's a damn reason it says &quot;DO NOT top off&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also tip: don't. If you do this, you will inevitably inhale some gases that the fuel releases, and that's bad for your lungs. Also, the fuel tank and station were built with this devices for security measures, overpassing them can cause accidents.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you!!! The amount of people saying this is okay to do is crazy. There's a reason I was cleaning 5+ spills PER day, so people could get their prescious 0.80¢ extra in their tank. The environment can take one for the team right!? /s</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats not exactly true. There's plenty of electronics designed for use in contact with flammable materials or atmospheres. They're called intrinsically safe. So they are sealed and rated for classified hazardous areas. That said, the venturi method is the cheapest and still highly reliable. Devices suitable for the location are bulky and expensive. That's the real reason they aren't used.</p></div>		</li>
