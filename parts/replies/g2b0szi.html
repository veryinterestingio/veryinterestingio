			<div class="markdown"><p>I think people really overstate Baghdad’s importance. Was it a horrible thing that the Mongols did, and did it destroy thousands of irreplaceable scrolls and treatises. But that doesn’t mean that knowledge in the Middle East was set back. There were still schools of learning in Egypt, North Africa, Iberia, Anatolia, etc. The Abassid dynasty also wasn’t a major powerhouse by that point, they had fractured in the years prior to the Mongols. </p>
<p>There wasn’t even a “technological gap,” between the Muslim and Christian world until relatively recently. The Mamluk Sultanate, and especially the Ottoman Empire were all strong states with huge centers of culture and learning.</p></div>		</li>
