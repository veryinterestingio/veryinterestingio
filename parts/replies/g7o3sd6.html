			<div class="markdown"><p>While this is true in a static system, as soon as someone opens a tap this changes. The more pipe the water goes through, the less pressure it will have at the end point due to friction losses.</p>
<p>Edit: Energy, not pressure; but the energy at the tap will be felt as pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This also causes a pressure gradient in the pipe system when the tap is open. You can observe this using a Venturi meter which in turn allows you to measure the flow rate without having to put a turbine or similar into the system which would disrupt the flow that you are trying to measure</p>
<p>Edit: you can observe the same principle by placing pressure gauges along a pipe at regular interval.  The pressure will be the same everywhere when no flow is happening. If you crack a tap open a tiny bit then you will get a high pressure jet of water but very little change in the pipe pressure. As you open a tap more flow you will see the pressure of the jet reduce (the water comes out slower) and you will start to see the pressure reduce as you get further along the pipe from the source. </p>
<p>For this experiment to work really well, you will need a small pipe supplied by a much larger pipe or a reservoir with constant pressure otherwise part of your pressure loss will occur before the tap supplying your test rig</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why is water not compressible?  Is it the structure of the bonded atoms that resists compression or, some other factor?  Not a science guyâ€”thanks for piquing my curiosity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Liquid water is extremely resistant to changing its volume compared to gaseous water because in liquid water there are more intermolecular forces at play.</p>
<p>The water molecule has oxygen and hydrogen. Oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen, in an OH covalent bond the electrons want to spend more time near the oxygen than the hydrogen and on average there's a slightly negative charge on the oxygen and slightly positive one on the hydrogen.</p>
<p>Hydrogen binding in water happens when the positive hydrogen of one water molecule and the negative oxygen of another interact, creating a lower energy level for the two molecules being within a certain distance.</p>
<p>This gives liquid water a tendency to hold its molecules within certain distances. When you heat it to a gas, the intermolecular forces still exist but the average energy of the molecules is much higher and the molecules can kinetically overcome the binding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oxygen for example has molecules that are fairly far apart, so you can push them together somewhat easily. Water has molecules that are very close together, basically almost touching. You can't really push them closer together by much without the forces that repel molecules from one another severely interfering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately this answer is not right, what you have said applies to normal liquids that would be more compressible than water. Water has a more special reason for not compressing. I wrote another reply to the question if you would like to take a look.</p></div>		</li>
