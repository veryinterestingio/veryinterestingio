			<div class="markdown"><p>Psychiatry doesn’t work like that - it takes years and years for new drugs to be developed, tested and approved and we haven’t really had many <em>truly</em> new or innovative drugs in a couple of decades, arguably longer. Benzodiazepines are still the go-to for panic disorder but they’re extremely addictive and dangerous. Despite this, hoards of doctors dispense them like candy. They’ve been around forever. If any other medical science progressed this slowly it would be considered a joke.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're slowly pushing more SNRIs - although they don't work in an acute panic attack, they work on anxiety to level things out more to prevent it from happening in the first place. You're right though. We work with the same neurotransmitters and the same drugs for years. They're finally starting to realize serotonin isn't the root of everything</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That feeling you recognize <em>is</em> anxiety. It's a fundamental emotion brought on during a fight-or-flight response.</p>
<p>Anxiety disorders are diagnosed when anxiety has a deleterious effect  on function.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, so you don't get panic attacks otherwise, just the one medically induced attack? I'd be way scared that it would be the catalyst for future panic attacks, but that's probably just because I get panic attacks, and... Well, idk.</p>
<p>I kind of wish everyone who <em>didn't</em> have panic attacks could experience a situation like yours just once, so they'd understand what it's like. Imagine that experience but it happens at random times, totally out of nowhere, maybe even daily, and sometimes lasts for an hour or two. I would not wish that shit on my worst enemy. It sucks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Best way I describe mine?</p>
<p>You know that feeling when you miss a step and think you're going to fall? Or when you swing too far back on a chair and think you'll tip over?</p>
<p>That's what a panic attack feels like, but those seconds last for minutes, and those minutes feel like hours. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get so highly aggressive during mine it becomes almost impossible to function without trying to take a swing at things.  I'll be going along, and out of nowhere, everything is the worst thing ever and out to get me and I have to protect myself, verbally and physically.  Afterwards, I end up so drained I'm usually on the verge of disassociating.</p>
<p>It's not a great trait to have when working customer service...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mine is accompanied with crippling headache. To the point where thinking is impossible. Often I am in severe anxiety and I cannot even go back and figure out what I am anxious about. I try to follow my thoughts before it happened, but any attempt at thought longer than two seconds is futile.</p></div>		</li>
