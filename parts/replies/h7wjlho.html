			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember seeing both the tub and the showers, in various televised events. I'll provisionally accept that they're showering to warm up, but it really doesn't look like the showers are putting out the same amount of flow that a domestic shower would do.</p>
<p>Maybe the water's, like, on the really really warm side, and they only need a little bump of it to warm back up. But also count me as asking about that point: are the showers really to warm up?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>theres a number of things it could be
chlorine is an irritant, and dries out your skin, so waiting for the next dive might get mildly irritating, so showering it off would help keep concentration, particularly after several dives.</p>
<p>the brief hit of warm water would replace the cold water sitting on them. they're not really in the pii8that long, their actual body temp probably isnt affected much, but sitting around with cold water on you would quickly change that.</p>
<p>help stop muscle cramps, you dont need to relax the muscles, just buffer against cramps</p>
<p>plus probably a lot of other small things, which its probably a combination of most of the possible factors.</p>
<p>EDIT: looked it up, cramps and rinsing off the cold pool water is apparently the cause, according to Jacob Brehmer, a diving coach (a university one, not an olympic one, to be clear)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had always assumed the chlorine was the major factor, but I figured: &quot;how much chlorine did they really need to wash off, after only being in the pool for 18 seconds?&quot;</p>
<p>On the other hand, they slammed into that water, after falling ten meters...so it could super-blast that crap into every pore, all at once.</p></div>		</li>
