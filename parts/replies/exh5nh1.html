			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but if anything its a recognition that your body is adapted to do it in a certain way. Basically your body is like &quot;if I've been up this long, its probably for a good reason.&quot; Which is a helpful response because many situations where you would <em>need</em> to stay up benefit from that extra boost. Unfortunately, the body can't necessarily differentiate those times from when you really should just go the fuck to sleep.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Body: &quot;Are we out of danger? I don't know how much longer i can keep this up&quot;</p>
<p>Brain: &quot;Just... keep....going.... We need more time!&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right and I just wanted to add onto this- as mentioned and explained at the top of the thread, that &quot;good reason&quot; the body feels it should stay up partially comes with a perception of danger. But, it also can be tied to a perception of hunger. The body instinctively thinks, &quot;Oh you haven't eaten in so long and you've been awake for so long- you must be awake because you're searching for food. Let me make sure you stay awake and alert so you can find what you are looking for, for proper nourishment.&quot; That adrenaline uptick  or &quot;second wind&quot; is pretty interesting, as it's essentially two precautionary survival measures built into one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suffer from occasional insomnia, the worst I've had is 62 hours without sleep. The worst thing about it is that you feel great like you can take on anything, but while you try to you mess up just about everything like a drunk person would. Plus when I was that sleep deprived I was very prone to over thought which gave me anxiety</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is really unhealthy. You can generally go 4-5 days without water, 30 days without food, but the effects of not sleeping will start to take hold in just 3-4 days. Hallucinations can start in as little as 48hours and the longest recorded time awake without dying is about 11 days. </p>
<p>Scientists have no idea why, but sleep is incredibly important.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also good to point out that these chemicals (cortisol would be another) only make you feel like you're less tired and doing better than you actually are. Studies show that sleep deprivation worsens performance severely on motor tasks and problem solving</p></div>		</li>
