			<div class="markdown"><p>That is an excellent question, and I hope I can answer it to your satisfaction.</p>
<p>If you have taken a biology course in school, you may recall the Big B little b example used for eye color on a punnett square. It's an oversimplification of how genetics works, as there are often multiple genes that actually cause something to be expressed, but if you have seen this explanation you'll know that the little b won't ever really go away. Since it is recessive, it cannot be the expressed phenotype unless there are two copies of the gene. Albinism is similar. It's a recessive trait, so it can be carried (and generally is) but isn't expressed, and can't be expressed unless two carriers of the gene have offspring, and the offspring is unlucky enough to get two copies of the recessive.</p>
<p>If this doesn't make sense or if you haven't seen the example I'm talking about, here's a video from the Organic Chemistry Tutor on youtube.

<p>TL;DR recessive traits can remain in a population for long, long periods of time without being expressed. the only way to truly remove the genes from the gene pool would be to eliminate every member of the population with the given gene, but if it is not expressed this would be incredibly difficult to do. Same reason things like sickle-cell anemia and cystic fibrosis crop up in humans occasionally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sickle-cell anemia confers protection from malaria, and being heterozygous provides some protection. It creates a weird situation where there's a counterbalance to the negatives of sickle-cell anemia based on the sum total health of the rest of the population.</p>
<p>Cystic fibrosis heterozygotes are speculated to have a similar benefit, where the carriers are resistant to cholera or dissentary, in situations where you'd normally die from a lack of salts due to excreting all your chloride ions, combined with dehydration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also the thing that in loads of types of breeding in animals not every animal in the herd ever reasonably has a chance the breed.</p>
<p>So a sacrificial lamb type of mutation in the form of a recessive gene would actually help the other reproducing family members to survive predation and subsequently reproducing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd probably go one step further. If you put one white Chicken in with a stack of black ones, or vice versa, they will often peck the different looking chook to death. But they're all chooks, it shouldn't matter the colour of their feathers, and yet it seems to. I just consider it to be animal racism.</p></div>		</li>
