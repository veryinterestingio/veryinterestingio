			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember being told at immunology class, that we could even make antibodies against glucose if it is fused with something that our immune system thinks is hostile.</p>
<p>The case of having autoimmune diseases kinda proves, that our antigen detection is not fool proof.</p>
<p>Sometimes when virus is being made inside cell, and being secreted away. Vurus can be wrapped in a buble made of the host cell membrane, with the normal surface proteins of the host cell now on top of this virus.</p>
<p>Our immune defence detects the virus as foreing object. Structure gets studied for new antigens that will get new antibodies spesific to these antigens. If the virus had some host surface proteins on it - tough luck - they can get labelled too.</p>
<p>Type 1 diabetes is probably caused by this kind of chain of events. Some flu triggers false antigen detection --&gt; creation of antibodies --&gt; autoimmune reaction --&gt; body destroys own spesific cells that made insulin --&gt; no more insulin producing cells</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can't see your reply to me except for through my inbox, so I can't reply directly, but B cells don't really interact with the thymus much at all and autoreactive B cells don't get cleared there in any way. </p>
<p>Overly autoreactive T cells <em>do</em> develop and undergo negative selection in the thymus (it is their namesake, after all), but B cells do not. Generally autoreactive B cells just undergo processes like clonal deletion or receptor editing in the spleen or lymph nodes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not irregular for the DOD to fund biomedical research. Obviously they spend a lot on weapons research, A LOT on AI and comp sci, but they also want their people to not die. I work in biomedical research and know a lot of people who are funded by DOD grants and they just do pretty standard biomedical research (although the NIH are definitely the powerhouse for biomedical research funding, not the DOD). </p>
<p>I know a lot of the time the DOD likes funding designs that work universally, like working against any strain in the world, being stable at any temperature with any countries infrastructure, etc. Just looked up some articles on ferritin, turns out it is able to withstand high temp for uniquely high periods of time, is stable in many denaturants, etc, so it’s no surprise the DOD is interested</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Historically, the US military has at times pushed medical knowledge forward.  The major example <a href="https://armyhistory.org/major-walter-reed-and-the-eradication-of-yellow-fever/" target="_blank">would be Maj. Walter Reed and yellow fever</a> (yes, the Army hospital is named after him).  Prior to WW1, most military casualties were not caused by the enemy, but from disease, so it's not surprising the Army would be interested in dealing with infectious diseases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the responses to your question miss the key point - in addition to protecting serving military, the DOD is responsible for the Veterans Health Administration, which treats many millions of retirees. At least on paper, IIRC it's the single largest healthcare system in the US. With a large proportion of elderly patients.</p>
<p>They have an interest in funding all sorts of research, not just stuff related to combat injuries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While serving I’d hear horror stories of the VHA, only to find out it is exactly what a healthcare system should be. I’m 80% disabled from service so my healthcare there is basically free-free. They are evidence based healthcare that shields itself from profit driven forces. </p>
<p>For instance, I have really bad depression and anxiety. As my psych noted I am of reasonable mind and interested in ways to cope with it, they prescribed me books and videos, not medication. My civilian ortho said I needed a knee replacement. The VA ortho said a specific diet and therapy would have a better outcome. </p>
<p>What I’m trying to get at, the VA/VHA has been maximizing their funding for years and clearly is outcome and quality of life driven. It makes complete sense these and related agencies would be involved in research.</p></div>		</li>
