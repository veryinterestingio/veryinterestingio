			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember thinking I could cheat by using a mirror. </p>
<p>That is, if I can only see clearly a foot away, then by using a mirror and holding it a foot away, I should have 20/20 vision. </p>
<p>Nope, turns out that exploit has been patched out.</p>
<p>Edit: I've had at least 8 people tell me that using a phone works.  I know.  I explained why phones work but mirrors don't. Please read the replies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think zooming a camera is the wrong way of thinking about it - imagine a very detailed picture that you can enlarge afterwards and see tiny details that were captured. The thing that amazes me is how the eagle can tune in to exactly the thing it needs when it has such a high resolution of sight!</p></div>		</li>

<p>the human finger can discriminate between surfaces patterned with ridges as small as 13 nanometres in amplitude and non-patterned surfaces.</p>

<p>To compare, a human hair is ~90 <del>nm</del> μm, so 90,000 nanometres. Thank you for the corrections! My mind is 1000x more blown by this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our fingers are ridiculously sensitive. Not only that, but our finger dexterity is completely unmatched. A task as simple as holding forks, knives and spoons in a single hand and using that hand alone to sort them out as you put them in the drawer is something we take for granted. It's an incredible feat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, they don’t zoom in on what they’re focusing on, i.e. their image doesn’t “crop,” but their attention probably does. This is similar to how we operate. When you’re reading text, you’re dedicating very little mental resources to the visual field that is static, and not important to the ongoing task. That’s how most brains work. </p>
<p>Also, there’s not really a “little” brain, as in animals have the brain size needed for their lives, no more no less, and they do a remarkable amount with all the brain they have.</p></div>		</li>
