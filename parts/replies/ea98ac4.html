			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the analogy, although reading through your response and the rest of the thread brought up two more questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Speed of light is treated as a constant. I understand that it has been verified but I'm wrapping my head around <em>why</em> that is. My natural reaction is to treat speed as a variable value since the &quot;distance&quot; and &quot;time&quot; are fixed, but mysteriously it's the time that seems to fluctuate.</p>
</li>
<li>How does gravity &quot;bend&quot; space in the first place? Is it moving molecules to just be closer to it? Or is the fabric of the underlying matter being moved in some way? </li>
</ol>
<p>I don't know if these questions are phrased properly, but I'm just having a hard time wrapping my head around the concept. </p>
<p>Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1) Space is also not fixed. This is the difference between old physics and new physics that Einstein introduced called special relativity. Instead of lengths and time intervals being fixed and true for everyone, we realized it is actually that the speed of light which everyone agrees upon. This indeed gives many unintuitive consequences. Searching &quot;Time dilation&quot; and &quot;length contraction&quot; on google and youtube should get you very good introductory material on this topic.</p>
<p>2) Gravity <em>IS</em> the fact that spacetime is curved. Gravity doesnt cause it to curve. The presence of Energy/mass/momentum and pressure cause it to curve.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is a very important point, put very simply.</p>
<p>Gravity isn't the cause, it's the curve itself. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Sometimes you don't think it be like that, but it do</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>MinutePhysics has a great video on time dilation, but basically the speed of light in a vacuum is such because it doesn't have mass. Because it doesn't have mass, it is unaffected by gravity, and therefore won't change (it can change if it's in a different medium, like water or glass). </p>
<p>As for how gravity changes time, the simple answer is &quot;because.&quot; Unfortunately, not all things can be dumbed down and simplified, and special relativity is along those lines. Imagine a deflated balloon. If I start from space 0 and time 0, and move one over in each, I'm now at time 1 space 1.  What gravity does is inflate the balloon, but it only seems that way to the observer not on the balloon, and here's where it gets fucky. For you, near the gravity source, time won't change. You'll experience time going forward one and space forward one. However, what gravity has done is stretched that time distance out to other observers. Basically, you felt one minute, or moved one point on the y axis. But to an observer not affected by the gravity, they saw you move the equivalent of ten units on the uninflated balloon.</p>
<p>Edit: I realized I didn't really answer #2. Basically, we unfortunately have to accept that gravity affects spacetime. There's not really an explanation for why. The same way I can exert force and move something in 3 dimensions, gravity is a force that can act on the 4th dimension by causing a distortion in spacetime.</p>
<p>Another way to think of it is actually that gravity is not a force bending spacetime, but merely the representation of the bending of spacetime due to massive objects, but that may make less sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best explanation I've read so far. This makes me think vacuums arent as vacuum-ey as we think. Not that it would be filled with matter, buuut something?? It makes me think of how there's space between atoms, or the parts of an atom. If space/time can be stretched with no matter available to stretch, there must be something, right? (couldn't even begin to guess the nature of it though).</p></div>		</li>
