			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that's why if you're feeding a carrot to a horse, you have to make sure the carrot, and not your fingers, goes into its mouth.  The horse can tell them apart because it can't see them.  Horses have dexterous lips and that's how they typically collect grass.  When your food can't run from you, you don't need to be able to see it.  When animals might eat you, not being eaten while eating is subject to pretty strong evolutionary pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite. Horses have what is called &quot;ramped&quot; vision: the focal length of the lens changes from the top to the bottom of the eye, very like multifocal spectacle lenses for people. The result is they can not only see what they are eating, the can see anything coming towards them at the same time.</p>
<p>Another oddity of equine vision is that if something behind startles them they swivel both eyes back a little leaving a blind area in front of them. That's why bolting horses will sometimes crash into obstacles directly in front of them, often with horrendous results. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had never heard of &quot;ramped&quot; vision, wanted to know more, went googling.</p>
<p>Found <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10505953" target="_blank"><strong>this</strong></a>, a study in which it was found that </p>
<blockquote>
<p>'ramp retina' of the horse, once thought to result in head rotating visual behaviour, does not exist</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Not trying to call you out, I went around for decades telling people that elephants have 4 knees, only recently discovered they've long since determined elephants' front &quot;knees&quot; are actually just their wrists!  Anyway, just figured if you're as detail oriented as you sound from the comment, you'd be interested!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also interesting about horses is their eyes don’t communicate across hemispheres of the brain. So if they see something scary on one side of their body and then adjust (spook, then calm down, realizing it’s only a mailbox and not a dragon) you can’t assume they won’t spook again when you come back down that road later.  That same mailbox will be on the other side and the other eye/side of the brain will say “ahh! Dragon!” all over again. </p></div>		</li>
