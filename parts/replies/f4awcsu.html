<p>When you breathe, your blood is saturated by either oxygen, not-oxygen or it's not saturated at all. </p>
<p>The device (typically attached to your finger) measures how much of the blood <em>it can see</em> is <em>saturated</em>. </p>
<p>Now there are some problems with this. </p>
<ul>
<li>You could have too little blood circulating, but ~100% saturated. Machine will read nothing wrong.</li>
<li>It could be saturated by something else than oxygen. Some gasses saturate blood easier than oxygen. </li>
<li>It could simply not get a good reading (fingernail polish could muck with the detection*, cold fingers with reduced blood flow etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>As with everything in medicine, one should look at the numbers from machines as in relation to what other symptoms the patient presents.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my experience, it’s not nail polish, it’s the huge acrylic nails that are more of an issue. Anecdotally, there’s a super simple solution though... turn the probe 90 degrees and attach on a different angle (anyone have funding to prove validity?)
I do agree with the original comment regardless - treat your patient, not the machine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am thinking of bringing a cheap oximeter from amazon when I climb my Kilimanjaro (19,341') in a couple weeks. Do you think it will be useful at all? It will probably be really cold at the top of the mountain, but we could could still try to use it in the tents once our hands are warmed up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>didnt know the carbon monoxide thing. also wasnt sure about the anemia thing. Im a nurse too and I've always told people 02sat = % of hgb with o2 on it, therefore if youre anemic, pulse ox will not reflect your level of sob accurately. not that i dont trust you, but how confident are you in this? (like i said, it's what i've always thought but haven't confirmed)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's been decently well proven that carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin with up to 250 times greater affinity than oxygen to form carboxyhemoglobin, which falsely elevates spO2 readings when present. Other substances such as cyanide can do this as well. And you're correct that anemia can cause the O2 monitoring to not reflect SOB as accurately. Someone with low hemoglobin could very easily still feel short of breath even if they are reading 100%. No matter how hard someone breathes if there's not enough for the oxygen to bind to they probably aren't going to feel any better. You can try to hyper-oxygenate the person to increase the amount of O2 dissolved in the plasma but that's really only for emergencies/short term use because of the risk of oxygen toxicity. </p>
