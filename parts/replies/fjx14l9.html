			<div class="markdown"><p>I know right! Everyone and their brother explaining, awkwardly, how refrigerators work and how compressed air behaves and Iâ€™m thinking OP asked a fairly specific question concerning the canned air cleaners and why the can got cold not how the fuck his milk stays cold behind the little white door lmfao!!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. But most of the gas expansion is happening outside the can (when it goes from being under compression to atmospheric pressure), whereas the phase change is happening inside the can. Which you're holding.</p></div>		</li>
