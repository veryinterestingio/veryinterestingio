			<div class="markdown"><p>I coincidentally wrote a comment on that subject about two weeks ago in reply to another thread!  I just noticed right now that my comment no longer shows up for some reason though, even though I can see it on my history... weird.  Anyway, I'll copy it below and hopefully it won't disappear this time: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Insect metamorphosis has been studied for a very long time (understandably, since it is a really weird and interesting system if you think about it).  As some background, there are a few basic things we know pretty  definitively.  First, true metamorphosis appears to have evolved only once in insects.  Looking at <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Yeates/publication/267916365/figure/fig1/AS:668992461078543@1536511640688/Dated-phylogenetic-tree-of-insect-relationshipsThe-tree-was-inferred-through-a.png" target="_blank">this phylogeny</a> for reference, the most basal groups of insects (silverfish and bristletails) do not undergo metamorphosis at all, and are born looking pretty much <a href="http://homepests.info/wp-content/uploads/Silverfish-Life-Cycle.jpg" target="_blank">like smaller adults</a>.  </p>
<p>However, the sister group to these insects (Pterygota) appears to have evolved two things at around the same time: the ability to fly, and a form of incomplete metamorphosis (also called hemimetabolism).  Many modern groups of insects live this way, including dragonflies, grasshoppers, cockroaches, mantids, true bugs, etc.  Basically, these insects still have nymph stages that are vaguely <a href="http://www.saburchill.com/ans02/images2/210807001.jpg" target="_blank">similar looking to the adult</a>,  but only the adult is capable of flight.  This is actually a bigger change from the inferred ancestral state of all insects than it might appear.  Silverfish and friends can continuously moult throughout their adult lives, in some cases over 60 times (<a href="https://entnemdept.ifas.ufl.edu/creatures/URBAN/silverfish.HTM" target="_blank">source</a>), but hemimetabolous insects go through a limited number of moults and  then stop once they reach their final adult stage.  Actually, this is a bit of a tangent, but mayflies are the only insects with a flying &quot;subimago&quot; stage which then undergoes one last moult to become a true  adult; you've likely seen <a href="http://www.mayflynews.net/mayfly-photos/mayfly-pic-2013-Joaquim.jpg" target="_blank">something like this</a> before.  </p>
<p>Anyway, one subset of the Pterygota (Holometabola aka Endopterygota) at some point experienced another major development which resulted in what we now call &quot;complete&quot; metamorphosis.  This group includes many of the most familiar insects: butterflies, beetles, flies, bees, ants, etc.  Members of this group, as I'm sure you already know, have several <a href="https://plantheroes.org/sites/default/files/coconut_rhinoceros_beetle_life_cycle_small_1.jpeg" target="_blank">larval stages, a pupa, and an adult</a>.  </p>
<p>That might be a bit too much background info, but I think it helps to show that metamorphosis didn't just come out of nowhere.  There was initially a switch from indeterminate growth to having a final, distinct adult stage, and then later there was further separation of the pre-adult stages into larva and pupa, rather than just nymphs.  Another point that I think is important to mention here is that the evolution of  metamorphosis has often been invoked as an explanation for a major increase in insect diversity.  It's clear that <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DUVAJc5XkAAiRim.jpg?format=jpg&amp;name=orig" target="_blank">over 75% of insect species</a> undergo complete metamorphosis (including the &quot;big four&quot; groups Coleoptera, Diptera, Lepidoptera, and Hymenoptera; figure from <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-ento-020117-043348" target="_blank">Stork, 2018</a>), and there must be some explanation for this.  Some researchers have directly suggested that the evolution of metamorphosis led to increased speciation rates (e.g. <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0109085" target="_blank">Rainford et al. 2014</a>), while others suggest that the timeline doesn't exactly match up and it's probably more complicated than this (e.g. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep19208" target="_blank">Condamine et al. 2016</a>).  </p>
<p>So to finally get around to your actual question a bit more directly,  let's talk about how metamorphosis actually evolved.  As I alluded to a the start, there have been many ideas about this, ranging from the  notion that larvae are premature embryos, as suggested by both Aristotle and William Harvey (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24944920?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents" target="_blank">source</a>), to some truly insane ideas, like <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/08/25/0908357106" target="_blank">Williamson's hybridogenesis &quot;theory&quot;</a>.  It's been shown pretty conclusively that metamorphosis is mediated mostly by hormones (especially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_hormone" target="_blank">juvenile hormone</a>) and an associated suite of gene regulatory changes; see <a href="http://www.biologiaevolutiva.org/xbelles/pdfs/2011-Belles-ELS.pdf" target="_blank">Belles 2011</a> for a pretty good review of the factors that control this process.  In terms of how metamorphosis evolved though, there are still several different schools of thought.  I'm not an expert on this subject and so around this point I'm starting to hit my limits in terms of literature  familiarity, but one group of researchers actually seem to suggest  something that hearkens back to Aristotle: larvae simply developed as precocial embryos that hatch before becoming nymphs.  <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/46737.epdf?referrer_access_token=JhyEk0D7PLR-TYeExm7m69RgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0NG_q1GkoY4kw16vw3poEuFjPUiZ72-YMAIf-05XFa7xzWwR3iA2eJiayARbgDi-eYo2Kqg16W2eaIGIF5Lq0hauEWdmEXqvKl8s7vOPyCSi45_lztSqk6vkgQk1UhFbxcMs2qelRClZnb0BfiPHLoR6jvecgNnVEeY2u5JRyhQKWwnil397bDqhLhfWDj9ehss1tElPKO_ErfXc9rpCyPi&amp;tracking_referrer=www.scientificamerican.com" target="_blank">Truman and Riddiford</a> outline some impressive work related to this idea, though this paper may be considered out of date by now.  However, other work (e.g. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jmor.10338" target="_blank">Konopová and Zrzavý</a>) has shown that both holo- and hemimetabolous embryos undergo the same  number of pre-hatch moults, which presents some difficulties for the above theory.  </p>
<p>Ultimately, it is unsurprisingly quite difficult to get any definitive answers about the fine details of an evolutionary transition that occurred hundreds of millions of years ago.  There is certainly some fossil evidence that is potentially informative, but when it comes down to the molecular mechanisms involved in metamorphosis, we are restricted to looking at living species that have undoubtedly evolved many refinements to the process compared to their ancestors.  Additionally, though I know you asked about <em>how</em> metamorphosis evolved, many researchers have focused on the equally if not more interesting question of <em>why</em> it evolved, though I've written enough already and that's a discussion for another time.</p>

<p>I thought by sequencing the DNA we could kind of go through the history of the species. See which order the DNA was added to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Broadly speaking yes, epigenetics refers to changes that occur at the scale of gene regulation rather than actual mutations.  I don't think it would be incorrect to use in this context, but I avoided using that term here because a lot of people are more familiar with epigenetics being discussed in reference to inheritance of regulatory changes <em>across generations,</em> such as the passing on of genes that are downregulated through methylation.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96verkalix_study" target="_blank">This study</a> is probably one of the most famous ones to look at this kind of thing in humans, for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very far off. Regulation is not epigenetics. This thread has used it incorrectly a few times. A mechanism of epigenetics can be gene regulation but that is not what defines it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately I don't really know enough details to discuss it much further on my own, but it is indeed very interesting.  However, I will say though that the idea that everything just dissolves and is recreated during metamorphosis is a bit of an oversimplification.  The process is pretty definitely more orderly than that language implies, and it seems that the nervous system in particular remains fairly intact, though still with gains and losses of certain neural pathways relevant to adulthood (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/neu.480231005" target="_blank">source</a>).</p></div>		</li>
