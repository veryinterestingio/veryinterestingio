			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. The virus has to have quite different properties and adaptations to infect bacteria versus what’s needed to infect a human. Among animals, the properties are generally the same though, so I understand your concern. But bacteriophages are not a direct threat to human cells afaik</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bacteria, like all life forms, lives in some type of niche or balance within its environment. For people to selectively kill a portion of that population throws that balance off. That alone should give us pause.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bacteria is still a very important part of ecosystems, killing them off could affect systemic balance.  What that means exactly would depend on the case, but it could impact things like effective biodegradation of dead organisms, natural selection, and plant and animal population levels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How is it risky? How many new ideas actually go as planned.  A virus that’s really efficient at killing bacteria X, for all we know,  might be even better at killing skin cells and be super resilient and hard to detect.  Compared the the possibilities available with gene manipulation, we know virtually nothing.  It’s like giving a kid the tools to build a pipe bomb and vague instructions on how he can use them to build a BB gun.  You might end up with a BB gun.  You might end up with a neighborhood full of accidentally dead kids.</p></div>		</li>
