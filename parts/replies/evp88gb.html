			<div class="markdown"><p>Also for this specific case, if you have a more recently made NAND-based flash drive or SSD, youâ€™ll see different read and program latencies as you move through the block.</p>
<p>Engineers figured out you can get more bang for your buck if you store more than one bit per flash cell. The higher-order bits take more time to read and program.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another specific case, NAND cells die with frequent use, so you get wear levelling (another bottleneck) to attempt to write across the device more consistently, and ... a system to mark a cell as dead (yet another bottleneck). That's in addition to the heat, which is itself a bottleneck across the entire computer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also temperature.  I have a USB 3 stick that gets slower and slower during a long, like hour long transfer.  It also gets very hot.  Point a fan at it, and it can maintain its top speed for longer.</p></div>		</li>
