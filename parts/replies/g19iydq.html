			<div class="markdown"><p>Econ PhD student here. The effect on inflation depends where the resources to pay for the universal income come from. Broadly speaking, if it comes from taxes, you are redistributing money from one person to another so aggregate demand and inflation don't move. If you print money to pay for the program, aggregate demand and inflation will increase.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think there is a problem here. The rich don't buy the same things the poor do.</p>
<p>&quot;Aggregate demand&quot; is really not a valid measure at all. If demand drifts from high end fashion and sports cars to the *basics* of life, that is going to effect the costs of those basics. There will be inflation in the most vital sectors of the economy. There must be.</p>
<p>If UBI purports to achieve a better outcome for the poor, that logically means they are buying more. Or at least think they are able to for a time until that greater demand effects costs.</p>
<p>Inflation is not a good statistic to aggregate. It is routinely broken down in economic sectors and for a very good reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seeing it described as wealth redistribution makes so much sense to me now. I only studied economics at college in the UK (16-18) so my knowledge isn't the greatest but this idea basically just means that the government would increase taxation on higher tax brackets so instead of 45% at the highest level, it would be 60% and therefore provide adequate income for the government to use this to form a UBI?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the government is injecting a lot of money into the economy through a basic income, in order to avoid inflation it simultaneously must also increase the amount of money it's sucking out of the economy. That is, increase taxes. The whole point of a basic income scheme is to accomplish wealth redistribution. Nobody thinks the government can just print money, forever, as much as it wants, with no consequences re: inflation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The keynesian economic model we use in the US very clearly defines inflation as a good thing. Taxes in no way decreased the money supply in the way you describe it as deferring inflation. Governments tend to be the largest spenders in any economy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Of course they do. Money that you have to give to the government is money that you can't spend on goods or services. An increase in taxes will, <em>ceteris paribus</em>, reduce inflation. If you increase government spending by the same amount as you increase taxes, of course, there will be no effect on inflation - which, in this case, would be the goal. </p>
<p>If you want a Keynesian view on the individual income tax as a method of inflation control <a href="http://www.taxhistory.org/Civilization/Documents/Fiscal/hst29026.htm" target="_blank">you can read one here, by Roy Blough, the Director of Tax Research at the Treasury Department from 1938 - 1946.</a> </p>
<p>I wouldn't call the current macroeconomic orthodoxy pure Keynesian by any means, but you're right that the Federal Reserve generally takes the position that a small, predictable rate of inflation is the ideal target because it incentivizes investment while allowing for relative price stability in the short term.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Governments tend to be the largest spenders in any economy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure what you mean by this. Total government spending (federal, state, and local spending combined) makes up about 40% of US GDP, so not a majority. As an individual entity, of course the federal government makes up the largest spender, as its spending is a deliberate policy tool to redistribute wealth in various ways, and it's also the largest single employer in the United States.</p></div>		</li>
