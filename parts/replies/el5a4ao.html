			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly why the push is on consumers and not on the manufacturers.   The only way to get manufacturers to change their behavior is to hurt the bottom line. Corporations have fiduciary responsibility to make money for their shareholders. They don't care about environmental issues until those impact the bottom line.</p>
<p>Edit: I hear all of you saying legislate/tax...  If you believe this will happen any time soon in the U.S. then you're delusional. The GOPutin will block that shit writ large. The only viable solution until we smack the GOP out of power is to hurt them where they feel it and that's in the pocket book.</p></div>		</li>

<p>One way to solve this is enough people commit to not having Coke at all until it's no longer in plastic, but that'll never happen because people care about their convenience first.</p>
<p>The other is government regulation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, that corporations have an obligation to prioritize shareholders above all else is modern-day corporate propaganda rooted more in &quot;modern wisdom&quot; than fact or historical precedent. There is no such obligation. The mistaken belief that there is is a direct cause of many of the failures of our economic system over the last 30 years.</p>
<p>From the dirty socialist rag, <strong><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2018/07/26/how-to-fix-stagnant-wages-dump-the-worlds-dumbest-idea/" target="_blank">Forbes Magazine</a></strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the 1980s and beyond, public companies began embracing the idea that the sole purpose of a corporation is to maximize shareholder value. Then, as executives were compensated massively with stock options to sharpen their focus on increasing shareholder value at the expense of everything else, and activist hedge funds began reinforcing the focus with corporate raids on firms that didn’t buy into the doctrine, public companies began to focus totally on maximizing shareholder as reflected in current the stock price.</p>
<p>Jack Welch, in his tenure as CEO of GE from 1981 to 2001, was seen as the uber-hero of maximizing shareholder value. In 2009, he famously declared that shareholder value is “the dumbest idea in the world. Shareholder value is a result, not a strategy... your main constituencies are your employees, your customers and your products. Managers and investors should not set share price increases as their overarching goal… Short-term profits should be allied with an increase in the long-term value of a company.”</p>
<p>Stagnant worker salaries thus aren’t a bug in the current economy: they’re a feature. Holding worker salaries as low as possible is a key to securing short-term quarterly profits, executive bonuses and rising share prices. Seemingly unnoticed by the world’s leading economists, shareholder value is not only the gospel of the global economy. It’s also the root cause of stagnant worker salaries.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bali, Indonesia banned single use plastics. I was there for a month recently and it made me realise how little we actually need all that plastic. Plastic straws are replaced with reusable metal or bamboo straws. I haven’t seen a single plastic bag. Locals clean out all the plastic in the rivers and beaches. The only companies that still uses them is the big international chains like McDonald’s and KFC. Meanwhile all the locals and small businesses work so hard to eliminate all plastic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what the cash refund value system does. IMHO they should increase it to like $0.50 per bottle. This way, basically everyone will recycle, and at that point, it becomes profitable for people to go door to door to pay/pick up them for a discount, and for people to dig through trash for them. </p>
<p>I mean yeah, it means you have to deposit your money inside of a bottle I guess but you get it back.</p>
<p>Context: in parts of the USA, like California, you have to pay $0.60 for a 12-pack of cans, and each one you bring to a recycling center (you can also go by weight) gets you 5c back that you originally paid..it's like a recycling deposit, and you lose the deposit if you don't recycle your own bottles. This deposit can also be claimed by trash/recycling companies, or homeless people digging through trash, giving some incentive to handle many bottles or cans that a lazy person threw out, so trash sorters have a financial incentive to diligently sort them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>in Michigan we pay 10c per container of (some stupid complicated group of beverages, but basically beer and &quot;pop&quot;), and we require all stores that sell pop or beer to accept returns during all hours of operation, and no limits on amount. </p>
<p>Oregon charges 10c for everything, which imo is better, but all the grocers got together and lobbied to make it so it wasn't as easy to return stuff because it was costing them money, so now lots of people just throw their &quot;returnables&quot; away(they might put them into the recycling) because it isn't worth the hassle to return them.
there is maybe a place within a 15 minute drive, but it's only open till like 7, and there is a limit to the number you can return, and if you are in a city, this place likely doesn't also sell groceries, so you can't just return your cans and bottles when you go buy cereal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>FYI I actually did a research project on this in my undergrad. (Though my focus was on beer bottles but not coke cans)</p>
<p>Glass bottles are not all they're cracked up to be.</p>
<p>They're harder to manufacture, they use tons of water, they're inefficient to recycle or clean, and they're HEAVY. This means if yours shipping them around the world, you're burning more fuel. You actually put a whole bunch of CO2 into the atmosphere by using a glass bottle.</p>
<p>The conclusions of my research back then (2008 so things could have changed) : if you're buying locally and going to clean the glass and reuse it locally glass is best. If you're shipping internationally use aluminum.</p>
<p>We party with a keg for the environment. (I got a 97% in that course. Prof partied hard.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>the real problem is non functional recycling which would be just as bad if suddenly everything would be packed in something else then plastic.</p></div>		</li>
