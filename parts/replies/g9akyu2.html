			<div class="markdown"><p>Not entirely related, but with a similar sensation:</p>
<p>If you ever have half of your mouth numbed for a dental procedure of some kind and you are able to drink liquids when you get home, drink some cold (fridge temp) seltzer water.  It will feel cold (like normal) on the non-numb half and warm on the numb half.  Very strange.</p>
<p>Got to do it twice recently.  Mild perk of needing a dental deep clean after neglecting my dental health for 6 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically that if you stick one hand in warm water and one in cold and then both in the same room temp water, your warm hand will feel like the room temp water is cold and the cold hand will feel like it's warm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was an old &quot;science center&quot; hands-on place at Epcot back in the day (Wonderworks, I think it was called) that had this experiment. Except they used these metal bars. A very hot one on the left, a freezing cold on the right, and a &quot;room temp&quot; in the middle. It is a weird feeling but cool experiment.</p></div>		</li>
