			<div class="markdown"><p>For anyone wondering why nitrous oxide is used instead of CO2 or some other gas.  From what I've read nitrous oxide is used because:  </p>
<ol>
<li>It dissolves well in the cream   </li>
<li>It won't oxidize the cream   </li>
<li>It won't give the cream an acidic taste  </li>
<li>It is inert and is safe to eat  </li>
<li>It displaces oxygen in the container and staves off the cream from going rancid</li>
</ol>
<p>#3 is the main reason for not using CO2</p>
<p>FYI, nitrous oxide will start to react with the oxygen in the room and your cream will go back to liquid form within 20-30 minutes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>PSA: if you really must inhale nitrous oxide (doing  whippits) for your safety DO NOT inhale from the can. It will freeze your lungs or at the least cause pneumonia or some foreign thing in your lungs problem.
If you must do this, do it safe please.
Spray gas into a balloon, inhale / exhale normal air 3x so your getting enough air before hand. Inhale from balloon, hold as comfortable. Exhale. 3x regular air again</p>
<p>[It also occurred to me, check your balloon type! Many have a powder in to lengthen the life of the balloon.
Always check your own set up details. I'm just a guy from the internet and can't possibly account for every detail. But you, youre living the choices; review them.<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>The nitrous oxide doesn't really &quot;react&quot; with the air, it just diffuses. Since nitrous dissolves into fat really well it can easily move from the tiny gas bubbles inside the cream into the &quot;walls&quot; surrounding the bubbles and from there into the surrounding air, leaving the cream behind as a liquid. Normal air is much less soluble in cream, so it leaves the cream much more slowly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>False. It doesnâ€™t burn at all. At high temps it breaks down to nitrogen and oxygen which supports combustion, but by itself it is non-flammable.</p></div>		</li>
