			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure exactly what you mean by &quot;light emission problem&quot;, but one of the things about Hawking radiation is that the black hole <em>will</em> radiate, very slowly, until it evaporates. It's my impression that the theory of Hawking radiation is not super well developed, and there's no observational data on it, but perhaps it's an answer to your issue here. </p>
<p>Caveat: I am extremely far from being an expert in this field and may be incorrect. The main point is you may find Hawking radiation interesting to look up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are multiple reasons why light can not escape a black hole. The gravity is so strong that light would fall back, like a person throwing a ball up into the air on earth. Also due to the massive gravity, spacetime is so curved inside the black hole that there are no paths that lead anywhere that is not inside the black hole. </p>
<p>Black holes do emit light (Hawking radiation), but it is not escaping the black hole per se, and there is nothing someone inside the event horizon could do to send light out.</p></div>		</li>
