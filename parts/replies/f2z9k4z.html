			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m some industries it’s used as “Number Of”, in my business we would say a “customer is looking for a quote - 5 no. 6” flange adapters, 6 no. 12” couplers. </p>
<p>But when it’s read out it 5 number 6” flange adaptors. It differentiates between quantity and size. It’s dying out though. We can’t use “5 by 6” flange adaptors as some products would have 6” by 4” in their description</p></div>		</li>
