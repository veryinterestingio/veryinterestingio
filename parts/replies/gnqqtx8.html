			<div class="markdown"><p>Rather, because he doesn't have the right meat and spices - think of the lipids that are used in the Biontech vaccine as bourbon vanilla, which is rare and expensive because you either need specialized bees or manual human labor to pollinate the plants.</p>
<p>The bottleneck is not the RNA production, Pfizer and Biontech already have figured that out, it's <a href="https://www.pharmazeutische-zeitung.de/das-sind-die-gruende-fuer-die-impfstoff-knappheit-123463/" target="_blank">these lipids</a>. They are complex chemicals which were not needed in vast quantities until the vaccine was proven to be effective, so plants need to be retooled and ramped up - especially in purity and quality control. And to make it worse, pharmaceutical injection-grade chemicals have extremely stringent requirements for purity in contrast to ordinary industrial chemicals which means that most chemical plants aren't even certified to produce stuff that's going to be injected into humans, further limiting the supply.</p>
<p>Another problem are the vials: usually, vaccines need to be stored in ordinary refrigerators. No problem for glass manufacturers, they have the tooling to manufacture such vials in masses. But the Pfizer (and iirc also the Moderna vaccine) require -80° C cooling so that the RNA doesn't degrade - which means, again, that you need special glass for the vials which hasn't been needed in billions quantities before.</p>
<p>This is why the hope was so high for the Sanofi vaccine (based on spike proteins created in bioreactors) and the AstraZeneca vaccine (based on modified harmless carrier viruses)... they're based on established technology with many suppliers for all components, not to mention they're vastly cheaper (AZ \~1.78€ per patient, vs Pfizer at 24€ per patient) and don't require a complex cooling chain logistics. Unfortunately, Sanofi completely fell through the tests and AZ has issues protecting against the new mutations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Sanofi is planning to launch a phase 2b study with an optimized candidate vaccine in February 2021, with support from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) in the US. The study will include a proposed comparison with an authorized COVID-19 vaccine. If data are positive, a global phase 3 study could start in Q2 2021. If the vaccine meets clinical requirements on safety and efficacy, and once approved by regulatory authorities, a vaccine can expected in the fourth quarter of 2021. &quot;</p>
<p>Awesome, ty for info.</p></div>		</li>
