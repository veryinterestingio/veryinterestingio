			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact I know from work. Heavy machinery of the same brand is often always the exact same key. They don't change them at all and it's well known but also well known that if you're stealing heavy machinery 1. A lock probably isn't going to stop you and 2. good luck transporting and hiding it without anyone noticing.</p></div>		</li>

Somehow or another he talked them into calling State Police and got a State Police escort all the way from New Orleans to the Mississippi state line. He was later caught after he made it home but hats off to him.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Realistically, if someone actually wants to steal machinery like that and can get physical access to it, its already too late to stop them.</p>
<p>A lot of locks in settings like that are just to deter kids and other casuals who might cause opportunistic mischief. Plus, even if its a shitty lock that would turn if you stuck a paper clip in it....the fact that a person even sought out a paper clip or brought a key with them is a demonstration of intent that I have to imagine would be relevant in the predictable legal followup activities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC, it also serves as a way to avoid liability  - if you &quot;lock the equipment&quot; and someone breaks in and gets hurt, you took a &quot;reasonable precaution&quot; and they become liable by virtue of bypassing the lock.  If you left it unattended and open to free access, you could attract liability for the harm or damage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very true, I work in construction and use a &quot;Bomag&quot; key often or a 14607 key as it's officially known.</p>
<p>This key fits all modern JCB equipment, Bomag rollers, Terex and New Holland Backhoes, Volvo mini diggers, Skytrack lifts and some Case mini diggers.</p>
<p>Although most modern vehicles will also have an immobilizer fitted, plus most big firms will have trackers fitted too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You all would also be interested to know that security panals for accessing buildings and gated communities have a key for opening the machine to let mailmen in. These 2 companies also have standardized locks so anyone can buy them online.</p>
<p>Additionally in some states you can buy the fire keys online, this means you can open the box that has the keys to every business in a building.</p>
<p>Elevator fire keys are also easy to find online, if you ever like to ride alone directly to your floor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hilariously, they are often valid keys for equipment in other industries.  </p>
<p>The key for my apartment building's lockbox is exactly the same bitting as the key for the fiber cabinet at work.  I can't call up the lock manufacturer and ask for the fire key, but I can order the fiber cabinet key.  They probably keep them in the same bin.</p></div>		</li>
