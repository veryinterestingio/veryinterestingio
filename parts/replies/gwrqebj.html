			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the truest and simplest answer, and should absolutely be the top comment. Many here are overanalyzing what the list means, but the simple fact is that the books you hear about are more likely to be popular, more popular books sell better and are thusly likely from the list in the first place. This works in tandem with the fact that the list itself drives further popularity, and makes it even more likely that you hear about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, pure availability bias.</p>
<p>The books that are stocked in bookstores, or recommended by recommendation engines, or sitting in little free libraries, or mentioned by friends... all much more likely to be books that have sold a bunch of copes than those that have not.</p></div>		</li>
