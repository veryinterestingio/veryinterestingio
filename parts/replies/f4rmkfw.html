			<div class="markdown"><p>Rockefeller did the same thing. He sold his oil at a below profit rate to gain a huge customer base and to also drive his competitors out of business. Then he jacked the price of oil back up only after his competitors were bankrupt and he was the main supplier of oil.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I studied Rockefeller. This is a common misconception, and it is not true. </p>
<p>In the mid-19th century, the primary demand was for kerosene rather than gasoline. Automobiles had not been invented yet. In the refining process, there are many by-products produced when crude oil, (the stuff pulled from the ground) is converted to kerosene. Rockefeller's genius was finding ways to use these byproducts rather than discarding them, which is what his competitors did. He sold paraffin to candlemakers, he sold petroleum jelly to medical supply companies, he even found a way to sell additional waste as paving material for roads. Due to this, Rockefeller's companies shipped so many goods that railroad companies (the only method of transport back then) watered at the mouth over the prospect of getting his business.</p>
<p>As a result, Rockefeller had significant bargaining power over the railroads. He used this bargaining power to force competition between the rail companies, and was able to get highly discounted shipping rates. He used all these methods combined to REDUCE the price of oil to his consumers.</p>
<p>That was his competitive advantage. His competitors could never compete on price and they were forced either out of business, or to fold into the Rockefeller empire.</p>
<p>The greatest part of his business model was that it won because he was cheaper. If he raised prices, then he would defeat himself. It would ruin his business plan, and any competitor would undercut him immediately, eating up his market share. </p>
<p>The price of a gallon of kerosene before Standard Oil entered the market was 56 cents. After Standard Oil had 90% market dominance? Only 9 cents.</p>
<p>At the time of the anti-trust action, his company's market dominance had been reduced by competitive forces to only 60%. They sort of came in at the tail end of things.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He did, too, invest in pipelines and stored oil for sale later when others didn't.  His first major foray into oil was researching oil for an insurance company and its transportation.  Told the company not to invest, and then poured his life savings (and a lifetime of borrowings) into research on just that.  He knew potential when he saw it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not true. Standard Oil was a profitable concern pretty much from the beginning. But it was more efficient than other producers and was able to undercut competitors even while selling at a profit. This put it in position to consolidate the industry, gain greater efficiencies in production and negotiate better terms with suppliers (I.e., the railroads) than competitors could. </p>
<p>The result was a dramatic long-term reduction in the cost of oil for consumers. He made his money by permanently driving down the cost of oil, not by creating a monopoly and later jacking up the price.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish I could find the article, I think it was in the Atlantic or NYT.</p>
<p>But it was about a guy who went out with a friend and the friend had an app that have you credit for Starbucks or Amazon for making a reservation at a restaurant.  It made no sense, there is no way that it's profitable to give out $25 credit on a $40 dollar meal, someone is losing money somewhere.</p>
<p>It also spoke about blue apron and how it costs them $460 to get an customer but customers only spend a few months on the service before they learn to cook and ditch the service thus netting blue apron $400, so they lose $60 a customer and they can't find a way to solve the problem.  </p>
<p>How are companies like this that have no viable path to profitability still in business?</p>
<p>It comes down to the amount of idle cash that is held by investors.  They can afford to fund this bullshit because they have so much cash that they can afford to gamble on these wacky ideas.  If it hits they make bank, if not, invest in some other kitten-mitten company.  The wealthy class literally has so much cash stockpiled that they can afford these highly risky, highly speculative investments, it's ridiculous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The two examples you give absolutely sound like they're wacky &quot;kitten-mitten companies&quot;, and I won't argue that the reason we see so many of these ideas popping up is because the uber-wealthy venture capitalists have too much money to burn.</p>
<p>However... with ideas like food delivery and taxi (dress it up however you want, at the end of the day Uber and Lyft are just another taxi company), small local companies have made a profitable go of it for decades. The problem with these ideas is less that it's unprofitable, and more that these companies are gunning to be the biggest, or only, name in the game, and they're trying to do it across multiple markets instead of staying local. Another comment brought up Rockefeller's Standard Oil and the anti-trust legislation passed as a result, and if the Uber's and Lyfts of today are halfway successful towards their goals, we may have to take another look at how they were able to circumvent the regulations designed in the Rockefeller era to stop monopolies.</p></div>		</li>
