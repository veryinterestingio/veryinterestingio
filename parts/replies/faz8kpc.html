			<div class="markdown"><p>We even use it in transmission electron microscopy. Unfortunately because it’s still uranium some places go overboard on precautions to use, and I have a materials science institute that is letting me use their TEM but forbade me from using DU causing some interesting problems figuring out alternative stains. Which is vaguely amusing seeing how much nastier the other chemicals used during processing and embedding are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're used against armoured vehicles. DU rounds typically contain no explosive payload, instead working like, basically, a really big bullet. Uranium is about the densest material you can practically make a projectile out of, so it's an effective way of delivering a lot of energy to a very small area of an armour plate.</p>
<p>In addition to being much denser than lead, it's also better at going through armour than lead (which is famously soft). In small arms, there is generally a compromise between using lead (for added weight) or hardened steel (for armour piercing). DU does both, in part due to it's &quot;self-sharpening&quot; properties.</p>
<p>I am not sure what advantages it has over tungsten, which is also very dense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depleted uranium is uranium that has had most of the uranium-235 removed (it occurs as a waste product of the uranium enrichment process), and so is even less radioactive than fresh nuclear fuel. Natural uranium as it is mined is about 0.7% U-235, while depleted uranium is usually less than 0.3% U-235 - so for each tonne of 5% enriched nuclear reactor fuel, you make about ten tonnes of depleted uranium.</p></div>		</li>

<p>These byproducts also generate heat as part of their decay, so spent fuel rods are first put in pools of water that serve to cool the fuel. Once the heat generation slows down enough, the fuel can be either reprocessed or buried. </p>

<p>Nicely written. Just wanted to add for those interested, because this is the part that's always fascinated me the most: the spent fuel is placed under water to cool for about 10 years! </p>
<p>It's incredible to think that these radioactive materials need such a long time to cool before they can be handled further - which is typically done by putting these rods in concrete shells and buried deep underground in a remote location. </p>
<p>When seen from this lens, it helps you appreciate the immense power of this technology - we essentially need to give it 10 years to cool down and then wrap it up in a thick material and make it fuck off deep underground for the rest of time. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The expensive part about nuclear is handling everything safely, not producing heat. Nuclear fuel is extremely cheap for its heat output. Once a fuel assembly passes a certain threshold, it's more economical to just pull it out and drop in a new fuel assembly.</p>
<p>We have the technology to be able to reprocess spent fuel, use it in breeder reactors, and get an order of magnitude more energy from it. Again though, simple economics drive the commercial industry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, the waste is emitting heat and that's useful. </p>
<p>The pool needs to be cooled as the water is heated by the hot fuel, and it receives passive cooling. Popular design entails passive cooling where the water is pumped through heat exchangers to cool itself and the residual heat can then be used where needed to boost specific component efficiencies!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Just an FYI, the most permanent storage available to commercial spent fuel is <em>not</em> underground in a remote location, but in concrete casks which are cooled by natural ventilation and stored in the same location where it was produced. You can thank Harry Reid and Gregory Jaczko for that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>sorry, I'm not American so I can't speak for American practices. But to be fair, you sound angry as if the solution is inadequate but concrete casks, if sufficiently thick, are good barriers for the radioactivity within. What you're describing is actually not an issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alpha particles are indeed stopped very easily by, for example, your skin.  However, if you were to ingest or inhale that uranium, those alphas will do a lot more damage to you (on a per-particle basis) than the other radiation types.  So no one should get the idea that precautions are not needed around it. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_particle#Biological_effects" target="_blank">More info here</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I learned this with the “Cookie story:”</p>
<p>You have three cookies... one each for alpha, beta and gamma radiation. You have to eat one cookie, put one cookie in your pocket, and throw one cookie away. What do you do?</p>
<p>Alpha radiation will kill you if it gets inside your body, but otherwise it’s basically harmless. Beta will penetrate farther than alpha, but still not very far and only does a moderate amount of damage. Gamma will pass through almost everything (like your entire body). So the best thing to do is put alpha in your pocket, eat beta, and throw gamma away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with alpha cookie, but surely you should eat gamma and discard beta?</p>
<p>As you mentioned, most of gamma radiation will pass through your entire body, so only a small amount will be absorbed by your cells and damage their DNA.</p>
<p>Whereas all the beta radiation will be absorbed by your cells.</p>
<p>So, assuming that each cookie has the same dose of radiation (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_exposure#Radiation_measurement_quantities" target="_blank">which unit should I use?</a>), I think that eating gamma is less damaging than eating beta.</p></div>		</li>
