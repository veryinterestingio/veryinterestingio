Granted in that case they're rearranging themselves rather than shedding genetic material to make more of themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's basically what it's doing.  The jellyfish does this when damaged, elderly, or starving as an emergency reset.  Since they don't really have brains or learned behaviors, nothing useful is lost in the process.</p>
<p>More complicated animals that do rely at least partially on learned behavior would need a more complex regeneration system to preserve that.</p></div>		</li>
