			<div class="markdown"><p>I grew up on 24 acres in Australia and my dad had a Clydesdale called Barney he used to plough the back field for fun.</p>
<p>The day Barney died 5 year old me was allowed to do some painting inside! I was so excited. I used to have to do everything messy outside.</p>
<p>They told me years later it was because they were taking Barney apart with a chainsaw on the front lawn :(</p></div>		</li>

Can't imagine cutting an elephant into pieces with a chainsaw. Imagine all the blood splashing around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, fortunately I haven't had to do it myself. In both instances the zoo rallied volunteers from the staff for the task, keepers from all over the facility pulled together to make it happen in a day.
Thankfully the blood is very stagnant at that point - though the chainsaw certainly makes a mess. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you considered using a reciprocating saw or sawzall instead? As someone who uses saws a lot at work I feel like these wouldn't have the same capacity to fling material everywhere. Also I feel like there are places in a chainsaw that would get a lot of gore and tissue stuck in there.  And cleaning the saw after would be difficult.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, thankfully a lot of zookeepers have a morbid sense of humor - in part to deal with truths like this. Heck, I dance around singing &quot;Closer to the Bone&quot; by Lou Prima while skinning and chopping up rodents for feedings. </p></div>		</li>
