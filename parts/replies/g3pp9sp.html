			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't guess that fermentation had anything to do  with it. C is found in a wide variety of fruits and vegetables.  Humans can go months before lack of C has a noticable effect.  Vitamin C is stable in dried fruits and veggies.  Drying was probably the first ever method of storage. Most fruits and vegetables are easy to dry and store up to a year or more even with primitive methods.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans evolved from and into primates with very, very good color vision that let them spot ripe fruit at a distance, large bodies with long nimble arms to reach high fruit and a taste for sweet things.  This made them able to reliably locate large amounts of fresh fruit and encouraged them to do so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an addendum to this:</p>
<p>When it comes to gene mutations, the overall process is entropic - that is, any particular mutation that does something to a gene is much more likely to break what the gene does than do anything else.</p>
<p>What this means is that naturally, everything the body can do would mostly get broken over many generations. It's only when there's enough selection pressure - aka &quot;if this breaks, the animal doesn't create as many offspring (which obviously includes <em>if they are dead</em>)&quot; - that what the body can do is preserved by these mutations being rejected from the population.</p>
<p>When it comes to producing nutrients needed, if a species always eats enough of it, then eventually the build-up of random mutations over time means the genes coding for mechanisms to create those nutrient breaks. This creates a new dietary requirement for that nutrient.</p>
<p>An example is Taurine in cats (and may other carnivores) - as carnivores, they get sufficient Taurine from their diet, so over time, their biological mechanisms to synthesize Taurine for themselves have accumulated mutations that break that pathway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never heard of a long term release nutritional supplement that is in the cow their whole life.</p>
<p>Are you thinking of hardware disease prevention?  Cows can sometimes accidentally ingest metal for whatever reason, so instead of letting it make its way through the cow, cows are fed magnets that sit in their rumen collecting bits and pieces.  These magnets are indeed removed at harvest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I figure it's more like genetic atrophy. If your species has gotten vitamin c from diet for a million years there's no penalty for mutation of those genes.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, a random mutation somewhere in the past that removed the ability to synthesize vitamin C in a population that had plenty of it in their diet probably had very little impact. So there was no pressure in the form of those who couldn't synthesize vitamin C dying out immediately, or even having more trouble staying alive than everyone else.</p>
<p>If the mutation otherwise increased the chances of survival slightly *or* if all descendants of the ones without the mutation died out in time for unrelated reasons, that's what we're stuck with.</p>
<p>For another example, domestic cats do not have receptors for the sweet taste, which for most animals would be pretty crippling (things that taste sweet tend to indicate to the animal that food is, well, rich in sugar, that is - a good source of energy). They also drink too little water if you don't give them enough food with sufficient water content - also a negative trait for most animals. But ancestors of domestic cats were obligate carnivores *and* lived in the desert, where sources of drinking water are rare. So whatever mutation led to those traits were, at that time in evolutionary history, completely neutral.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not producing our own Vitamin C is a survival mechanism.  It means that our metabolism is more efficient, not spending energy on something that we get naturally from our diet.  Given that early humans were hunter - gathers, we would be eating a fair bit of fruit and liver- good sources of Vitamin C.  The lineage that does not spend energy on producing Vitamin C would have an advantage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did we figure out what advantage not being able to synthesize Vitamin C gave us? Because if it was just a random mutation without other advantages we would be seeing a mix of people with and without this mutation. It must be quite advantageous to not be able to make VC on our own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean sure we need sunlight, our body can't just create something out of nothing - but sunlight is probably one of the best requirements.</p>
<p>Just go outside for a bit and easily generate an essential vitamin passively.</p>
<p>Maybe nowadays its hard for some people as some work from home / don't go out often, but I am sure for most of humanities existence, we were in open sun plenty of time, easily making vitamin D</p></div>		</li>
