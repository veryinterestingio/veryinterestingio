<p>Um what?? Latin is objectively older than English and French culture is objectively older than American culture</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, language is constantly changing and there's really never a definite boundary (that is to say, there wasn't a single change which made Latin suddenly become its descendants). Certainly classical Latin is older than Modern English, but is debatable how much you can say without more specific information about the time periods in question. It raises an interesting question: did &quot;Latin&quot; actually die, if it evolved into other languages? People didn't stop speaking Latin all of a sudden, the differences that set Latin and French, for example, apart are really only visible in hindsight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Latin is a bad example because we are very clearly speaking about <em>living</em> languages here.</p>
<p>Also, no, it still does not make sense to call one &quot;older&quot; than another because cultures are not things that age. Modern French culture is not &quot;older Old French culture.&quot; Culture <em>changes and evolves</em> (as does language), but the relationship ends there.</p>
<p>People often use &quot;older&quot; to fetishize languages/cultures, and it holds no scientific merit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was under the impression that Xhosa has seen much more influence from the Khoisan languages than Zulu. This would make geographic sense, and also explain why clicks and Khoisan loan words are much more common in Xhosa than Zulu.</p></div>		</li>
