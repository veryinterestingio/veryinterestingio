			<div class="markdown"><p>I know for sure that there are many kind of ways to remove a scar, both surgical and pharmaceutical.
Take what's coming netx with a pinch of salt</p>
<p>As far as i know surgical ways are:
1) skin graft
2) excission</p>
<p>The first one works buy taking away  the scar and patch it with skin taken from another district. It helps with the healing.
The second one it's that simple: after cutting the scar tissue you saw the margin togheter. This way a large scar can become smaller and cleaner.
About pharmaceutical ways i am totaly ignorant. </p>
<p>I hope someone else can give a better answer</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a burn survivor of 45% of my body. I've got a good amount of scar tissue on my chest and legs in addition to 7ish skin grafts.</p>
<p>My doctors performed a sort of laser scar revision surgery where I was put under while they used the laser to break down the scar tissue.</p>
<p>Honest to God it did seriously help with the healing of my scars and improving my overall range of motion. For lack of a better way of putting it, I fucked myself up real good when I was 17 (21M).</p>
<p>The medical field is amazing and honestly crazy with what they can do nowadays. </p>
