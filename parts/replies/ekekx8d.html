			<div class="markdown"><p>Silicon photonics also delivers much lower power consumption since photons have much less energy than electrons. Also, photons can essentially be “bussed” via electromagnetic frequency combs. Silicon photonics is still growing, but a lot of the research looks promising.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the really interesting summary. So along the lines of the asynchronous clocking being harder to commercialize, how realistic could some of the other ways be in terms of how expensive they are.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Photonic interconnects would eliminate the propagation delay of signals across the chip.</p>

<p>They would not.  The 1% increase is speed gained by using light instead of electrical signals is not worth the trouble. The benefit of silicon photonics is that you can get extremely high bandwidths.</p></div>		</li>
