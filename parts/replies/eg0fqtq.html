			<div class="markdown"><p>Seriously that is so stupid. I think we are way passed the point that vaccines should be mandatory. And also push for global imminisation. I know there are so many factors to this but mankind needs to start working for the benefit of mankind as a whole, not just their own country. Whats the line from Independence Day? We can't be consumed by our petty differences anymore. Something like that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They can't be completely mandatory. Even <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/should-not-vacc.html" target="_blank">the CDC recognizes that there are legitimate reasons not to get vaccinated</a>. But those people are exactly the reason why <em>everyone</em> else should get vaccinated.</p></div>		</li>

<p>However I read the questions and answers here and it appears immigrants can get around it with a waiver :-/</p>
