			<div class="markdown"><p>I was about to say, just because we <em>think</em> we remember a song it doesn't mean we remember all the complexities, tones and layers of the song correctly to &quot;fully&quot; remember the song as a comparison to photographic memory.  Most of the time we would remember the main melodies, but the supporting layers and harmonies I can pretty much guarantee are not fully remembered.</p>
<p>Edit: I think it goes without saying that this doesn't apply to <em>everyone</em>.  Of course there will be individuals with better auditory memory or are trained to pick up the differences, especially professional musicians and composers.  But I still think it's fair to say that the average person cannot fully recreate a song from memory to match the actual score, as much as they believe they memorized it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'd hazard a guess that's part of the reason why singing along with a song, you feel like you would get all the notes etc correctly, but you end up unable to anyway. You &quot;remember&quot; the details but they're just gaps being filled by your brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your last point also strongly depends on expertise, as u/Soramaro had mentioned. A person who is an expert musician can remember all parts of a song much better than a non-musician. There is a legend about Mozart, for instance, that said he could recite entire musical pieces from memory, with all the supporting layers and harmonies, after only hearing it once.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But a person who isn’t an expert musician could very well be capable of recalling a piece of music perfectly in their mind. They would just be incapable of reproducing it themselves due to lack of the skill required to do so.</p>
<p>So somebody could remember every note a singer hits perfectly in their mind, but they would have to be an amazingly talented singer with perfect pitch to then sing it back perfectly themselves.</p>
<p>Since most people can’t do this there isn’t a real way to prove someone can perfectly recall a song unless we invent some sort of mind reading technology that could let us “hear” what they are imagining in their mind.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That just reminded me of the bicycle story.  If you ask someone if they think they know what a bicycle looks like, most people will say yes.  But if you ask someone to draw a bicycle from memory, most people will struggle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm both surprised and unsurprised that there's so little research into aphantasia. It's such a curious phenomenon but it's so hard to verify your finding due to its subjective nature. I only realised I had it when I saw a post on TIFU where someone revealed to their SO that it was normal to actually see things in your mind's eye.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, this is really interesting. Can you tell me what it's like for you to read. Without an inner monologue, do you enjoy fiction novels? Also  how does your recall work? If you needed to practice a speech, does it just come to you?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, I have an inner monologue.</p>
<p>If I try to recall a song, I can't hear it but I can kinda make my inner monologue hum along to it, but it's not really like hearing something. It's kind of hard to describe.</p>
<p>I haven't done a lot of reading lately apart from technical docs, bit I've read a ton of scifi, fantasy, popular science, non fiction etc. I tend to gloss over detailed descriptions of visual detail. Maybe make mental &quot;notes&quot; of details that seem relevant, bit mostly skim for the actual plot...or I really enjoy clever verbal interactions between the characters.</p>
<p>My memory isn't what it once was, but it's always been pretty good for recalling &quot;useless&quot; trivia and factual information.</p>
<p>I recall things as facts...or events kind of like you'd read off of a list.</p>
<p>I can still recite the words from songs I haven't heard in years and never had much of a problem memorizing speeches. I've never much liked delivering them though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't visualise either.</p>
<p>I always describe it as different layers of thinking. my normal thinking is just me talking to myself(my own voice is the only thing I can hear in my head, so I was a bit surprised by the OP of this thread, I knew about people seeing images in their head but wouldn't have thought anyone can play music in their head).</p>
<p>however just like when talking aloud, I need to 'know' what I'm going to say before I say it to myself in my head. so there's a deeper, faster level of thinking beneath the normal thinking. so I can recall things that you can't grasp in words, but in a kind of subconscieus way, and I then translate it into words. (as a kid, I used to think I had a photographic memory since I can often recall on which part of a page in a textbook I  can find back something I saw before for example. I just thought the whole head-images talk was more symbolic, just like how you don't literally feel any physical feeling when you've got an underbelly feeling, it's just an expression. only later I found out most people actually see literal images in their head)</p>
<p>however if I'm concentrated on a task, and really in the flow, the talking-layer basically disappears and I only have that deeper subconscieus thinking, so basically no inner monologue(well, still in a way, but way faster), and I just instantly 'know' things I'm thinking about since I don't have to take the time to say the words in my head. </p>
<p>especially while reading or writing it is common that I go into that deeper layer of thinking, basically the typing replaces my normal inner monologue as translation-layer.</p>
<p>so yes I do enjoy reading, although visual descriptions in books usually don't mean that much to me. what works better for me are visual descriptions that are well written, where the specific words chosen to describe something form a nice sentence, or if a good analogy is used. so with books from a good writer I have no trouble enjoying descriptions, but with a bad writer who just writes simple visual descriptions that are meant to evoke an image, instead of a description that's beautifull because the way it is written, I quickly get bored. an example of the kind of writing I deem good is for example the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy. descriptions are not merely descriptions, but it's full of analogies and humor.</p>
<p>specifically about speeches, I personally do best if I don't practice them. the more I practice the more I'm just 'uhm'-ing to recall what I prepared to say next, better to just impovise(I just make sure I have all the relevant info in my head, as I'm speeching it'll flow out and I still have room to shorten or lengthen some bits depending on how fast the time goes by)(it may also help that I'm already constantly translating my subconcieus thinking into words, and then think about it in actual words already, so giving a presentation is easy, it's just like any random conversation)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. OP just thinks they’re good a remembering music. Even as a conservatory-trained musician who can dictate music by listening, I still don’t get the starting pitch correct most of the time. Usually +/- 3 half steps. OP is probably missing most of the notes and many of the rhythms. Most people have so little music education that they literally don’t know what they don’t know</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, you could argue that just because you don't get the starting pitch/key right on doesn't mean you don't remember the piece perfectly. Most musicians don't have perfect pitch and the key isn't necessarily integral to remembering a piece of music.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah this. Some people, many people actually have a nack for 'hearing' music in their heads as if it's playing. Sometimes really detailed and it can last years between hearing the piece again. I'm one of them so I know how cool it is.</p>
<p>I could've put this better but I've been out and had a few beers. But it is a thing.</p>

<p>Do they not know what they don't know or can't express it? I wouldn't be able to tell you the pitch or the notes but I can still tell when they're off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I truly don’t mean to be condescending in the least, but <em>most</em> people cannot. They can tell when they’re not in the same zip code but many people will sing contour correctly and miss the actual notes by quite a bit. Like unacceptable margins for making music (instead of cents flat or sharp theyre off by a whole step). It sounds kinda right if you aren’t used to a higher standard or have never learned to give attention to that standard.</p></div>		</li>
