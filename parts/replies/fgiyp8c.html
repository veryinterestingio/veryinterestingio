			<div class="markdown"><p>Bingo. Refeeding syndrome is the trouble here. </p>
<p>During starvation (whether fasting purposefully, deprived of food, or in an eating disorder/psychological process, etc) the body goes though something similar to that in ketosis. </p>
<p>Mineral concentrations in the serum stay relatively stable, while there is some decrease intracellularly, although the cellular contraction during starvation can mitigate some of this. </p>
<p>When the body has food reintroduced, there’s a bolus amount of nutrients that the body has to deal with. Glucose causes insulin to go up which causes glycogen/fat/protein synthesis. These processes require minerals like phosphorous and magnesium, using them from the serum. When potassium is taken into the cells by the insulin, mag and phos go with it, too - further decreasing available Mag and phos in the serum. These rapid shifts in electrolytes are the hallmark of refeeding syndrome.  The body removes them from the serum to take to the cells, but the cells are also using them to power synthesis processes and ATP processes. </p>
<p>I had patients in ICU that we had a strict refeeding protocol for. Meals were calorie counted and balanced by a dietician for proper electrolytes. No extra snacks were allowed. Strict intake counts. Meals had to be eaten at certain times. Daily blood counts and metabolic panels. Gentle vitamin supplements if needed.  If the patient had an eating disorder, we further allotted certain amounts of time to eat, If the meal was not consumed in that time frame, the meal was removed (alteration in ability to control stretching a “meal” over hours or ignoring food). </p>
<p>Patients on paraenteral feeding were more at risk for hypophosphatemia - the hallmark of RS. One study (I have to find it, I’ll update it if I do) I came across years ago (when I first got to that hospital) pegged it at an 80% occurrence of RS in paraenteral feedings <em>without</em> phosphorous repletion; adding it or enduring its replacement lowers the RS risk to around 15%. </p>
<p>While there is no strict timeframe, anyone with low/negligible oral intake of nutrients can be at risk for refeeding syndrome at around 100 hours (~5 days). </p>
<p>Highest risk: anorexia, chronic alcoholism, oncology patients, elderly (failure to thrive), chronic malnutrition, excessive antacid usage, chronic diuretic usage.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds a lot like what happened to survivors of concentration camps liberated by the Allies. Walking skeletons that the soldiers gladly gave food, only to have medics come running up and grabbing the food away so the survivors couldn't eat it. Some of them died from the shock of actual food after having gone without for so long, and a lot of effort was taken to provide a safe path back to being able to eat normal food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can be to the extent that we replace losses. If your magnesium is say, 1.5, and your phosphorous is 2 pre-feeding, we will replace it.  Problem is the IV replacements take hours. Mag 2g takes 2h, while phosphorous can take 2-4h. We often correct simultaneously in severe cases. </p>
<p>If it is normal pre feed, then we typically won’t (or at least not that much to require IV). Feeds are typically slow going but there’s no way to know how their body will receive and use the nutrients. We check CMP/Mg/P/Liver labs often (sometimes q4-6 in these patients) that we can often stay up on acute shifts but if your potassium drops right after lab check we won’t know for a few hours; diligent monitoring including telemetry is key.  We also lean <strong>heavily</strong> on our dietitians and pharmacy (love them) for monitoring and repletion.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is a simple typo but it took me a while to figure out. Hypophosphatemia. If not for context I would never have understood. </p>
<p>Thank you for the detailed explanation of what is involved... and for your expertise in treating these individuals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Slightly tangential from the original question, but: there's also things like being so riddled with intestinal parasites or the stuff that causes diarrhea that you can't recover, because you're losing more than you're gaining. You can't digest enough food no matter how much you eat, so you die. You can't hold on to enough water, so you die.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Things like intestinal parasites eat the nutrients from your food, so you don't get any. The bacteria/virus (I forget which) that causes diarrhea doesn't suck up the water; you lose water because you have diarrhea. That's what it is, it just runs right through you. You can't digest food properly because of the illness, you can't absorb water either. Historically diarrhea was a huge killer, because tainted water was everywhere, so when you tried to rehydrate, you were still getting reinfected over and over. So yes, it would kill you pretty quick, without access to clean water and modern meds. That's partially why you're not supposed to drink the water in a lot of underdeveloped countries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who helps patients experiencing refeeding syndrome I can tell you there are points of no return (though rarely encountered in developed countries). there is a point of no return with dehydration as well where you cannot swallow fluids but IV fluids could restore you. We sometimes give nutrition directly into a vein, though as you might imagine, it's already broken down into the simplest possible parts such as amino acids, dextrose, vitamins, fats, etc. even then refeeding is a risk and there could be a point of no return where due to the limits of what the liver and kidneys can process, the person could in fact &quot;starve&quot; to death. But that would be a highly exceptional case, never seen it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See my answer above for a little bit on IV fluid usage, but it comes down to what IV fluids are. Unless we are taking a concentrated, specially formulated nutritional solution (as in TPN or PPN) sugar water and normal saline won’t cut it (and can actually be very detrimental). </p>
<p>Giving fluids without nutrients won’t fix the problem. Giving saline can be dangerous too (it waters down what little electrolytes they have in the serum and/or it can also cause congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema) so we typically just cover enough for sodium losses. </p>
<p>Giving just dextrose could cause a massive influx of insulin in response to the sugar - which would further cause intracellular potassium shifts. The end result being even less potassium in the serum, which could be critically damaging and even fatal to the cardiac system. Additionally, hyperglycemia and insulin stimulation can lead to increased lipogenesis (fat formation), causing increased carbon dioxide formation which can lead to respiratory failure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i am at the limits of my knowledge. i assume this is why pedialite and gatorade are recommended, as far as i remember. not sure if the gatorade still is. iv fluids would probably be used if you're in the hospital because of it.</p></div>		</li>
