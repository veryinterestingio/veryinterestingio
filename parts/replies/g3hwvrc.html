			<div class="markdown"><p>There are special safety protocols. All prion work is done in a contained space with everything thing that leaves that area needing to be autoclaved at minimum. You have to wear full gowns, pants, booties and double glove. It is fun to do the boots because you have to step into the danger area as you put them on. Other than that  you just don't touch your face or anything else that is common sense.</p>
<p>Edit: yes autoclaving doesn't destroy prions, that is why it is the minimum we do. There are individual procedures for everything that leaves the contained area, including incineration, and NaOH sterilization.
Most things never leave the area, but for anything to leave it must go through an autoclave first.
Additionally the autoclave cycle sterilizes at a higher temperature than most cycles, 134⁰C if i remember correctly.
Sorry for the confusion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a little sad that you didn't call it the Danger Zone! I'm not scared of many illnesses, but Prion related diseases (familial fatal insomnia especially) and Drug Resistant TB are terrifying. The chances of me coming into contact with either is negligible... But man.. No thank you. </p>
<p>I am concerned about the rapid spread of chronic wasting though. It's In the middle of my state, and it's only a matter of time before it's in my area. Screw prions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe this is the direct answer.  What is meant by a prion is something that toggles another prion, or a little more generally, a protein of its kind; it's not a skull key for every, or any, other protein.   </p>
<p>At least we haven't seen such a skull key, yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>once a protein is unfolded it may never be able to refold. For instance the useful folded state may not even be the most stable state. Note the prion (disease state) is actually more stable than the folded normal state, so it can never go back. Proteins when they are initially folded into shape may also need other proteins (chaparones) around to help them. These proteins are no longer around when the protein gets unfolded so it stays unfolded.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Take a look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMrkV5CMf0s&amp;t=16" target="_blank">this video</a>. Proteins start out as a strand and as they are built they tend to bend and curl into a functional shape. The final shape depends on the components and timing but the process is called folding.</p>
<p>You can unfold a protein by cooking, whether high fever or stove top, but refolding is not likely. There are different sized and complexity proteins so YMMV.</p>
<p>Prions happen to have a functionally similar shape to their original protein so they pass checks and balances and the body tries to use them normally. However, like lead and calcium only one is actually good for the job.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Somethings require too much energy to unfold again, or if it unfolds the way that records can not be controlled like when it is initially made.</p>
<p>The mechanics behind how it misfolds are rather complex and not fully understood. It is not simply touching then Shazam.</p></div>		</li>
