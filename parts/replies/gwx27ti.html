			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding on to cover the other part of the OP's question, this matters to physics because our current concept of gravity rests entirely on the curvature of spacetime. Spacetime is the &quot;surface&quot; we do real world geometry on...we know that mass distorts it (that's gravity) but we're not sure if, absent mass, it's flat or subtly curved. And, if it's curved, which way. This makes essentially zero difference to our daily lives but it makes a big difference on the scale of the universe.</p></div>		</li>

Geometry isn't exactly my forte but I have only a basic mathematical understanding of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let me try it; Euclidean geometry happens on a flat paper or book. It's just how you learn this kind of stuff. It is called Euclidean because HE was the first one to describe the rules of the game.</p>
<p>however, the rules don't work properly if the paper is not flat. </p>
<p>And it turns out that the universe might not be &quot;flat&quot; in its default state</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To tack on to this: here's an easy example of non-Euclidean geometry.</p>
<p>Look at a globe. There's the equator that goes around the middle, east to west. All the lines of longitude go north-south. They all cross the equator at 90 degrees to it. One of the lines of longitude is the prime meridian, that goes through England. The 90 degree west meridian passes through Illinois and eventually makes a 90 degree angle with the equator in the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>So that's two right angles |<em> and </em>|. But we know those vertical lines of longitude meet at another right angle at the North pole. So are they parallel? In truth they make a triangle in a curved plane, whose interior angles add to 270 degrees, not 180 degrees like they must in a Euclidean (planar) situation.</p></div>		</li>
