			<div class="markdown"><p>Ex addict here. Might not be the exact answer your looking for,  but after 5 years (2 heavy iv use) you never really come fully back. I've been on suboxone in one form or another for 3 years in March now (March 13 2018 was my last use of anything) and that has really really helped keep my brain regulated while I get my life back together. </p>
<p>I'm starting the transition to lower my medication levels since technically I'm still using an opiate, but a much different one. And my head and life are in different atmospheres. I was a homeless junkie making the worst of my life. Now I'm employed, clean, have a great place to live, a car, motorcycles, an amazing girlfriend etc. So dealing with the full withdrawal now is much easier then trying to fight through it while trying to fight with everyone/everything around me. </p>
<p>I still have bad days but my bad days are millions of miles from what a good day using was. My mental state isn't perfect but I appreciate the small things in a way I could never before. </p>
<p>Just my insight. Cheers</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's still hope! I was also an IV user and it got better for me. If you're still on suboxone, then I think it's too early to say things won't get better.</p>
<p>Suboxone saved my life, but I took the first chance I got to stop going to the methadone/suboxone clinic to start getting it from a private doctor. That way, I could actively start weaning myself off of it at my own pace. I did it really gradually for sure since suboxone withdrawals are awful. By the end of it, I was taking such tiny pieces of the sublingual film it was probably more placebo than anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have not been taking strips for over a year. I've been working with my doctor to build a program for the new once a month injectable bupe. My case is not typical or normal and I've really responded well to the treatment. We have learned alot along the way and had some Incredible setbacks as well. I just didn't feel like doing a deep dive into my exact treatment details.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good for you! Suboxone helped me so much! When I finally got off it, I was at such a low dose that it was barely even an issue. Keep going, stay on it as long as you need!</p></div>		</li>
