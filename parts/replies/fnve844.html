<p>I think he  was quite objective in that episode. It's however important to note that he tends to possess a noticeable left-wing bias when going into topics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like John Oliver.  I miss Jon Stewart.</p>
<p>Edit:  so I started watching the John Oliver video.  His first example was about some group called Americans Against Food Taxes.  A television commercial seems like a poor example of astroturfing to me.  It’s obvious there is some higher power— some lobbying group — that’s pouring money into this.  There was no illusion that this was a grass roots effort.</p>
<p>I’ll keep watching now.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Crowds on Demand.  Smh.  Now that I think about it though, I seem to recall reading about this before.  </p>
<p>What a fucking hot mess of a world we live in.
Thanks for the link.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I wholeheartedly believe that Trump would never have been elected if Jon Stewart was still running the Daily Show in 2016.   I think Trevor Noah is a great host, but his non-native roots, like John Oliver's, don't have the impact that Jon Stewart's did...sigh</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do you know why spammers send emails laced with spelling errors and grammar mistakes? You don't need to fool everyone. You need to fool your target.</p></div>		</li>
