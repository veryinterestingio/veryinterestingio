			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. This happens to me every once in a while. I'll have random, minor anxiety episodes/panic attacks and my heart rate will increase, and I'll be able to feel my heart beating in my chest. It's super uncomfortable and tends to trigger even further anxiety so it takes a while for me to just forget about it, and then it just goes away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the tricks that often work for me is to remind myself that it takes 3m for the physical symptoms to go away. So I keep repeating to myself &quot;you only need to last 3m&quot; (title of my sextape) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I occasionally get panic attacks.</p>
<p>Have you tried drinking something or eating something when you have one?</p>
<p>I drink water and it helps me get out of it.</p>
<p>The explanation I was given is that a panic attack is your body responding to a perceived threat by triggering the flight or flight reflex. However you wouldn't eat or drink unless you were safe so doing either of those helps knock your body out of the reflex.</p>
<p>No idea if it's true or just a placebo but like I said, it's helped me a few times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm socially awkward and intorvert and have panic attacks. I can feel and see my chest pounding very often. It feels super uncomfortable. I should get that diagnosed so I could get medication but I just don't really want to. I kinda feel I could work on it myself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had similar symptoms and have been practicing mindful meditation regularly - I'd definitely recommend giving it a go as it's done wonders for me. And without the horrible side effects of most medications. I hope you feel better soon anyway!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you exercise? </p>
<p>Try exercise before you try medication. I had all kinds of mental health issues (including anxiety) that cleared up with exercise and came back when I stopped and went away when I started again.</p>
<p>Like some psychiatric meds it doesn't work right away, you might have to push through for a few weeks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to mindfulness meditation, some of the simpler biofeedback techniques used for anxiety and panic attacks use breathing. You inhale for a certain count, hold for a certain count, and exhale for a certain count. You're also supposed to focus on breathing evenly (like if you imagine a graph of your breathing, you'd want it to have a nice, gentle curve instead of a jagged one.) The technique helps to interrupt the hyperventilation-panic loop, and to distract from the panic attack (rather than being in the &quot;I'm having a panic attack, I'm going to panic some more!&quot; loop.)</p>
<p>It's really simple and easy to do, and I've found it moderately useful--it can help lessen the impact of a panic attack when I'm having one, but it doesn't deal with the underlying cause of the anxiety.</p>
<p>I did some actual hooked-up-to-machines biofeedback sessions, but you can get the same effect from reading about the techniques and using apps (there are a ton of breathing apps that teach you techniques and let you sync your breathing.) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of what you're saying isn't right. Blood pressure does not increase around infection, in fact it decreases. This is done primarily through vasodilation, and increased blood vessel permeability results in increased interstitial fluid in the affected area. This process causes the swelling/heat/redness, which can 'pulse' because this new mass may place pressure on surrounding large arteries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes of course - happy to help! Also, unless the changes in blood pressure are extreme, people don't experience them as hearing heartbeat, symptoms are usually headache, vision changes, generally feeling unwell. I'm an intensive care doctor so deal with this stuff a bit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This topic brings up a question. Do we tune out the sound of our pulse near our ears? If we had  earpieces in that played our heart beat 24/7 would we tune it out. Similar to experiment of people that wore glasses that flipped vision and eventually their brains fliped the what they saw.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our brain certainly filters out repetitive sounds (such as rain) when we're concentrating on something else, and in a quiet room could certainly filter the sound of our heartbeat. Similarly, our brain is constantly masking a significant hole in our vision - the 'blind spot' where the optic nerve interrupts the retina.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let me add to that. The blood flow or pressure may also be affected by vascular disease and/or heart failure. </p>
<p>If I get dehydrated my body throbs along with my pulse, and it took a long time for me to figure out I needed some water, because I never feel thirsty.</p>
<p>OP, try a glass of water next time and see if it stops.</p></div>		</li>
