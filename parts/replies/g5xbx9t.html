			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why you should never &quot;help&quot; a baby turtle out of its nest and into the water. As it's working its way out of the nest, some major behavior patterns are being imprinted that it will need throughout its lifespan. Only if they are in distress should they be handled and taken to a marine life center for proper rehabilitation and release.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did some turtle hatch wrangling in the Keys. We never touched unless there was no choice at all. </p>
<p>Mostly involved blocking light from the causeway and guarding for snakes, birds and raccoons. Raccoons were mostly a problem before hatching so we would put chicken wire down on the beach to cover the nests. Snakes and gulls would be a problem for the trek, though. Weird to see gulls active at midnight but tennis rackets work great for gulls.</p>
<p>E: thx for the whatever’s. To be absolutely clear: Yay turtles. Screw gulls.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am pleasantly imagining two young men running across the sand and leaping through the air to slap a pair of seagulls with tennis rackets. Then  standing with their feet planted in the sand with baby turtles crawling all around, they turn to each other and u/OdouO shouts &quot;Radical!&quot; and high fives his friend who responds with &quot;Totally, Dude!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like this answer and while it explains a lot, it doesn't offer up an explanation for how the brain is &quot;primed to send the turtle in that direction&quot;.  &quot;Primed&quot; how? I feel like this is fundamental to answering the OPs question but I might be wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There probably isn't a widely known answer, but the overarching concept probably goes along the line of: </p>
<p>If Light enters the turtle's eyes-&gt;brain senses this light-&gt;brain produces endorphins<br />
If light intensity is increased-&gt;more endorphins<br />
If light intensity is decreased-&gt;less endorphins<br />
The turtle then acts accordingly.  </p>
<p>An analogy would be something like instinctual sexual desire. Our brain is primed to motivate us with chemicals that makes us feel good whenever we see a potential partner, but it ends there. When we voluntarily use our legs to approach the person, we are just using the tools we have to act on that instinct. </p>
<p>I don't know much about turtle brains, so it may not exactly be endorphins, but the same holds: the brain produces chemicals to urge the animal to do something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a pretty good estimation of the mechanics, although I suspect (with absolutely no authority on turtle brains) that there are chemical motivators other than endorphins. In humans for example, someone driven by hunger may receive endorphins upon finding food, but generally isn't driven by endorphins so much as stomach pain. There can be a lot of physical and emotional motivators with different chemical transmission lines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>DNA codes for how brains get built, just like anything else. Behavior comes from how the neurons in the brain are connected to each other. So evolution can actually work on the brain's DNA to get useful neuron connections and therefore &quot;instinctual&quot; behavior.</p>
<p>Data Scientists actually use evolutionary algorithms to train artificial neural networks sometimes. It's slower for learning than direct feedback, but it totally works.</p>
<p>And it turns out attraction to light is pretty simple, mechanically. You can actually make a little two wheeled robot that is attracted to light simply by wiring a light sensor directly to its wheels, no brain required: <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/light-seeking-robot/all" target="_blank">https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/light-seeking-robot/all</a></p></div>		</li>
