			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s also important to understand that the 3 phases are spaced 120 degrees apart, which is what makes the peak power so consistent. When one phase is reversed, the next is peaking. Like in this photo: <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Eb4Mc.jpg" target="_blank">https://i.stack.imgur.com/Eb4Mc.jpg</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup! We could do 4 phase,  7 phase, 300 phase if we wanted too! We use 3 phase because with extra phases it gets more complicated and therefore more expensive, and 3 phase is the &quot;sweet spot&quot; between efficiency and cost. </p>
<p>Semi related note: Parts of downtown Philadelphia still run off an old 2 phase system, so it's not like 1 and 3 are the only viable systems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Your phases would be spaced out 90 degrees, so phases across the circle from eachother would mirror eachother. This is also known as quadrature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We can, but you dont normally see it because of cost efficiency. The cost of running another line for four phase is normally not worth it. Peak power consistancy doesn't improve enough to justify it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a note, but it's actually due to some trigonometric trickery that 3 phase power is so consistent. Unlike single/split-phase where you end up with a sinusoidal power waveform at twice the line frequency (from the multiplication of voltage and current), with 3 phase electricity you actually end up with a DC power term (assuming a perfectly linear load).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you add all the phases in a 3 phase system together, you actually end up with no current, as each phase cancels the other out (remember, when one is positive valued, one is negative valued and the other is zero). DC is more accurately described as single-phase AC at zero frequency (since it does not change). This is actually how it works out electrically as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good answer. I'll add this visual for OP. Start with single phase 120/240 VAC: think of the pedals on a bike. They are always vertically opposite to each other. They are always the same amount above or below the crankshaft. When one is at the top, the other is at the bottom. When they are part way around, vertically they are still equal (but opposite).</p>
<p>The amount a pedal is above or below the crankshaft is  like the instantaneous voltage <em>and</em> which direction the electrons are wiggling in that moment. In single phase it's easy to imagine the parallels.</p>
<p>Now think of a bike with <em>three</em> evenly spaced pedals. That's kind how 3 phase is. Only one pedal is at the top at a time and when it is, the two are below the crank, but not fully at the bottom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One more benefit: a three phase motor can always start without stalling. A one phase motor needs an external capacitor to get it started. It’s like if you imagine the bike pedals stuck in the top center position, then pushing down on them won’t rotate them...they’ll just stay stuck. With three pedals they can never get stuck since pushing down will always find one pedal that catches it and causes rotation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not the voltage that's steady with 3-phase, it's the power (assuming the load is linear and therefore doesn't introduce harmonics). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well if the load is resistive and the power is constant, the voltage must also be constant.</p></div>		</li>
