			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be more appropriate to say that 'speciation' is a process and just like evolution is not an instantaneous thing. They weren't too too split off yet, so <em>some</em> fertile offspring were possible (IIRC mostly between female humans and male neanderthals, and between female neanderthals and male denisovans) - not all, maybe not much, but enough that there's a bit of their DNA that's still with us.</p></div>		</li>
