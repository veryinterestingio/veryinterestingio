			<div class="markdown"><p>reminds me of a funny story where i was working in a kitchen with my cousin. we always got up to goofy shit, but one day he was tired of standing so he tied a thin rope to the ticket counter leg on one end of the kitchen, the other end to a pipe near the door in the back of the kitchen, and sat in one of our office chairs pulling himself back and forth lol. It only lasted for a short bit since it was mainly just to be stupid and have a laugh, but it was a pretty funny moment.</p></div>		</li>
