			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just colonialism. Metric was a major part of the French Revolution. Replace the money, replace the measures, replace the clock (yes, they had a fully decimal clock with ten hours per day, one hundred minutes per hour, one hundred seconds per minute - want to figure out how long beween 8:83:15 and 9:66:97? Just subtract: 9.6697 - 8.8315, and you're set).</p>
<p>The calendar and clock didn't last (except in the name of the dish, lobster Thermidor), but the metric system did. When Napoleon went around and conquered most of Europe 20 years or so later, guess what his new Revolutionary governments implemented by force? Yep, the metric system.</p>
<p>Except that Britain was never invaded, so they didn't get it. And the US was already independent, and across the sea, so <em>we</em> didn't get it. Most of the rest of the world got it when colonized.</p></div>		</li>
