			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily true, something would happen if an investigation is found to prove a leader committed a war crime for example. Tony Blair was investigated and report filed on whether he committed war crimes by sending troops into Iraq but he was never found guilty of any which many people believe isn’t true. </p>
<p>So I get what you are saying is correct but it’s more about being convicted if the investigation is justified. As oppose to winning or losing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the accusation. Some stuff is difficult to prove, but other examples of war crimes have been so blatant that even a nominal victor is asked to explain how the hell this was ever permitted.</p>
<p>The thing about many wars now is that they’re very, very rarely Country A in isolation vs Country B in isolation. There are networks of allies and trade partners and international media presence. It’s possible to argue that “what I did was not technically a war crime, so I shouldn’t be punished for war crimes”, but it’s very very hard to pretend you never did anything at all.</p></div>		</li>
