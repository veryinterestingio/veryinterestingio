			<div class="markdown"><p>Look into wake induced lucid dreaming(W.I.L.D). It might interest you.(Because you recognize the feeling of your consciousness slipping away, which is one of the key components to having a lucid dream using the W.I.L.D technique. You're on the doorstep.) Essentially, you can go from being consciously awake, to consciously dreaming. There's no disconnect. I've only had 3 of them in the decade I've been lucid dreaming, but they're some of the most crazy experiences I've ever had. For example, one time I was trying to fall asleep after waking up to take a leak and I lucked into one. My center of vision turned into a vortex of color with the image of a butterfly in the center. After a moment, it was gone. But it wasn't over. I was forcefully flipped upside down, drug off my bed, whilst my glasses where crumbled into my face. Then I was floating down through darkness until I saw a house. It continues on for a bit after that, but I really only wanted to tell you about the &quot;entering&quot; experience. It's different every time, but all of them have been intense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Me too!  Falling asleep with the TV on is practically a requirement now.  Or I drag ass all day after getting a couple hours of sleep and then I’m too exhausted to care.  Somewhere between 18-20 hours of being awake it’s like the anxiety flushes out so at least there is a limit.</p></div>		</li>
