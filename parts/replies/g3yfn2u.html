			<div class="markdown"><p>I like that you included 4. Evaporation, because it is important.</p>
<p>I just want to say that thermodynamically, there is just three ways of heat transfer and 4. Evaporation is actually a consequence of heat being transferred (via convection) to water on/in your body, which then heats up and eventually evaporates.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, that is another and maybe better way to say it.</p>

<p>I referred to it as a <strong>consequence</strong> of a given heat transfer, NOT as a &quot;subset&quot;! </p>
<p>Evaporation is a phase transition where liquid is transformed into gas. This may be caused by (amongst others) a temperature change of a liquid relative to its environment. In this example, the temperature change is caused by heat transfer.  I repeat, there are thermodynamically speaking only three modes of heat transfer: Convection, Conduction, and Radiation. </p>

<p>Oh well, here is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_transfer#Mechanisms" target="_blank">wiki article</a> with the following quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_transition" target="_blank"><em>Phase transition</em></a> <em>or phase change, takes place in a</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_system" target="_blank"><em>thermodynamic system</em></a> <em>from one phase or</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_matter" target="_blank"><em>state of matter</em></a> <em>to another one</em> <strong><em>by heat transfer</em></strong> <em>&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In case you neglect wikipedia as a reasonable source, below are some alternative sources (web pages and text books) listing the three (and only those three) modes of heat transfer.</p>
<p>Using your own wording, &quot;I have yet to see undergraduate texts, let alone ELI5 :)&quot; describing evaporation as a mode of heat transfer ;)</p>
