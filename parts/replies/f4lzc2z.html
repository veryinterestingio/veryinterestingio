			<div class="markdown"><p>I was at a pancake breakfast event a couple months ago, and the city fire department sent out a truck there. Apparently they like doing that, as it puts them closer to where any likely emergency would actually be than the fire station, to the point where I personally was able to book one for a local community event that was organized by an organization I am a board member of and all I needed to do was send them an email with a copy of the event plans.</p>
<p>I was talking to one of the fire officers they had there, and they explained some of the things that firefighters actually do. I already knew this, but much of what they actually respond to are vehicle crashes and some medical emergencies, as they are trained in basic paramedic aid and have tools that can demolish even a crushed up vehicle if it needs to be to free a victim. When firefighters are actually fighting fires, they very often are making a decision much like this. If there aren't any people left alive to go in and help, is it worth it to actually save the building? The hose and fire damage are likely to be high, so if the building is already close to collapse or would need total replacement or such replacement that it would be better to just leave it to burn itself out and replace it, that's likely what they will do.</p>
<p>And another thing to keep in mind is that a well designed building up to code will have many things that limit risks in more ways than one might imagine. Something like 95% of fires in buildings with working sprinkler systems are put out by the sprinkler system alone, and while papers or similar are not going to be happy about that, the building itself will be fine. </p>
<p>Fires also don't actually kill by burning the victims nearly as often as people tend to imagine in a fire. Inhalation of smoke and toxic fumes (as many things set on fire can release) is a killer far more often. A burn is bad but many can be treated and you'd have to stand in a fire for a relatively long time before flames alone can kill you. The protection that firefighters wear is important of course, but it's also meant to keep them on the job and not have them hospitalized every time a fire happens, while an individual victim can be kept in the hospital if they need to be.</p></div>		</li>

<p>basic paramedic aid</p>

<p>We prefer the term &quot;ambulance driver&quot;. </p>
<p>Joking aside, at least in the USA it's &quot;first responder&quot;-&gt;EMT-&gt;Paramedic. Most places train their firefighters to at least EMT, but a lot of career (and volunteer that run an ambulance) train to the paramedic level if they staff ambulances. </p>
<p>As for actually fighting fires: It's a function of where in the country you are. Cities burn more due to density, and old buildings and/or poverty lead to more fires. For a sprinkler system to work the building ... actually needs to have one,  and a lot of buildings don't. Residential sprinkler systems are still rare here outside of newer multi-family units. </p>
<p>Plus there's also good old-fashioned arson. People think fire is a great way to get rid of a building they're better off without, to hide a crime, to get back at an ex, or to fulfill their sick urges. And you'll always get fires resulting from  drug, alcohol, or &quot;what were you thinking?&quot; induced carelessness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great answer - the most important thing to any emergency personnel should be &quot;multi-use-case tools&quot;.  The focus on saving lives and ensuring you have the tools to do so are the focus of all firefighters I've met (I've worked with many of them because I'm a CASA, and unfortunately many of them interact with the children I work with because of not-so-happy-reasons).</p>
<p>There are plenty of things that firefighters have on hand that are only used in certain specific circumstances, but even those are multi-use-case tools.  The police are actually the only first responders I can think of who have things like battering rams, which are a &quot;single-use-<em>case</em>&quot; tool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aww thanks!  It's actually really easy and super &quot;rewarding&quot;.  I don't mean that in a cocky way, but in a &quot;it's super cool feeling so useful and seeing how quickly children get past horrifically traumatic events with the right help and support network, and being a small part of that recovery&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
