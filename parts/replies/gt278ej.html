			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worse than that. There is actually massive shortage of the plutonium needed to power these rovers since the isotope used was historically made as a byproduct of nuclear weapons. So NASA doesn't even have enough to put them on nearly as many probes as they wanted and many space probe proposals have actually been declined citing a lack of available of plutonium. The U.S. Government is currently work on making more of this isotope directly but production of it is very, very slow and the shortage could last at least for another decade until production ramps up.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That and due to the nature of its production as a byproduct of weapons grade refined isotopes, there is some...ugh...international treaties... and such the government has to work through. Russians and the US still inspect each other's weapons and manufacturing sites periodically, even when decommissioned as per various treaties to try to lessen the chance of a nuclear Holocaust</p>
<p>If the US starts ramping up similar production standards needed for that isotope of plutonium, there could be some offended parties over seas even with full disclosure/transparency</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To give more scale to the problem, I was at a conference on planetary exploration proposals where one idea was a probe with 5 RTGs that would enter orbit around Pluto and up to asteroids near Pluto's orbit. They had an entire section on how we would need to devote a Year's worth of Plutonium production to this mission if it happened.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually Perseverance runs directly off the RTG except when the load exceeds what it can produce so the <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/rover/electrical-power/" target="_blank">lithium ion batteries</a> arent going though boom/bust cycles all that often. </p>
<p>Voyager uses a similar RTG  (though not lithium in batteries) and has been going since 1977.  Every probe beyond Mars except Juno has used an RTG and most of them are still going, I dont know of a single one where the RTG/batteries have been the source of failure something else always goes wrong first.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Voyager probes had to shut down multiple systems because the RTG power output decreases over decades. This is not a hardware failure however, this is simply the nature of radioactive decay. Voyager 1 and 2 will probably stop being able to use any instrument within the next 10 years, and stop working completely not that much longer afterwards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lithium batteries are actually very good at maintaining their health and lifespan... As long as you treat them right.</p>
<p>It's a push and pull between longetivity and short term efficiency. You can get more power, more storage, and faster recharge out of the battery at the expense of longetivity.</p>
<p>A modern smart phone expects the battery to last somewhere between 2-3 years before the entire phone is replaced. (We aren't worrying about if that is a good thing or not.) The manufacturer then designs the battery to last that long, expecting a full discharge every day and peak power draw regularly. Plus fast recharge, and allowing the battery to charge to maximum. They also don't care so much about maintaining temperature. </p>
<p>An electric car, for comparison, would design the battery to last &gt;8 years. Those batteries are restricted from being charged to full, and also stop discharge before empty. The batteries are also kept in a climate controlled enclosure. Those restrictions extend the life of the battery significantly.</p></div>		</li>
