<p>When I was a baby my mom would take me in the car just to put me to sleep, but now I'm older, I've been hit in the car and I do long drives all the time so I'm pretty sure my body knows the car â‰  sleep but I still find myself getting much more tired in my car, even sometimes able to doze off in an upright position (cannot do that at home, even on the couch or anything) </p>
<p>Obviously the motion of the car could have an effect on me or anyone else that this occurs to, but Im just arguing the whole &quot;our body learns to sleep in our bed&quot; concept.. our body has no preference of where we sleep as long as our brains believe it to be safe. </p>
<p>When you are in a new place trying to sleep for the first time, your brain won't fully rest and will keep part of it &quot;on&quot; , similar to birds that sleep while flying, to keep us in a heightened state of awareness until we are sure they area is safe</p>
<p>I think people don't realize how much of the millions of years of evolution and instinct are still tugging us every which way.</p></div>		</li>
