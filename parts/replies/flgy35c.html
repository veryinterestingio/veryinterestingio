			<div class="markdown"><p>Good summary, but just to add a little.</p>
<p>Although cookies are &quot;for the same site&quot;, there can also be &quot;third party&quot; cookies. These happen because many web pages contain links to e.g. adverts or 1-pixel tracking images other websites. These third party cookies enable (for example) the major advert servers to effectively track you across different web sites.</p>
<p>Some of the major browser have announced that they will stop sending third party cookies.</p>
<p>In any case the major browser have setting so that you can disable third party cookies, but most people don't change the default settings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cookies aren't bad, they are one of the foundations of the modern web. Without a cookie (or any similar concept) a webserver wouldn't be able to differentiate between different requests. Basic things like different users would't be possible.  </p>
<p>But yes, any website which is using third party services, e.g. uses advertisements or a &quot;share on social media&quot; button makes it possible for third parties to track you around the web and gather a lot of data on you.  </p>
<p>One of the worst offenders is the Facebook like button. There are so many websites which have it you can't avoid it. If you ever see such a button: &quot;Facebook knows you have been here&quot;. You can compare it to just handing over your browsing history at this point.  </p>
<p>But there is also a way around this. If you configure your browser to only allow first party cookies the tracking gets a lot harder, but not impossible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The goal of the modern digital advertising world is to build audiences which advertisers can show their ads to. The more accurate and larger the audiences the more a platform (like Google or Facebook for example) can charge an advertiser. The name of the game is building large accurate audiences and a way to show them ads. There ya go, thats why Google and Facebook are worth hundreds of billions of dollars.</p>
<p>In a few cases the same company does both pieces; Google builds the audience <em>and</em> serves the ad. Sometimes that is different companies; company X builds and audience based on their own data and pays google to show the ads to that audience.</p>
<p>How does company X get audience data? By paying for anonymized data from any of the hundreds or thousands of companies who are also collecting data about you. Everyone from big names like Verizon to little companies like that flashlight app that collects location data you installed are collecting data and then selling it on to data aggregators who de-duplicate it, clean it, group it together, and sell it on to company X.</p>
<p>If I sell running shoes I dont want to pay money to show an ad to everyone, I only want to show my ad to &quot;20-30 year olds who enjoy outdoor activities and healthy eating who have shopped for shoes online&quot;. If a company like Google or Facebook can learn enough about you (and many other people) then I am willing to pay more to show my ad to that audience because they are more likely to buy from me. If enough people respond to my ad then I make more profit than the cost of my ad.</p>
<p>Does it bother you that there are thousands of companies building profiles about you so that data can be used to target more accurate ads at you? If so then its bad. If not then its not bad. Or you can be somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>Maybe you're OK with Google doing it but not OK with Creepy App Company doing it. If so then you'll be happy to know that's the direction the industry is moving. The more &quot;locked down&quot; cookie tracking gets, like the upcoming changes to Chrome, the fewer companies can track you. It is very much in Google (and Facebook's) interest to be the sole owners of that audience data which is why they are locking down their data in visible ways and also behind the scenes. They'll say it's &quot;to enhance privacy&quot; (and it does) but it also enhances their control and therefore the prices for ads.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't necessarily know your email address, but it can help them to target ads, because they might have an idea of the kind of pages you visit.</p>
<p>In some ways this is not necessarily bad - if you're going to see ads, then you'd probably prefer to see ads that are of some interest. On the other hand there are obvious privacy concerns.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can disable third party cookies in Chrome. I recommend you do this, since they are enabled by default. You can find the setting under: (translated from Dutch, hope it's correct)</p>
<p>Settings - Site Settings - Cookies</p>
<p>Then check 'block indirect cookies'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that while cookies get a bad rap, they're useful for not only the stuff the guy above you said, but also because it helps sites and even advertisers better craft your experience. If I have to see advertising across the web, I prefer that I get ads for stuff I might actually buy. It helps me identify new products and stuff like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Beyond direct persistence, they're also good for non-account customization.  This is relatively rare at this point, but I like it when sites do that.</p>
<p>You could have any kind of preferences, like &quot;what columns to show&quot;, or &quot;sort order&quot;, or whatever, saved in a cookie.  The site itself doesn't have to store <em>anything</em> about you... because when you visit you send them the cookie that says &quot;here are my preferences from last time&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
