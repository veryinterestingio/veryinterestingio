<p>The USA just decided to call its subdivisions &quot;states,&quot; even though the term &quot;state&quot; generally refers to a sovereign state. (The USA is not the only sovereign state to do this, but it does lead to some degree of confusion in instances like this.)</p>

<p>The Swedish translation of US states is &quot;sub-states&quot;, which I think is a better term than the native one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the context of the US, were originally (if briefly) independent, sovereign states. American constitutional law still retains some of this language, for example we still talk about state sovereignty or dual sovereignty. And while sovereign states have the power to regulate all manner of behavior, the federal government lacks what we call general police power. This is the power to prohibit common criminal behaviors like murder, robbery, or burglary. All of these law are passed and enforced by the individual states unless there's some specific relationship to the federal government (like the place burgled was a federal property or the person killed was a federal agent or employee.)</p></div>		</li>
