			<div class="markdown"><p>If I’m listening to something not too demanding (action audiobook or a podcast that isn’t too mentally demanding), I sometimes start reading online news/Reddit on my phone (the reading material also can’t be too complex). However, I quickly realised that this only really works at all if the reading and the listening is in two different languages. If it’s in the same language I’ll drop out of one thing, but if they’re different and the material not too complex, I can actually multitask.</p></div>		</li>
