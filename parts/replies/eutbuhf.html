			<div class="markdown"><p>I literally canâ€™t breath of rollercoasters. I like them otherwise but on the initial drop when everyone else is screen Iâ€™m choked, similar those first attempted breaths after you have the wind really knocked out of you.</p>
<p>So I went skydiving recently, no idea if id be able to take a breath during free fall, but it worked out fine :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It only lasts for the first small bit. Once your body stops accelerating downwards so much it's completely gone. I fully recommend skydiving, it's just plane awesome</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was the strangest part for me when I did go sky-diving; no one told me I wouldn't 'feel' anything.  I respect heights, but I'm not afraid of them per se, so it was really just kind of a cool view.  If anything, it felt like if I'd snapped out of my harness, I'd drop a few feet onto a realistic looking map below me.  Things didn't get 'real' until the chute was open.</p>
<p>I'm glad I did it, but for the money and time, I'd much rather go to an amusement park, any day of the week.  But at least now I have way more respect for base-jumpers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But... It has to be similar though right? I've jumped off some pretty high cliffs and the sensation was still there. It's hard to breathe for me while falling. I fear that it'd be that way but for way longer if I went skydiving</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not at all. You feel kinda like you're on a pillow because of the air rushing past, but otherwise don't feel like you're falling really. If you flip around and look at the plane shortly after you jump you get this really trippy feeling like the plane is the one falling away from you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>isn't that phenomenon about your upward momentum contrasting the vehicle's downward motion? I recall it being explained to me this way, highlighting the fact that, for the purposes of physics (and the logically-ensuing things from it in the case of cars like, y'know, safety) the person and the car are two very different entities that can behave in different ways at the same time, with the passengers behaving as sort of fluid particles, which are effected by the motions of the container, ie the car.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's pretty much the same principle as being in a rollercoaster. The momentum changes from going uphill to going downhill.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point, unless the car is tethered to the road in some manner then it can only accelerate downwards at a maximum of 1G, therefore the occupants of the vehicle should not feel any more pull downwards from the vehicle than they do from the earth itself.</p></div>		</li>
