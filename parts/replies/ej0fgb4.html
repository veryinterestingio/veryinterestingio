			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two answers to this. The amount of &quot;dry land&quot; exposed on earth fluctuates at a relatively high frequency on geologic timescales, due to changes in sea level. So during ice ages for example, there's more water locked up in ice, so sea level is lower, so there's more exposed land. Sea level also controls the amount of sedimentation, i.e. whether river deltas are depositing more sediment than is being eroded.</p>
<p>You could also ask about the amount of continental crust over time. Earth is unique in that it has two kinds of crust: thin, dense, and silica-poor oceanic crust, and thicker, relatively bouyant, and silica-rich continental crust. During the first billion years of the Earth's evolution, the first continental crust was generated from magma differentiation. The first continents were small and volcanic, with cores of granite. Today, these are preserved in some areas of the world as cratons/shields. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much. The western part of North America is much younger, and was added (&quot;accreted&quot;) onto the margin of the Shield much later during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So how did these two different kinds of crust differentiate in the first place? I guess the answer is like you said magmatic differentiation, but how did this specifically lead to two types of plates where the oceanic is more dense/mafic?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Bingo. Oceanic lithosphere is fractionated from partial melting of mantle rock. Continental lithosphere is even more chemically evolved and occurs from several rounds of fractionation via recycling and partial melting, as occurs at subduction zones. Oceanic and continental lithsosphere are not types of plates btw, a tectonic plate can be just oceanic lithosphere, though it usually consists of both. There is no such a thing as a purely continental tectonic plate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. First of all, we had radically more landmass relatively recently when there were giant glaciers sequestering around four hundred feet of ocean. During the last ice age, there was a waterfall at the edge of New Jersey where the Hudson river exited into the sea. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From a plate tectonic perspective though, this was the same amount of continental landmass we have today, jut more of it was exposed. </p>
<p>If we look at the actual amount of continental crust through time, we find that this does vary, it gradually increases over time (the production of continental crust is an irreversible process). Going back far enough we find that much of it was produced in a sort of rapid growth period for continental crust during the Archean, when the Earth was hotter and larger melt fractions were produced. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Surface area is the only thing that really matters, and it fluctuates with sea level. When an ice age rolls around, the sea level is far lower and we get a lot more surface area, when it thaws we get a lot less. For example, the east coast of australia extended several kilometers further out during the ice age. Islands were part of the mainland. Now that its rising, we'll steadily have less total area above sea level</p>
<p>The only real exception to that is islands created by volcanic activity and plate tectonics, but they're not too significant in terms of total area or crust mass.</p>
<p>Mass isnt a great measure because a lot of the crust is below sea level. Earth is basically a closed system so the crusts mass remains relatively unchanged despite its changes in distribution.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Plate tectonics is incredibly significant in terms of total continental landmass. Without plate tectonics, there would be none at all. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but the rate of subduction is roughly equal to the rate of divergence. So it evens itself out pretty neatly. On one edge of the plate, crust is being formed and on the other it's being returned to the mantle. Generally speaking </p></div>		</li>
