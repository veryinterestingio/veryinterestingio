			<div class="markdown"><p>Something to point out for whomever is interested- women have been found to be more susceptible than males for HIV when talking about vaginal sex. </p>
<p>I thought it was due to cell type lining but I was wrong. </p>
<p>Apparently its due to various reasons including semen containing more HIV, vagina being a warm and moist place with many mucousal membranes to pass through (similar to GI i guess?). I find it really interesting! <a href="https://www.archguelph.ca/biological-susceptibility" target="_blank">https://www.archguelph.ca/biological-susceptibility</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought this was very well known already. </p>
<p>Transmission of fluid in general from male to female is much higher than from female to male (i.e. semen) and the skin on the penis is much thicker than the skin inside the vagina. Those two things alone would make transmission rates much higher from male to female.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Vagina needs lubrication so why doesn't it have columnar cells instead?</p>
<p>The anus doesn't need to absorb or secrete anything so why does is it columnar instead of epithelial?</p>
<p>Thanks</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The vagina needs epithelial cells to protect it from the friction of a penis. The lubrication comes from small glands that do have columnar cells, embedded around the vagina. The anus is epithelial lining. The rectum is columnar—it absorbs water just like the colon. During anal sex you’ll have direct contact of seminal fluid and the rectum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vagina is lined by squamous cells which make alot of sense. </p>
<p>Due to friction, we nee multiple layers of epithelium to continue to serve its function of protection. So like the skin, we can loose some layers in the vagina without damage. </p>
<p>To the lubrication, there are glands which are epithelial cells. Considering amount needed, columnar wouldn't be enough, we need glands to really build the level of lubrication. </p>
<p>The anus is columnar because it needs the microvilli to move the stool as well. Columnar are the only type of cells capable of having microvilli i think.</p></div>		</li>
