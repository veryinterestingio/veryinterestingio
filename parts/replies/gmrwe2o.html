			<div class="markdown"><p>Cognitive ability and neuropsychological performance are not necessarily embedded genetically. One of the main issues is the psychosocial issues that more directly impact ability. As we age, our abilities are formed via parenting, exposure to diverse experiences, quality of education, nutrition, trauma, etc. often, differences in cognition between race are best explained by socioeconomic status. Also, there are many twin studies of siblings that were separated at birth and even though they have the same genetics, end up with different IQs, because environment plays such a key role in formation of cognition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree about the nature v nurture disparity and considering the difference in class as well as race seems more appropriate. Where we grew up, what our dietary habits were and our early sleep patterns can also be essential to our brain development. There are far too many variable to simply boil it down to racial differences.</p></div>		</li>
