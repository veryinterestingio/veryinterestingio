			<div class="markdown"><p>Canada is a HUGE landmass so the weather isn't moderated by large bodies of water. Also, if you look at how the jet stream fluctuates north south across North America, you see that the weather is highly variable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup just about every part of Canada experiences this except for the west coast of BC. Even the Toronto area by the Lakes, because even though the Great Lakes are massive, they're not large enough bodies of water to effectively regulate temperature. Toronto and the parts of the states near the lakes get none of the benefits of living near large bodies of water and all the shitty parts lol. No (or minimal) temperature regulation but massive snowsqualls in the winter and high humidity in the summer.  </p>
<p>i.e. Toronto in summer can be almost as hot as Texas (largely due to the humidity from the lakes), though typically it doesn't have as long heat waves. In winter it's typically around freezing to -10c with it possibly going as low as -30 or -40.  </p>
<p>Yet as you said, the way the jet stream tends to dip and rise in North America leads to systems that bring warm gulf air or frigid arctic air into these regions and can make for very abnormal days compared to seasonal temperature values.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just depends on latitude and geography. I live in the northern US and the temperature between extremes (different times of year of course) is between -20 and 110. Between 0 and 100 pretty reliably.</p></div>		</li>
