			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer. I want to add a little about the history of this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ‘double-storey’ <strong>a</strong> and ‘double-storey’ <strong>g</strong>, as they’re called in typography, come from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolingian_minuscule" target="_blank">Carolingian minuscule</a>, a script which was developed to help standardize writing in Charlemagne’s empire. As you mentioned, in handwriting the single-storey versions are popular because they are easy to write by hand. But in type design, the double storey versions are equally popular, if not moreso.</li>
<li>During the Renaissance, when printing began, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackletter" target="_blank">blackletter</a> type was more popular than upright Roman type (based on the Carolingian script with Roman inscriptional capitals). Italic (based on the Chancery script used in Italy during the Renaissance) was equal to the Roman type – meaning it would be used for entire books – instead of being subordinate like it is now. So there were three different distinct categories of typeface, which were all popular. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutenberg_Bible" target="_blank">first mass produced book</a> was actually printed in blackletter.</li>
<li>Blackletter fell out of favour over time, until the 19th century, when it was mostly only still used in Germany, where it remained extremely popular. 19th century German newspapers sometimes used blackletter for body text. Blackletter was something of a symbol of national identity, but it eventually became associated with the Nazis, and was more or less killed by this association after 1945.</li>
<li>Over time, Italic fell into its current familiar role as subordinate to the Roman. In conjunction with the fall of blackletter, this left us with the now familiar Roman type as the primary style.</li>
<li>The now so familiar sans serif, so called because it omits the ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serif" target="_blank">serifs</a>’, did not appear until the early–mid 19th century. It was developed as a bold, high impact, all caps typeface style for advertising. It took until almost the 20th century for the sans serif to become popular, when lowercase letters began to be included. Sans serifs have only really been accepted for use as text fonts in the 21st century, as serifs have traditionally been thought to be more legible. Sans serifs have finally taken their place as equal to traditional serif typefaces. Recently, there has even been some research showing that sans serifs are slightly more legible than serifs due to their simpler forms, and for dyslexic people this is even more true. Now, sans serifs are even used for text in some books (a <em>very</em> traditional medium), and the dominant style on the web is the sans serif.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m not really going anywhere with this, I just thought it could be useful to provide a little context.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The primary reason for the surge in popularity of sans serif in the modern era is that low resolution screens make serifs more difficult to read. That made them ubiquitous in digital media. Then as screens became higher resolution we started seeing more different kinds of sans serif rather than a return to serif. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not true. Sans-Serif surged in popularity in the post-WWII era, as part of Modernism in art and style. Things were to be simple, less ornate and functional. Sans-serif fonts are not more common since computer screens came around.</p>
<p>It makes no sense and is factually wrong. Sans Serif fonts are <em>not</em> more easy to read on low resolution screens. It's the exact opposite. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/YUd1FE1.png" target="_blank">Look at the MS-DOS terminal font</a> - it has serifs. Without them you would not be able to distinguish I, 1 and L there. Not only that but <em>new serifs were added</em>, in that computers started using the stroked-through zero to distinguish it from uppercase o. </p>
<p>Even before that, in the 1960s you had <a href="https://www.idautomation.com/ocr-a-and-ocr-b-fonts/ocr-example-shadow.png" target="_blank">OCR fonts for numbers</a> which had special serifs and a style of their own to make then possible to read optically with the computers of the era. And that <em>did</em> influence design and style by inspiring the font <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Westminsterfont.svg" target="_blank">Westminister</a> which was the 'futuristic, computer font' from the 1960s well into the 80s. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is really neat and I had never thought about it, even though I have done a decent amount of research about how the tools used to create letters and words have shaped them historically. It is just another building block in the development of our language.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Re blackletter, the nazi association would be ironic because the nazis discouraged use of this type as too archaic and difficult to read. They were very much into promoting German history and designs, but they were also modernists in many respects and their monumental architecture was quite simplistic for that reason. Smooth lines were seen as modern and so the various blackletter, fraktur styles were not modern by comparison.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m pretty ignorant on the relationship between the Nazis and art, so correct me if I‘m wrong, but my understanding is that they sort of reversed course in 1941. That year, Bormann described blackletter as ‘Jewish letters’. However, I believe that prior to 1941 they promoted it as a German script, compared to the ‘Jewish’ Roman script. I know they used it for their letterhead. For example, <a href="http://ligaturix.de/bormann.htm" target="_blank">Bormann’s communiqué announcing the switch</a> from blackletter to Roman type still used the old letterhead in blackletter. Even their newspaper, Völkisher Beobachter used blackletter at one time. <a href="https://www.dhm.de/lemo/bestand/objekt/d2z00352" target="_blank">Here’s</a> one from 1923 and <a href="https://www.dhm.de/lemo/bestand/objekt/zeitung-voelkischer-beobachter-1939.html" target="_blank">another</a> from 1939.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard that the original reason for serifs was that they helped 'pull' ink into the corners of the letter shapes, because sometimes the ink didn't flow all the way to all the edges.</p>
<p>A sans-serif character with ink missing might not be recognizable, but a serif character with ink missing would often just look like the sans-serif equivalent which *was* recognizable.</p>
<p>Now that this is no longer a problem, we're stuck with it anyway because people are used to it and resistant to change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Serifs originated from Roman letters carved in stone, inscriptional letters.</p>
<p>These were end strokes the chisel made. Type designers kept on using these traits when designing movable type years later, even when they weren’t necessary anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Serifs guide the eye, that is why they are bad for dyslexics, they pull our focus. So in a book they keep you reading on the same line, but can make a person prone to transposing letters more likely to.</p></div>		</li>
