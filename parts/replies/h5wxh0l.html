<p>Or something?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having done some extensive growing of mushrooms as a hobby, would this account for the inability of shrooms grown in a sterile environment to fight off foreign bodies / pathogens / mold? Is it due to not having to learn the necessary factors to hold their own, like they would in the wild?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The linked review discusses <em>innate</em> immunity, as opposed to the adaptive immunity that we usually talk about in the context of human health (especially for the last yeast) and which it appears fungi don't have (though fungi are very diverse, and maybe something of the sort just hasn't been discovered yet).</p>
<p>Innate immunity can, however, &quot;adapt&quot; to the environment through gene regulation. Plants, for instance, will start expressing immune response genes throughout their entire structure if a pathogen is detected in just one location, essentially anticipating future attacks. I would hypothesize that similar long-distance regulation exists in fungi, which could explain your observation. Of course, another potential explanation is that pathogens are more virulent in a sterile environment because they do not have to compete for resources with non-pathogenic microorganisms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just put a batch in their tub on <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ONWkoX0.jpg" target="_blank">Sunday</a>.  I'm growing the illicit kind in order to experiment with some of the antidepressant qualities they may have, but one can grow the legal edible ones as well just as easily.</p>
<p>It's time intensive, and a little investment to get started right, but it's certainly a fun project.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, never had any desire to get into the hot mess that comes with selling. Personal use only. But it's entirely easy to get started with. Spores101.com is where I've always gotten my syringes and if you want PM me and I'll show you the best method for a low-tech setup with high yields I've worked out over many harvests.</p></div>		</li>
