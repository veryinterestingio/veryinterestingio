			<div class="markdown"><p>The sun emits light radially in all directions. If you were very close to the sun you’d be hit by sunlight from a small arc length of the sun. As you get further and further away this arc length shrinks as light from the original arc now are going above and below you. As the arc shrinks the internal angle shrinks making the top and bottom line closer and closer to parallel. </p>
<p>By the time you get to the earth the arc length is so small the radial arc lines are parallel for all intents and purposes (but not <em>exactly</em> parallel). </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really.  When a bunch of people look at, say, a stop sign, they all see the same sign, in the same place.  They each get a different &quot;batch&quot; of photons than the others, but all those photons are bouncing off the same source (the sign.)  When a group of people look at a rainbow, the photons they see are &quot;bouncing off&quot; (there is some internal reflection, as well as refraction) of different source water droplets for each person; they each see a &quot;different&quot; rainbow, in a different place.  Even if two people are looking at the same droplet, they'll be viewing it from a different angle and so the color of light that reaches them from that specific point will be a different color.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add, when seen from a plane, a rainbow can be a full circle.</p>
<p>Also, the sky is blue due to <del>refraction</del> scattering through the atmosphere, as well. As the sun sets it  <del>refracts</del> scatters such that other wavelengths are now visible (violet, orage, red, etc.)</p>
<p>There are even very specific conditions, as the Sun is setting over a calm ocean, for example, that the sky will light up green. It is called a &quot;green flash&quot; and occurs for only a split second, if you are lucky.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Not refraction, but scattering of the light through the atmosphere. The sky changes colors at sunset because blue light scatters more easily than red and yellow light. This is because blue light has a much shorter wavelength. When the sun is setting, the light has to travel farther through the atmosphere, so the blue light gets scattered and overpowered by the longer wavelength light colors.</p></div>		</li>
