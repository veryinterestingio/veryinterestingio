			<div class="markdown"><p>There was actually an Apple computer that this was the suggested method of getting it to work after it had overheated. It would get too hot and the chips would pop out, pick it up and drop it. Problem solved.</p>
<p>Edit: It was the apple III</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a ticket for an iPad that had a discoloration on the entire screen.  I dropped it into a soft surface (carpet) onto it's side from about 18 inches.  Not only did it immediately fix it, but that same method has worked several times on other iPads that came in after with the same problem.  It was our inside joke for weeks to drop iPads for anything that was wrong with them.  ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Implies there is a class of people that decided this is common enough to have a common term to describe the behaviour.</p>
<p>The belief then is that the term implies it's a common behaviour and thus this isn't a made up BS by one person.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had an old TV that frequently lost the picture quality, and smacking it always fixed it. After doing this for a couple years, I realized that hitting it was jostling a settings dial, which didn't click into place but spun freely. Instead of beating on the top, I could have gently spun the dial. My way worked though.</p></div>		</li>
