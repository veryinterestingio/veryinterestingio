			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, I think the issue is just quantity. I did my homework because I had to for a good grade, even though it was largely repetitive and frustrating. If there had been a graded homework assignment say, once a week, with one example of each type of problem we'd been learning about throughout the week, then optional additional practice assigned throughout the week that shows you variations on those problems, I'd have felt a lot more confident with the material.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Homework is a formality.  Teachers assign it because administrators bark at them if they don't.  The same administrators bark at them if they take a grade on it.   It also can't be too difficult because not every child has someone at home who can help them with it.   I used to feel guilty every time I sent it home but had no choice.  Either it's easy because they already know it and thus provides little benefit or it's too hard because they don't and they show up the next day with it incomplete and have questions about it.  </p>
<p>My experience is in elementary.  The only homework that provides significant benefit in my experience is nightly reading, spelling and memorizing multiplication tables.  In these two cases speed of recall is important so students will benefit even if they already know how to perform the task on a basic level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Totally understand. It's definitely a systemic issue, and the education system as a whole should be overhauled to focus more on actual education and less on satisfying arbitrary, ill-thought out criteria.</p>
<p>Also agree on a lot of elementary school homework. For those fundamental skills, I think repetition is definitely key (just like with Duolingo, as mentioned).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my experience teaching high school, it's almost worse at times because the kids just cheat. They copy it from their friends, and I've seen issues even in class where a kid finishes and then takes a picture and airdrops it to everyone else. So they're learning nothing because they're just copying other answers without even looking at the questions, and it's hard to stop that when they can work on it at home.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a math teacher in high school that would put one hard math problem that we didn’t cover in class on his tests. It pissed me off when I couldn’t get 100%. Stopped enjoying math around that time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My high-school calculus teacher gave us pop open book test (5 each for 20% of our final grade) and somewhere around half of the stuff on each test hadn’t even been mentioned in class. There was no syllabus to read ahead in order to prepare. I saw mathematical signs on test that I didn’t even know existed. Most failed, but I managed to pass, got college credit (AP), and unbeknownst to me prepared for the college learning style. I hated that guy, but i now appreciate that he essentially taught me how to learn by / for myself. Can’t say his other students felt the same..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm confused as to why you expect to be able to ace every test without synthesizing new ideas building upon previous knowledge. Multiple of my high school math classes were built on this concept, and it was clear from the outset that if you wanted an A as opposed to an A- or a B+, you had to perform consistently alright on those hard questions. They were all soluble with material learnt in class, but the goal was to find the way in which the concepts we learned could be applied. Doing that alone got you most of the points, even if you couldn't quite get the right answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In 9th and 10th grade, I did just enough to keep my grades above water then aced the tests. I feel ya with my mom, she'd stand over me breathing down my neck until it was done to her satisfaction, even if the teacher told us we only had to do it part way and the next part was for tomorrow night because she hadn't gotten far enough in the lesson.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, I started this in 6th grade and did it all the way through high school. I had this down to a science.</p>
<p>The only time it ever backfired on me was my sophomore year chemistry class. I could not get my head around the math related to molar mass and conversion and bombed the tests for those units. Later I found out that was because my teacher was shitty at explaining it. (We didn't have an internet to consult back then.)</p>
<p>My parents absolutely despised this approach, which was in part why I did it.</p></div>		</li>
