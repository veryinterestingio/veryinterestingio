			<div class="markdown"><p>Friendly reminder to not get your hopes up much. </p>
<p>I missed their first fly-over my house on Thursday (June 4th), and ever since I've been trying to watch them (they supposedly pass over every day, at roughly the same time - I use <a href="https://james.darpinian.com/satellites/" target="_blank">https://james.darpinian.com/satellites/</a> as well to check), and I haven't been able to see them, even in 0% cloudy nights. I guess that, as they are already spreading out since launch, they are becoming less visible, and I live in a big city, so light pollution may not help. Also, beware they will not be in a &quot;train&quot; as on pictures/video from observations on launch day.</p>
<p>Hope you're lucky and still can spot them!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh, that's weird. I've been out a couple of times to see some of the older trains passing by. Never had any trouble seeing them. Hope you get to see it some day. It's not super impressive, but very interesting.</p></div>		</li>
