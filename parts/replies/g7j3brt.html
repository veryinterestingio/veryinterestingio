			<div class="markdown"><p>Chemist here.  It is mostly due to the hydrophobic (water hating) or hydrophilic (water loving) nature of the material. Because plastic doesn't like water, it beads. When water beads it takes a longer time to evaporate. Because the surface of ceramics or glass loves water it spreads out.  Spreading out allows it to evaporate faster</p>
<p>Edit- changed &quot;takes more energy to evaporate&quot; to &quot;takes a longer time to evaporate&quot; to be more accurate. It takes the same amount of energy (anyone who knows thermo better than me, please correct me). But a ball of water (bead) will take longer to evaporate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>came here to say this. also, i think that and the heat capacity of plastic is also at play.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It likely contributes some but imy guess is very little... here's my thought process- if you take the two materials, one glass surface and one plastic surface in room temperature, add a small amount of water, the water on the glass will evaporate faster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The amount of heat needed depends on the mass since you would be pumping more latent heat into it for a complete phase change. Since its such a small amount, and a spherical drop, the mechanisms of heat transfer need to &quot;reach&quot; into the center of the droplet while if it was spread on ceramic the translational motion of atoms dont need to &quot;reach&quot;. So, the droplet takes more energy and more time.</p>
<p>As an example you could think of the heating of ice. Does crush iced melt faster than a whole ice cube if they are the same mass? More surface area, lesser mass per chunk of the crushed ice, heat transfers faster, less energy, and less time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like this. What about when the two have exactly the same mass? What if Both the droplet (on plastic) and the thin layer (on glass or ceramic) were equal mass? What if the entire system is the same temperature?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a lil stupid when it comes to thermo and chem, even though its my major.., but I'd assume the bead of water takes longer because on a ceramic the same mass of water has spread out over a larger area so more heat energy can reach it. Whereas as bead of water is concentrated in a small area so the more mass = more energy, but takes longer because of plastic's inability to transfer the heat as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To try simplify: You know how when you touch a metal slide on a very hot day and it feels really hot, but the plastic right next to it doesn't feel as hot? Some materials are better than others at transferring heat. Metals are generally good at it. </p>
<p>Some things are also better at holding onto <em>more</em> heat than others. Like how if you fill up a small hot water bottle and a big hot water bottle with the same temperature water, the big one will stay warm for longer. It depends on how heavy they are and what they're made of. Metals and ceramics are heavy, plastic is light.</p>
<p>When water gets warm it evaporates easier. Plastic is bad at transferring heat and holding onto it compared to metals and ceramics, so it is less good at making the water warm and evaporating it after the dishwaser is turned off.</p></div>		</li>
