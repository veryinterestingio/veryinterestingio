<p>Plenty of explanation, interesting cases and awesome bedside manner. Ofc he's just one podiatrist (and all that's featured is his professional opinion for the case presented) but he's one hell of a podiatrist. Really recommend checking out his channel for abnormal growth causes, treatment options depending on the situation, as well as other foot issues. </p>
<p>Or if you like pimple popping and aren't grossed out by feet, you'll love his vids.</p>
<p>Adding to OP's comment, the edge of the nail can grow into the skin following a single trauma (e.g. bad nail cut) or repeated trauma (e.g. hard work boots) and some people are just genetically predisposed to it due to the shape of the nailbed.</p></div>		</li>
