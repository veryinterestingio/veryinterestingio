<p>There was a great novel featuring that idea written by Robert Schneider. It's called &quot;Schlafes Bruder&quot; in German, idk about translation names. But if you can find it, it's highly recommendable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but there were also composers like Clementi, who were as big at the time (got the shot and made it) but were at some point forgotten. </p>
<p>Bach for example was forgotten for a long time and resurfaced somehow. </p>
<p>Also different times and cultures tend to like and appreciate different music.
Classical music is subsidised by the government, so it's easier survive. Jazz not as much, pop not at all...</p></div>		</li>
