			<div class="markdown"><p>Close. Hard water contains calcium and magnesium ions which react with detergent and soap and make them less effective. Also the result of this reaction can stuck to the fabrics.</p>
<p>The acid in the vinegar dissolves these residues. Note: Using any acid in your washing machine might damage the seals and tubes over time.</p>
<p>If you wash with soft water you do not need to use vinegar.</p>
<p>Also, washing is a mechanical process which will wear down fabrics over time. Low temp, mild detergents and short, not too strong spin cycles help.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a similar issue after moving.  I highly recommend getting a shower filter.  The area I moved to used chloramine to treat their water, so I had to get a filter that addressed that.  I used the Aquasana filter and liked it.  Their filter that addresses chloramine had to be ordered directly from them (their regular filters could be ordered from Amazon).  I moved again and don't need the filter anymore, so not sure if that is still the case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just pour it in. I pour in about a half cup of distilled white vinegar when I wash my running clothes because it helps deodorize them, I usually wait until thereâ€™s some water in there already. To use as a fabric softener, you want to pour a cup into the machine during the last rinse cycle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I add some vinegar to every wash I make with powder detergent. I put about 100mL into the fabric softener compartment of my front-loading machine, and that does the trick! It also prevents me from every having white build up from the detergent on my clothes.</p></div>		</li>
