			<div class="markdown"><p>You get so much training and experience that you learn not to. You rub your nose on your shoulder if you have an itch, or ignore it until you can wash your hands. Or if there's a coworker in the hallway, they might do you a solid and scratch your back right quick. You become really, really aware of where your hands are and what you've touched when you're working with, say, a homeless lady with scabies, or an elderly person with C.Diff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Working in restaurants also taught me not to touch my face. </p>
<p>I may also get really, really annoyed when my daughter swishes her freshly-brushed hair in the kitchen at dinner time. </p>
<p>I appreciate nurses a lot. Not comparing prep work to patient care, just acknowledging that with practice you can learn to not touch your face with your hands. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's something you learn over time. I just finished my first semester in nursing school and the first few weeks were how to avoid spreading disease. </p>
<p>But never fails when you're elbow deep in blood/urine/poop/vomit/etc your face always itches.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My girlfriend and I would get ill pretty easily. We've heard that touching your face etc without washing your hands increases the chance of getting ill. We trained ourselves to stop doing it. Took a few weeks.</p>
<p>Turns out, we just needed a better diet :D</p></div>		</li>
