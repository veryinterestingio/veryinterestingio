			<div class="markdown"><p>It's definitely a major surgery, but can be done safely with skilled specialists. Also, the liver is naturally made of multiple lobes and there is a less risk of bleeding if you cut out a lobe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The liver can be anatomically (and functionally) divided into different lobes. Usually a larger section is cut out of the healthy donor and transplanted to the patient along the “lines” that separate some of these lobes with the major blood supplies clipped and then reattached. A transplant like this requires both patients to stay alive (unlike a heart transplant) so the two surgical teams work on their own patient stop the bleeding and reattach major blood supplies, respectively. How the bleeding is specifically stopped in the donor from smaller vessels I’m not 100% on but I’m assuming there’s a lot of cauterization happening. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Liver is made of <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjP7IXuqIfhAhWDr6QKHTRUAo0QjRx6BAgBEAU&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DDONcEl3q_WQ&amp;psig=AOvVaw3hroUU74-XOBNrOfj1PCYu&amp;ust=1552848301383191" target="_blank">segments</a>, each of them receives macroscopic blood vessels and bile ducts.<br />
A surgeon can clamp these, cut and saw them to a new patient (or stich them closed in the donor). Cutting in the middle of a segment will cause unstoppable bleeding because there is no macroscopic vessel to work on.<br />
Despite that, liver transplant is still one of the most demanding surgeries in terms of blood donation, mostly because of the huge surgical field they need to work on the organ, sometimes because one or more sutures are not &quot;holding&quot; properly in the reperfusion phase.<br />
Btw donation of a small fraction of liver from living donor is a pretty rare, and it's usually done from adult to child  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You mean transplanting a piece of healthy liver to a hemophilia patient? It's an interesting question that I never thought about. So I did some quick internet search. According to World Federation of Hemophilia, transplant could technically cure hemophilia (makes sense, since healthy liver cells would be able to produce the normal clotting factors) but not commonly done because the benefit does not outweigh the risk. Here's the <a href="https://www.wfh.org/en/page.aspx?pid=637#Cure" target="_blank">page.</a> Scroll down to &quot;Is there cure for hemophilia?&quot; on the FAQ page.</p>
<p>There are other conditions where organ transplant could technically offer a cure, but not commonly done because of the risk of severe complication. With medical advancement, many diseases can be managed well and offer almost-normal life expectancy. So, a risky procedure like organ transplant would not be recommended. An example is sickle cell disease. People with sickle cell disease used to die in their 30s. But with better medications and management, their life expectancy is much longer now. So, even though bone marrow transplant could cure sickle cell disease, it's almost never done.</p></div>		</li>
