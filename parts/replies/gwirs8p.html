			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the first things we learned during my smithing training was not to wear gloves. It's not likely you'll touch red-hot metal by accident, and touching hot metal for a split second that isn't glowing sucks, but doesn't cause lasting damage. What can do significant damage, we were instructed, was having a hot piece of metal accidentally land inside your glove and be pressed into your skin for a couple seconds while you get the glove off, or having a glove catch fire and burn while in contact with your skin. </p>
<p>Ultimately, to each their own, but the school I learned at has a no gloves policy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note, do not wear gloves because if you grab something hot and it burns, it can burn longer while you‚Äôre trying to get the glove off. </p>
<p>Basically if you don‚Äôt want to get burned, don‚Äôt blacksmith.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah. Learn how to minimise scale and avoid putting your hands in positions where it drops on them, and you'll be fine. A tiny burn every other week is okay, losing control over your workpiece bevause you are wearing gloves is way more harmful. SOMETIMES you can wear a glove on your supporting hand, but never ever on your hammer hand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. I can't speak for blacksmith type forging, but in a steel mill it's factored in. Scale is just a waste product in the process. Lower carbon steel has more scale, higher carbon steel has less. Sometimes when making really low grade steel we use the scale as an input in the melting process to recycle it. </p>
<p>Overall scale is a very small percentage of the output. It comes off in paper thin flakes. At times you can get really large thin sheets of it, but it's super brittle so they usually break apart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, in the very outer crust of the steel.</p>
<p>When hardening you get a decarburised area that doesnt harden, as the carbon gets burned out of the steel - this is why knifemakers rough grind, harden and then finish grind knives, removing that ‚Äúdecarbed‚Äù steel.</p>
<p>It is possible to create an inert atmosphere that wont cause decarb - wrapping in stainless steel foil and removing as much air as possible is one way of doing it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't see why it would unless you're forge welding or making damascus and literally making a hybrid of two different steels. The forge scale is just on the surface, which shouldn't impact the composition all that much, especially since it's generally just ground off when making tools. </p>
<p>Generally the only things you're doing in forging are shaping the steel and restructuring the molecules inside the steel, but not changing the composition of the steel. Well...I should add only if you're doing it correctly. It's possible to burn up the steel with too much heat which would change the composition, but it would also make the steel unusable and generally is something to be avoided.</p></div>		</li>
