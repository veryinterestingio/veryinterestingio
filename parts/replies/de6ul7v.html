			<div class="markdown"><p>I know you didn't ask me but I felt the need to chime in on this question. Ex addict here. Meth was my drug of choice but I regularly did just about anything else you could think of. The hardest things I ever tried to quit, by far, were cigarettes and alcohol. Don't be fooled. The legalities of a drug don't equal the severity. These things will kill you just the same. I think they lull people into a false sense of security. I think that makes them worse. </p>
<p>Sure, you don't overdose on cigarettes - and alcohol may not peel your skin off, but I know more people that have died from heart, lung, or liver disease related to these two things than people who have OD'd on the harder stuff. I wish people would take smoking and drinking more seriously. </p>
<p>Edit: Alright, I guess I should clarify a couple things. First, this is my personal experience. I'm not trying to belittle your loved ones who've found themselves addicted to harder drugs, and I'm not saying that one glass of wine is equal to a lifetime of heroin addiction. They're all bad mmkay? For me, alcohol and cigarettes were the worst of the bunch. They've caused me real health problems where the drugs haven't and I could not quit them as easily as I quit harder drugs. I realize not everyone will understand or agree with that. </p>
<p>Also, a few people are arguing that alcohol is only bad because it's so prevalent and more widely used, but that just reinforces the point. Withdrawals and reactions between drugs may be different and not comparable, but drugs can be bad in different ways. Alcohol and cigarettes being legal and so widely used is part of what makes them so bad. </p>
<p>My hope is that my long-term experience with hardcore drugs, weighed against my opinion on cigarettes and alcohol, might be eye-opening to someone. I don't want all drugs to be legal, and I also don't want people to feel like they're in a good place because they stick to liquor and Newports.</p>
<p>Again, not trying to offend anybody here. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Former healthcare worker here:  Cancer and liver failure are the most horrific ways to go.  </p>
<p>I watched a pretty woman in her early 30s die from lung cancer in a matter of months.  She was a smoker.  She deteriorated to the point where she was bald from the chemo, the cancer had spread to her brain and made her violent and 'crazy'.  We had to restrain her to the bed.  She became incontinent (pissing and shitting on herself), in diapers.  And then she died.   From cigarettes.</p>
<p>Liver failure is equally horrible.  Jaundice, yellow skin, sour diarrhea, incontinence.  Obviously this can be caused by alcohol, but a lot of people don't realize that pills can do it too.  Not even opioids...friggin Tylenol.  I took care of a poor woman with some kind of chronic pain condition.  Her doctors told her to load up on Tylenol...perfectly safe, they told her.  After a few years of that abuse to her liver it finally started giving out.  All the above symptoms happened.  She had horrible sour diarrhea shits...in bed, so the healthcare workers (me) had to clean her up and her butt and back were raw from the poop- sores and everything.  </p>
<p>So yes...100%...kids, don't overdo it with cigarettes, alcohol or pills.  ??</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not surprised by this as depending on where you live on the planet, it's damn near impossible to escape either.<br />
Need fuel for the car? Station has beer and cigs.   Need groceries?  Store has beer/wine/liquor and cigs.<br />
There's liquor stores with drive-thru windows, and even little smoke shop kiosks that are also drive-thru.  </p>
<p>Since you have to go looking to get harder drugs, it's going to be easier to avoid the temptation as opposed to cigs/alcohol which are shoved in your face damn near everywhere you go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heroin, most definitely. Opiate withdrawal, while not deadly, is so incredibly fucking painful and just all around miserable. And it sets in so quickly after your last use. It starts with popping pain pills occasionally, then a little more than occasionally, and then you can't afford them (one pill can be as much as 50 usd) so you make the switch to heroin. You start with snorting it &quot;I'd never touch a needle&quot; and then its not effective enough and in less than 3 months from even starting the pain pills you find yourself with a collapsed vein from how frequently you shoot up in the only place you where taught how.
Can confirm, young heroin addict struggling to get clean </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I took a drugs and health class in uni and we had ex addicts as speakers. One thing that really stuck with me was that one of the addicts was asked the same question. She responded by saying &quot;The one that clicks with you. Some people can try meth and not like it and never do it again. That same person could become a violent,raging alcoholic. Whatever drug is the one that calls to you, that's the most dangerous one&quot; </p>
<p>Edit: obligatory wow my inbox! I'm glad her message resonated with you guys. I found it one of the few moments in that class where I truly learned something useful. We all have our vices, drug related or not. What's important to remember is we all have the ability to fight them,  once we decide that it is our decision. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a history of recreational drug use. I've tried pretty much everything, skipped a few, but pretty well versed. I can walk away from heroin. I can blow through an eight ball of coke and not even think about it the next day. The list goes on in that fashion. I ended up an alcoholic. A total non functioning life revolves around my next drink alcoholic. I quit 2.5 yrs ago. But for over a decade, it was all about getting drunk. I grew up with the DARE program. They taught us that crack could be addictive in one hit. They never warned me that I could take or leave crack at will and end up in the bottom of a bottle. It's fucking crazy what happens when the right chemical gets ushered in. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that's a good way of thinking about it.
I read a story here about a guy who became life-ruiningly addicted to nitrous oxide of all things.</p>
<p>I have an addictive personality (I think that's what it's called).  It's interesting what substances I have a problem with, and which ones I don't.  I've used DXM a fair amount, and that's known to be very addicting--but I just didn't like it enough to become addicted.  Alcohol is similar, but I find it slightly more addicting.  Stimulants meanwhile, I find very addicting, and I recognized the potential for addiction from day one.  To illustrate: I can drink alcohol one night on the weekend, and when it wears off have no desire to drink in the near future.  DXM I take on a whim every few months.  With stimulants, I fight the urge to get high every day, and as soon as it starts wears off and I know the fun is over, I feel the urge to redose.  And it's been like that since day one, literally; I got high again the very next morning.</p>
<p>My guess it's because of my ADHD, social anxiety, and other mental problems.  Stimulants make me think and act like a normal person.  It's also a good class of drugs for a creative person.  They get other people &quot;coked up&quot;, but they make me calm and still and able to think clearly.  So it just clicks with me.  Weed clicks with me because it's a break from constant anxiety and racing thoughts.  Alcohol doesn't click with me because after more than 2 or 3 drinks, I actually become more withdrawn and antisocial instead of becoming the life of the party.  DXM doesn't click because I often feel dissociated when I'm sober.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm actually on ritalin right now, which is why I'm writing such a wall of text.  I just find it interesting how people's subjective experience of the same substance can be so different.  Drugs are neato, though a little scary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me this is sugar. I love sweets. I've always loved sweets... nothing makes me more comforted than a carton of ice cream or a big bar of chocolate. I've struggled with bulimia ever since I was 16. I remember the first time I threw up was because I had eaten so much crap I felt insanely sick and disgusted with myself. What people don't realize is the act of throwing up releases all of those feelings quickly to the point where you feel great again -- that's an addictive feeling in itself. The food environment in the United States also doesn't help. Sugar is everywhere: it's added to milk, it's in salad dressing, candy and sweets are everywhere you look. Even when you kick the habit, it's always in your face. More than a decade after this started I still make a daily decision to not buy a bunch of junk food and throw it up. I'm successful 99% of the time these days.</p>
<p>Having read these other responses makes me feel like it's not the worst thing to be addicted to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm glad you mentioned the lifestyle damage here.  That I think is almost as bad as the drug itself.  My former best friend got into method pretty bad and has been in and out of prison for about 10 years, and is due to get out again next week.</p>
<p>We had been friends for years and he ended up living around the corner from me in his father's rent house with his wife and two kids.  I stuck by and tries to get him clean for a while, but gave up once his wife and kids left.  He was just gone.  One day I told him I wanted to hang out with him.  I spent a weekend with him living the lifestyle.  Here is my story.</p>
<p>Disclaimer I saw some bad shit but did not participate in it.</p>
<p>I showed up at about seven am to help him work on his truck.  Fuel pump had gone bad from siphoning gas out of storage tanks and construction equipmemt.  Meth heads can't afford gas so steal dirty fuel.  He smokes a light bulb pipe to start the day with the little meth he has left.  Then we went to a hotel, he crawled under another truck and stole the fuel pump.  Yay his truck works, so we drive over to the illegal gambling place.  Little did I know these places are everywhere in suburbia.  Oops there goes his last 20 bucks.  So we drive out to a friends land where meth boy has a trailer full of stolen goods to pawn.  With this money we go to his dealers houe.   This 60 year old couple deal and a couple of other tweakers are hanging out.  The house iso filled with glass decorations, old newspapers and half finished projects.  I smoked some to see what the big deal was.  </p>
<p>It's like coke but more extreme, like you are full of adrenaline and in high gear, but feel in control.  We hit some more gambling halls and drove around trying to get more money.  He did some welding while high as shit, stole some copper out of a brand new AC unit, delivered some pot, and stopped to eat.  Lunch/dinner was gas station doughnuts and coffee.  More meth through all of this.  </p>
<p>It gets dark so we head back to his house.  His dad locked him out so we pull the plywood off the back window he broke and crawl in.  No heat or electricity just a trashed couch a blanket and a table full of paraphernalia.  The electric meter has been pulled from the wall and hot wired for free power, but at some point it shorted and caught fire.  He has the grill inside though so other than all the co2 he has light and warmth.  </p>
<p>All the welding, working on a car, stealing copper while high meant his hands were shredded.  A good coat of engine grease sealed the wounds though. His family was gone and he was bored so it was meth all night long.  I slept in the car and the next day was the same shit all over. </p>
<p>Sorry if that was long, but I just figured this was a good place to share.  The risks and stupid shit you do to stay on method is almost as bad as the drug.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Former meth addict here, used to shoot it. Shortly after I began using I got rhabdomyolysis. I was hospitalized for two weeks with two IV bags every half hour. I had three episodes where I my body would start tingling and I was unable to move. These episodes would leave me unable to even wiggle my fingers and toes for two hours. My kidneys were also failing, but since it was caught early I recovered just fine. </p></div>		</li>
