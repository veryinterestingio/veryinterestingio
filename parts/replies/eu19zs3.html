<p>and we're still making observations and we'll continue getting those data down beyond that. - HW</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We would hope to find another object to flyby, though we would need to get lucky. Even if we don’t flyby another KBO to flyby, we can measure the light from distant KBO’s from angles that are not achievable from Earth. This can provide light curve information to determine the shape and rotation rates. We also can take data with SWAP,PEPSSI, and SDC on the particles and plasma environment. We have the power and fuel available. – CH</p></div>		</li>
