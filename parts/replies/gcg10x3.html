<p>I suppose the closest analogy I can make to this is taking out vowels in the English language. So long as some of what you are familiar with is still there, a few adjustments here and there makes no difference to your understanding.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, though if we were to take into account the fact that Chinese words are single characters and not a string of alphabets put together, it'll probably be more like this:&quot;Eye am going 2 day.&quot;While the words by themselves mean absolutely nothing, and their meanings together is gibberish, the sound of the words gives it some meaning, and here all the context is given by the words &quot;am going&quot;. Chinese language has a lot of homonyms and makes a lot of use of them. This is also why I personally find there to be far more <del>&quot;dad jokes&quot;</del> puns in the Chinese language.  </p>
<p>Edit: I did mean puns, thank you u/AlanCJ for pointing it out. My dad's the only one in my family who uses them frequently so I've sort of just categorized the Chinese puns under &quot;dad jokes&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s not true. They write the vowels, just not all of them. Although all the letters used for vowels are technically consonants. Also that thing about the dot applies to one letter: vav (v, o, or u sound).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't the same. The writing isn't the focus here. You're talking about standard hebrew writing, which has no written vowels. This isn't the same as removing vowels from written english words. </p>
<p>What the removal of spoken tones is like is the loss of spoken vowels. Writing is just memorizing visual representations of words. Removing written vowels doesn't have the same impact as completely changing how a word is pronounced. </p>
<p>What happens with the tones in Chinese might be akin to spoken Hebrew being pronounced like: shalam ma shlamcha? Ana asraala. The spoken element is reduced in a way that may be unrecognizable without context.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Taiwanese mandarin (pronunciation) in general is very difficult to understand if you haven't lived in Taiwan.</p>
<p>edit:
more precisions. To people that are used to mandarin as spoken in China mainland, Taiwanese can be tough to understand.</p>
<p>Taiwanese people tend to speak fast and slur words, and on top of that, tones arent emphasized as much (which seems to be a common trait of southern varieties)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, to add to this, tone is not the same thing as a melodic note. You can pronounce è é ē ě in any pitch/note/key , but it will slightly interfere with the clarity of it. For example, if you sing lǎi in E, it would dip very slightly (a quarter step?) toward E flat, but not all the way.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that traditional chinese songs aren’t scored by the same increments as western music. They use other quarter and half steps to represent the right pitch. If you listen to GuZheng music, the dipping and bending of notes is intended to mimic the patterns of Chinese tonal speech, and sounds like they’re playing “off key” by western standard.</p>
<p>Now that Chinese music is full of western pop coventions, a lot of tonality is dropped and depends on context.</p></div>		</li>
