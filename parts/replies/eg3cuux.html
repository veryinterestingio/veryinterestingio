<p>Similarly, if you're cataloging animals in the rainforest, and only 10% of the animals you find are known species, then there are about 10x more species out there to finish cataloging</p>

<p>This only works if each species is equiprobable. If species A is much more common than species B, this skews the result. A similar thing happens if species A is easier to spot (bigger, less camouflaged, noisier, ...)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's my understanding that the original basis for the claim was that our entire brain is never active simultaneously; only parts of it are active at any given time, depending on your activity and focus.  So it might be 10% at a time (though that sounds low) but over a period of time, all the parts of your brain are used, though only in partial segments for any given moment.</p></div>		</li>
