			<div class="markdown"><p>When she's old enough to be on birth control tell her to observe the difference in her hair too. I was on Nikki (generic for yaz) for the past 6 months and it dried my hair terribly and made it coarser and frizzier. Changed it almost 30 days ago and it's already so much more manageable</p></div>		</li>

<p>Another cool thing I learned from /r/curlyhair (haven't tried it much myself, as I'm in a bleach/color my hair phase, and that fucks the texture) is using gel in the shower after toweling your hair off a bit (still damp). If you do it right it's supposed to create really nice curls and reduce frizz.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. I don't ever blow dry her hair but won't until I get a diffuser. We tried gel for the first time yesterday. Still learning but I think making progress. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If she's still frizzy, there's a different technique for keeping moisture in that's called something like WCO/WOC (water-cream-oil ) which is the order of hair products to use. I personally can't get cream products where I live, but my hair has gotten a lot nicer since I've started doing water and then oil to seal it in.</p>
<p>In any case, I hope you guys can find something that works well. It's a struggle to keep curls looking nice, but when you get to something that works, it's a great feeling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>in general you should wash your hear ideally only about twice a week with shampoo, regardless of curly hair or not. your body matches the oil production to how much oil there already is in an negative feedback loop. oily hear means less oil production. washing your hair every day means your scalp will produce more oils making your hair oily quicker. </p></div>		</li>
