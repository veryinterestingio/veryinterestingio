			<div class="markdown"><p>I have to use this cream too. My suggestion would be to lay off the cream to only when needed. Use very small amounts. </p>
<p>Try to moisturizer with a non scented cream very frequent. After washing hands,showering, and just in general. </p>
<p>Good luck </p></div>		</li>

<p><del>Steroid creams don't make your skin thinner.</del></p>
<p>Edit - As u/scarlettmouse pointed out and I checked again - prolonged exposure to corticosteroids does in fact cause thinning of the skin. Their intended use is to make you itch less / reduce inflammation.</p>
<p>Stopping treatment reverses this thinning. </p>
<p>Old answer - The chemicals that make skin &quot;thinner&quot; are called keratolytics - the most commonly known is salicylic acid. These chemicals in eczema / wart ointments make the top layer of your skin shed more rapidly (so that you can't see them) and thus prevents it from shedding in large groups that you can see like peeling or flaking. (also how anti-dandruff works) </p>
<p>After disuse of the the ointment, the skin goes back to its natural shedding pattern and regains its &quot;thickness&quot; and that is why some peoples eczema is recurring when they stop treatment.</p>
<p>Edit : more info - there are drugs that actually make skin thinner, classified as Retinoids. Topical retinol creams and systemic isotretinoin (Accutane) pills can make the skin so thin that waxing can take out a chunk of skin with it. Hence obviously waxing is counterindicated with Retinoids. They (edit - orally taken retinoids) also have a plethora of side effects ranging from mild skin irritation to depression and suicidal ideation so...</p>
<p>Anyways i dont think any doctor gives out Retinoids for eczema. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Steroids do thin the skin with overuse. Thatâ€™s why topical steroids cannot be used chronically. Also they stop working as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just want to point out that topical retinoids don't have too many crazy side effects. Skin irritation is pretty much it. Isotretinoin (&quot;Accutane&quot;) does have some scary systemic effects, as you mentioned. </p></div>		</li>
