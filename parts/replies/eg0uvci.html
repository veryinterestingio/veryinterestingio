<p>In 8th grade chemistry class, we got ahold of mercury and rolled droplets of it around in the palms of our hands. I was starting to wonder how fucked I am.</p>
<p>And there's this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/449u2z/guy_sitting_on_a_pool_of_mercury_national/" target="_blank">famous photo of a guy sitting in a pool of mercury</a> from National Geographic, 1972</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ELI5 version is that it gets in the way of normal chemical processes that are supposed to happen in your body.</p>
<p>I can't quite understand the technical details i'm reading, but it seems that you body produces something called selenoenzymes.  These enzymes help your body process oxygen in a safe an healthy way.  Mercury interferes with the production of selenoenzymes which in turn prevents your body from being able to process oxygen safely.</p>
<p>It causes a variety of problems in your brain, because your brain really really needs and uninterrupted supply of oxygen.  It cauese memory loss, difficulty concentrating, and eventually insanity. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Slightly more advanced explanation on why its toxic:</p>
<p>Your brain has a &quot;filter&quot; that blocks most things from the blood from entering it, but mercury is able to bypass this filter</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever heard the term &quot;mad hatter&quot;, or &quot;mad as a hatter&quot;?  Mercuric nitrate was a common chemical used in the curing of felt (made from the skins of small animals) for hats, and hatters were those who both preserved and cured the felt and made hats from it, so they were exposed to mercury compounds continuously.  Mercury poisoning became endemic among hatmakers, causing all kinds of mental problems and insanity, leading to the term mad hatter.  Mercury is a heavy metal, and your body has no way to rid itself of the buildup of mercury, as it does with so many things that are bad for you.  This means that the exposures are additive, and it will continue to build up in your system, making mental problems worse and worse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The comment above is incorrect. Only organic mercury compounds, like dimethylmercury pass through skin. Inorganic mercury (the normal stuff) does not pass through skin and can be handled quite safely as long as everything is properly cleaned afterwards to avoid accidental ingestion. (Don’t do it anyway)</p></div>		</li>
