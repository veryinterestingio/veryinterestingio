<p>Woah, I had not thought of that. Seems ripe for sci-fi, a la space triffids. I wonder how long it would take before some kind of space SCOBY shows some emergent properties like moving to avoid light (probably by shooting waste at you)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>slime molds would be perfect for a world ending super plauge, consuming a world then forming a massive spore bearing structure that reaches space(less gravity so the spores can travel)</p>
<p>and that is pretty much how they actually operate just on a much larger scale, the groups of cells clear an area then form a larger mass to produce spores to get to more food</p></div>		</li>
