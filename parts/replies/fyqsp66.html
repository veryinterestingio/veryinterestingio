			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on methods that astronomers could use to recover absolute time without an atomic clock is through pulsars.</p>
<p>Pulsars are rotating neutron stars that fire extremely energetic beams of particles from their magnetic poles. These poles are often not aligned with their rotational axis, much like the Earth's magnetic poles, causing the beams to shine like a light house out into space. If the Earth is within this beam as it passes over that portion of the neutron star's sky, a pulse of energy is detected.</p>
<p>Pulsars are extremely accurate, but a special class of pulsars, known as millisecond pulsars, are on the order of atomic clock accuracy, with spin rates stable to 1 in 10^(18). However, the real story is that the spin rate does decay. Essentially the pulsars slow down over time as they lose mass, and with them being so accurate the spin rate decay can be measured extremely precisely. Since the pulsars have very well known positions in the sky, and a very accurate and very predictable pulse and decay, and exact time can be recovered by measuring the pulse rate compared to previous observations. This will allow you to get a true time to within many orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about pulsars and millisecond pulsars, I suggest reading up on NanoGrav, where radio astronomers are attempting to measure gravitational waves by looking at how the distortion of spacetime affects these extremely precise natural clocks</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>when you say &quot;absolute time&quot; is this referring to the time that has passed since the earliest known reference point (i.e. big bang or thereabouts) aka the age of the universe, or only in reference to our own previously recorded time?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I meant here on Earth relative to previous observation. Thanks to relatively, &quot;absolute time&quot;, what cosmologists would call fundamental observers, don't really exist. What we do track is the age as it appears from our vantage here on Earth</p>
<p>I'll admit though, I welcomed any cosmologists to answer as I'm only a radio astronomer/geophysicist</p></div>		</li>
