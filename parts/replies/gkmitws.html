			<div class="markdown"><p>The real answer way down.  I smoked a pack a day from 17-35 years of age.  By 42 Dr. told me my lungs had healed to that of a &quot;new smoker&quot;.  Now at 46 my lungs are completely healed.</p>
<p>I traded cigarettes for vaping but I am fully aware that a % of ppl who vape also develop issues. Edit: I should also divulge that I've smoked weed throughout and it's never had an impact on my lungs and has never been a concern of my Dr's.</p></div>		</li>

<li>I def sourced that number from my ass but it's honestly not that off. I suspect you've never smoked or at least tried to quit. It isn't just &quot;don't have a cig driving&quot;, &quot;don't have a cig before bed&quot;. </li>
</ol>
<p>It's being at a bar with your smoker friend and being like &quot;dont smoke dont smoke dont smoke dont smoke&quot; CONSTANTLY because it takes just <em>one</em> moment to lapse. It's driving to work every day and say &quot;dont stop at Sheets for cigs. Dont stop at the smoke shop. Dont stop at getgo. Dont stop.&quot;. It's every time I'm pumping gas, &quot;dont go in dont go in dont go in&quot;. Every time I see my smoker neighbor, every time I take a walk, every time I find an old pack I forgot about, every time I'm stressed to tears. Constantly. All the time. And every time it feels like I'm putting my head through drywall. So yeah. I resisted smoking 80,000 times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the hard part with any addiction.  It‚Äôs the constant voice telling you to do it and you have to tell yourself ‚Äúno‚Äù constantly.  Since we‚Äôre talking about smoking, if you give in and have a cigarette you‚Äôre free from the demand at least for the duration of the cigarette and longer depending on the addiction level.  I know the science says the cravings only last 3 minutes, but it doesn‚Äôt talk about how frequently you get the cravings.</p></div>		</li>

[Remembered about this, one of my friends was trying to quit and I noticed he reached for his cigarette pocket over 50 times during a 20 minute episode on Netflix]</p></div>		</li>
