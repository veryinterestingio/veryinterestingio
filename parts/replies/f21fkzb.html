			<div class="markdown"><p>I love the beauty of this explanation as I can visualize the inverted history hurtling infinitely away from us, yet identical in absolute terms. </p>
<p>As a fun thought experiment, it follows, then, that the future MUST be able to be predetermined (which seems unlikely or at least impossible for us to comprehend).  If you think of everything as a huge computer that has received a universe of input and transforms it exactly the same way forward as it does backwards, you've pretty much proven there's an algorithm to existence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On what are we basing the assumption that pre-Bang universe is symmetrical to our own, though?</p>
<p>If you cut an explosion in half, matter isn't being flung symmetrically either side. Numerous factors determine what is sent where, and what it bumps into along the way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but if we're talking about the origin of the universe, there's nothing else out there to bump into along the way.  And if we're talking about the Big Bang, you have all the matter of the universe compressed into a single point.  At those pressures, you would think the matter and energy would have to be evenly distributed in that infinitely tiny &quot;ball&quot;.  And so if it was evenly distributed, it would have to be symmetrical, would it not?  Plus if every force has an equal but opposite reaction, everything that pops forward in time would &quot;eject&quot; an antimatter version backwards in time at the same but opposite speed and direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perceiving time moving only forward is a limitation of our meat cases. Just as matter expanded outward in all directions, time flows out in both directions from the center of the Big Bang.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So with this theory would the big bang be all matter and antimatter colliding and annihilating?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If time works like the spatial dimensions then, and that the actual perception of the &quot;flow&quot; of time is merely subjective, then yes, moving towards the origin would certainly mean everything is annihilating itself out of existence (just as moving away is everything coming into being).</p></div>		</li>
