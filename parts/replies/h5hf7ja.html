			<div class="markdown"><p>Piggybacking onto this comment, there are various parameters that many of us in physical medicine fields use. The main points I use… (all for musculoskeletal injuries and not necessarily for other conditions)</p>
<p>-short applications of ice (less than 20 minutes at one time, preferably 10-15 min) for pain </p>
<p>-some swelling is not necessarily a “bad” thing and evidence suggests it might be important for healing</p>
<p>-a lot of swelling, prolonged swelling, or “pitting edema” can be cause for concern and following up with a healthcare provider is a good idea. Ice may or may not help, not much evidence to suggest it harms at that point.</p>
<p>-most evidence that shows that ice is either harmful or just not helpful involve applications longer than 20ish minutes</p>
<p>-don’t ice if you don’t have enough time to warm the tissues back up before activity. Better to use it at the end of the day or during a lunch break or something.
-compression and elevation are often helpful</p>
<p>-definitely move it even if it is just gentle movements while on the couch</p>
<p>-Rest should be a “relative rest” NOT total rest</p>
<p>ETA: apologies if the formatting looks terrible.</p></div>		</li>
