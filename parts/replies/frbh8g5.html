			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not quite sure what you mean by that. If you're asking whether or not rigid body rotational motion can affect magnetic fields, at low speeds, I would not expect any changes. At higher speeds, I would suspect there are relativistic effects that need to be considered. My knowledge of special relativity is extremely fuzzy, so I'd have to defer to another physicist to answer this.</p></div>		</li>
