			<div class="markdown"><p>This is 100% me on the weekends.  I feel like I don't have enough free time in the week (even though I work remotely and have tons of free time), so I am up pretty much all night Friday and Saturday trying to squeeze every minute I can out of the weekend.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suffer from anxiety and if i have a big day tomorrow then i usually stay up as late as possible because i want to make the ‘most’ use of today before the ‘inevitable’. I hate it and the only thing that has worked has been mindfulness meditation.</p>
<p>I’ll do it 20 mins before i’ve readied for bed but also practice it while i’m trying to get to sleep. Just as simple as being consciously aware of my breathing and counting 11 seconds breath in and hold for 5 seconds and a controlled 9 seconds breath out. </p>
<p>It has helped me in all aspects of life but starting it has been the hardest part.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is basically what I explained to my mom as a child with an earlier bed time than most of my peers. I argued its better to let me stay up so I can tire myself out in an hour or two, rather than lay there for 4 or 5 hours every night. She didn't like my arguement at all. It was brutal laying there for hours every night, year after year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah, her husband abused the hell out of me for years, so I basically lived/hid in my bedroom to escape his rage as much as possible. I simply wanted to keep the light on past bedtime so I could read and tire myself out. Ended up reading books from the streetlight and needed glasses quite young because of it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>“Revenge bedtime procrastination” is also a thing that makes it harder to fall asleep at night, when we finally get a moment to ourselves and don’t want that free time to end.</p>

<p>Could you please not call me out like that.</p></div>		</li>
