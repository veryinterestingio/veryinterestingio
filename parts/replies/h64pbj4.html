			<div class="markdown"><p>IMHO, this answer is very misleading for relativity. There is different between the time an event happen, and the time the signal that it happened is received.</p>
<p>Under Newtonian physics, events can happen at the same time, even though you will receive the signal for events further away later. To figure out when an event happen, you have to work backward and figure out how far it was and account for the travel time of the signal. The time the signal is received for different observers are different, but they can all calculate backward and agree that the event happened at the same time.</p>
<p>But under Einstein physics, there are no such thing as happening at the same time. After correcting for signal travel time, different observer will still find different time between events, and they cannot agree whether the events happened at the same time or not.</p>
<p>So using an analogy with signal travelling time is quite misleading. I know it's a ELI5 answer, but this is precisely the misleading ELI5 that make people get more confused, not less.</p>
<p>Here is my analogy. Imagine there are 2 spots on the floor. Someone ask &quot;which one is on the left?&quot;. Well, you and your friend stand at different locations, so from your friend perspective and from your perspective different dots are on the left.</p></div>		</li>
