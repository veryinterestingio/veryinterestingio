			<div class="markdown"><p>u/CBDInspector6360 Dissolving CBD into a carrier oil, such as Medium Chain Triglycerides (MCT) is a relatively straightforward means to create a product in the marketplace. It's a lower barrier of entry into the marketplace and is one reason why there are so many products available. In addition, a lot of early investor dollars in the space went to companies producing tinctures for white-labeling, which predictably led to lots of tincture startups.</p>
<p>Before this study was published there was a very limited understanding of how poor the absorption rate is for oil-based CBD products. Now that poor absorption rate has been empirically proven and quantified in relation to multiple types of water soluble CBD products. Absorption routes of fat-soluble products into the bloodstream appear to be more impacted by “first pass metabolism”, reducing and slowing the amount of circulation CBD in the bloodstream. The key question for consumers is what is the end use they want out of CBD.  If consumers need fast acting, fat-based may not meet their needs. If consumers can wait 2-3 hrs for absorption (e.g., when seeking low-level anti-inflammatory effects), fat-based CBD could meet their needs.</p></div>		</li>
