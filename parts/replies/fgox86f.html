			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of air like a fluid (because it is). Fluids generally like to go from high pressure to low pressure. The warmer something is the higher the pressure it usually is so there is less resistance to move warm air from the equator up north where it’s cooler compared to the other way around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also the fact that during the summer, the frigid polar air is on the opposite half of the planet from you. (When it's summer in Canada, it's also summer in the Arctic), but when it's winter, the warm tropical air is just right there near the equator.</p>
<p>While the Arctic is still cold in the summer, it's not <em>that</em> cold, relatively. So when you get a &quot;polar vortex&quot; in the summer, it's not got as much ability to drop the temperature of the temperate regions that much.</p>
<p>As opposed to to during the winter, when the tropics are still just as warm as they always are, so when hot, tropical air gets pulled up to the temperate areas, it can have a significant effect on the local temp.</p>
