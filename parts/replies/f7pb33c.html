			<div class="markdown"><p>Not particularly, you're going to want to avoid lying on your back so standing up or getting on your knees would help, or rolling onto your left side (especially if you think you're going to throw up) then once you're in a position where breathing is a bit easier just try and take some breaths as deep as you can manage. Beyond that you can't really avoid the dying fish noises everyone makes when trying to catch their breath</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Old guy here. When I was a kid playing football I jumped on a fumble and 2 or 3 guys landed on top. Couldn't get wind for what seemed like forever. Coach rolled me on my back, grabbed me by the waistband and lifted a bit causing my back to arch. Seemed to help a lot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i got punched in the chest years ago, right on that magic spot that freezes your lungs or whatever. i remember i got punched there and my eyes went wide, i stopped moving, grabbed my chest, and i realized i had stopped breathing, and much as i wanted to breathe, i couldn’t, i couldn’t even move at all, let alone draw breath. i was completely frozen. it was the weirdest feeling. thankfully the person who punched me realized something was really wrong and shook me, basically, and suddenly, i could move and breathe again.</p></div>		</li>
