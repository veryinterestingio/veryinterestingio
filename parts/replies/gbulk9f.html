			<div class="markdown"><p>some iphones also use heat pipe cooling, which are basically just tiny sealed pipes with a droplet of water inside them, used to dissipate heat. These are also common in many laptops. If the phone doesn't use these then they would still be able to learn a great deal about heat spreaders. Another thing they could probably learn about would be dual sided or dense circuit boards (also called stacked SLP boards) provided they are able to understand what a circuit board even is, those would not be invented until 1936. I'm not sure if they would be able to develop the equipment needed to manufacture any of these things, but they could probably learn their assembly and function.</p>
<p>All that being said, it's probably important to remember as a frame of reference that even the VCR wouldn't be invented for another 30 years (a very complicated feat in itself), basic radios had just gained popularity and things like transistors or integrated circuit chips wouldn't even be invented until the 1950's - 1960's either. All this condensed technology might just look completely alien to them but humans can be quite intuitive so who knows what they could learn. It would probably depend on how broken the phone is and what means they could have to explore the internal functions of the components.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They definitely didn't have the laser tech to do anything like modern fabbing. I was gearing up to be all like &quot;they couldn't even replicate the <em>substrate</em>, LET ALONE the lithography&quot; but it turns out the Czochralski method actually dates back to 1915, so shut me right up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just because it was invented doesn’t mean it was consistent or refined enough to do anything useful. That’s pretty crazy how long ago it was discovered though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would think they would already know about heat pipes and spreaders. Granted the fabrication process to make them so small would be of some interest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>heat pipes are based on technology they already understood very very well-- boilers and live steam systems.  as early as the mid 1800s they were using organic working fluids in small engines to make them very simple and easy to use (the same fluid was your fuel, lubricant and working fluid), as well as bypass legal restrictions on tube boilers in boats-- the &quot;kerosene launch&quot;, for instance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, there is no way they would be able to even see the what was going on inside the CPU of even the oldest Iphone. The size of the parts inside the A4 CPU is just 45nm and the strongest microscopes of the 1920s had a resolution of 300nm. </p>
<p>The CPU was however the chip with the smallest components. There were other integrated circuit chips they could take apart and study. There are also  much larger circuits they can study on the motherboard. </p>
<p>1920s tech had good knowledge of vacuum tube diodes and triodes. So they should be able to recognize the function of the silicon semi conductor diodes, resistors, capacitors. You can figure out the function of each of these by removing them from the motherboard and running a test voltage through each wire.  Having the formula to create highly efficient and smaller electrical components should be enough to push technology 50 years ahead of time in circuit creation.</p></div>		</li>
