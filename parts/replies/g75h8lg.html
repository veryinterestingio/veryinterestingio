			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes fascia. You can visualize fascia by the silver skin you see on a piece of raw meat. And ILT fascia has nerves!  From  Johns Hopkins Medicine: &quot;Fascia¬†is a thin casing of connective tissue that surrounds and holds every organ, blood vessel, bone, nerve fiber and muscle in place. The tissue does more than provide internal structure;¬†fascia¬†has nerves that make it almost as sensitive as skin.&quot;
You can work out the knots yourself by myofascial release and trigger point techniques.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just fascia. Fascia doesn't cause knots but can become tight.  Knots are deeper muscle issues.  Everything from spasms to bruises.</p>
<p>If a knot was only fascia you could fix any problem with finger rolling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe fascia is the only thing a knot is, but that does not mean there are not other reasons for back pain and problems, many of which I'm sure need more intensive work and therapy than a massage. Also just because it's worked out doesn't mean it won't reform or isn't more likely to come back.</p></div>		</li>
