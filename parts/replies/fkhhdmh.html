			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. I have hearing loss stemming from a million ear infections when I was a kid. Lots of scar tissue on my eardrums. So I have more trouble hearing low frequency sounds like men’s voices. I can hear them but sometimes I can’t quite make out what they’re saying. That said, I have lots of practice interpreting what I do hear and combine that with some basic lip reading. It sometimes takes a while for my. Rain to put it all together. But if I wait for that to happen I look like an idiot just standing there. So I usually just say I’m sorry what?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Except the reverse on frequencies. I hear the low great and the higher very poorly....right about the same frequency as my wife’s voice unfortunately. When she says something and I can’t make out all the details, there are tricks. If I can see her mouth, I can usually cobble together about 80-90% of the words I missed with lip reading. If that doesn’t work, I use context, “kinda sounded like...”, and “wtf did you just say?!?” Lol. Forget it in crowded, noisy places like restaurants and bars. I tend towards the Madagascar penguins and “just smile and nod.”</p>
<p>TLDR; hearing loss sucks</p></div>		</li>
