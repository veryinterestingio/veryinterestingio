			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm talking about storage in fat. You're less likely to store an equivalent weight of chicken breast as fat than you are simple carbohydrates like sugar.</p>
<p>People also tend to marinate and season their chicken, which is fine, but this tiny amount of carbohydrate is often expended when digesting the protein in the chicken, so it isn't much of a concern. It's when you couple that chicken with a soda that it can become an issue.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'll say.  Everyone knows you pair chicken with a white wine, not soda.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another reason is that sugar in your food is digested into glucose (the sugar of all sugars) before being absorbed into the blood. That gives a massive spike in your blood sugar level, which your body doesn't appreciate. Larger molecules can be absorbed before being turned into glucose. They can then be processed in your cells (liver, mostly), which gives your body control over what it releases into your blood. It also allows the carbohydrate to be turned into other molecules via metabolic shortcuts, depending on what your body needs. If that happens, the carbohydrate is never converted to glucose at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The important thing is that there are so many things happening. The glucose spike leads to an insulin spike which drops the blood glucose levels, leading to a slight decrease in energy - often associated with sleepiness after eating carb rich food. (Unless some other mechanism takes priority over this). Then there's the fact that even if you intake a lot of glucose, it won't immediately be converted to energy - there is a cycle to store glucagon - that's why athletes cargo load the day before, not immediately before their match.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Please be careful making comments like this.</p>
<p>Others, please check the glycemic index tables. You'll see a baked potato, popcorn or even bread have higher glycemic indices than sucrose.</p>
<p>The above comment is very false and misleading IMO.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have just checked the table. </p>
<p>Sucrose has GI 100. This is THE definition of Glycemic Index.</p>
<p>Wheat bread 75, Potato 78, Rice 78.</p>
<p>By the way, pure glucose should be more than 100, because Sucrose (table sugar) is broken to Glucose and Fructose and Fructose has to be processed in the liver and that takes time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But that’s simply a case of energy input being larger than energy output. Of course the excess is stored as body fat.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's pretty much on the mark. Your body <em>barely</em> has to do anything to make sucrose (table sugar) into glucose. The majority of that will be sent to your blood stream almost immediately and stored in body fat.</p>
<p>Eating more complex foods as well as fibers means digestion and extraction of glucose is done more slowly, and there will be less stored in fat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the type of food doesn't matter for weight gain as long as the calories are the same. 2500kcal of carrots should yield the same weight gain (or loss, if you are exercising) as 2500kcal of table sugar.</p></div>		</li>
