			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, some even call the first few months of a new child's life &quot;the fourth trimester&quot; because of how completely helpless and dependent on the parents they are during that time.  Hell, they can't even lift their own heads for the first 3-5 months.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some species of octopus take much longer than that to hatch, different from mammal gestation but still interesting. I think there was some octopus that was observed to have remained in her nest(?) protecting her eggs for something like just short of 4 years.</p>
<p>Edit: found the article. Apparently this octopus tended her eggs for ~4.5 years. The longest observed period of egg tending. </p>
