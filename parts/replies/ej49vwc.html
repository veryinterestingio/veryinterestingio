			<div class="markdown"><p>Human skin is also very mildly corrosive. If you take a shiny new Penny and clean the surface off with a towel then press your finger firmly on the surface and put it into a cup of boiling water it'll burn the fingerprint into the surface of the penny. Heat is an accelerant* for oxidation. This is one trick to catch arsonists because their fingerprints will be burned into metallic surfaces like doorknobs.</p>
<p>*Got corrected, initially said it was a catalyst which it is not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, a catalyst is an object that functions by lowering the activation energy of a reaction. Heat is not a catalyst because it is not an object, and doesn't reduce the activation energy. Most reaction rates are dependant on temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vinegar is already usually diluted to like 5% acetic acid by mass in water.  Pure acetic acid (called glacial acetic acid) is ~100% and contains little to no water.</p>
<p>As far as a reason not to boil vinegar (or acetic acid) in your home - short answer: it’s inherently not a very safe thing to do and it will smell bad, and breathing acetic acid fumes hurts.  I think there are probably more effective ways to clean things.</p>
<p>In terms of dangerous chemistry stuff you can do this isn’t that bad, but I wouldn’t recommend doing it outside of a chemistry lab with proper ventilation and some rubber gloves.  Boiling vinegar adds the danger of acid to the danger of hot water, so you’d have acidity irritation in addition to a boiling water burn if you were to spill on yourself.  Also it will contribute to metal corrosion on any metal it comes into contact with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your pans are also metal. Metal is especially weak to corrosives (aka acids and bases) because metallic atoms are generally more chemically reactive than other common elements, like carbon.</p>
<p>So if you add heat to the acid, it just speeds up the chemical reactions, so you break stuff down faster. </p>
<p>Also when you’re using vinegar on your metal pots and pans you’re also removing a top layer of metal.</p></div>		</li>
