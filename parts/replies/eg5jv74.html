			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve been thinking about this for. Couple of months. You helped me aooooooooooooooo much. Thank you!
Since I don’t have textbooks or teachers, it’s hard to learn. </p>
<p>I’ll think about this for a few weeks and if I didn’t find a disproof, I’ll tell you.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Khan Academy covers tons of topics in bite-size chunks.</p>
<p>If that doesn’t have what you need, MIT has their entire curriculum online!</p>
<p>Good luck, and remember to eat &amp; sleep once in a while.  ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should check out a book called &quot;thinking physics&quot;. It has all sorts of explanations similar to this.</p>
<p>Another example is doubling your speed requires 8x as much power. This is because air molecules are hitting you twice as hard, you are hitting twice as many air molecules - so 4x the energy - but since you are going twice as fast you put out that energy in half the time, so 8x the power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A minor addition to this for correctness. You do not actually collide with every molecule the objects path sweeps out. Instead, using your explanation, you should actually look at a global momentum balance where you can say the object imparts a velocity change of approximately v to a fluid stream swept out by the object. However, it does this through communicating with pressure/viscous forces through the fluid continuum, not by personally smacking every molecule in its way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So you directly hit 20% of the particles and they hit the others out of the way. So that you’re not directly hitting all of them.</p></div>		</li>
