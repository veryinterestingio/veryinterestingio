			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m Spanish and this is literally where our Tapas dishes come from. It was required by law in the XIII century, when a king called Alfonso X made it a mandate to have taverns serve food along with alcohol, to help with the national problem of drunkenness. Tapa means literally “lid”, as bread loaves were usually served on top of wine jars, making them look as actual lids.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would this also mean that if you wanted to get sober as fast as possible,  you'd want to eat/drink nothing else? That way the alcohol would pass through quicker without having to process all the other food?</p>
<p>You'd get drunker quicker,  but you'd also start sobering faster? Or does it not make a difference because the alcohol stays in your bloodstream?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, your body processes alcohol at the same rate. If you eat something then its going into your system slower but you're still processing the alcohol already there.</p>
<p>Think of it like a sink. Say it's around half full (amount you've already drunk) and the plug is slightly out draining it slowly (body processing it). You can either throw everything else you're drinking in immediately, or the tap can be running slowly into it releasing the same amount over a longer term. The water level is how drunk you are. In the first scenario you get much more drunk before starting to sober up. It's going to take the same amount of time to flush all the alcohol out in either scenario.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks a ton for your response!</p>
<p>So following the same analogy,  if we had a sink that was half full and draining at some constant rate. Let's say we had 1 liter of total liquid,  which at the start is 50% alcohol, and it's draining at 1 liter an hour. </p>
<p>We have two options: 1. Start drinking water or 2. Drink nothing else.  </p>
<p>If we choose 2 and do nothing,  then all of the alcohol would be processed and out of our system in 1 hour and our stomach/sink would be empty. </p>
<p>If we choose 1 and start drinking another liter of 100% water,  then the way I'm thinking about it,  the liter of water would add to the sink and dillute the water, leaving us with 2 liters of total liquid,  25% alcohol.  </p>
<p>This would take 2 hours to drain,  so up to two hours later,  we'd still be processing more alcohol instead of starting to sober after an hour in scenario 2. We'd get less drunk at the peak (since we're processing half as much alcohol per hour), but itd take longer to process. </p>
<p>Is this how it would work? Or am i completely off? Sorry if I'm being dumb,  I don't know much about anything haha</p></div>		</li>
