			<div class="markdown"><p>A few years ago I read a (summary of a) research paper that said the opposite: a chess grandmaster will spend 2000 calories in a serious match, far more than he does after the match.</p>
<p>IIRC it was part of a study showing a brain's calorie-demands, even showing that dogs burn more calories when given complex tasks than when performing simple ones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I read that study as well however the widely recognized cause of the additional calories burned is the amount of stress involved and the increased heart rate while playing chess during stress, even while sitting the amount of stress causes prolonged periods of increased cardiovascular activity.</p>
<p>This study goes into a decent amount of detail on this topic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The stress of chess players as a model to study the effects of psychological stimuli on physiological responses: an example of substrate oxidation and heart rate variability in man.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cool. But then we do the old switcheroo......</p>
<p>Maybe the brain is not consuming calories, but actions of the brain are driving changes in our autonomic nervous system such as heart rate and breathing pattern. So to answer OP's question: yes, thinking harder burns more calories, at least when that thinking is stressful.</p>
<p>Which leads to the next question: can a human &quot;think hard&quot; without a stress response? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this: often times your overall energy use raises in consequence to &quot;thinking hard&quot; because of higher stimulation of muscle resulting in higher muscle tone thus higher energy need</p></div>		</li>
