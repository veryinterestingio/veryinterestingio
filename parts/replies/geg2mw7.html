			<div class="markdown"><p>It's like chomping down on a piece of bone in your steak that you didn't expect, or drinking coca cola that you thought was sprite. It isn't that we &quot;aren't use to crunchy foods&quot;, but we aren't expecting crunchy in certain situations so when it's there it's really unexpected and even concerning (&quot;Is this a piece of shell? Or part of a beak or something?&quot;).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a kid I was eating a cheese coney from sonic. I bit down on something HARD. I took a second to fish it out, and it was... <em>a tooth.</em> I yelled out on disgust and felt the gags starting to come.</p>
<p>Then i realized a loose tooth of mine had come out. It's the only one that ever fell out on its own</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. That's gotta be it. </p>
<p>I think we're finely attuned here to reflexively be disgusted by material that approaches the hardness of teeth. Think of cavemen who cooked bread on stones. Their molars were worn down by this diet far beyond typical molars today. It is advantageous for humans to detect this potential damage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The hardness of eggshell is MUCH higher than crunchy foods. And the mouth is an extremely sensitive area of the body so the difference is extremely noticeable. It's unpleasant because we've evolved to only enjoy eating things that are edible. Our distant ancestors who ate too much eggshell didn't survive long enough to reproduce.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's hard to prove the why's of evolution, but I'm sure this is the answer.  We have been munching on bone and tubers pulled out of the ground since before the stone age.  Our mouths are tuned to detect food and non-food, and more importantly prevent us injuring our teeth and gums, or swallowing something dangerous.</p></div>		</li>
