			<div class="markdown"><p>It is interesting to also point out that we never have perfect vacuum, there are however different degrees of vacuum depending on how you achieve it (type of pumping, chamber size etc). It is fairly straightforward to create a vacuum that has a million to billion times lower pressure than the atmosphere. However going below that might be quite tricky, but is highly dependent on the setup.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed. By poor vacuum, I meant something around 1 mbar (compared to 1000 mbar atmospheric pressure). A good vacuum is around 10^-6 mbar. An amazing vacuum is around 10^-11 mbar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So just a question to you from me, since I usually utilize the vacuum without going very low in pressure (I usually don't go below 1E-8 mbar anyway since I use it for processing at 1E-6 mbar anyway), what are the best high vacuum pumps for getting record low (or at least lower than mine) pressures nowadays? Cryo?</p></div>		</li>
