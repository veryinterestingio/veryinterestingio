			<div class="markdown"><p>This is wrong. They can, and have. They cannot sell them because of Saw Stop’s patent. Bosch had their Reaxx saw on the market which worked in a similar way, but had to take it off the market after a court found it violated 2 Saw Stop patents. </p>
<p>It wouldn’t be all that surprising if DeWalt, Delta, Rigid, etc etc released a competitor the day the Saw Stop patent expires.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a test with a sawstop saw, the Reaxx saw had twice as many finger nicks as the the sawstop, 4 vs 2. the Reaxx doesn't break the blade but it's not as effective at detecting flesh.</p>
<p>If anything the sawstop appears to have more false stops, then true failures to stop.</p>
<p>The Reaxx saw is a different technology altogether.</p></div>		</li>
