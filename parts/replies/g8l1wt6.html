			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're missing the point. OP isn't really comparing Covid-19 to HIV, they're trying to ask if Covid-19 infection can have long-term consequences for the body. And early evidence is showing that there is a good chance of developing pretty serious respiratory and cardiovascular complications from this virus that can last long after the patient has recovered.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What the data says at the moment is that long term complications for those not hospitalized are exceedingly rare, as long as you're not a long hauler, but even then that seems to clear up after about a couple months.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Encouraging points:</p>
<ol>
<li>We have Coronavirus vaccines for dogs (canine coronaviruses are more deadly than your typical human coronaviruses)</li>
<li>Several candidate vaccines are already in Phase 3</li>
</ol>
<p>Reasons to doubt that it will be easy:</p>
<ol>
<li>We have no other coronavirus vaccines in humans despite trying pretty hard for SARS.</li>
<li>HIV vaccines entered Phase 3 more than thirty years ago and none have proven safe/effective despite enormous funding.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it makes reference towards the alteration it makes upon the human body parts (most of which maybe are still unknown) like the heart, lungs, kidneys etc, which could negatively affect your long term health towards the point where it will eventually kill you (in the span of 10 years given the example in the question)</p></div>		</li>
