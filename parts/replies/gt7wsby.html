			<div class="markdown"><p>As a frequent user of the roads I concur. Most people are idiots anyway but on the road they really do shine. Coupled with how car control and any understanding of the immense forces involved is barely if at all present in learning how to drive.. if there's one thing I remember from driving school it's how much they tried to hammer the use of mirrors and I can prove with a lot of dashcam footage the average person doesn't use them at all. Then there's the left lane hoggers that brake check you when you ask them to move over.. Or the people that drive below the limit and would probably get to where they want to go faster with public transport but instead just clog up the road..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm. My human factors textbook reckoned that poor balance when drunk was the result of the fluid in the semicircular canals, and the otolithic organs, getting alcohol in them, lowering the specific gravity of the fluid and increasing the reaction of the otoliths to relative motion. </p>
<p>It didn't propose a mechanism for how the alcohol ends up inside the inner ear, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it would explain head spinning and the falling BECAUSE of head spin but the poor motor control in general is exactly as op said, the GABA being inhibitory, inhibits a lot of regions, but inhibition of motoric dopaminergic neurons is the most noticeable. Alcohol also inhibits NMDA receptors, so it not only increases inhibitory GABA but decreases excitory NMDA(glutamate) neurotransmission.  This of course affects regions near brain stem or spinal cord and affect coordination. </p>
<p>I think the ear fluid explanation is a bit outdated and is just somewhat linked to just one side effect - head spin. For example i dont get head spin at all. But i still get poor coordination, because the decreased neurotransmission in motor control regions will of course result in less muscle control since the affected neurons fire less often. its hard to have coordination when major portions of the brain and its region s are severely suppressed from normal function and without that certain regions are unable to 'talk' to each other properly when parts of it are 'offline' hah</p></div>		</li>
