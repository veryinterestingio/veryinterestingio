<p>When the muscle relaxes, they change places. A muscle must have all of these things to contract, but only needs potassium to relax. This is why when you have low potassium, you get awful muscle cramps!</p>

<p>I didn't know that's why you needed potassium when cramping! Interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Potatoes (both sweet and white), tomatoes, winter squash, broccoli, cantaloupe, some types of fish, and (most) fat free yogurts are a better source than bananas per serving. Not that bananas are a bad source, just that eating them in large amounts for potassium is boring and makes you sick of them quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had problems with fine motor control for a couple weeks after my first was born, too. It was pretty bad- I even had trouble speaking. No doc could give me any explanation.</p>
<p>I'm wondering if the fact that they kept my prenatal vitamins from me after I gave birth because it took three days to get through the pharmacy at the hospital may have depleted something? Plus shitty hospital food when I'm used to eating lots of vegetables. For my second I made sure to keep them with me for my (shorter) hospital stay, and it didn't happen. </p>
<p>Two different pregnancies (c-section for the first, VBAC without drugs for the second) but I've always wondered why this happened to me. </p></div>		</li>
