			<div class="markdown"><p>Having certain markers match between donor and recipient is very helpful and a certain degree of matching is all but required but not sufficient to prevent the recipients immune system from detecting the transplant as foreign.<br />
Almost all organ recipients need to take immunosuppressant drugs that dampens their immune system to prevent a rejection of the transplant. Those drugs however dampen all immune reactions making transplant recipient prone to infections.<br />
Directly after the transplantation the dose of immunosuppressants is highest and later reduced to find a dose of immunosuppressants that keeps the transplant safe while allowing the recipient to live a somewhat &quot;normal&quot; life.</p></div>		</li>
