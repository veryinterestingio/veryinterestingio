			<div class="markdown"><p>Been out of the kitchen for almost 5 years and I still remember the way we made packet ranch. 4 gallons of fat free buttermilk, 8 packets of ranch powder, whisk by hand. 8 gallons of heavy duty mayo, put the whisk on the Hobart and whisk until smooth. Dump into a 15 gallon Rubbermaid and cover :) we'd go through 30 gallons on a busy Friday. </p></div>		</li>

<p>America's love affair with ranch is at least partially responsible for the obesity epidemic in this country. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worked at a place called TacoMac for quite some time. Despite its name, it is known for wings and beer! I regularly filled 5 to 10 gallon buckets with those portion cups. Game nights, we'd have 3+ of those buckets on stand by. People fucking love ranch. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, I said 30 gallons but that recipe didn't really fill those buckets to the top. It was probably along the lines of 24 gallons. But given the huge dining room and the drive thru (fast casual diner atmosphere), we would absolutely tear through all kinds of dressing. Not sure what our raw numbers of people served were. </p></div>		</li>
