			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol. No, a high heel exerts 50 times the pressure of an elephants foot. It’s problematic with church parking lots if you apply an asphalt surface.</p>
<p>Though I have seen some people in heels who are probably exerting more pressure than that</p></div>		</li>

<p>This one isn't even true though. It assumes that you put the entire weight of the average woman onto a single 1/16in^(2) heel, all at once and even then it would be only roughly 2700psi. (average US woman weight is 168lbs, but I <strong>highly</strong> doubt you're gonna catch many women that size in stilettos). Going down to putting their entire weight solely on just the two heels, that's only 1360psi. </p>
<p>That has a lot of problems for several reasons. For one, you don't put your weight on the back of your foot when walking in heels. You walk on your toes and the balls of your feet, so your weight is predominantly there. When standing still, your weight is still predominantly on the balls of your feet, but also spread out over two feet and the two heels. </p>
<p>Putting the weight spread out over 5in^(2), which is probably a conservative estimate for both balls of your feet combined, gives you 34psi. </p>
<p>It's a problem on <em>hot</em> asphalt because hot asphalt softens up significantly and even light pressure over a small area can leave an indent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s static pressure, but as the woman steps forward and lands heel first she’ll exert much more pressure while arresting some momentum. Notice when you step on a scale the needle swings far past your weight before falling back down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Idk if you've ever walked in heels, but you do not heel strike in stilettos. You basically tip toe around. Your heel will touch first, but you won't put any real weight on it. You just use it to guide the balls of your feet down. </p>
<p>I had to learn how to walk in stilettos for a school thing where I had to dress up as a woman. I about broke my ankles walking with the heel first, until a girl showed me how and told me about how it's basically just tip toeing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This isn't really true. There's a calculation out there that puts it at barely just over one single ton per square inch, but it's only in a hypothetical scenario that ignores the ball of the foot and the fact two legs are always used unless you're in a run. Even then, the scenario requires that someone in high heels is going to be heel-striking rather than running on the balls of their feet.</p></div>		</li>
