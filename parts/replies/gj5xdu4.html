<p>Theres more flashing on a tire made in a segmented mold vs a clamshell mold.</p>
<p>Most tires are made in a segmented mold</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's another bit of trivia. Large, commercial truck tires are made so that is easier to replace the tread. It's called retreading, or regrooving.</p>
<p>I used to know a guy that worked at a retread facility.</p>
<p>He retired.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It used to be when you bought tires you would have them installed at a tire shop and the tire shop would <em>true the tires</em> for you. Basically they stuck them on a machine with a blade and it would spin the tire and cut it perfectly round by taking off some of the tread. Some shops actually still have these machines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Finally I get a chance to use knowledge from my job! I am actually an engineer in a tire manufacturing plant!! </p>
<p>Those little “hairs” are actually called “vents.” A lot of people believe that tires are made through injection molding. However, tires are actually built. There’s a bunch of different components of a tire but I’ll save that for another time. Anyways, all the components are put together into what is called a “green tire.” The rubber these green tires are made of is still soft and needs to be cured in order to make it a finished, road worthy tire.</p>
<p>The curing presses use molds to give the tire its details (tire specs, tread pattern, etc). Some types of molds have little holes in order to allow excess rubber/air to escape. The hairs are the result of the escaping rubber!</p>
<p>TLDR: You’re correct! The hairs are results of excess rubber/air escaping from the curing press molds</p></div>		</li>

While working for a tire manufacturer, I was told the American market like to have their tires shaved and slick, while in Europe they prefer them &quot;hairy&quot;, like a proof they are new.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey. A follow on question if you can answer. I saw a pic where as the tire gets worn down there are words embedded in the tire so you know when to replace it.</p>
<p>How do you put words in the tire and then cover them up in a way that the void of letters stays empty? (they don't get filled in by the above layer)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not 100% sure but I’ll give it my best educated guess. So normally, the tread wear indicators are just an indentation on the mold segment. But your question is slightly different. </p>
<p>The tread is extruded (a bunch of rubber fed through an auger screw and being pushed out of a die. Think of making spaghetti with play-doh) and then there’s a roller with letters/numbers on it that indents the uncured tread to show when it was made and the spec. So what they might do is either indent the letters a little farther into the tread on the inside (but that would leave air pockets which are really bad) or they could use a thinner layer of tread on top to cover the letters</p></div>		</li>
