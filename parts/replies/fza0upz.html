			<div class="markdown"><p>This is especially interesting since we've been testing so many people this year and still getting record lows. In New South Wales, every time someone gets a COVID test, we check them for the other major viruses like Flu A and B, rhinovirus etc. Those ones are coming back ridiculously low as well. The only one that I've noticed an increase in is rhinovirus, but that's mostly because we wouldn't bother checking those people in a normal year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would depend on rates of flu vaccination. I don't have the figures for that unfortunately. If vaccination rates have increased dramatically then rates may still be lower, but more than likely when people stop isolating it will increase.</p>
<p>It should still be lower than previous years however, because the rates in the community are much lower ergo community transmission will be lower. </p>
<p>In terms of next year, if everything is back to normal then flu rates will likely be back to their previous levels sadly. Perhaps with more community awareness of effectiveness of social distancing things will improve, but doubt it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's possible that some aspect of the quarantine lifestyle sticks around long term. Increased handwashing and prevalence of working from home are my hopes.</p>
<p>That would help, but we'll have to see.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could this lead to viruses adapting to social distancing and developing traits like increased persistence on surfaces and longer incubation times?</p></div>		</li>
