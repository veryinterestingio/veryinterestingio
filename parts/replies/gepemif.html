			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that really true? I'd be more inclined to believe things with <em>fewer</em> moving parts have a smaller chance of breaking. Consider e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patek_Philippe_Henry_Graves_Supercomplication" target="_blank">complicated watches</a>. They are rather small, but I'd fathom if you made a couple of million of these, you'd have a big chance of many more breaking than, say, a million of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ben" target="_blank">Big Ben</a> equivalents.</p></div>		</li>
