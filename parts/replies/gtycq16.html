<p>Here's another from 95 million years ago, and actually looks pretty similar to yours... because your map is from 94 million years ago, not 65. It says so on your map. It's pretty strange to me your map calls that &quot;The Rockies&quot; though since they didn't exist yet, also, my map makes clear what is now &quot;the Rockies&quot; is half underwater, with exception of Idaho and Canadian Rockies/</p>
<p>By the end of the cretaceous the seaway was mostly gone, as the Rockies formed during this time (starting 80 million years ago). The entire state of Nebraska is now on average 2,600 feet above sea level. If all ice melted, the east coast (and all of Florida) and the gulf coast would be inundated, but there wouldn't be an interior seaway.</p></div>		</li>
