			<div class="markdown"><p>All mammals can, even humans.</p>
<p>Our blood vessels just care less about warming out feet, and more about controlling our core temps. We basically use our feet and our hands as radiators. Are you hot? Your palms and souls will be flush to try and radiate away heat. Are you cold? Your hands and feet will restrict blood flow to conserve heat. (Which is why people often have ice cold hands when they are shivering, their bodies already sacrificed their hand warmth)</p></div>		</li>
