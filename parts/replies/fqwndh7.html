<p>I tried making little gingerbread men using a cookie cutter with my ginger molasses cookies. They turned out to be blobs. It's definitely because the recipe wasn't meant to be cut outs</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd never actually realized that before -- but you definitely have a point! Choco-chip cookies seem much more likely to &quot;blobify&quot; for me, as well :) It certainly explains why a wedge- or cube-shaped bit of CC dough turns into a normal-shaped, round(ish) cookie &gt;_&gt;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agree. Also, cookie cutter cookie recipes tend to have less rising agents (baking powder, baking soda, etc.) than say a chocolate chip cookie which is meant to be soft and chewy. </p>
<p>I typically only use 1 tsp of baking powder in my sugar cookie recipe to minimize spread and maintain sharp edges. The recipe calls for 2 tsps but I’ve found that causes it to rise and fluff up a bit too much and I lose the sharp edges. (Yes, I’ve tried chilling and even freezing the dough before baking. Doesn’t help as much as decreasing the baking powder)</p>
<p>I’ve also made “letter cakes” / cream tarts, gingerbread houses, etc and used a knife to cut out the shape with no issues. It all comes down to the recipe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good to know! I love my sugar cookie recipe,  but it is awfully fluffy - the edges end up rounded rather than sharp. I’ll have to experiment with reducing the leavening!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Try Sweet Sugar Belle’s recipe with only 1 tsp of baking powder instead of 2. The recipe was developed to have sharp edges with your cookies so hopefully that helps!</p>
