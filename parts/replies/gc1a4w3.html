			<div class="markdown"><p>As an adult that struggles with the volume of their voice, I agree you are lucky. I am fully aware I have this problem and when anyone calls me out for it I will instantly thank them and lower my voice. However, before they thank me I literally do not hear the fact that my voice is loud. Its not shouting, just incredibly projected. I think it comes from having two parents with hearing issues and being the youngest: my 'normal' voice is just a few decibles above everyone else's.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im like this too, but i think its to do with hearing loss, due to working in loud environments without hearing protection. I read lips. According to my wife, im either yelling or mumbling. And its either because i think someone wont hear me, so i yell, or i feel like im yelling, so i mumble. Theres no in-between, but i dont realize im doing it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm the same, except I'm not 18 yet and I haven't really been working in loud environments.</p>
<p>I think I do have some form of hearing issue, because I tend to rely on lip reading for understanding what people are saying, except in quiet scenarios. Wearing masks makes it so much more difficult, and my constant &quot;Pardon&quot;s make it seem like I'm just being a dick.</p>
<p>If I'm in a moderately noisy situation and someone says something without me seeing them say it, I'll either not hear them or I'll not understand what they're saying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have the same issue. I’ve had two people break up with me simply because I was too loud. It’s just my normal voice, and when I get excited the volume goes up without me realizing it. Life sucks when you’re constantly thinking, talk softer talk softer talk softer, and people still think you’re shouting. :p</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a co-worker like that!    Whenever he'd get excited about something, he'd get <em>super</em> loud... and in an open-floor plan, everyone could hear him...    Got to the point where I didn't even say anything, just kinda did the downward hand pat and he's immediately lower the volume...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And if one set of young kids is better at regulating volume than another, it’s almost certainly upbringing. Little boys in the US tend to be permitted to shout, and presented with shouter role models, etc.</p></div>		</li>
