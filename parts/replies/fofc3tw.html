<p>That needs to happen <em>within an existing magnetic field</em> for it to work. It's a known chicken and egg situation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the slightest field can be bootstrapped up to enormous levels. That is why they call the process a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo" target="_blank">dynamo</a>. For instance the classic car generator (not alternator) is a dynamo. These would not self start without some small residual field in the core. If they were really zero field, they would not start. But supply a very small starting field and they would bootstrap up to a very high one. Since the molten/gaseous cores of planets are chaotic, the random an-isotropic motion of ions could unbalance enough (creating a momentary weak field) to kick start the process. Of course the energy to power all this comes from the differential rotations of the interior parts.</p>
<p>The gain of this process can be tens of thousands. As exampled in a modification of the basic dynamo called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplidyne" target="_blank">Amplidyne</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An amplidyne is an electromechanical amplifier invented prior to World War II by Ernst Alexanderson. It consists of an electric motor driving a DC generator. The signal to be amplified is applied to the generator's field winding, and its output voltage is an amplified copy of the field current. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this consider the generator's field winding, those residual fields. Consider the commutator the dynamo process. So the smallest weak field will get amplified tremendously.</p>
<p>Edit: here is the pertinent point from the dynamo link, relative to the self generating nature of the process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a weak residual magnetic field that persists in the metal frame of the device when it is not operating, which has been imprinted onto the metal by the field windings. The dynamo begins rotating while not connected to an external load. The residual magnetic field induces a very small electrical current into the rotor windings as they begin to rotate. Without an external load attached, this small current is then fully supplied to the field windings, which in combination with the residual field, cause the rotor to produce more current. In this manner the self-exciting dynamo builds up its internal magnetic fields until it reaches its normal operating voltage. When it is able to produce sufficient current to sustain both its internal fields and an external load, it is ready to be used.</p>
