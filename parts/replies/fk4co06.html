<p>Those super fit people you meet who seem to do heroic amounts of exercise are actually only working hard one day in ten. Their baseline of easy exercise is just a lot higher. They're just as knackered as a newbie after those hard workouts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it was George St. Pierre's MMA coach that said, he keeps him training at a 7/10 frequently rather than a 9/10 four times a week. He gets better overall results, GSP stays fitter. I've taken this approach to my F45 classes 4-5 times a week and I gotta say that the results have been fab. Not only does it feel like I'm making good progress, I also don't have to kill myself physically and mentally to get there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you eli5? I work out 4 times a week for probably 2-3 hours, weights and cardio but I don’t understand the 9/10 thing. I also keep hearing how less days can be more beneficial but I don’t see how. Is this why I only see some people at my gym consistently 1 time a week?</p>
<p>Edit: oh working out 9 days out of 10. Who has time for that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree with your second statement. You can do hard workouts day after day after day but you’ll eventually build a lot of fatigue and get too tired. Look at ultra runners who run for days straight with almost no rest. </p>
<p>When you’re training the baseline of easy increases but also your ability to handle harder workouts also increases. Your body becomes better at performing while fatigued and doesn’t feel the tired as much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're not taking it easy you're never working hard.</p>
<p>You're mistaking fitness for effort. Those top ultra runners are pacing themselves very conservatively and they will take commensurate rest afterward to recover from their destroyed muscles and injuries.</p>
<p>No top runner ever does race pace outside a race. They'll do that pace for a shorter distance or that distance at a lower pace but never flat out.</p>
<p>Honestly I don't know where you're getting this information from but &quot;doing hard workouts day after day&quot; just isn't possible, like, inherently. The definition of a &quot;hard workout&quot; by any athlete's standards is that you need a few days to recover.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good answer. The thing I would emphasize is that strengthening of the muscles only correlates with you feeling better. You feel better because your entire system is at a better hormonal balance, it responds properly to insulin and other hormones, it has less reactive oxygen species doing harm to your body etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh, heh heh heh sort of. It's also kind of a &quot;guesser&quot; and our body has a limited number of sensors to know what's going on. </p>
<p>A good example for what I'm talking about: fevers. Fevers turn up the heat in the body, ramping up the white blood cells and creating a very hostile environment for bacteria and tiny organisms. Well, the same thing that makes heat bad for cells makes it sort of dangerous for the body as well. The body doesn't really know how much heat is right for fighting diseases, so it just starts cranking up the thermostat and hoping it kills the intruder. The brain especially is sensitive to higher temperatures, especially in younger children. This is why children who get a fever are monitored closely by worried parents: the fever is <em>supposed</em> to help, but the body is kind of a loose cannon, so to speak, about the approach. Keeping the temperature below certain thresholds is more important than beating a disease quickly. But it still is quite amazing how many different ways our bodies work!</p></div>		</li>
