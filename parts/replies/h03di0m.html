			<div class="markdown"><p>You're welcome. I always enjoy explaining scientific principles to people. It's fun. It's really hard to get it it ways that are understandable though, so I hope I simplified it enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Say if they only have 1 unique stretch identified for a given virus, then the virus mutates somewhere in that stretch, would that mean the tests wouldn't detect it, and they also wouldn't be aware of the new mutation?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The tests wouldn't detect it if it's within the stretch you're testing for. And they may not be aware of the mutation.</p>
<p>However its more complex than that. When a mutation occurs, it could infect many people and not be detected anyway. But as it spreads, people would come down sick with the symptoms. Logically - of you've got people sick with the symptoms, and the tests say negative, you'd suspect something is wrong with your tests and start doing extra checks.</p>
<p>And of course in your scenario, you're only testing for that one stretch. In reality we aren't testing for that one. I did see another comment around that did name the 3 things that are being searched for.</p>
<p>So the simple answer to your question is yes, it wouldn't be detected, but the more in depth answer - we might not notice at first, but we'd notice fairly quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We can actually use a real world example to show how this would work. The B.117 (British) variant had mutations in the S gene. This ended up being useful - the S gene was one of the three in the PCR test used in the UK, so S gene drop-out could be used as a proxy for B.117 proliferation, and gave faster data than genetic sequencing (which is still important, as other variants could also cause S gene drop-out).</p>
<p>Imagine now that the PCR assay only tested for the S gene. Anyone infected with B.117 would return a negative test, and cases would appear to fall. After a few weeks, when hospitalisations (and later deaths) start to increase, it's likely people would put 2+2 together, but this would delay the response, and allow the variant to gain a much bigger foothold than otherwise.</p></div>		</li>
