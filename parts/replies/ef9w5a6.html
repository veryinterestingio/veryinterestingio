			<div class="markdown"><p>Given the 460° C (860° F) surface temperatures, it's pretty unlikely any organic material would be preserved. To make matter worse, every few hundred million years Venus appears to undergo a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology_of_Venus#Global_resurfacing_event" target="_blank">global resurfacing event</a> - basically vast amounts of lava flooding the surface, a bit like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberian_Traps" target="_blank">Siberian Traps</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_mare" target="_blank">Moon's maria</a>, but way bigger. Pretty tough to find fossils in that case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had once heard that if we're looking for life anywhere in the solar system (and obviously not on Earth) that the clouds of Venus were more likely to have it than the surface of Mars. Would you say that's reasonable to conclude given what we know about Venus or no?</p>
<p>Furthermore, would it be possible to prove/disprove life having existed on the surface of Venus in the past with our current technology, or would it require actually getting to the surface with a probe to check? Like, would terrestrial life have emitted some sort of markers in the atmosphere that we could check for without having to go too far into the hostile atmosphere?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, somewhere around 50 km (30 miles) above the surface you find that the pressure and temperature are surprisingly Earth-like. However, that's also right in the middle of the sulfuric acid cloud deck, which makes things difficult. On top of that, water vapor abundance is really, really low on current-day Venus, somewhere around 10 ppm (i.e. for every million atmospheric molecules, just 10 are water).</p>

<p>As mentioned above, every few hundred million years Venus appears to undergo a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology_of_Venus#Global_resurfacing_event" target="_blank">global resurfacing event</a>. That makes finding any fossil sign of life from billions of years ago extremely unlikely.</p>

<p>Generally we would look for atmospheric abundance disequilibrium - something that shouldn't be in the atmosphere given what we know about chemical reactions. For example, it we looked at Earth not knowing if it had life, the fact that there's both free oxygen and methane existing together in the atmosphere is a very suspicious clue, as those two should react with each other to make carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>So far as we know, nothing like that exists on Venus...though it is interesting that we've seen signs of chemical disequilibrium in the atmosphere of Titan (largest moon of Saturn). From what we know and what chemistry we see, all the methane should have converted to ethane long ago from UV photochemistry, but we keep seeing fresh methane plumes rising up into the atmosphere. The assumption is that there's some subsurface process that converts ethane back to methane after the ethane rains back down to the surface. Exactly what that process is, though, remains unknown.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very cool stuff and makes complete sense to me! I had heard that Titan was showing promise in the life department as well, I didn't realize just how much promise! Obviously nothing definitive, but neat that there's even such a big clue for us to follow!</p>
<p>That global resurfacing and wide-spread volcanism doesn't seem to bode well for life, but perhaps there are some hardy single celled fellas bopping about in the atmosphere somewhere. It's a nice thought. Again, thank you for the information and insight!</p></div>		</li>
