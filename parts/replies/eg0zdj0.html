			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s pretty difficult to measure or quantify the extent of a plaque at all, never mind doing this several times over years for what would require thousands of patients in order to obtain any amount of useful data.</p>
<p>Especially since we only screen or look for disease in patients with symptoms and not treating patients with significant disease with medical and/or interventional management would be pretty unethical. </p>
<p>TLDR: it wouldn’t be super useful, would cost an insane amount, and would likely not even be reliable data </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As this is my field I'd encourage you to read into the GLAGOV Trial which utilizes intravascular ultrasound imaging to quantify plaques at baseline and 76 weeks later after dropping circulating LDL-cholesterol to about 33mg/dL (about as low as we'll probably every be able to go)(N=968 patients). Atherosclerosis regression was reported to occur in ~2/3rds of patients receiving statin therapy in combination with the PCSK9 inhibitor Evolocumab. Unfortunately, the average reduction in plaque size was only about 1% so while we can measure plaque regression, it is quite slow and probably not achievable without further interventions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can do it with OCT and there is lots of research in this area. In the future it is hoped that we will have better predictive power on lesions to understand which therapeutic strategy is best on a per disease segment level. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I may or may not be one of those examples. Had a CT angiogram after chest pain &amp; stress test at age of 32. “Best” Cardiologist in large mid-western city diagnosed soft plaque buildup in LAD, definitely remember him mentioning “widow-maker”. That was fun. No family history. Not over-weight. Recently quit smoking. Prescribed Crestor and Niacin. Quit Niacin shortly there after. Fast forward 5 years and I ask for a follow up CT. Next appointment w/Dr. he is walking out of room w/o mentioning results of new CT so I ask. He seems unaware I had another scan - just what you want from the “best” - looks it over and tells me the scan showed no plaque in the LAD. Either the first scan was bad (and I get to pay ridiculous life insurance rates for nothing), the second was bad or I did have plaque that was “remediated” by therapy. </p>
<p>Anyhow, NAD but anybody looking at looking at improving cholesterol/inflammation should ask his/her Dr. about Vescepa. Recent data is promising. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This has actually been well studied with serial angiography with IVUS, and with serial CT coronary angiography. Plaque may regress with treatment, but it never reverses entirely.</p>
