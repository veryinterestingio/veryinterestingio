			<div class="markdown"><p>Alright so to use this to answer the question: they (dolphins or aquatic mammals) can't go too deep beyond going so deep they crush their bones or raise their blood pressure too high. These are both physical things you and I can easily feel so it is likely that aquatic mammals can feel it too. The issues terrestrial mammals have with their blood and pressure are unique to us because we didn't evolve to live in water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That might be what I'm looking for, except &quot;crush their bones&quot;? Are their bones somehow different than ours in that they'd crush easier? Human bone can handle a lot of pressure, so long as it is applied equally like it would underwater.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it can handle a lot, but water is really heavy. Every 10 meters (30ish ft) the  pressure doubles. So only 90m below you'd experience 4atm. Which is a lot. at 180 meters it would be 7atm. ect ect. Eventually you'd reach a depth wher eyour whole body would just collapse. Whales have this issue when they dive, and they compensate for it by being HUGE. When they dive they are able to compress a lot before it become an issue. Humans not so much. The world record dive for a human is 1,082 ft, which is ~330m so ~12atm. A Sperm whales have been recorded as deep as 3,280ft or 1000m. At this depth the pressure would be 35atm. or 35 times the pressure at sea level. That's a lot of pressure. A human that deep would collapse in like a raisin which while it may not snap a bone in half it would crush your skull and crush your ribs together.</p></div>		</li>
