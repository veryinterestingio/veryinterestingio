You can read about his 'music of the spheres' if you want to, but the 12 notes being not out of tune, and the scales we use, are much much older than people realize.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>if you're interested in hearing how culture influences this, try listening to some music written in the middle eastern part of the world. You'll notice that they use a lot of 1/4 steps, whereas in western music the smallest intervals are almost always 1/2 steps. A half step is the difference between a white key on the piano and the black key directly next to it, or 1 fret on a guitar (think of C and C sharp) A quarter step would be half way in-between.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Always wondered what that distinctive &quot;Middle Eastern&quot; sound was. It's definitely funny how much our culture can influence what sounds &quot;right&quot; to our ears. Those 1/4 steps always sound to me like someone hit the wrong note or the instrument is out of tune, but of course that's only because I haven't been exposed to that music scale from birth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the only way would be to buy a special piano or tune it to be 1/4 step intervals. I'm not sure though, I'm a guitar player myself and have pretty limited piano knowledge. On guitar you would bend the string a little bit to sharpen the note.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's really interesting and cool and makes for some nifty tricks in modulation -- but no.  It happens because 3^12 is very close to a power of 2.  (A fifth interval gives you a factor of 3/2 in frequency -- so going up 12 fifth intervals is almost the same as going up 7 octaves.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your answer is great, but to expand for the mathsy people:</p>
<p>A note exactly an octave higher than another has exactly double its frequency, which implies that a note a half step above another has a frequency exactly 2^(1/12) above the first (since an octave has 12 half steps and thus each half step must be 1/12 of the way to 2 (logarithmically))</p>
<p>The convenience of 12 is that it just so happens that 2^(4/12) is pretty close to 5/4 (a major third), 2^(7/12) is pretty close to 3/2 (a fifth), etc</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the right answer. Any primitive human ‘inventing’ music would find that the simple ratios 1:2 2:3 3:4 sound nice together, so those notes become the first keys on your glockenspiel or frets on your guitar. Then you apply the same ratios to the notes you already had in order to get new notes, and so on, filling in the gaps. But because of this mathematical coincidence with 3^12 you will find that you seem to run out of new notes automatically and inevitably when you’ve got 12 notes in your octave.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>.... sorta kinda, not entirely.  When you take a length of string and pluck it, it's going to vibrate a certain amount of cycles per second.  In western music, 440hz is generally considered an A.  220hz and 880hz are also A.  So there's specific ratios of dividing our string which will provide the steps to get through an octave scale/mode.  Divide a 220 string by 2, you now have a 440 string, by 4, an 880 string it becomes.  </p>
<p>Where youd put your finger on a guitar to pinch a string is how you divide the string, for example. </p>
<p>This is pretty simplified, but ..  hopefully that helps? There's far,  far more to this but I dont have accreditation, or likely anyone's patience lol.  If there are errors pleased to be educated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might not be related to music but it's almost certainly related to why we picked the number 360 for degrees in a circle. Having 360 degrees lets you split a circle up into halves, thirds, fourths, fifths, sixth, eighths, ninths, tenths, and twelfths; it's extremely flexible in that sense.</p></div>		</li>
