			<div class="markdown"><p>Satellite internet isn't always two-way.  There's still transmit-only systems that use terrestrial modems (usually dial-up) for the uplink.  There's less latency on the uplink and it's cheaper, but upload speeds are dial-up speeds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also depends on the data transfer protocol - some will re-request lost packets which slows everything down, and some will just happily lose those packets and continue to receive the data it does get.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Digital satellite video uses something called Forward Error Correction which is essentially resending redundant parity bits.  If they encode more FEC you get a more reliable signal and can get a picture with a worse S/N ratio, but it cuts into the available bandwidth that they profit from.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can sacrifice Eb/No for better reliability if you increase the gain of the down converter. Most carriers drop the gain to nothing so they can enjoy a &gt;16 Eb/No that isn't needed. 7 or higher will pass packets no problem AND protect your downlink from any potential hits by leveraging the gain. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Going a bit past ELI5 but something I've wondered is do satellite users have the same problems with UDP-based streaming? It has to be much better than TCP because there's no ack/retransmit, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, although in the event a particular packet is very delayed or lost/corrupted, you will see video artifacts or the audio will briefly drop out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'd tell it to you but I'm not sure you'd get it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Satellite TV uses UDP because there's no buffering/rewinding so there's no point having the data integrity of TCP. If a packet is dropped there's no going back for it, you just do the best you can and pick it up from the next good packet.</p></div>		</li>
