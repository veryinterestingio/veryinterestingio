<p>Technically it's your waste that's burning, but I'm the one who said I would compost them and torched them to save a buck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The moment you take responsibility for my garbage it's no longer mine, it's yours. So you're burning your garbage. </p>
<p>Now, if I knew what was going to happen to that garbage I would be a bad person, because that information basically just means I'm burning the garbage without being the one to physically burn it. My lack of action against it is directly causing you to have more garbage to burn. Then we are both bad people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite. Recycling is multi billion dollar industry, what you may perceive as plastic trash is worth money. China used to buy massive amounts of plastic waste around th world because they would separate by type, grind, turn to pellets and sell as raw materials for the plastic industry.</p>
<p>A full shipping container with 20 metric tons of used PET bottles is worth 10,000 USD. After its been recycled the same 20 metric tons are worth around 20,000 USD.</p>
<p>Countries aren't selling their trash to be burned. Private companies are selling their pre processed plastic waste, because their prices top the ones of the domestic market.</p>
<p>I own a recycling company.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that covers 10% of the useful plastics. The rest gets chucked in the sea or burned. This is all well documented.  </p>
<p>Post script. Your other comment is much more accurate. You should delete this one. I have upvoted the other one.</p></div>		</li>
