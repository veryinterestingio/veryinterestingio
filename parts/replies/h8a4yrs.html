			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure, I follow a lot of sleep research since I have insomnia. I've heard it from multiple people though and there really aren't many front figures on sleep, you see the same people on all the podcasts really.  </p>
<p>May have been on this one but I'm not sure, the intro makes me think it might be: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1Qm5x7Lxgc" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1Qm5x7Lxgc</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, this is such a cringey belief. Of course you can catch up on sleep. Most people have that visceral real experience like once or twice a month no? Like, have non of those scientists ever been really sleepy then slept longer than normal then felt fine? </p>
<p>I dare anyone to sleep 2 hours less than their normal amount for 7 days straight then sleep as long as you want on the last day. You'll sleep longer and feel better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is a misconception about the damage sleep deprivation does. When sleep researchers say you can't undo the damage, <em>they're not talking about feeling tired</em> (which as you point out, we all know goes away after a few nights of good sleep). They're talking about the small amounts of damage each night of sleep deprivation does to your <em>long term cognitive function</em>, memory, ability to heal from damage and fight disease, etc. </p>
<p>So the price you pay for sleep deprivation isn't just feeling sleepy for a day or two. It's having small but measurable cognitive deficits days or weeks later and/or developing dementia a few decades down the road. The claim is that a few nights of good sleep won't undo <em>that</em> damage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right? The body evolved to catch up on sleep on its own. Of course there’s a reason why it acts that way, because it’s beneficial.</p></div>		</li>
