			<div class="markdown"><p>Alcohol either inhibits absorption or depletes every vitamin and mineral that we need. The chronic depletion of b vitamins in alcoholics can lead to Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome. It's a very sad condition where people are completely unable to transfer memories from short-term to long-term storage, and often can't even answer questions or form coherent sentences because they can't remember the question or even what they were saying at the beginning of the sentence. It's terrible to see in person, but I guess the good side is that we use people who suffer from WKS in order to further understand the brain as it relates to memory.</p></div>		</li>
