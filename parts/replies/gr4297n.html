			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi there u/IndependenceNo678 -</p>
<p>How horrifying. Such a senseless tragedy. I really shouldn’t speculate too much as to what happened in a particular case or what individual motives were, as I focus on statistical patterns observed in larger groups. But it does seem possible that the most vulnerable kids can become dehumanized in the eyes of their tormentors, which can escalate abuse.   </p>
<p>It’s important to note that homicide is an exceedingly rare outcome of bullying, so this case is quite extreme. I can see why it would shake one’s faith in humanity. I hope those who are directly affected or traumatized by this event are receiving adequate support. We are also going to post links for resources that may be helpful for those who are experiencing bullying.   </p>
<p>When it's safe to do so, it would be great for you to come back and visit campus.<br />
