<p>The big caveat to this is that these are small engines with (relatively) low fuel flow. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If u/r3dl3g is right about lift, then these smaller planes with the pods higher  up on the planes' bodies also have them father <em>back</em>, behind the wings.  Would it be reasonable to suggest that the pushing effect on the back of the plane simply pushes the back end down, and therefore the front end up?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, it's a case of where the center of lift and the center of mass of the aircraft is. Note that the position of the engines is also not <em>that</em> much further forward than with aircraft with tail-mounted engines, which obviously work fine. You can have higher-mounted engines, but generally you'd want them further back, above and behind the center of lift so you still get the lift force causing the aircraft nose to pitch up.</p></div>		</li>
