			<div class="markdown"><p>Everest is only the highest mountain by way of being the highest point above mean sea level. Chimborazo is the furthest point from the center of the Earth, and Mauna Kea has the greatest distance from base to summit, except that most of that is underwater. The greatest base-summit distance entirely on land is Denali.</p>
<p>Everest itself is <em>really</em> not that impressive of a mountain, just 3700 meters tall. The only reason its summit is so high is because it sits on the Tibetan Plateau, which is already 4500 meters high.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but that starting point is what makes it so deadly, which is the big reason a lot of people get excited over it. (I'm not speaking to the merits of said excitement.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know anyone who said they want to summit Everest due to the high risk of death.</p>
<p>I know a few people who said they wanted to because it's the tallest peak.</p>
<p>You make it sound like the main allure is for suicidal people</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you suggesting that climbing Mt. Everest is more or less a form of autoerotic asphyxiation? </p>
<p>I find this plausible</p></div>		</li>

-73°C recorded on the mountain,damn.
Did not know these facts tks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's something like the lowest contour line that completely encircles the mountain.</p>
<p>For example, imagine two mountains with a valley between them.</p>
<p>Imagine the valley is flooded, so that you cannot get from one mountain to the other.</p>
<p>As the water level in the valley drops, it will eventually reach a point where there is at least one point where you can cross the valley from one mountain to another.</p>
<p>The level to which the water dropped represents the lowest contour around the mountain, and the &quot;base&quot;.</p>
<p>Note: all of that was from memory, so I may have got some of the details wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There might be a precise geological definition I don't know of, but in general, the base of a mountain is where the surrounding land begins to <em>significantly</em> slope upwards. Determining what &quot;significantly&quot; means is left as an exercise to the reader...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where there is a sudden increase in the rate of elevation change. You might hike to the base (to a base camp), and be gaining elevation steadily, but once you proceed past the base of the mountain you are gaining elevation rapidly, often a 50% grade but it will vary widely throughout.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another slightly different metric is Huascarán (also in the Andes) whose summit experiences the smallest gravitational force which puts it furthest from Earth's center of mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it all depends on how you look at things.
Chimborazo doesn't have the same type of death zone like Everest has that will kill you being that the atmosphere is also out with it.
Fun fact ; the three humans to be at the highest above sea level were the Apollo 13 guy's doing the higher than normal orbit around the moon to get them back to earth.</p></div>		</li>
