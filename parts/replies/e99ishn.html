			<div class="markdown"><p>That's fascinating and upsetting for me. I've always suffered from insomnia, but it got significantly worse for me after I was awake for 4 nights in a row.</p>
<p>Ever since then it seems like I lost the ability to fall asleep when tired. I can now be really tired and feel like I'm on the verge of falling asleep but never fall asleep. I hoped it wasn't permanent, but it hasn't got any better with time.</p>
<p>All the advice about sleep hygiene, exercising, avoiding caffeine and screens, getting up at the same time every day etc. doesn't do anything for me. I think my body is producing the sleep hormones but they no longer induce sleep because I can feel so incredibly close to sleep, but still stay awake.</p>
<p>This happens even if I go camping for a week in the wilderness with no technology at all, and the previous few nights got barely any sleep. I will still be lying awake for 3-5 hours every night until the early hours of the morning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who has had a similar experience, go see medical professionals; there are drugs that can help you get good sleep consistently in the long term.  If nothing else, you can get drugs like Lunesta which are non-addictive to use in the short- to medium-term which gives you time to either find a better fix or at least get some temporary relief; perhaps getting good sleep for a long period will be enough for your body to fix itself.</p>
<p>The idea of relying on drugs for sleep may sound unappealing (and it is a royal pain), but it's much nicer than not getting sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a similar experience but eventually it improved for me. But it took years, literally. Like 4 years. I recommend trying Melatonin but if it causes or worsens depression don't continue it. It helped me get sleep a bit better. Other drugs seemed like a waste of time and money tbh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Following 6 months of 12 hour shifts where the time I came into work changed drastically day by day I developed narcolepsy. The time I came into work changed day by day and I barely got any time off in 6 months. Up until May, I was beyond exhausted <em>constantly.</em> Following being put on medication that keeps me awake and focused, now I pretty much don't sleep at all anymore. I slept two hours last night and feel relatively fine. I will sleep at most, five hours per night. Oddly, because of the medication, I don't really get tired anymore, but waking up in the morning requires insane mental fortitude and four alarms all set 60 seconds apart</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Idk if it’s in that podcast, but it’s rumored to have messed him up pretty good. I believe he did it at high school, or young college age, just for fun and let people study him. Seemed all good, but in his middle age I think he’s Schizo and can’t sleep at nights which he attributes to setting that world record just for fun. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anecdotally, I also know regular coke heads who have real trouble sleeping since they got clean. One attributes it to being so conscious during the sleeping phase (due to cocaine inhibiting the actual sleep) that he has to trick his brain in to not paying attention so he can actually fall asleep. </p></div>		</li>
