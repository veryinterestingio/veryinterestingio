			<div class="markdown"><p>Whooping cough vaccine is also not very effective after the first vaccination. So even after babies are old enough to have received their first shot against it, they are only a bit above 50% likely to be protected against it. It takes up to 5 vaccinations before they are above 90% protected.</p>
<p>Adults need regular revaccination as well to limit the risk of them getting it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my limited knowledge of the subject, most doctor's won't allow you to get the shingles vaccine until your in your 40s/50s. I know someone who got the shingels at 25, and the doctors still didn't want to give her the vaccine until she was older, despite its ability to recur. </p></div>		</li>
