			<div class="markdown"><p>It's really a question of &quot;what is the most accurate astronomically recorded &lt;data of some sort linked to our <em>previous</em> measurement of time&gt; that we could then observe again&quot;.</p>
<p>So, if we knew that Pulsar ABC has a pulse of exactly <some frequency> and we know a pulse was emitted at exactly <some moment on our clocks> we could use that to reconstruct the current 'time'.</p>
<p>Using a single pulsar would have an issue where you wouldn't necessarily know if it has pulsed 1000 times since the last observation or 1001 times, but if you use observations across multiple pulsars it would be possible to find the correct interval that matches all the observations. Then it just comes down to what is the error in our measurement of the pulsar frequency and the error in our observation of exactly when the pulsar 'pulses'.  </p>
<p>It's an interesting question.  Can we bootstrap our way back to the same 'time' as it was before, and how close would we get?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well as I said, the error is effectively zero for pulsars.  They are actually more precise than atomic clocks and were even used to measure time by several major observatories before getting the atomic clock signals was as easy as it is today.</p>
<p>They're the only community I'm a member of where every few years someone reminds everyone on Dec 31 that there's going to be a leap second that year so pay attention. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what the people above were meaning is how would you establish what time it is currently. I can see how pulsars help set up calibration of timing is some event happened as we lost what the current time is on earth i cant see how we can use a pulsar to establish what the time currently is.</p>
<p>If all out tech failed to that level i doubt working out if it should be 12:01 or 12:02 would really matter.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This was true in the early 1980s, particularly when assuming an averaging time of a few years (which is a great advantage of pulsars). But it doesn't seem to be true today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd need something with similarly steady decay. For a hypothetical example, say a pulsar that was slowly slowing down or speeding up, but with a progression that could be accurately calculated/predicted out a million years. So the earth is glassed in world war 3, but somehow a book survives that says when this pulsar's emissions cycle at a rate of x.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx, it will be Justin Bieber's 70th birthday.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might be possible to use the relative phase of several pulsars to get an absolute time offset to a past reference time, at least if anyone had the forethought to record lots of pulsar frequencies and their relative phase.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to this, pulsars are not <em>perfectly</em> perfectly stable frequency sources. They lose speed as they radiate energy away, and as centrifugal forces decrease with the slowdown they have starquakes where they crunch up to become a little more spherical, speeding up again. So most have tiny infrequent but unpredictable variations in their pulse frequency <a href="https://i.imgur.com/uXAWYRP.png" target="_blank">and it looks something like this</a> (note how tiny the scale is though).</p>
<p>By looking at several pulsars at once we can tell when one of them hiccups, and readjust for that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that's my understanding, but it's just something I was reading about recently. Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch_(astronomy\)" target="_blank">paints a slightly more complex and restrained picture</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A glitch is a sudden increase (around 1 part in 10^6) in the rotational frequency of a rotation-powered pulsar, which usually decreases steadily due to braking provided by the emission of radiation and high-energy particles. It is unknown whether they are related to the timing noise which all pulsars exhibit. Following a glitch is a period of gradual recovery where the observed periodicity slows to a period close to that observed before the glitch. These gradual recovery periods have been observed to last from days to years. Currently, only multiple glitches of the Crab and Vela pulsars have been observed and studied extensively.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>While the exact cause of glitches is unknown, they are thought to be caused by an internal process within the pulsar. This differs from the steady decrease in the star's rotational frequency which is caused by external processes. Although the details of the glitch process are unknown, it is thought that the resulting increase in the pulsar's rotational frequency is caused by a brief coupling of the pulsar's faster-spinning superfluid core to the crust, which are usually decoupled. This brief coupling transfers angular momentum from core to the surface, which causes a decrease in the measured period. It is thought that the coupling could be caused by a breaking of the pulsar's magnetic dipole, which would apply a torque to the crust, causing a brief coupling between the two parts.</p>
