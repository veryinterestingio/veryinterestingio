<p>and I agree with your thought and would like to add my own anecdote with drinking beer and not peeing, not sure what exactly happened and I didn't seem to have repercussions as it was a decade ago, but i held it until it hurt and was looking at the clock like six times a minute. When I finally went, i made it maybe 4 steps away from the toiletand sort of fainted but for barely enough time to hit the ground. I now am just hyper sensitive to the need to pee, I can sense when I can pee a single ounce and hold it but it's very, uh, not exactly painful but a fairly urgent sensation if I actually have a full bladder which wasn't how my bladder sensations worked before that day I fainted.</p></div>		</li>
