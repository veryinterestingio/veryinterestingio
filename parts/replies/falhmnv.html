			<div class="markdown"><p>I've actually been wondering this for a while but since this post is about printing... Why is it that when I print black and white, it actually turns out green? Is that because it's CMYK? It's really weird. I printed this document that had a lot of coloured text and pictures in B&amp;W and all of those parts of it were different shades of green.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I almost laughed at the thought of my printer attempting to compensate for an empty cartridge and get the job done anyway, rather than tell me “fuck you, my ink’s low, I’m not doing this shit” when none of the cartridges are even low.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Using color to make black is called “process black”, or occasionally “rich black” in market speak.  Unless you are doing something art related, it’s pretty much not good for anything but wasting ink/toner on consumer and office grade printers.  </p>
<p>There is usually a driver setting to force black only printing, but it gets complicated with gray tones because lots of the gray spectrum are only in gamut with color.</p>
<p>There are/were also six color ink schemes that add orange and green or another that added purple and something that I can’t seem to find right now.</p>
<p>Lastly, Trivia.  The old Key Lime iMacs we’re out of Gamut on all 4 color processes, but Jobs refused to change the color, so all the ads were slightly off from reality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically mixing heavy cyan, magenta and yellow will produce black but in reality you get an ugly greenish-brown, that's why there's also a black cartridge (and also because it's cheaper to print monochrome). Many colour printers will switch to using a mix of cyan/magenta/yellow to produce black when the black cartridge is empty, so that's the first thing I'd check. See if your printer has any other sort of diagnostic self-test, it's also possible that you have lots of black ink but the ink head is clogged.</p>
<p>If your black cartridge is not empty, I would try printing a self-test page (from the printer, not from your computer) and see if the blacks are still muddy. If they are, you might just have shitty black ink.</p>
<p>If the self-test page comes out with a nice black, the issue is in the computer software that's converting RGB colour to CMYK. That's not something I can help you with, but if this turns out to be the case (which I think is unlikely anyway) you at least have a lead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My printer does B&amp;W fine, I just checked a document I recently printed from my one and it's all black and grey. It's my mum's that I used and it turned out green like that, so I will tell her to do some maintenance/checks on it (or she will get me to do it lol). She must not check it since she doesn't use it a whole lot. Thanks for your advice!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, it prints things that are black in the document, like text, as pure black it's just stuff that was in colour in the doc that turns green.</p>
<p>edit I lied I just checked and it's blue lol. It is fine on my own printer but the one in my mums office is the one that makes things green and I don't do maintenance on that printer. I'll tell her to check it out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of true, but you have some big, glaring inaccuracies in there. For example, CMY can most definitely NOT produce every color the human eye can perceive. Not even close. It's a decent compromise between cost/effort and result, but it's a pretty limited spectrum overall. A lot of blues and oranges are impossible to reproduce in CMY for example, that's where extra colors in custom prints come in. And CMY will only in theory produce black. In reality, it'll be something dark brown-ish.</p>
<p>RGB color space is waaaayyy bigger than CMYK color space. CMYK is an approximation and a compromise, not a 1:1 reproduction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This right here is a very important addition. As someone that works with both RGB and CMYK on the daily, this is the truth. CMYK can nowhere near produce every color the eye can perceive.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Kind of true, but you have some big, glaring inaccuracies in there.  sRGB is about the same size as the average CMYK space, just a different shape.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically green can’t because the color that yellow + blue actually make is olive.</p>
<p>To be honest, when it comes to mixing RYB, the only actual colors on the standard wheel (or at least just its outer rim) you can get are probably orange and its variants like amber and vermilion</p></div>		</li>
