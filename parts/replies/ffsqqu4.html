			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends.   If you are just doing your own dishes, doing them by hand is always faster, more efficient.   Personally I would never dream of owning a dishwasher, but I don't host dinner parties, feed a large family three times a day/what have you.<br />
But keep a bowl of soapy water next to the sink, a second of scrubbing, splash of water to rinse, done.    I only own like 4 plates though.<br />
Even in restaurants the employee is the one actually washing the dishes.   The machine just sterilizes.  Removing food scraps, polishing any silverwear, all of that is done by hand anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More importantly, an at-home dishawasher doesnt NEED to be able to wash dishes that fast, because unlike a restaurant, nobody is using up dozens and dozens of dishes every single hour in their home.</p>
<p>Making a dishwasher that can wash that fast makes it bigger, needs more energy, and much more expensive. Since most people can afford to wait an hour or so for their dishes to be done, it makes more sense to spend less on high-performance parts, and make the dishwasher cheaper, at the expense of speed.</p>
<p>Also worth nothing that the washers at restaurants are much harsher on the dishes. Thats fine when all your dishes and utensils are exactly the same and are <em>made</em> for frequent use, but not so great when youre at home and your dishes might come from dozens of different manufacturers, be made from many different materials, and might react differently to heat and pressure inside an industrial dishwasher.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Home dishwashers <em>used</em> to be fast, though. They weren't as green as they are as far as energy use and water use, but they were fast. We also had much better detergents, the phosphates (banned, now) were a much better and quicker catalyst than the stuff current &quot;green&quot; detergents have.</p>
<p>If you use something like Cascade fryer boil out (instead of detergent), you can still run a fast cycle on modern machines, and your dishes will be just as clean. (Personally, I don't bother.)</p></div>		</li>
