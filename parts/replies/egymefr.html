			<div class="markdown"><p>And because they cant put thay cost on 5 million Units. 5 million in rnd on 5 million units is 1 a piece. But make Only 1 unit, that is a lot that needs to be earned back on that unit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm.  My company did a series of the &quot;final&quot; structural tests on the James Webb space telescope.  $8.5bn test article bolted onto our machine that could tear it to shreads if a static shock was discharged at the wrong place, or if the controller failed.</p>
<p>The vibration testing we do on satellites is itself nerveracking; because if you accidentally break it...there goes a billion + dollars because there was only one.  But thats all so that they can ensure that 1/1000 chance of failure when its in service.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the answer. The mission may only be 90 days, but if it was only designed to last 100 days the chance of failure before 90 days is VERY high. So to achieve a high probability of success to mission length you have to design it to last far, far longer than mission length. Mission critical component factor of safety is often 10 or more to achieve essentially infinite fatigue life of the part.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If your phone was the size of a washing machine, hardened to survive space, and built by NASA, it would probably have a better battery life.</p>
<p>Admittedly it'd probably be a uranium RTG battery designed to last 10 years without a charge, but still. </p></div>		</li>
