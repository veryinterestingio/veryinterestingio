<p>We're not - theorists have postulated that things like silicon and methane could be used in place of carbon and water.</p>

<p>Still, researchers have long speculated that alien life could have a completely different chemical basis than life on Earth. For example, instead of relying on water as the solvent in which biological molecules operate, perhaps aliens might depend on ammonia or methane. And instead of relying on carbon to create the molecules of life, perhaps aliens could use silicon.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>in theory yes. in practice the boiling point of methane is very low. so liquid methane is very cold. very cold is not very nice for chemistry. So yes it could be, but life based on liquid methane would be very slow.
Of course, boiling point goes up when pressure increases, so in conditions that are waay out of what we know from earth there could be liquid methane at earth like temperatures.</p>
<p>A whole shitload of stuff thats good for life is soluble in water and hence life on earth uses it. becasue its available and by far the best &quot;solution&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
