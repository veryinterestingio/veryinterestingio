			<div class="markdown"><p>For context Everest is just upwards of 29,000 ft. 18,400 feet is very high (roughly on par with the highest point in Europe), but that elevation is only about 1000 ft. above Everest's Southern base camp. The Himalayas are fucking massive is what I'm saying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gotcha. I understand this was around base camp elevation. It's just wild reading the phrase &quot;bees on Everest&quot;.</p>
<p>Not too long ago I read the book &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; by: Jon Krakauer. It was thoroughly a great read.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>really though, can you imagine, you're how many thousands of feet up a mountain with some of the deadliest, unpredictable weather conditions on earth, which can happily end your life if you have bad luck or don't pay attention to your position and 02 levels. And you get stung by a motherfucking BEE. And immediatelly go into anaphylactic shock because you are DEADLY ALLERGIC to bee stings. AND YOU DIDNT THINK TO HAVE YOU SHERPA PACK A FUCKING EPI PEN. ON MOUNT EVEREST. AT FIFTEEN THOUSAND FUCKING FEET.</p>
<p>I would be so sour.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The bees were found at 18400 ft, which is just a little above Base Camp (17600 ft). The dangers aren't quite as extreme there yet :) (though still not negligible of course!) Everest is 29k ft high, and the death zone begins around 26k.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would be pretty wild and unfortumate. Certainly one of the crucial pieces of gear you <em>wouldn't</em> think to bring on an Everest trek. </p>
<p>I would be sour...but would also probably be dead. </p>
<p>Imagine the obituary. People get the impression you died from the unpredictable conditions of that treacherous mountain. Nope. A bee sting. </p>
<p>Or you're finally, after years of saving, preparations, etc, about to embark on one of your dreams. It's cut short before you even really begin the ascent because of...a bee sting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><strong>Translated to rest-of-the-worldean:</strong></p>
<p>Temperature usually determines max altitude.</p>
<p>Flies  can only fly if the temperature is about 10 degrees Celsius or  warmer.  If it‚Äôs 32 degrees at ground level, that‚Äôs a max height of  about 1800m.</p>
<p>Other insects  can go much higher.  Some butterflies have been seen at 6000m, and  a colony of bees was found on Everest at 5600m.  Air chamber tests  showed some of these bees can fly in extremely thin air, equivalent to  9000m.  Going to that altitude outside an air chamber would be  about -40 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>Flies will typically be closer to the ground because that‚Äôs where the food is.</p></div>		</li>
