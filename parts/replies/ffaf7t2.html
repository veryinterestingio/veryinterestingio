			<div class="markdown"><p>If I can piggyback, I have a related question</p>
<p>I've torn my acl (knee ligament) twice. Extremely painful after it happens, but after approx 10-20secs of searing pain it goes away completely. To the level that I can walk freely or even jog. Once I cool down the intense ache sets in</p>
<p>I've seen athletes do the same on tv. They go down clutching their knee, but then they're shown jogging on the sideline and you think they're good. It's then reported post game they've torn ligaments </p>
<p>What causes the pain from severe knee trauma to dissipate so quickly? It doesn't feel like adrenaline as I've felt calm after doing it and walking off</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm afraid I'm not certain. I imagine an adrenal response does play a role, since they can take multiple forms (depending on how your brain reacts to them and how much adrenaline is released), but I don't specialise in that area and I wouldn't want to speak out of my area and give anyone false impressions that I know more than I do and potentially teach someone the wrong thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For injuries occurring during physical exertion, pain is suppressed because of how much adrenaline is flowing through your blood. It's a hormone secreted during a flight or fight response induced by fear or surprise.</p>
<p>Adrenaline or epinephrine, suppresses pain. This is an adaptation that is supposed to allow you to run away from what ever is causing the fear induced response. Then once you've gotten away adrenaline decreases, swelling increases and consequently the pain increases.</p>
<p>It just so happens that it's also secreted during physical exercise. Presumably because evolutionarily speaking physical exertion may mean something bad is causing that need, so adrenaline is also secreted then too.</p>
<p>In addition, the knees have relatively less synaptic connections, due to how many different types of non-circulatory tissue is crammed into such a small space. Fewer connections = less pain response.</p>
<p>The body is not a perfect system, there are compromises everywhere. In fact most of evolutionary biology is an exhibition in tradeoffs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The type a pain Is quick and enough to get you down, the memory and your body saying &quot;whoa steady now&quot; keeps you down until you're lifted up and then shock gives you enough adrenaline that you start moving as much as you can to work it out of your system (the harder your heart pumps, as long as there's no danger, the faster the adrenaline leaves your body) and the adrenaline completely shuts down type c nerves.</p>
<p>Sometimes athletes use the adrenaline rush and start to play again, and the danger of playing the game on such a painful injury keeps them plenty pain free in the moment, but the body is still I hired and whatever the injury is is only getting worse, so most teams don't let players do it and you often see a seemingly small injury take the player out of field and into the clinic to make sure it's not just adrenaline.</p>
<p>I hope that helps, even though I'm not OP.</p></div>		</li>
