			<div class="markdown"><p>It can’t be done.  In order to make blood, you actually need to run it through a human body.   The human body is an essential part of the “making blood” process.   You can make <em>blood cells</em> separately, but to make <em>complete blood</em> outside of the human body would be something so far beyond the reach of current science that it’s laughable.</p>
<p>I cannot overstate how complex blood is.  You are constantly tweaking it inside you to be sure that it’s right.   It contains two separate acid/base buffer systems.   It contains sugar and nutrients.   It contains escort molecules and signal molecules.  It contains hormones and toxins.   It’s literally the superhighway of your body.   How do you grow that in a dish?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So would it be possible if someone who had donated their body to science (or registered organ donor) and somehow gone brain dead with an intact body to essentially to become a blood factory? Like they’re a vegetable but we keep them on life support and just keep taking blood?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps we could get &quot;close enough&quot; with a blood substitute that would function for emergency transfusions. Getting the buffers, nutrients, and electrolytes right should be easy, maybe add some synthetic O-negative red blood cells, platelets, a couple of the more important proteins.</p>
<p>Would it be easier to start with human blood plasma then add synthetic red blood cells, or is that a significant bottleneck? </p>
<p>Basically focus on the absolute essentials, and make sure we aren't diluting anything too important by transfusing this synthetic or semi-synthetic blood.</p></div>		</li>
