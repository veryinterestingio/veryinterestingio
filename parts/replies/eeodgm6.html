			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.244301" target="_blank">If your interested, here is a paper on the subject</a>. Not exactly ELI5, but it was well written.</p>
<p>From the abstract: &quot;We find that purely normal deformations lead to global deformations of the soft solid, so that the blade has to penetrate deeply into the sample, well beyond the linear regime, to reach the relatively large critical stress to nucleate fracture. In contrast, a slicing motion leads to fracture nucleation with minimal deformation of the bulk and thus a much lower barrier&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, that explained it much better than I did. One of the key bits with soft bodies is that most of the energy you supply pushing the knife down actually goes to just deforming the body, rather than actually starting the cut.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A <em>minor</em> quibble with an otherwise excellent answer. In this sentence: &quot;Low amounts of energy lost to plastic absorption means the crack doesn't need much energy to spread,&quot;
Shouldn't it be &quot;Low amounts of energy lost to plastic absorption means there is more surface energy for cracking.&quot; The energy required to crack doesn't change, it's just there's more of the incoming kinetic energy that is expended on cracking</p>
<p>Mark Rober's pinewood Derby explainer is excellent at demonstrating this: the input energy is a fixed amount (potential energy from gravity, illustrated by blocks), it just gets expended/allocated in different ways (kinetic energy / friction)
