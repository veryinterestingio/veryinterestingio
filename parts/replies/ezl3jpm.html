			<div class="markdown"><p>What usually happens is they infect a bunch of computers or find a bunch running software they can use (like cpanel turning on dns recursion by default, you can use it in an amp attack), then they fire them up when they need them. It's hard to find rhe source because they buy a server (stolen cc) to scan and infect other servers then use those to continue hopping until they built an army of servers.</p></div>		</li>
