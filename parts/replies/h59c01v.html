			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. Im a very normal, non-violent guy who started training at an MMA gym just to learn Jiu Jitsu. I had no desire to fight, spar or get hit in any capacity. But after straight grappling for a few years and seeing guys I rolled with take fights, I decided to try it out. Sparring was never fun and I hated getting hit, and leading up to the fight I was terrified. But the weird thing is, once I got in there I was so overcome with adrenaline none of the hits I took were really unpleasant—I felt them and knew I needed to get out of the way, but it wasn’t until after the fight that all these aches started up and I realized how much damage I'd taken (it went all three rounds, so we were both pretty bruised up). It’s a very weird experience.</p></div>		</li>
