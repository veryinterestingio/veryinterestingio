			<div class="markdown"><p>There are some, mainly physical therapy and those electric pads you see on infomercials that are meant to help you get ripped (they won't do that without causing significant pain, but they do help counter atrophy in certain patients), but the problem is that to counter the total lack of nerve signals from the brain, you need to be taking part in whatever therapy for a significant portion of the day, every day, for years, which just isn't feasible in a lot of cases. The kinds of therapeutic schedules that are feasible are effective at slowing down atrophy (but not preventing it), so they're very effective at speeding up overall recovery time for eg. a hand transplant. It is possible with longer transplants, but the longer the limb, the more difficult it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the most common form of limb attachment surgery is reattachment. Keeping a severed finger etc on ice and rushing to the hospital is definitely a thing. Lost hands/feet/limbs are most commonly replaced with prosthetics rather than a donor limb, due to the risk of rejection.</p></div>		</li>
