<p>that's really weird, because capsicum is just the scientific name for the family of peppers that Bells fall under. It's weird that you guys would refer them to that because they are the only pepper in the family that doesn't contain capsaicin and are not spicey, so the name is slightly inaccurate. The spicy varieties in the family are called Chile Peppers, those do contain capsaicin. Bell Pepper refers to the non capsaicin bearing fruits that are not spicey. But, they did originate here, so that explains why we would have better and more accurate naming for them.</p></div>		</li>
