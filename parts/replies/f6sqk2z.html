It contains facts, possibilities and our on lasting insecurity in that topic.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just here to clarify that the <em>acceleration</em> isn’t equal to the speed of light, the escape velocity is equal to the speed of light. </p>
<p>The event horizon is the point at which all world lines (space-like, time-like, and light-like) end up at the center of a black hole in a finite fine.</p>
<p>Edit: appears people don’t like facts. Acceleration cannot equal escape velocity, the units do not match.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, if the escape velocity of a black hole happens to be perfectly equal to the speed of light, and a photon is traveling away from the black hole - is the photon just standing still?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A photon could be held at the event horizon for a short period of time. If a photon were emitted at the event horizon, it could stay there until there were some perturbation to the black hole (accretion of mass, Hawking radiation), which would cause the size of the black hole to change, putting the photon either just inside, or just outside of the Schwarzschild radius. Accretion or radiation would cause the photon to fall in, or escape respectively.</p></div>		</li>
