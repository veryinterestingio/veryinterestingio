			<div class="markdown"><p>In the ideal situation yes; an RH negative person must receive RH negative blood however if it's the first time they are needing blood and it's an emergency and there's no other option; they can be transfused O RH positive blood!  However this is an extreme circumstance and not routinely practiced but can be life saving! This would be coupled with RH anti D immunoglobin to prevent mounting an Immune response against the RHD antigen! </p>
<p>Logic being that it's only after the first time of receiving RH + blood will they form antibodies!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, they made a mistake witb my dad and started a transfusion of O+. Read the wrong chart. He's O-. They fortunately blew the vein, it didn't get far. His arm was solid black from it for weeks. He said a horrible feeling of doom/death came over him, he called my mom freaking out. A doctor took the phone and told her to meet him at the ER <em>now</em> (he was at rehab for misdiagnosed GBS, it was,paraneoplastic syndrome , hence needing transfusions, no happy ending)</p>
<p>They checked over and over for the rest of his transfusions. The ER doctor had jo clue how they fucked that up so bad. They figure the nurses bad IV skills saved him that day, the blood pooled up rather than circulated..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also note that with plasma and platelets it's actually the other way around. People with ABpos blood don't make antibodies against any of the blood antigens, AB or D, so their plasma is the most compatible. Oneg people have anti-A, anti-B, anti-A,B (a different antibody only Os make) and can have anti-D too. Their plasma is the least compatible.</p>
<p>This is why in emergency situations or with babies you'll see them given O blood and AB plasma.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are four groups of blood types, A, B, AB, and O. They can all be positive, or negative. </p>

<p>ofc, biology being the science with all the fun exceptions... that is unless you are one of the very few people with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hh_blood_group" target="_blank">rare blood group</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This very rare phenotype is generally present in about 0.0004% (about 4 per million) of the human population, though in some places such as Mumbai (formerly Bombay) locals can have occurrences in as much as 0.01% (1 in 10,000)</p>
