			<div class="markdown"><p>If you’re talking about getting a stitch while running, my cross country coach taught me to focus on inhaling and exhaling on the opposite foot from the stitch- if it’s on your right side then try to time your breathing with your left foot hitting the ground.</p>
<p>He explained why, but I forgot. I have no idea if this is legit or if it’s just placebo effect/self fulfilling prophecy, but it’s always seemed to help me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh. I do something like this inadvertently, but have never had a problem with cramps.</p>
<p>When I run I try to delay being completely out of breath by extending my breathing over several steps. I start with inhaling over 4 steps and exhaling over four steps, and &quot;giving up&quot; steps (breathing over 3 steps, then 2 steps) until I'm full-on panting.</p></div>		</li>
