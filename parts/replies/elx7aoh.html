<p>I remember when I was younger and skim milk being marketed as better for dieting but in reality fat doesn’t make you fat, sugar does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm very confused by where you read this or which milk bottles you were looking at. None of the milk I buy (either TJ's Organic or Clover organic) have added sugar in the nonfat milk and the reduction in calories is about 50 cal/serving. This is especially important because there's a growing body of empirics that show saturated fat may be harmful for longterm health. A summary from the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/fat/art-20045550" target="_blank">Mayo Clinic</a>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No shit?</p>

<p>Whatever reality you're living it, it doesn't obey the first law of thermodynamics. Calories make you fat, not fats, not sugars, not proteins. The total caloric intake is the <em>ONLY</em> factor in whether you are fat or not. Stop spreading misinformation.</p></div>		</li>
