			<div class="markdown"><p>Hang on, we're mixing metaphors. The missions were 100% oxygen at significantly lower psi to give the same partial pressure -- basically 1/5th the air at 5x the concentration = same O2 available. This would burn no more aggressively than 20% O2 at 1 atm.</p>
<p>In the Apollo <em>test on earth</em> they couldn't run 3-4psi because then there would be higher pressure outside the capsule, the opposite of in space, so they cranked it up to 15-16psi for a positive differential. That's where the inferno happened.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wouldn't it tend to burn hotter, as the heat energy isn't diluted by nitrogen?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this seems to be true in general, according to page 5 of <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19920004363.pdf" target="_blank">this study</a>. It talks about higher pressure atmospheres with the same amount of oxygen inhibiting fire, but the reverse should also be true. Unfortunately I couldn't find a pdf version of the 1967 study it cites.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is interesting to note that some atmospheres that support human life may not support fire spread (ref. 22). For example, a breathable atmosphere with a near-sea-level quantity of oxygen (a partial pressure of 21 kPa) but a low percentage of oxygen inhibits fire growth because of the cooling or quenching effects of the excess atmospheric diluent. In submarines, this principle is the basis for fire control by nitrogen flooding to dilute the oxygen concentration in the existing air atmosphere (ref. 23). Unfortunately, since nitrogen flooding substantially increases the atmospheric pressure, the method is unsuitable for use in a limited-strength spacecraft structure.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Guessing but: the mass of available air and it’s heat capacity is very low in a capsule. So when you say “diluted” Heat energy through nitrogen that doesn’t really make sense.</p>
<p>It’s more like the nitrogen is there and could limit the amount of oxygen that can get to the flame. But gasses At reasonable pressures can be assumed to be ideal so they don’t really block each other which means that having 20% as much straight oxygen vs whole amount as air at 20% oxygen Gives us the same amount of oxygen to fuel the fire with very similar “accessibility”.</p>
<p>Perhaps the nitrogen even helps facilitate convective transport of the heat, making it “feel hotter”. I don’t know though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd be curious to know this too, but I suspect that's correct.  Standard N2 O2 mix at 15 psi would have more volumetric heat capacity than 3 psi 100% O2, without significantly affecting the heat of combustion.  N2 isn't completely inert; if the temperature is high enough NOx will form, which I believe is an endothermic process.</p>
<p>It's not a trivial question to answer... PhD theses have been written about combustion of a single compound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apollo actually operated on Pure O2 as well (it was way too late to change thing sup after Apollo 1). The difference was that at the surface, they maintained the N2/O2 mix, but as the spacecraft ascended, it vented to the outside, and the Nitrogen was purged as the craft dropoed to the 5psi flight pressure.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Nm, it isn't.  Standard sea level ratios and pressures, but mostly for convenience</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's at standard pressure, 101.3kPa, 21% oxygen. So under ordinary circumstances it's pretty much just like normal sea level air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would make sense too.  But it seems it does stem back to the apollo fire, shuttles use atmosphere, and it would be a big tear up to dock with a different atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>
