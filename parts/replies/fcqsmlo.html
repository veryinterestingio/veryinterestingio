<p>There’s also the “every action has an equal reaction” part, right?  So, because of the lack of elasticity in the wall, the force you input against it at least partially transfers back to you as force movement in the opposite direction you push, which is why you can bounce a ball off a hard surface — or your body if you hit it right. So, it takes additional energy to continue pushing against that very reactive force that would otherwise bounce you off the wall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry this is straight up inccorect</p>
<p>Why does my body feel more fatigued if I keep the deflection for 10miniutes instead of 5 minutes?</p>
<p>The energy of displacement is not time dependent (energy doesn't have time units in it)</p>
<p>So where does the energy of my body from 5 minutes go?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It may seem counterintuitive, but it’s “straight up” the correct answer here. </p>
<p>This is not a question of displacement (directly), but instead of potential energy. When you push against the wall, the wall pushes back on you (otherwise the wall would move or break). It pushes back by “just the right amount” (to balance your force) because the wall (like all things) is actually elastic. </p>
<p>You’re putting potential energy into the wall by pushing on it. You need to apply a constant force to keep that potential energy from pushing back at you. Your muscles burn energy to apply that force (over time). So pushing for 5 minutes is easier than pushing for 10. </p>
<p>Think of the wall like a (really really stiff) spring. When you push on the spring, the amount of energy in the spring is proportional to how far you deflect the spring (Hooke’s Law). To hold the spring in a position, you need to apply a constant force proportional to the amount of spring deflection.</p></div>		</li>
