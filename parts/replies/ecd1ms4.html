			<div class="markdown"><p>This is generally the consensus at this point in research. You’ve summed it up nicely - insufficient cues, insufficient coding, or potentially actual changes in the network itself. At one point, it was considered that forgetting was the result of “writing over” a memory, essentially, like a computer writes over data. I’ve been out of the field for a little bit, but I try to keep up with the research because it still interests me even though I don’t work in it anymore.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This may be outside the scope of this post, but is there a reason why we form memories for specific types of things over others? For example, I worked as a bartender when I was in grad school and I could remember people’s faces really well but had difficulty recalling people’s names, while some other bartenders had an easier time recalling names while forgetting faces. Another example, if I read or wrote something, I could find it in my memories, whereas I struggled when only taking in information orally, such as a lecture where I didn’t take notes</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my physio-psych classes they made a big del about the fact that writing something down is one of the best ways to get it in to long term memory and have it able to be recalled quickly.  It activates networks in the visual, language, speaking, and motor sections of the brain.  This was 200 level stuff so I don't know super specifics, but the strength and robustness of the memory is tied to the number of activated networks and the way that they play off of each-other.</p></div>		</li>
