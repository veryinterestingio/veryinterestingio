			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a runner, and several years ago my 2nd toe on each foot, which is a bit longer and curved, ended up with damaged nails during the middle of winter running. Those nails have always ended up being slightly discoloured, hard as f$@k, curved. I always stacked it up to damage from running, and since I never stop running the damage just keeps being maintained.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got a negative test and I simply don't believe it because my toenail looks really messed up. My skin also shows signs of infection. The last podiatrist I went to told me I have to see a dermatologist, but I've seen several already. It's annoying. Anyway I don't have the symptoms you're describing so maybe that test was accurate, I have no idea.</p></div>		</li>
