			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with your comment up until this point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even if somehow you managed to measure the whole superposition without breaking it (which of course is against the laws of quantum mechanics), you would be restricted by Holevo's bound, which says you can only retrieve n classical bits of information from n qubits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Holevo's bound essentially says that you <em>can't</em> measure a superposition without breaking it, so I'm not sure what the conditional in your sentence means.</p>
<p>If you <em>could</em> measure a whole superposition without breaking it (which, like you said, violates the laws of quantum mechanics) then Holevo's bound would not apply -- you could store an arbitrary amount of information in the coefficients of that superposition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Superposition&quot; is an unhelpful word to be using here---a measurement of |x&gt; leaves the system in a superposition of |p&gt; states, for instance.  <em>Everything</em> is a superposition in a different basis. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It stops being a superposition of the eigenstates of the observable that is measured, would be a more correct way to put it. In quantum computers, it's usually a very specific observable so people use this as a shorthand.</p>
<p>That aside, I think QM language should have a few more conventions to make it easier to get into. Eg it's not always obvious from context if &quot;state&quot; refers to the whole state vector or a single eigenstate, which is super confusing for students.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes I totally agree with your point, it is a fundamentally absurd statement what I suggested. Perhaps I understood Holevo's bound incorrectly, I didn't realise it is basically a direct consequence of superposition collapse. Thank you for this reply!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They exist, but they're like a computer in the 60s. Large room-sized affairs at big research labs. Additionally, many experts believe that that will never REALLY change because of the power and cooling requirements (the qubits must be cooled to very nearly absolute zero), so while quantum computing certainly has a very long way yet to come, it was never designed to replace conventional computing and it's likely that future users will subscribe to a quantum computing service where you're given time to run computation on Amazon's QC or etc.</p>
<p>An important caveat, though, is that experts never thought conventional computers would miniaturize to the size we have either. Predicting future tech is hard.</p></div>		</li>
