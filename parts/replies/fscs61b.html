A perfect light speed connection between two points across the globe would have about 66ms latency, or 16ms for two points across the continental US, or 23ms from East US to GB.  This is on top of whatever is added by the users' computers, audio encoding and decoding, etc.</p>
<p>Latency is a real issue for large ensembles because of the time it takes for sound to travel.  Performers in marching percussion have to mentally block out sections in front of them to prevent ensemble tears.  That wouldn't make for enjoyable jamming conditions.</p></div>		</li>
