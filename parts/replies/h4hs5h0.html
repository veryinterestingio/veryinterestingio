			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember a question on a dynamics final that involved an ideal rope, but the force applied would create compression, and like half the class got the answer wrong.  Because the answer was “a rope cannot undergo compression.” Lol</p></div>		</li>

<p>While I completely understand the concept in context, the mental image of someone with a bunch of rope in a trash compactor trying to prove you wrong comes to mind every time I hear the phrase.</p>
<p>As someone who hasn't formally studied the field, is there a reason it isn't phrased more like: &quot;A rope cannot withstand compression&quot;?  It seem like you could try to apply compression, but it can't withstand it.  I know words can have very specific meanings depending on the context and the specific field, so I don't know if there is an engineering definition for &quot;rope&quot; and &quot;compression&quot; that doesn't allow it to be used that way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s a great term that is also used for gas laws, namely the Ideal Gas Law: PV = nRT which is also a differential equation.</p>
<p>What an amazing concept to create idealized versions of reality and extrapolate from there to make educated guesses on the reality of things. Sometimes good enough is good enough!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stiff and rigid are slightly different. Rigid means it cannot be deformed. This tends to describe a permanent attribute of an object. Stiff means it resists deforming. It often describes a temporary attribute of an object. So the idea of a “stiff object” rather than a “rigid body” is kind of funny. One might imagine that the “stiff object” is holding its breath and trying its best to stay stiff while you do some math about it :)</p></div>		</li>
