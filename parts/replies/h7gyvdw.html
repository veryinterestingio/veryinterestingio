			<div class="markdown"><p>In places with cement kilns, tires are burned. They have special conveyors that shove the tires one by one into the furnace. The kilns are large and reach thousands of degrees so the tires combust cleanly. Of course, there are CO2 emissions to deal with but it's one way to get rid of them and use their energy for something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't burn them 100% &quot;cleanly&quot; since almost all tires are sulfur-vulcanized, but if you burn it at a sufficiently high temperature you'll get sulfurdioxide, carbondioxide and water because those are the most energy efficient combinations of carbon, sulfur, hydrogen and oxygen. Now sulfurdioxide isn't nice, but there are extremely effective methods for desulfurizing flue-gasses.</p>
<p>If you don't burn tires at very high temperatures though the long carbon and sulfur chains will only partially break down and instead form various complex carbon and sulfur molecules. A whole lot of those are carcinogenic or otherwise toxic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The kiln burns tires more cleanly [than an open fire burning a pile of old tires], because it provides enough oxygen and high enough temperature to burn not only hydrogen from carbohydrates that rubber contains, but also burn carbon from rubber and carbon-black (a very fine black powder) that is used in rubber production. So a tire burning in kiln doesn't produce choking black smoke but converts all that black soot [carbon] to carbon dioxide. Plus in the kiln the sulfur is burned more cleanly and the smoke can be scrubbed. Plus, the iron content from the reinforcing wires is actually used up in production of cement. When producing cement not only limestone is used but also iron in some form.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure about the name but i remember hearing stories about some places that have been burning for years on end because we can’t really put it out and at least one of those was a tire graveyard if i remember correctly</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This site in Kuwait has had large tyre fires multiple times over the past decade.</p>
<p>Based upon some of the older photos, they did tend to create &quot;islands&quot; with fire breaks in between. Although the photos in the link below don't appear to show much of that from the recent fire.</p>
<p>With large tyre fires, they will bring in heavy equipment and move tyres away to create fire breaks so it can just burn itself out eventually if they can't put it out.</p>
<p>So yeah, not like the Simpsons.</p>
