			<div class="markdown"><p>Astronomer here. I'm in the same boat as you. I dislike how all the science news articles make it sound like we know everything with absolute certainty. In reality all of these new scientific discoveries just represent the fact that we are slightly less in the dark than we were yesterday. Rather than saying &quot;it rains diamonds on Saturn&quot; it would be more correct and honest (though very cumbersome) to say &quot;based on our understanding of the composition and internal structure of Saturn's atmosphere, we would predict that it would have carbon precipitation that could reach temperatures and pressures necessary to form diamonds&quot;. Of course that is <strong>way</strong> too wordy,  and the news media will jump on the flashier and shorter statement that it rains diamonds.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's the power of light spectra - there's a wealth of information to be gleaned about chemical composition, planetary formations and atmospheres.</p></div>		</li>
