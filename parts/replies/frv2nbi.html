			<div class="markdown"><p>As above, we all hoped experimental results would have aligned with string theory's view of the universe. As yet that has not happened. That could well mean that string theory reveals itself at energies beyond today's experimental/technological reach. So, my view for the future is that such observational evidence is likely to elude us for some time. But theorists are making such incredible strides in understanding string theory's view on black holes, the nature of space and time, as well as so many other vital questions, that there is much to keep us busy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I've read, insufficent data. The LHC experiments can place constraints on not finding supersymetric particles at certain energy levels, but that's all you get from not finding evidence, as opposed to finding some contrary piece of data. The LHC experiments aren't all encompassing and there are still many interpretations of string theory that place it out of current experimental validation range.</p></div>		</li>
