			<div class="markdown"><p>If I remember correctly, an art historian explained to me that many of the simplistic styles of history actually required a lot of skill and practice. So people back then could have learned a more realistic style, but just weren't interested to, instead perfecting the style they thought mattered. Kind of like many manga artists today. Some of the styles might have had several practical and religious restrictions. Realism probably wasn't that interesting, since it's what people saw anyway, a stylized version could rise above ordinary and the mundane</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, many artists have no intention to be realistic and I didn’t mean to imply that  realism is inherently better than symbolic art. It depends on what the artist intends to communicate. I was simply responding to the OP’s question about why it took so long for art to match what we now perceive as realism. I think of realism as a type of technology that was communally evolved over generations as artists built on each other’s discoveries and techniques. Some artists contributed to that goal and many more chose to explore other avenues of expression.</p>
<p>Scott McCloud has an amazing book called “Understanding Comics” that delves deeply into the relative strengths and weaknesses of representational and symbolic art. Scott says: </p>
<p>“When we abstract an image through cartooning, we’re not so much eliminating details as we are focusing on specific details. By stripping down an image to its essential meaning an artist can amplify that meaning in a way that realistic art can’t.”</p>
<p>I highly recommend that book. Scott is brilliant!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the recommendation! </p>
<p>I think there might have well been people who made relistic paintings before, that OP, you or I don't know about, and that was the question. I think the reason why we haven't seen much of that is because people didn't find it that appealing back then.
To me it's a different question wether people could have achieved the exact same level of realism that we are currently seeing</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nearly &quot;photorealistic&quot; sculpture was being done in Classical Greece. It seems likely that highly realistic 2-D art was also being done as well at that time (though not likely to survive, due to fragile media).</p></div>		</li>
