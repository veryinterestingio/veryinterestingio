<p>The lowest pressure that it reports during this is about 200-700 mTorr (I believe that is the measurement thatbis used, I'm not there right now to verify).  And my understanding of converting between pressure scales isn't good enough yet to convert for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I don't think you're pulling enough of a vacuum. 200 <del>mTorr</del> Torr (if that is the minimum for that pump) is approximately 200 mbar which is far too large of a pressure to boil the water (at room temperature).</p>
<p>What you could do to demonstrate this to the kids is to heat the water before hand but not to boiling. This increases the lower pressure required to boil the water. I believe you could heat the water to 60 degrees C and you would observe the water <del>continuously</del> boiling <del>until it's all gone</del> at approximately 200 mbar.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong><em>Edit:</em></strong> Just a post script thought. You could accurately measure the temperature of the water when it boils and use that to accurately determine the true pressure in the vacuum chamber (sometimes the pressure gauges aren't great). Maybe a little experiment for the kids.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a field service tech for a manufacturer of chamber machines (and other packaging equipment). This is correct; if you aren’t positive you are pulling 200mbar I would heat the water to about 70°c just so the cool factor comes through.</p>
<p>What I am actually here to say is that doing this in a chamber machine will actually harm your machines vacuum pump. Pulling water vapor into a vacuum pump like this is detrimental to their health, and should not be done frequently without changing the pumps oil much more often than normal.</p>
<p>That said, it’s a cool trick that we use as a demonstration on why the product being packaged is very important to the process.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The water cools down in the process and then boiling stops unless you keep heating it. If the vacuum pump is strong enough you can freeze the remaining water to ice, but 200 mbar doesn't sound sufficient for that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One torr is about 1.3 millibar, so 200 millitorr should be about 0.25 millibar, which should be more than enough to boil water at room temperature, since the triple point of water is at about 6 millibar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Makes sense  perhaps OP could try heating the water first then see if it continues to boil or boils longer. I may have to play with this a bit in my vacuum chamber later (butcher type).</p></div>		</li>
