			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm no professional pen tester (work in IT) but... My favorite is when any random joe schmoe complains because they don't have an admin account on their office computer. They always say stupid stuff like &quot;I don't go on any of those bad sites!&quot; or &quot;I always follow best security practices!&quot; Which both ALWAYS turn out to be false -_-. Then when you say you won't give them admin because you're reducing attack vectors or however you want to put it, they give you an eye roll and just assume you're telling them no because you don't like them or something stupid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like the pass phrase method. Basically you come up with a sentence, bonus if it has punctuation and caps in the middle. Something like:</p>
<p>&quot;I'm pretty sure that our IT guy was a diversity hire, it's the only thing that makes sense.&quot;</p>
<p>Then you take the first letter of everything in your phrase while keeping punctuation and caps:</p>
<p>IpstoITgwadh,itottms.</p>
<p>Now translate to leet-speak:</p>
<p>1p5t0ITgw4dh,1t0ttm5</p>
<p>There you go, a pretty damned secure password that you don't really have to remember, you can figure it out pretty fast though just from your phrase. Until your IT guy makes you change it 10 days later because he's a fucking potato.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is really the only case for routine password cycling.  It is common in business for people to use a shared account for some services that are not personal in nature.  There are 2 better solutions instead of password cycling, one internal to the company procedures and one at the level of the service:</p>
<p>Internally, the company should change the passwords for shared accounts whenever someone leaves the company.</p>
<p>Externally, services should allow for shared accounts with one admin user who can grant/revoke access for other people, each of whom has their own login/password.</p>
<p>Cycling passwords at some random arbitrary interval is just a lazy way of not bothering to do what should be done, and mostly is worse for security (for reasons others have mentioned).  It does somewhat over the long term mitigate cases where people forgot or didn't bother to do the right thing, but the system can still be compromised  within the cycle window, so it's really better to do things right in the first place than try to clean up afterward.</p>
<p>To me, a system that mandates password cycling indicates an assumption that proper security policies will not be followed, and therefore things should be assumed to not be secure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One company I worked at, they instructed me to use the last 4 digits of my SSN as my voice mail password. When I asked them how would our supervisors check our voice mail when we're out, I was told they would be provided our password. I asked them if the company is going to be responsible for any identity theft that occurs through their dissemination of that very confidential information.</p>
<p>Next day we got a memo about changing our passwords to something else. Turns out they did this for years, and I was the first person to bring it up.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So 99% of places?</p>
<p>Changes protect against leaks too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This! Very much this! There has been testing that shows that having such strict requirements for passwords/having it expire frequently because it makes it difficult to remember them and changes are typically something akin to just changing a number at the end or something. The other alternative is that they would then need to record them somewhere or use an app to generate/store them.</p></div>		</li>
