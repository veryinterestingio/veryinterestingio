			<div class="markdown"><p>It was natural formations initially mistaken for life, and that headline was put out before rigorous confirmation.  In fact, there is a big problem in science of erroneous claims making headlines in advance of peer review, only to be disproven later.  Another example was the superluminal neutrinos about 5 years ago.  It turned out to be,IIRC, an ill adjusted clock.</p></div>		</li>
