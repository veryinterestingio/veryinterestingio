<p>The effect after a single dose is significantly smaller (and apparently less than Pfizer was claiming), though it still reduces infections by around a third.</p>

<p>This has been very, very badly reported in the media. Pfizer's data is that immunity* after 1 dose does not start until 12 days, and that by the time the second dose is given (21 days), immunity is at 52%.</p>
<p>The data reported from Israel was that after 14 days, shortly after immunity starts at all, but long before the second dose, it is already at 33%. This does NOT contradict the data from Pfizer. We'll know more after Israel and others publish more data.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually also wrongly reported. The efficacy rate of 52% comes from comparing infections in the vaccine and control groups <strong>from the first dose to the second</strong>, which includes the first 12 days where antibodies haven't kicked in yet. If you look at the Pfeizer data and ignore those first 12 days, you'd get around 90% efficacy from the first dose alone.</p>
<p>See Figure 3 here:

<p>The reason I think this is reported wrong, is probably to encourage people to get the second dose (as it probably ensures longer immunity).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry but you are mistaken.</p>
<p>I'm seeing a lot of incorrect information and missunderstanding around the effectiveness of the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine. </p>
<p>There are numbers of both 52% and 90%, these are both correct but refer to different things.</p>
<p>If you view figure 1. In this source </p>
<p><a href="https://www.cas.mhra.gov.uk/ViewandAcknowledgment/ViewAttachment.aspx?Attachment_id=103741P" target="_blank">https://www.cas.mhra.gov.uk/ViewandAcknowledgment/ViewAttachment.aspx?Attachment_id=103741P</a></p>
<p>You can see that the placebo group and active group diverge after 14 days. That is, the vaccine takes around 14 days to act. This is the key difference in the figures </p>
<p>The 52% is the figure if you measure from the moment of the first dose being administered.</p>
<p>The 90% is the figure if you measure from 14 days after the first dose was administered, i.e after the vaccine kicks in.</p>

<p>So it's <em>far</em> more important to get widespread treatment with one vaccine, than to get the second vaccine to the people who already had the first one, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's more -- A significant fraction of the people testing positive after the first dose of the vaccine are believed to have been infected before the first dose was administered.</p>
<p>There's no hard data of course, as these are people who don't realize they're already infected.  But a sizable number of the <em>infected-after-first-dose</em> cases are probably pre-vaccine infection.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The data really isn't there to make this claim, though. They gave doses three weeks apart, right? And the immunity response from the first dose is supposed to ramp up over a couple of weeks. So you have a very limited time frame to look at for when the first dose would be 'active' in people, but the second dose not yet given. Most of the time between the doses is time when the immune system activity from dose 1 has not yet kicked in.</p>
<p>You really need a good population size that delays the second dose for 6+ weeks after the first dose, to properly see the effect of just one dose.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Dialing in from the UK here, I hope you're looking for a sample size of 60 million!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, if you look at the published phase 3 data for the Biontech (Pfizer had nothing to do with the development) vaccine (Polack et al., NEJM 2020), it's pretty clear that the incidence rate in the vaccination group drops very significantly at around 12 days after the first vaccination. </p>
<p>This is not  a valid or very scientific way of analyzing the study, but if you just look at days 14-21 post vaccination and then compared it to 21+ days after the first vaccination, it almost seems like there's no added benefit of the second dose. Of course that doesn't take into account long term protection and so on, but I think it shows pretty well that the first dose alone protects pretty well from getting COVID19...</p></div>		</li>
