			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow! That's a much kinder explanation than I heard at a Nine Inch Nails concert.</p>
<p>This was in Sydney at the Hordern Pavilion in 2009, I think.<br />
They were playing Starfuckers, and the crowd started clapping along... but then got all out of time.</p>
<p>Trent Reznor actually stopped the song, and informed all us amateur percussionists that the issue was we were &quot;fucking useless&quot; and throwing the band off.<br />
Then tried to restart the song, but gave up because we &quot;ruined it&quot;.</p>
<p>I was laughing, coz he was totally right, and I've played in bands before and knew exactly how shocking the crowd was.</p>
<p>So many clap-alongs are just criiiinge. Don't do it, folks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm no Trent Reznor, but when I was a percussion director, I once stopped the entire marching band three beats after the director said &quot;one two ready GO!&quot; .......Multiple times.</p>
<p>My reason?  My percussion section didn't say &quot;dut dut dut dut&quot;</p>
<p>Because of the aforementioned reasons, it's important for the rhythm section to lock in with each other by ensuring they can hear each other.  That they can listen to each other.  I got l legitimately angry when my percussionists didn't listen, not just to me, but to each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha, I'm no professional muso. I played <strong>adequate</strong> bass guitar a long time ago, but I know just enough to appreciate quality band interaction.</p>
<p>I've been to concerts and stuff where I can tell everyone is an absolute professional, coz the conductor or band lead is like &quot;And a 1 and...&quot; ~perfect music~</p>
<p>And I'm like &quot;Wow.&quot;</p>
<p>And my friend is like &quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p>And I'm like &quot;They're all amazing.&quot;</p>
<p>And my friend is all &quot;Yeah so?&quot;</p>
<p>And I'm like &quot;The count in was shit, but everyone knows what to do.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Former percussion caption head here. Teaching the concept of listening back field can also be challenging. When the drum line is split front to back, I always loved showing how sound travels to the kids. The members in the back are always right. Their duts must be extra loud!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen interviews with rock musicians who say they try not to look at the front of the crowd when performing because doing that ruins the time. Farther away is fine, because you can't see the details. But the front row, you can see their hands clapping and mouths singing off time and it can throw you off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>having been a professional hand drummer in a performance art group for quite some time, this is true.</p>
<p>we loved to get other drummers involved later in our set, and the <em>primary</em> thing we had to ”teach” everyone is that when you are trying to sync up with a group, your ears lie about the time... <em>watch</em> the lead's hands and play to that.</p>
<p>this also works well when trying to keep sync across some distance.</p>
<p>so that's why it's difficult when the first couple of rows is fucking up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is <a href="https://youtu.be/0JdpRWG3IJ0" target="_blank">this video</a> of the so-called Viking Clap, that Iceland’s soccer team fans performed during World’s Cup, where you can see the soundwave propagating from the front of the crowd to the back just by watching their hands. So cool. </p></div>		</li>
