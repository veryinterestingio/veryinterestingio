			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, all of the data collected under Copernicus are publicly available free of charge. The data include output from a satellite altimeter (providing measurements of sea surface height and ocean waves) , microwave radiometer (providing measurements of the atmospheric water vapor load) and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Radio occultation instrument (providing measurements of atmospheric vertical profiles of temperature and humidity).  Sentinel-6 is an operational mission providing measurements to services within 3 hours of sensing - although the commodity of the operation is scientific measurements. The orbit is chosen to minimize the impact of ocean and Earth tides (which complicate the interpretation of the measurement) and is a pro-grade non-sun-synchronous orbit inclined at 66deg with a repeat cycle of \~10 days.  This orbit has been occupied by a series of satellite missions starting in 1992 with the TOPEX-Poseidon mission, followed by 3 Jason satellites and now Sentinel-6.  Maintaining the same orbit and allowing satellites to overlap during tandem flight operations (flying back to back with each other) and the length of data record is important for climate analysis since we need great stability of measurement to be confident in sea level rise trend estimates after we have accounted for natural variability of the climate system (which occurs on interannual and decadal time scales).

<p>Love it. Freely-available data is a massive boon.</p>

<p><em>That</em> sounds interesting. Using navigation signals transmitted through the atmosphere to get a vertical slice of data like that makes sense when you consider it (we're broadcasting those signals <em>anyways</em>, after all), but it's not something most people would consider doing, I think. If I'm understanding how it works right.</p>
<p>Also, just want to say it's good to see the Earth Science division of NASA doing stuff. The last couple years haven't exactly been great for them, since a lot of their work involves climate issues. Hopefully the next couple years see them given a bit more freedom and perhaps capability, eh?</p></div>		</li>
