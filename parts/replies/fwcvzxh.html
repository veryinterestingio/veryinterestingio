			<div class="markdown"><p>after some tries it asks you to enter a1b2c3 to prove that you are not a robot</p>
<p>EDIT: Someone said that its propably for troubleshooting your keyboard and that makes way more sense because it would only protect form lowkey attacks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The a1b2c3 was designed with touch-enabled devices in mind. It has nothing to do with security or troubleshooting a keyboard and is just a simple check to be sure you are <em>intentionally</em> entering text, rather than just random input from a pocket, backpack, cat, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn't seem all that useful. If it's always the same text, the robot will just type that. If it's not, the bot will just read the screen. That's why we use captchas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, couldn't it give you a freebie or two? Giving someone <em>two</em> quick password entries before starting the delays is not going to make it open season for hackers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It could insert the delay only after the second and later erroneous attempts, so that the occasional error in typing wouldn't cause a delay.</p></div>		</li>
