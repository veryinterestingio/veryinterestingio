			<div class="markdown"><p>Vaccines train the body to attack something that looks like the virus. In the case of most COVID vaccines they train the body to attack the pointy spikes on the surface of the virus. Viruses become immune when they mutate such that they no longer look the way the body expects them to.
For example, if the Covid spikes mutated in a new strain to become curvier or to change from triangles to pyramids, the vaccine training might not be sufficient to provide protection against that strain.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not really that the virus becomes &quot;immune&quot; to the vaccine - it's that it mutates and &quot;evades&quot; OUR immunity.</p>
<p>We build immunity during an infection by finding immune cells in our lymph nodes, that have been hanging out inactive in the lymph nodes for years, that can kill whatever infection (or vaccine) we are currently dealing with. These inactive immune cells, B Cells (which make antibodies) and T Cells (which kill infected cells), have receptors on them (B Cell Receptors &quot;BCRs&quot; or T Cell Receptors &quot;TCRs&quot;) that recognize a specific shape - they are waiting until an infection that matches their BCR or TCR comes into the body.</p>
<p>When a virus is making proteins of a specific shape, the immune cell with a matching BCR or TCR will divide millions of times to make copies of itself, all of which start pumping out antibodies in the case of B Cells or begin walking around the blood looking for viruses / for areas in the body with infections, to go see if they can find the shape they recognize and kill it for T Cells.</p>
<p>When viruses mutate (when anything mutates), the shape of the protein(s) it is coding for also changes. Some of these changes are small, so our immune cells can still recognize the newly mutated protein's shape. Some of these changes make the protein stop working, so any virus with this mutation may never infect a cell. But some rare changes will make shapes different enough that our immune system no longer recognizes them AND they will still be able to function and infect us. This is called &quot;immune evasion&quot; - where a mutated virus is still able to function, but is no longer recognized by the immune system of a person/animal who is immune to the &quot;parent&quot; virus.</p>
<p>So far the mRNA vaccines are providing enough protection that the mutations of SARS-CoV-2 that are still able to infect people are also still able to be detected by our immune systems. This may not always be the case. But if I'm being honest I thought we would have immune-evading mutants by last winter, and hundreds of millions of infections later we still don't see much of any! The cost of immune evasion might be too high for SARS-CoV-2: it may need some very specific shapes to keep infecting humans, and the mRNA vaccines are providing immunity to those important protein shapes, so it may turn out to be nearly impossible for SARS-CoV-2 to mutate in a way that is both able to spread and able to evade our vaccines. We could have gotten really lucky (lucky, coupled with the fact mRNA vaccines are a light year step forward in biomedicine).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know this might seem random but you seem to know a lot about this stuff, do you think its possible that covid 19 was &quot;fabricated&quot; in a lab?
I personally don't believe it, but overtime more people are thinking it was and now I'm confused</p></div>		</li>
