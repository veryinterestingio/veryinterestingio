			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Mecha are not a good idea. People like them because they are cool looking and that's why we see them in fictional stories, but in real life even if they would be cheaper, barely anybody would pay for them. &quot;</p>
<p>Thank you for saying this, I've always thought they were ridiculous. Why would anyone pay billions for what is essentially a giant tank that can be thwarted by a stiff breeze or a flight of stairs? Just make 1,000 tanks and 100K suits of body armor instead for the same price.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, so in their defense (and I know Mechs aren't practical machines of war) the Mechs they probably are thinking of aren't the type that would walk up a flight of stairs or get blown over by a breeze. </p>
<p>They are like a 100T, 12meter tall Atlas. More like Pacific Rim then Boston dynamics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Point taken, but if a mortar shell hits it in the upper body, will it be thrown off balance? Even if it doesn't fall over, will it still be able to aim properly? Doesn't the fact that it stands 12m above the battlefield make it an easy target? Legs are way easier to disable than treads. If stairs are not an issue, what will it do when confronted with a steep incline covered with loose rocks and boulders? What if the terrain is muddy? There are just too many things that can go wrong. As my 6th grade math teacher used to say, &quot;Keep It Simple, Stupid.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>sooo, how much weigth per square meter of ground does that mecha have? Can it go on softer ground without sinking in it? What about...bridges? :&gt;</p>
<p>And, also...If I cannot directly destroy that mecha, what would I do? Oh, right. I'll drop a runway cratering bomb, or ten...or a 1500kg guided bomb or a few... or a 20 ton MOAB - directly on the GROUND under its feet....and you are most probably not taking another step without falling over.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One well-placed landmine or shell to the foot and that thing is kaput. Treads are the way to go. I just don't see what advantage those feet would have, raising the center of gravity like that. Even if it is better able to scramble up steep rock faces, what happens to the crew inside? Their heads would be rattling against the steels walls of the cockpit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but they are not humanoid and the question was about humanoid. On top of that, it's a pretty niche role. I mean, in most terrain wheels or track are far superior for mobility and cheaper. Logging spider are cool, but will they be commercially viable? I don't know the answer to that. They will certainly be more expensive and the added complexity make maintenance harder than other type of vehicle, so are they more efficient enough to compensate? Only time and testing will tell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People fail to realize just how many adjustments and realignments they're doing constantly just to do something as simple as walking. There's a reason why most animals don't ambulate on two legs: it's hard. It's hard to keep balance, it's hard to move quickly, it's hard to even stay upright on two legs. Hell, as an example, take any two legged action figure or something. There's a good chance many don't stand up without assistance. Any 4 legged figure of anything is practically guaranteed to stay standing even when applying pressure to it.</p>
<p>Just controlling a Mecha to do something as walking on slightly uneven terrain would be a nightmare logistically. You'd need some kind of fully integrated neuro kintetic control and give the Mecha the ability to have the same array of sensations that the human body has. We have way more than 5 senses. The amount of internal sensors for balance we have are mandatory for our ability to walk upright, as is our tactile sense just in our feet. You know people have to go to rehab for something as comparably minor as losing a toe? Losing a foot or having a neurological disorder that makes your lower extremities lose sensation can make walking horrendously difficult. Ever get up from sitting on the floor with your foot asleep? How impossible walking feels for a minute or two? Now imagine trying run, shoot, fight, while feeling that numb all over. And controlling your entire body with a joystick.</p>
<p>Someone mentioned blowing over with a stiff breeze. Without adjusting your muscles to resist force like that unconsciously, every sudden gust would knock you over with how little inborn stability and high surface area the humanoid figure has. If you can't even feel the wind and had to manually adjust with some sort of pilot controls these things would be toppling over constantly.</p>
<p>I never thought much about this before now but goodness it is glaringly obvious how insanely impractical and practically impossible these things are in virtually every aspect.</p></div>		</li>
