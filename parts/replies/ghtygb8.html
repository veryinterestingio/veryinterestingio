<p>You see, 4K videos are filmed using 4K cameras</p>

<p>I've been shooting in 4k for a half decade and and we've always used 8k cameras making most of your point even more valid as 8k will generally be better all round cameras to 4k equivalent.. </p>
<p>We're also getting 12k next month! Woop!</p></div>		</li>

Now watch a DVD-- same/similar resolution, but they're able to control the colors and place them properly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>weird, as your answer is dead wrong </p>
<blockquote>
<p>4K videos are filmed using 4K cameras with much more expensive low-noise sensors and usually a better lens</p>
</blockquote>
<p>???</p>
<p>there are point and shoot cameras and phones that shoot 4k with TINY sensors that fall apart in low light and have quite crap lenses attached to them</p>
<p>you seem to think the mere presence of 4k means the device shooting the video is inherently better</p>
<p>a full frame camera with a decent lens shooting 1080p is still going to produce a better result than some bargain bin $200 android that can shoot 4k video.</p></div>		</li>
