			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't just affect smaller animals. It benefits the species as a whole as if a predator eats a pineapple and experiences discomfort, they're going to learn not to eat pineapples. Therefore having this trait is extremely beneficial to their survival.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They generally don't produce seeds, but instead use vegetative growth to put out suckers and have them root in the ground.</p>
<p>The sweet, pleasant taste is a side-effect of the plant storing sugars to feed its reproductive systems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm far from an expert, but I I would guess that they just coincidentally taste sweet because they contain sugar and nutrients the fruit uses to grow another pineapple <del>tree</del> plant from itself. I welcome a correction or further explanation though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a pineapple expert but it could be related to the way hot peppers spread their seeds. Birds can fly long ranges and spread the seeds over a wider area than other animals, so hot peppers developed a chemical, capsaicin, that burns mammals but not birds.</p>
<p>Whereas pineapples target larger animals, which typically roam larger areas, and produce enough stomach acid to neutralize the enzyme.</p></div>		</li>
