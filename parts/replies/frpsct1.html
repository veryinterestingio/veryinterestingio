			<div class="markdown"><p>yea pretty much. the nicotine just happens to fire on those neurons that signal your body to tell you that you don't feel hungry. so technically, you're probably hungry and need some food, you just don't feel like eating because of the neurons firing. I forgot what the other neuron was called but there's also another neuron that makes you feel hungry. im guessing that THC fires those neurons (munchies) but idk for sure! you could probably also see that most people who are addicted to nicotine are usually pretty slim</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes so much sense haha! Thank you for the clear explanation. I'm assuming other stimulants (cocaine, speed, mdma etc.) also fire those same neurons that mean you don't feel hungry, and other substances like weed fire the ones that do make you hungry. Cheers for helping me understand :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this why people crave nicotine after a meal? When I smoked, I always needed one after eating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oddly enough, nicotine has no effect on my appetite, as far as I can tell. I'd love to know how much this effect varies and how strong it is for some people.</p></div>		</li>
