			<div class="markdown"><p>What do you think of another redditor’s suggestion that beekeepers place wire screen around their hives, large enough to let bees in but small enough to keep the larger hornets out? Would this protect commercial hives? If wild hives were found could nonprofits or environmental services erect a barrier like this to help?</p>
<p>Also as a layman I didn’t know honeybees were not native. We often hear how crucial they are for pollinating and are told to protect honeybees. What species <em>are</em> native?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the screens are shown to work in Asia, and WSU's handout covers that and other strategies. There are not many wild honey bee hives left due to a different honey bee pest: varroa mite. It is going to be easier at this point to find and eradicate Asian giant hornet colonies than try to protect feral honey bee colonies.</p>
<p>Honey bees are crucial for pollinating large parts of modern agriculture (most fruits and nuts and some vegetables. Not most staples though.) There are, however, over 400 native species of native bees in the state of Washington (there are over 20,000 species of bees worldwide!) Many of these species do help pollinate crops, and studies have shown that native bees and honey bees together often provide better pollination than one alone. Anyway, as you might imagine, with over 400 species in Washington there's a pretty wide variety of bees. They include things like bumble bees, carpenter bees, long horned bees, sweat bees, mining bees, alkali bees, leafcutter bees, digger bees, cuckoo bees, etc. These come in a pretty wide variety of colors, sizes, social behavior, and floral preferences. And they're essential to pollinating our native plants. Hope that answers your question!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, a note about eradications of invasive species. The US is actually fairly successful at this, especially when the invasive species are found very early. Asian giant hornet appears to have been found very early, so while eradication is not a foregone conclusion, our odds are pretty good. Washington state also has a very experienced team on this. Washington has the most gypsy moth introductions of any state, and has successfully eradicated it every time. Also, if you want to look up a really amazing eradication campaign, look up the primary screwworm. The US pioneers a lot of pest control strategies and eradication techniques.</p>
<p>Also, the public actually plays a pretty important role in all this. At least half of all invasive species are found because someone noticed something weird and reported it. And that's exactly what happened in this case.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is unrelated to the original topic, but has there been any progress on using predatory mites like <em>Hypoaspis miles</em> on these?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there any indication as to how exactly the hornets were introduced to the west coast and established colonies?</p>
<p>Obviously in our modern globally connected world, invasive non-native species of all sorts have been spread to several different places for hundreds of years, but the Asian Giant Hornet has been known for a long time. Why is it just now being found in North America?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its unknown at this point how it was introduced. It is most likely to have hitched a ride either by boat or plane or in some type of cargo container. We may never know exactly. </p>
<p>And as for why it's just now being found... luck? It has been on the radar of invasive species experts as something to watch out for, but honestly, that's a pretty long list. This website has the lists for just the 2020 ag pest surveys. They update that list also every year. <a href="http://caps.ceris.purdue.edu/pest-surveillance-guidelines/2020" target="_blank">http://caps.ceris.purdue.edu/pest-surveillance-guidelines/2020</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This maybe a silly question but how did the hornets get to the U.S. from Asia? Were they able to fly the whole way, or did they stowaway in something imported like produce?</p></div>		</li>
