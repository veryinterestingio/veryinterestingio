			<div class="markdown"><p>Nasa uses evaporation/sublimation cooling. When water or ice evaporates, it uses some heat to do so. In space, water evaporates and ice sublimates quickly, so this is effective. </p>
<p>The limitation in that case is the supply of water. If that runs out, no more cooling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think to elaborate on what the other person said. The water instantly evaporates which takes some of the energy away then freezes when exposed to space. The system circulates the water across the ice covered plates to cool it. In the space station they also use ammonia for the second step of removing heat because it freezes at a much lower temperature. The circulating water could freeze in the pipes if they tried to radiate too much heat away from it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not in terms of heat. Your fart is as warm as your rectum temperature. Your rectum is already inside of the space suit. No change in temperature.</p>
<p>It could however give you a panic attack as you are forced to smell it and you take of your helmet because it stinks so much and you die.</p></div>		</li>
