			<div class="markdown"><p>And even after recording technology, many things weren't necessarily saved, or if so, not saved on good shelf-life film or in proper conditions. <em>I Love Lucy</em> is credited in the eyes of history as the show that pioneered reruns and syndication because Desi Arnaz wanted to film in 35mm and the studio wouldn't pay for it. He was able to negotiate paying for it himself if he could own the film after it aired. The studio didn't think it would matter; why would it? Everyone would have already seen the content by then. Little did they know of course....</p>
<p>Disclaimer: some consider this story apocryphal and I was cautious to not use the word &quot;invent.&quot; Its just one of those things where it doesn't matter who came first in history. Like Edison versus Tesla or Star Wars versus all the sci-fi and westerns its a stitching together of, what matters is who had the &quot;x&quot; factor of popularity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's pretty close to the version of the story I heard.</p>
<p>The version I heard is that Lucy wanted the ability to do re-takes, which you don't have with live television. All the other comedy shows were done live. Video tape hadn't been invented yet, so the only way to record these was to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinescope" target="_blank">point a movie camera at a TV screen</a>. This is why the few recorded shows you see from that era looked so terrible.</p>
<p>Because I love Lucy was shot on film, it was preserved.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why not point the camera at the actors
Instead of the TV screen?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also hydrox cookies just fucking suck, there are dollar store brands that are better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't recall all t he details, but in his autobiography <em>A Book</em> Desi said the main reason he wanted to go to film was so  they didn't have to make the show in New York; CBS wouldn't pick it up if the East Coast audience had to watch the show as kinescope.</p></div>		</li>

<p>the best part of this is early tv had no delays so mistakes couldn't be cropped out. so there were stories of dead bodies sneezing or scratching themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mom used to tell stories about the live commercials that aired. Most notably dog food commercials where the dog was supposed to run to the food bowl and start chowing down, but they would run offstage instead.</p>
<p>I read years later, though, that they started not feeding the dogs for a while before the commercial so that they would go right for the bowl when it was on stage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I vaguely remember live commercials that were from local car dealerships. Basically it was a guy in a suit talking very loudly in front of a curtain and a tripod display where he would remove one cardboard panel to display the name, the price, the interest rate, then ending with some sales slogan, delivered very loudly. Not a single shot of any actual cars.</p>
<p>A lot of early TV content had very  simple production where a central single camera would just show what could already be seen in a live environment. Stage plays, church services, daytime baseball, news reports with one guy sitting at a desk reading from typed pages.</p></div>		</li>
