			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't quite get the thought process behind deforestation on a grand scale like that. Sure, if it's &quot;only&quot; a patch of a few thousand mÂ² you need, then it'd be more of a hassle to buy the equipment and personnel to harvest, process and sell the wood. But, I mean, that unimaginably huge area of major forests could very well be harvested and sold (for a profit of course) and <em>then</em> be used for whatever purpose you wanted that piece of land in the first place instead of just burning it for no profit at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They want the land for itself. It's shit land, no crops can grow because the soil has been depleted from sustaining a fucking rainforest, and they can't just magically make more cattle to use it as pasture either. They get one or two cows and plant grass all over the fields, just to be able to claim it as property and get their land. So they're not even using these lands, they just want them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And it's happening right now because of Trump's trade war that has shifted soybean purchases from the US to Brazil, so farmers are burning the forest to clear more land to grow soybeans. China uses soybeans largely for hogs and poultry. Beef production is high in Brazil, but it's not like demand for beef has suddenly exploded recently. This is about soybeans.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Not to mention, the Amazon is pretty humid year-round, </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just a note, humidity / rain is only a factor for how fire behaves.  </p>
<p>There are fire-adapted ecosystems that are humid (much of southern Florida), and ones that are considered rainforests (the Redwood forests of the Pacific Northwest U.S, and at least some of the Eucalyptus forests of Australia).  </p>
<p>The Redwood rain forests have natural stand killing fire cycles on the 500+ year basis, while south Florida's native vegetation is adapted to a stand killing fire every 10 years.  My understanding is the Amazon isn't an ecosystem that evolved to tolerate periodic stand killing fires.</p>
