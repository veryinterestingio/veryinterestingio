			<div class="markdown"><p>The key thing about Special Relativity is that the speed of light (in a vacuum, in flat space) is constant for all (inertial) observers.</p>
<p>So as they are approaching, let's say one of them sends a burst of light towards the other. It must leave them travelling at c faster than they are going from their perspective. But it must hit the other one travelling at c faster than they are going from their perspective. And it must pass anyone watching nearby travelling at c faster than them.</p>
<p>The light will be blue-shifted, but it will still be travelling at c compared to all observers.</p>
<p>Same once they have passed each other, except the light will now be red-shifted. They'll still be able to see each other, just distorted a bit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How can this be possible if he's already going .5c? How can the light he sent be moving at c to me, a third party observer, and simultaneously seem like it's also going c, from the perspective of a guy moving at .5c?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because time, space and speed <em>do not work the way we tend to think they do</em>.</p>
<p>That is the point of Special Relativity.</p>
<p>We tend to think that you can just add velocities together; if you are travelling at 5m/s down a road, and you throw something forward at 2m/s relative to you, it will be travelling at 5+2 = 7m/s compared to the road. But that is not how the real world works. It will actually be going ever so slightly less than 7m/s compared to the ground, because speeds don't just add together (but provided the speeds are much less than the speed of light, the difference isn't noticeable).</p>
<p>It turns out that there is this special speed, just under 3 x 10^8 m/s, that is the same for all (inertial) observers (in flat space). If something is travelling at 3 x 10^8 m/s from your point of view, it must also be travelling at that speed from my point of view, no matter how fast I am travelling compared to you.</p>
<p>Knowing that, we then have to figure out how time and space actually work (to make this happen), and we get concepts like time dilation and length contract. Essentially, if something accelerates (changes speed), its idea of time and space get smushed in a bit. If something is travelling relative to you, from your perspective its time runs a bit slow and its distances are shortened a bit (although the reverse is also true - from its perspective it is <em>you</em> who are moving, so it is <em>your</em> time that runs slow and <em>your</em> distances that are shortened).</p>
<p>Of course, for every day life this effect is so small we can ignore it. The textbook example of where it is needed is with GPS satellites; they have to correct for Special Relativity as they are moving really fast compared to us, and they need to make really accurate measurements of time (they also have to correct for General Relativity, which says gravity also smushes space-time around). If they did not correct for SR effects (and GR effects) they would be pretty useless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because your relative perception of time and space to the other entity gets changed.</p>
<p>This is where all of the stuff from special relativity comes from. The one constant, the only thing that is always the case, is the speed of light, everything else is malleable, including time and space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You assume that there is an objective time frame, that you could theoretically decide on what events happen first or simultaneously. You can't.</p>
<p>An event A may happen first from one observers perspective, but a second observer may say it happens later than event B, not first. They can both be right. <strong>There is no objective correct answer for the simultaneity or order of events.</strong></p>
<p>Basically, because the speed of light is constant under all conditions (including movement by the observer), the order of events is not necessarily fixed. <strong>However</strong>, if the events are causally connected, precedence order is preserved in all frames of reference. That is actually the point. If you try violating these odd rules that the theory of relativity gives us, you end up with paradoxes that violate causality.</p>
<p>Essentially, the laws of nature as we observe them seem to &quot;make sure&quot; causality is maintained. On the other hand they don't seem to care much about absolute references (clocks).</p>
<p>You really got to pick one. Only in a Newtonian universe could you have both. But we have incredibly good experimental evidence that disproves the Newtonian model. There is no aether. The speed of light is always c no matter how we measure it or move observer and/or light source. Clocks definitely change their rate of measuring time when moved relative to one another. So causality or absolute reference frames it is. The laws of nature seem to have picked causality (probably better for our brains, <em>that other universe</em> would be even more mind bending than the relativity one we got.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would be if the speed of light depended on the speed of the source, but that is not the case, light speed is absolute. Also, once a photon hits one of the objects, the next photon can't be the same, so there is no such thing as a still image. A closer analysis would be needed to determine how objects see each other apart from a massive red shift, but I'm in no condition to think much about it now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. If both objects have a clock with them, they can always see the others clock ticking forwards. From the prespective of one observer, the other one is travelling sub-lightspeed so they can exchange photons. From the perspective of a &quot;neutral&quot; observer, the photons leaving one object don't slow down due to that objects velocity, so they can catch the other observer. This last point is the same as stating that the speed of light is constant.</p></div>		</li>
