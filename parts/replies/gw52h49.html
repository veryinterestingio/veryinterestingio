			<div class="markdown"><p>The surface tension still increases from 0 to 4. A person below linked to a website with that data. The reason for the change in density is because the water molecules begin to form a more rigid structure. In ice the water molecules have a very rigid crystal structure that leaves some empty spaces. When it is a liquid some molecules can flow into those spaces. However that molecule slightly disrupts the structure as it can not form the exact  same crystal structure. You can think of ice as like a chain link fence. Lots of rigid bonds but some space between them. As it heats up some of those links get cut and squeezed together. The density increases but the cut links are structurally weaker since they are only connected on one side.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is wrong or at least an incomplete explanation.  </p>
<p>The self diffusion coefficient follows a consistent trend between 0 and 100C. It's a property that does not show a significant anomaly compared to density and other similar ones. No different from the diffusion coefficient of other materials that don't show the transition.  In fact the self-diffusion coefficient pretty well followsa consistent trend clear down in the supercooled region. This isn't the reason unfortunately.   </p>
<p>I mean no offense, but I keep seeing people on this forum try to explain the density anomaly and fail.  Because they're trying to give a Chem 101 answer to a problem that's still the topic of red hot debate by active researchers.  This is far from settled scientist and there have been some pretty high profile &quot;brawls&quot; between groups over this.  </p>
<p>It's better said that we don't really know why and there's multiple theories out there as to why. And there's a lot of evidence which is starting to suggest it's because there's actually two liquid forms of water and they're in equilibrium below 4C.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This statement doesn't make sense to me, it's still liquid there's no increase in rigidity because there isn't any rigidity. I'm confused about how the term rigidity can even be used in relation to a liquid or a gas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I remember my high school chemistry class correctly, the density is dropping because the water molecules are beginning to arrange themselves into a rigid crystalline structure, so OPs explanation should still apply.  So density decreases, but the bonds between water molecules are still becoming stronger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the answer. Covering 0C water to 0C ice actually releases quite a bit of heat. This is why ice is so good at cooling down drinks. If you had 3 ice cubes in a 16 oz glass, the quantity of water would be rather trivial compared to the total quantity, and the temperature wouldn't go down much. However, changing 0C ice to 0C water takes a fair amount of energy. Therefore a glass of ice water will get much colder. </p>
<p>In this case, as ice crystals form, the surrounding water is actually heated up a little.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The closest thing I could find to an answer: brownian motion (the tendency for molecules in a specific pool to be at various temperatures) in water under 4C leads to some molecules of water turning into ice crystals, which causes the overall density to drop.</p></div>		</li>
