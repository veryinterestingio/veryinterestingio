<p>There are three primary effects that cause drag:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Skin friction. This is literally the drag from the air rubbing over the surfaces it flows round. Making your surfaces nice and smooth reduces it. Shape affects skin friction, but putting too much effort into minimising skin friction generally causes more losses elsewhere. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Frontal pressure increase. This is the pressure pushing back on a vehicle simply from the effort of moving the air out of the way. Whatever order you place your vehicles you've got to move the air out of the way of the largest vehicle so order isn't too important (as long as the front vehicle doesn't have an awful frontal shape). You want to make sure you don't move too much air out of the way, or impart too much tangential velocity to the airflow. Some sort of blunt rounded front is what you want here. A pointy front just increases skin friction since the surface area is larger, a flat front adds a lot of tangential velocity to the air which is unnecessary work. A truck front vaguely approximates a hemisphere (which is a good shape), so isn't too bad.</p>
</li>
<li>Rear pressure drop. You end up with a pressure decrease behind a solo vehicle which sucks the vehicle back. This is the one where the ordering makes a big difference. You want a long tapered shape following the pressure shadow such that you never have a low pressure void behind any vehicle in your convoy. Ordering large to small helps minimise this. Effectively placing a smaller vehicle behind a larger one reduces drag on both vehicles.</li>

<p>one other factor you need to add in is engine efficiency (amount of chemical energy in the fuel converted to break power</p>
<p>Bikes are around 12%, cars around 24% but large semi engines can get up to 40%.</p>
<p>Putting the semi first you have the efficient engine doing the most work.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Holy crap, 40% is crazy. And that's one looong paper...looks like the first relevant graphs (on a quick scroll through) are Figure 27 on page 34 and Figure 28 on page 35.</p>
<p>But 40% is close to or better than many single-stage steam turbine's efficiency. Very impressive from reciprocating turbodiesel engines.</p></div>		</li>
