			<div class="markdown"><p>When you take a thermometer and put it into a pot of water, the thermometer already has a certain temperature. (Temperature is basically a statistical average of kinetic energy)</p>
<p>If the water is hotter, water molecules are impacted the thermometer and on average contributing more energy to the thermometer than the other way around. The thermometer’s atoms start to vibrate more- and more space is needed in between the molecules of fluid in the thermometer as the molecules repel each other with their electric fields.</p>
<p>The fluid becomes less dense and expands- we see the line go up the tube. Other temperature measuring devices measure different properties of a material affected by changes in temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would you be able to explain how the flow of electrons through a material causes the material, and therefor the nucleus of the atoms it’s made out of to vibrate?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’d be resistance in circuit analysis you’re talking about.</p>
<p>Electrons flow through a material, creating a negative current going them (positive current in the opposite direction). These electrons have kinetic energy- depending on the resistivity of the material, some portion of that kinetic energy is imparted on atoms as the electrons go through- increasing the temperature of the bulk material.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that makes sense to me. Do we know how that kinetic energy is imparted on atoms/nucleus? And why it does not happen to super conductive materials?</p></div>		</li>
