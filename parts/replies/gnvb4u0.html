			<div class="markdown"><p>It's just blank. The only time I actually had to use my passport was at the French-British border (La Manche Channel). The lady just looked at the passport, looked something up, smiled and let me pass without fingerprint identification, no questions asked, so I guess the information is somewhere in the system.</p></div>		</li>
