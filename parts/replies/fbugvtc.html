			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep.  There definitely is a number of cycles that cause natural climate change.</p>
<p>Thing is, they usually grow over the course of a few hundred thousand years, allowing evolution to keep up.  CO2 levels also haven't been this high since the Permian Extinction that cleared the way for the dinosaurs.  The scary part isn't that it's rising, it's that it's shifting more prominently than most apocalyptic events.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you provide a source of data that confirms that past climate had stable temperatures for hundreds of thousands of years?  What is you definition of &quot;grow over the course&quot;.  From what I've seen the only example of a stable climate ever has been since the younger dryas.</p></div>		</li>
