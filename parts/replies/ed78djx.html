<p>We know of this thing called Pi; there's a definite kind of relationship between the circumference of a circle vs it's radius but when we try to model that (via 3.1415926....) it's never exact.</p>
<p>Our approximation is just a construct, as is time, as is gravity.  At best, they are models/descriptors to paint a picture accessible by all others.</p>
<p>What they <em>represent</em> is fundamental, but ultimately unknowable as we can only measure and build <em>models</em>; as accurate as they might be, they are only our best guess...</p>
<p>Hence, in all our models, what we define as gravity WORKS.  So!  Regardless if it's a fundamental force or not, all our math works with it, around it and until we can break it down something more fundamental, it stays.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reminds me of Kuhn arguments. I agree also that I think the answer more has do with to simplicity and utility of theory rather than abiding to the &quot;correct&quot; theory (Not that the discussion about GR quantization isn't interesting, but it didn't answer the question). Sure Newtonian mechanics is wrong (in the sense that it had become more so apparent in the last 100 years that the world is inherently quantum mechanically), but it's a good approximation for many situations and cases so that's why it's still used and taught. Same thing with chemistry and atomic orbitals and how high schools still teach the Bohr model but you learn the real nature of atoms in your physical or quantum chemistry course in college. The often &quot;wrong&quot; models offer an easy and often non mathematical rigourous scheme for students introduced to the ideas for the first time to learn.</p></div>		</li>
