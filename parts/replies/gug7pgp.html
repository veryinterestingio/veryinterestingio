			<div class="markdown"><p>Another reason that slower stronger heart rates are better is because the heart can only perfuse itself during the diastole phase (filling phase). This is because during systole (contracting phase) the heart not only squeezes but also has a bit of a torsion action that constricts the coronary arteries. So even though every other muscle gets perfused during contraction the heart can only feed itself oxygen when the heart is relaxing. Therefore, slower heart rates equates to a longer diastole phase which means more oxygen and nutrients get delivered to the heart while also not having to work as hard (less beating).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Skeletal muscles restrict their own blood flow, when they contract with more than roughly 15% of their maximal force. They need contraction relaxation cycle for endurance just as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what about someone like myself, that has a slow heartbeat at rest (43 to 62) but a very high heart rate during aerobic exercise (180 to 230). I did a cardiac stress test (exercise on a treadmill) and I was told that this was normal for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Under normal circumstances, your heart should only beat as fast as the physical demands placed on the body. So as you you progressively increase exercise intensity (i.e. stress test) your heart rate should increase virtually linearly with each stage. This is because to increase cardiac output (amount of blood pumped by the heart per minute) you need to increase either or both HR and stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped per beat) So the formula is CO = HR x SV. Increasing HR increases CO output which is good, but after a certain speed SV starts to decrease due to not having enough filling time (diastole phase) which is bad. So to fix this, SV must also increase by having a lot of blood return to the heart (preload) in a very short amount of time. When you exercise, all the contracting skeletal muscle helps squeeze a lot of blood back to the heart, think of squeezing a tube of toothpaste from the bottom and working your way up to get more out of it. This increases preload which also activates the Frank-Starling mechanism which stretches the heart more causing it to contract harder due to its tensile properties and thus increasing CO even further. The associated increase in CO then is able to perfuse the heart even in a short amount of time (due to shortened diastole). This is why high HR during intense exercise is perfectly normal and healthy as long as you're not going into any leathal arrythmias or getting symptomatic. Now on the other hand, if your heart rate is really high at rest then not only is your heart working harder to just perfuse your body at rest, but you also don't have the accommodating skeletal muscle to increase preload for that shortened diastole phase.</p>
<p>Whew.... hopefully I didn't ramble too much. Keep in mind that this gets a lot more complicated than I made it sound and nothing is really as straight forward when it comes to the body so take some things I said with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>Sources: I have a Masters in Clincal Exercise Physiology and I've worked in cardiac rehab and ran cardiac stress tests.</p></div>		</li>
