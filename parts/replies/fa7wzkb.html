			<div class="markdown"><p>I was imagining storage in salt caverns, low oxygen deep sea, or other areas where the carbon would be locked?  Would turning it into charcoal sequester enough carbon to offset the the right kind of heating process?   What percent of a tree is carbon and what method would sequester that C?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Getting the logs to those areas would add to the carbon footprint.  </p>
<p>The carbon in char lasts about 500 years in a tropical climate.   And about 2000 years in cold climate.  </p>
<p>But hugelkultur, in a cold climate will have a half life of about 40 years in a cold climate, BUT if the fungus responsible for brown cubicle rot gets to it, it will have a half life of 500 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hugulkultur only buries the material a few feet deep. It also creates a lot of air space which allows normal decomposition and does not sequester carbon. Carbon is sequestered when one or many of the key components needed for decomposition is absent such as no air, moisture or heat to allow normal microbial processes to break down the material. </p>
<p>Hugulkultur is the exact opposite. By burying the Carboniferous material in shallow holes you have all the components of decomposition very actively breaking down the carbon and making it available back into the environment NOT sequestering it.  Sequestering via digging a pit and depositing material would need to be tens of of feet deep where there is very little air and the carbon has a lot harder time making it back up into the layers closer to the atmosphere. </p>
<p>I have a degree in soil science and have some good friends doing research on which species of trees best sequester carbon to turn old pasture land into revenue generating carbon capture sites based on a carbon credit system they want to proposed. Based on their studies tree roots must be at least 10 feet under the soil to actually sequester carbon so they have identified several species of eucalyptus that create very deep and prolific root systems.</p></div>		</li>
