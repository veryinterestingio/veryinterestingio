<p>Same motivation for any lending: getting paid back more than what you loaned. If the stock goes up instead of down, John still has to pay it back, but now loses money in doing so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But that doesn't go to the person loaning the stock, right? It goes to whoever the borrowed stock was sold to. So if you lend John a stock you're just allowing him to either make or lose money with no affect on you, right?</p></div>		</li>
