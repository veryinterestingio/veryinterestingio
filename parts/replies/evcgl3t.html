			<div class="markdown"><p>Going into shock for body temp dropping is almost never a thing. You'd have to have a severely overheated person and extremely cold water that you let them drink way too much of. Mostly what is a concern is possibly choking and complications from the pt needing advanced airway interventions and/or surgery.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A minor explanation is that when suffering trauma, shock is a big concern. Shock can cause your body temperature to drop. So giving water could sap heat from the casualty.</p>
<p>If you are with an injured person and they request water it is advised to moisten their lips. Less than a mouthful of water. Just enough to wet their mouth and make them comfortable again.</p>

<p>Yeah, I always heard the &quot;shock&quot; explanation. </p>
<p>You don't want to trigger your digestive system to &quot;turn on&quot; and draw blood from elsewhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It actually depends on the type of shock. Giving fluids to someone in hemorrhagic shock is not going to help them. What they need is blood products. Giving fluids to someone in cardiogenic shock could kill them. Septic shock though, sure, they may need some fluids to treat their hypotension.</p></div>		</li>
