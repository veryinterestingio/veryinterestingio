			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's how it was explained to me once, to get an appreciation for it:</p>
<p>Imagine you shuffle a deck of cards once per second, every second. You shuffle 86400 times per day.</p>
<p>You start on the equator, facing due east. Every 24 hours (86400 shuffles), you take one step (one metre) forward. You keep shuffling, second after second, each day moving one more metre. After about 110 thousand years, you will have walked in a complete circle around the Earth (I know: you can't walk on water. Just ignore that part).</p>
<p>When you have completed one walk around the Earth, take one cup (250mL) of water out of the Pacific Ocean. Then, start all over again, shuffling, once per second, every second, taking a step every 24 hours. When you get around the Earth a second time (another 110000 years), take another cup of water out of the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>Eventually (after approximately 313 quadrillion years, or so, about 22 billion times longer than the age of the universe), the Pacific Ocean will be dry. At that point, fill up the Pacific Ocean with water all over again, and place down one sheet of paper. Then, begin the process all over again, second by second, every 24 hours walking another metre, every lap around the Earth another cup of water, every time the Pacific Ocean runs dry, refilling it and then laying down another sheet of paper.</p>
<p>Eventually, your stack of sheets of papers will be tall enough to reach the Moon. I think it goes without saying that, at this point, the numbers become very difficult to comprehend, but it would take a very very very very very long time to do this enough to get a stack of paper high enough to reach the Moon. Once you get a stack of papers high enough to reach the moon, throw it all away and begin the whole process again, shuffle by shuffle, metre by metre, cup of water by cup of water, sheet of paper by sheet of paper.</p>
<p>Once you have successfully reached the Moon one billion times, congratulations! You are now 0.00000000000001% of the way to shuffling 8 * 10^67 times!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is my favourite analogy of it, taken from a comment I read a while back:</p>
<p>I've seen a good explanation of how big this number (52!) actually is.</p>
<ul>
<li>Set a timer to count down 52! seconds (that's 8.0658x10^67 seconds)</li>
<li>Stand on the equator, and take a step forward every billion years</li>
<li>When you've circled the earth once, take a drop of water from the Pacific Ocean, and keep going</li>
<li>When the Pacific Ocean is empty, lay a sheet of paper down, refill the ocean and carry on.</li>
<li>When your stack of paper reaches the sun, take a look at the timer.</li>
</ul>
<p>The 3 left-most digits won't have changed. 8.063x10^67 seconds left to go. You have to repeat the whole process 1000 times to get 1/3 of the way through that time. 5.385x10^67 seconds left to go.</p>
<p>So to kill that time you try something else:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shuffle a deck of cards, deal yourself 5 cards every billion years</li>
<li>Each time you get a royal flush, buy a lottery ticket</li>
<li>Each time that ticket wins the jackpot, throw a grain of sand in the grand canyon</li>
<li>When the grand canyon's full, take 1oz of rock off Mount Everest, empty the canyon and carry on.</li>
<li>When Everest has been levelled, check the timer.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's barely any change. 5.364x10^67 seconds left. You'd have to repeat this process 256 times to have run out the timer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But if you think about it, every deck of card you shuffled has the same probability of happening so it is possible that the order of cards in the deck you shuffle will only happen once in the lifetime of the universe. Sorry, I'm not articulate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's 52 unique cards in a typical deck of playing cards, so think of it this way. You can take the Ace of Spades as the top card, and then the next card could be any of the other 51 cards, then the next card after that is any of the other 50, and so on. That will leave you with an absurd number of combinations from just one singular card fixed as the top, now take that and repeat it for the other aces, and then every other card.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Start with smaller things, like dice.</p>
<p>If you throw a six-sided one six times, every single specific sequence of numbers is equally likely. In this case, the number of possibilities is not a factorial, but a simple multiplication/potentiation: 6*6*6*6*6*6 or 6^(6), because for every throw each value from 1 to 6 is equally likely.</p>
<p>Getting the sequence 123456 is literally a one in a million chance, but so is every single other specific sequence.</p>
<p>The basic phenomenon is almost identical, although with slightly different rules (because cards cannot be reused in the sequence).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I remember correctly, the birthday paradox is something like &quot;With 20 people in the room, there's a 50&#37; chance of them sharing a birthday&quot;</p>
<p>With only 365 days in a year, the two are so massively different in scale. Whenever you shuffle a deck you're immensely likely to have made a order of cards that the universe has never seen, so you aren't even hitting results that have been made earlier in history, much less shuffles done just for this experiment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Birthday paradox says that the number of trials to get one overlap is approximately the square root of the number of possibilities. The square root of 365 is 19. The square root of 8*10^67 is 9*10^33 .</p>
<p>We can say with a very high confidence that no two thoroughly shuffled decks have ever had the same order.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Using Python, based on <a href="https://gist.github.com/benhoyt/b59c00fc47361b67bfdedc92e86b03eb" target="_blank">this gist</a>, I did the following:</p>
<pre><code>for e in range(25,36):
    print(e,1 - math.e ** (-math.pow(10,e)**2 / (2 * 8*math.pow(10,67))))</code></pre>
<p>which prints</p>
<pre><code> 25 0.0
 26 1.1102230246251565e-16
 27 6.217248937900877e-15
 28 6.249445405615006e-13
 29 6.250000517127319e-11

 34 0.4647385714810097
 35 1.0</code></pre>
<p>Meaning that there's insufficient precision to show the probabilities of exponents less than 25 (this is most likely caused by floating point precision problems), and that we reach 100% probability when we have 8×10^35 shuffles, and 46% probability at 8×10^34 and 0.6% at 8×10^33. Remember that the paradox in the birthday paradox comes from the apparent inability of humans to see the opposites of things, i.e. what's the likelyhood that there <em>isn't</em> a collision with a given n and d (n being the amount of people and d being the amount of days in a year). The same could be said of the [Monty Hall problem]( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem</a>).</p>
<p>There may be something horribly wrong with the math here but suffice to say you need a lot of shuffles before you start having birthday problems, around the same number of shuffles as there are atoms in the universe.</p>
