			<div class="markdown"><p>No, not really, depending on how you define a “particle”. What you are smelling are volatile compounds. These aren’t particles (as in dust particles that can carry bacteria and viruses), but they are molecules that started out in the poo, evaporated into the air, and diffused across the room to where you are. If you are smelling them it means the molecules are in your nose and making contact with nerve cells in your nose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;particles&quot; implies tiny suspended pieces of <em>solid</em> material, &quot;molecules&quot; can be gases. Like an H2S (hydrogen sulfide) molecule entering your nose smells like fart but is not an actual &quot;piece&quot; of poo entering.</p></div>		</li>
