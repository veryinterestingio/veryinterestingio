<p>The CFR in Wuhan/Hubei province is about 4% but about 1% in the rest of China</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another possibility is how CFR is calculated. Often CFR is:</p>
<p>Deaths/Confirmed Cases<br />
or<br />
Deaths/Confirmed Cases + Likely Cases</p>
<p>However there has been some academic work to suggest that this is only an effective measure of CFR <em>after</em> an epidemic is over. It might be that the more accurate measure <em>during</em> an epidemic is:</p>
<p>Deaths/Deaths + Recoveries</p>
<p>Using this metric, the global CFR is around 7.5%</p>
<p>But this isn't a very well studied area yet, and though research has been published on the idea it's not conclusive at this point.</p>
<p>Important to keep in mind though that statistics can be used incorrectly in <em>very</em> subtle ways that aren't apparent until you see the reality start to disagree.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both of these methods are wrong during an epidemic, but they give a good upper and a reasonable lower estimate of the eventual fatality rate.</p>
<p>Deaths/Confirmed cases will underestimate the true fatality rate, both because it takes longer time for someone to die than to get confirmed, and because new people keep getting infected. Raw numbers give 3.4% currrently, but outside Wuhan this seem to be lower.</p>
<p>Deaths/(Deaths + Recovered) will overestimate the true fatality rate, because time to die is shorter than time to recover. In the beginning this was probably 100% because no one had recovered yet, and now it's 7% and sinking daily.</p>
<p>Both methods will approach the true fatality rate asymptotically, the first from below and the second from above.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, and the second version appears to be accelerating downwards now that China is getting fewer cases, indicating that fast mortality versus long recovery probably gives it a high error. An exponential fit last week had it converging around 7.2 within about 30 days, now the rate is blowing past that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And both estimates will be biased in different ways. With virtual certainty, these will be biased high because not everyone who is infected will seek out care, such as mild cases, and those that do may never be tested.</p>
<p>Alternatively, quarantine measures can also exert a range of different and potentially competing effects. In one case, quarantine isolation measures which limit contact with others lead to lower estimates of CFR. Unless of course the quarantine measure is some dense collection of (a few) sick and (mostly) healthy or otherwise non-infected people, such as a cruise ship or the newly built quarantine apartment building in Wuhan. In this case, there's a perverse incentive to evade detection or be noncompliant with quarantine orders, or it's possible that the dense environment allows a particularly infectious disease to a rapidly spread to new hosts who would otherwise have never become infected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I keep trying to explain this to people: you can't take the number of death and divide by the number of cases, because the majority of cases do not yet have a survive or die outcome.  The only measure that really matters is death/death+recovery, but the problem with that metric, and one of the reasons they say it is hard to gauge until the spread is over, is that there is no good way to tell the number of patients who recover.  If 100% of those infected seek medical care, the number is easy to work out, but it is really hard to determine the number of people who only had mild symptoms or who had no symptoms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find the Italy situation helps people understand the problem here.  Italy spiked from zero cases to several hundred in a very short time not because that many people were infected but because that many people were tested.  Many of the currently infected people in Italy might never have known they had COVID-19 if Italy hadn't started broad spectrum testing for everyone who was sick.  Those people could very well have recovered on their own and we would never have known which would result in a much higher CFR than the virus actually has.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with death/death+recovery is that it completely ignores the fact that for many healthy people this illness could present as what they might even just call a &quot;cold&quot;.</p>
<p>I think people vast underestimate how low this virus can lie, and how many likely undiagnosed cases there are.</p>
<p>If I had to guess, the US has far more infected people than we know, and China is probably riddled with them across the entire country.</p>
<p>Using that metric you're literally only talking about cases severe enough to seek treatment. You can't count recovered people who never sought treatment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that's part of what needs to be studied in this field still. With the numbers that you <em>do</em> have in the middle of an epidemic, which provides the best signals and information.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It varies a lot depending on the patient’s immune system. Normally the infection starts in the throat, and seems to take some time to show symptoms: 2-14 days, although there are some reports that it can be as long as 21 days. In China people are normally quarantined for 14 days. If you’re lucky, the infection stays there, the symptoms are quite mild and you can recover in as little as a week (although you’ll be quarantined for at least 14 and/or until tests show no sign of the virus.</p>
<p>The bad news starts if/when the virus passes down to the lungs via your throat mucus, which results in pneumonia. That can be anything from mild to deadly depending both on the infection and your immune response. too strong a response can be as deadly as not enough and often faster, as your body rushes white blood cells and fluid to your lungs. This can kill you in a couple of days or take a month or more to recover. </p>
<p>There are now a lot of reports that people can become re-infected, and/or that the virus can linger in the body for some time after the patient apparently recovers (particularly found in anal swabs, I believe). This is unusual behavior for a coronavirus, and strange that someone can show mo symptoms yet still have enough of a viral load in their system to infect others. If true, it’s pretty bad news.</p></div>		</li>
