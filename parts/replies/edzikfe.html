			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a curly gurl and as a toddler I had tight ringlets, as a child my hair was poker straight and flat, and when I hit puberty it got really fluffy and frizzy and now in my 20s it's properly curly. A lot of fellow curlies on Youtube and other social media have said that their hair was straight when they were younger and curled out massively later. :) Usually it's a hormone thing, but don't take my word on that!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's so weird - I was very curly haired as a kid but lost a lot of my curl in my early 20s. These days it's just loosely wavy. Its interesting to hear the other people have the opposite experience. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The same thing happened to me. I’ve always had super straight hair but when it came back after chemo it was curly. Now it’s really long again but it’s still wavy. If I cut it short it’d be curly because I wouldn’t have the weight pulling the curls down. </p></div>		</li>
