			<div class="markdown"><p>First of all, I wish you good luck on your first research project. I hope you are successful and enjoy the journey. Bench to bedside is a very long and winding road. the first thing we do is basic research where we discover targets which we think could be interesting and important. Then we do preclinical trials where we target in mouse models. If this is beneficial and we can show in the models that it works, then we try to get a company interested in what we're doing. Usually, at this point, the companies tell us it is too premature and they want us to develop an antibody or an inhibitor and then do all the busywork of proving its efficiency. this is where most things fall. It's almost a different profession. Somewhere in the middle of the discovery and the company making the drug there need to be the step of drug design. There are companies that try to bridge this gap. You not only need to find a target and prove it in preclinical models but also attract pharmaceutical companies with a drug that works. It's a very long road and I recommend finding a mentor to guide you through.</p></div>		</li>
