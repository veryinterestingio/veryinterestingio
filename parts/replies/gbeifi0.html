			<div class="markdown"><p>There's lots of parts in a gas engine that are sliding - piston walls, as you stated, as well as cam shaft followers. The forces on the con rods at both the wrist and the big end are too high for something like roller bearings, so they are sliding bearings as well. All of this needs constant feeding of fresh oil, either keeping the two surfaces apart, or carrying away worn metal and heat.</p>
<p>Electric motors use roller or ball bearings, where the force is transmitted by surfaces rolling past each other without sliding - so you can just pack them with grease and be done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electric motors have orders of magnitude less force involved to boot. Cylinder pressures of around 1000psi acting on a piston of 10-12 square inches of area, vs whatever inertial side loads you have on electric motors. Or gear loads. ~10^4 vs low double digits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd have to disagree.  With most gasoline combustion engines, the amount of oil consumption is rather low.  That's the purpose of the oil scraper ring on the piston.  I have seen engines gone 25,000+ miles without a change.<br />
Secondly, the amount of metal being sent into the oil, unless you have a serious problem is going to be pretty low, after the break in period.  Even then the amount of metal is not going to be as bad as you make it out to be.  The majority of contaminants in the oil is going to be the product of combustion, in carbon and sulfur and other petrolium by-products.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah burnoff is very low but still present. If the scraper ring removed 100% of the oil then by definition it would become unlubricated and grind itself down.</p></div>		</li>
