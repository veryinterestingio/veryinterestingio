			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, I said it wrong! The 1 and 6 faces are bigger. The 1-6 axis is shorter, which is another way of saying that. Thanks! </p></div>		</li>

<p>If it were the pips, then the 1 and 2 side would be heavier, and thus more likely to land face down (meaning that 5's and 6's would be rolled on the dice more frequently).</p>

<p>From the <a href="https://www.dakkadakka.com/wiki/en/That's_How_I_Roll_-_A_Scientific_Analysis_of_Dice" target="_blank">study</a> in /u/lunk's <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/9zvhwl/eli5_how_do_molded_dice_with_depressed_dimples/ead7uhx/" target="_blank">post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Game room logic, a poor source of anything, would dictate that the side with the one is heavier and would therefore be on the bottom more. Unfortunately this is just not true, take popcorn or batholiths as an example. The 6 is too light to stop the momentum of the die, the rounded corners cannot prevent the die from turning due to the weight. In the end 1s are by far the most common result.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Lower numbers rolling more frequently is not entirely logical as the heavier part of the die ends at the top. I submitted my results to a friend in the physics department. On the original outset he also agreed that the results were counterintuitive. But he proceeded to test my theory because the results were overwhelmingly in support of the opposite expectation.</p>
<p>There are 2 major forces that affect the dice as they roll â€” gravity and centrifugal force. Gravity is a constant force and the centrifugal force is generated by the weight of the dice as they are tossed. The two forces work together but one clearly takes precedence over the other. The weight differential of the pips directly affects the centrifugal force more so than gravity. In the end, without going into research, he said that this is probably the route that I should take to determine why the dice do not roll evenly.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cool, thanks! I only looked at the study briefly, but I didn't see the full distribution, only the number of 1s. I wonder if they found the same thing as Labby, that 1s and 6s were both more common? </p></div>		</li>
