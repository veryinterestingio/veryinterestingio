<p>The apple trees we buy are always grafted. The first little piece is kinda a wild apple kind, then they graft the type they want to sell it as. Apparently the ones with the nice fruits are not as good at the ground work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apples don’t breed true. If you take the seeds from an apple and plant them, the apples will probably be terrible. All commercial apples are grafted. Interesting fact: Johnny Appleseed planted apples in America and they weren’t really edible off the tree, so they were made into jellies and ciders. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s true with most fruit trees. All citrus is largely grafted to hardy citrus rootstock. Avocados mostly make inferior fruits unless a graft from a known stock. </p>
<p>And a majority of bananas are just a continuing clone from one plant. </p>
<p>Sometimes it’s to assure the fruit is not inferior from genetic changes like a different pheno appearing.  Other times it’s because you get a stronger varietal rootstock. </p>
<p>And all dwarf trees are dwarfed by grafting them to a smaller varietal rootstock. </p>
<p>Another advantage is if you get a “fruit salad” apple or plum tree, it can help improve fertilization and fruit production. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a post on r/legaladvice about a woman who had an apple tree with like 3 different varieties of apple tree grafted onto it, until the neighbour cut it down. </p>
<p>Turns out Trebble law is expensive, and cutting a grafted apple tree with a rare variety of a Russian apple tree grafted onto it makes it really expensive to pay back, and the LAOP no longer has a neighbour, and the neighbour no longer can afford a home, and probably a car, and probably food. </p></div>		</li>

There being no brandy to drink, they were forced to try some of the local booze, and found they kind of liked it.<br />
And that's kind of sort of how Scotch happened,</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the Japanese Maples in my town are grafted in such a way. Same with cherry trees. The graft is at the very top of the trunk, about 5ft up. Lower down, the branches and leaves are a different colour! It's quite a thing to see.</p></div>		</li>
