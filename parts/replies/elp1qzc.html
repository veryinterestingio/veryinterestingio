Like if you are remembering a time you went to a restaurant in Prague with your sister and you recall it with her and then she says &quot;yea and there was that woman wearing a red dress&quot; then you repack the memory it will now have altered and you will recall it next time with a woman in a red dress, even though there actually wasn't a red dressed woman.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But what you’re saying makes sense too.</p></div>		</li>
