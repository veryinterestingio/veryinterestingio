			<div class="markdown"><p>Penguins are just fine in fresh water but the need to ingest salt so they shove salt pills into the fish they hand feed them to ensure they get their daily dose of salt.</p>
<p>So they need salt, but it doesn't have to to be in the water they swim in.</p>
<p>Penguins of course are semi terrestrial (there's probably a better word for that) but they don't spend their entire lives in water. They just hunt there.</p>
<p>Dolphins however do spend their entire lives in water and their bodies have evolved to be surrounded by salt water from the moment they're born to the moment they die. But I'm sure there are dolphins capable of handling brackish water, sea water, and fresh water like the Amazon river dolphins. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sauropsids and mammals have different adaptions to deal with high salinity: Mammalian kidneys are more efficient at keeping salts and water in proper conditions, thanks to our Henle's loops that allow us to create urine with higher salt concentration (hyperosmotic) than our blood plasma. Birds are also decent at that, but them and reptiles (sauropsids) have their excretion focused on wasting less water by excreting uric acid rather than urea (that's why bird PEE is a white paste; the poo is the dark solids found within that paste).</p>
<p>For marine adaptions, thus, mammals and sauropsids have 2 different approaches: Sauropsids have salt glands, located near their eyes, which pretty much secrete brine. That allows them to outright drink seawater as if it was mineral water.</p>
<p>Cetaceans, meanwhile, have highly efficient kidneys, and use the exact same system as desert mammals: They do not drink, obtaining all their water from food and metabolism, and they urinate small ammounts of very concentrated urine. They live as if they didn't have water to drink.</p>
<p>Fish are the ones that have trouble with fresh and salt water, as they lose salt or water through their gills if placed into water with a different salinity than the one they are adapted for. And sharks just saturate their tissues with urea to prevent gaining or losing ions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Their bodies have adjusted to the salt concentration so that osmosis doesnâ€™t dehydrate them. If you put them in fresh water, they now have more salt in them than the water around them, so they inflate because osmosis brings in more water to their bodies to equalize the amount of salt.</p></div>		</li>
