			<div class="markdown"><p>I had the luxury to read a learnt <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/ffy8av/data_from_sars_outbreak_showed_that_mask_wearing/fk1a4yx/" target="_blank">comment</a> by an Asian netizen half a year ago who raised my scepticism of Western health authorities' and WHO's mask wearing discouragement, over and above the claim that masks work only if worn by healthcare workers.</p>
<p>In light of the above, let me fix your comment for you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the supply of masks changes over time in countries that shifted their manufacturing base elsewhere and that are terrified of DIY and industrial policy, we adapt our acknowledgment of the most effective respiratory virus transmission reduction measure and quietly dismiss unsubstantiated rationalizations and paralogisms.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not justifying the CDC's and other Western health authorities' behaviour. In fact I deem their early attitude criminal.</p>
<p>In the end they hurt their own credibility, and that's even worse than my censure.</p></div>		</li>
