<p>Thank you for the rabbit hole!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For sure! Another fun fact: a well fitting corset should never, ever, give you a tight feeling sensation. Even at high reductions, a corset should never feel like it's tight on your body. That's a (sensible) misconception. The sensation is like a hug, or as I describe it, like a weighted blanked, but it also offers vertical support.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dude it's awesome. I started sewing my own at the start of quarantine cause boredom and I'm very interested in fashion history as a whole. I don't need a lot of support but it's like a little wearable hug. It impacts my ability to move, but just in that you need to squat to pick stuff up rather than bend at the waist.</p>
<p>Also it should never impact your ability to breathe, and if it hurts you're doing it wrong!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you wrap your arms around your body and make your anxiety lessen? I have recently been doing this, pushing myself to reach further, squeeze tighter. Both up high by my shoulder blades and down low near my abdomen. Curious as a fellow Generalized Anxiety sufferer. A good secure feeling hug is hard to come by these days. Gotta hug yourself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe it's the wrong sort of tight fit. I hate tight clothing, but I love well fitted <em>heavy</em> clothing. Like thick cotton. Makes me feel like I'm wearing a suit of armor that dampens the sensory inputs from the outside world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This doesn't work for everyone. Anyone with claustrophobia usually doesn't do too well in a corset. The deep pressure therapy works better for those with social anxiety or generalized anxiety. If you don't do well in fitted clothing (corsets don't produce a &quot;tight&quot; sensation like jeans that are too tight) then a corset might not be right for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love mine, I use a sheet, a light comforter, then the weighted blanket.
Keep in mind that you cant wash them, only spot clean, so you dont want them right against your skin.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider is that even tho it really helped my sleep and anxiety there is a rebound effect, if I travel and sleep in a hotel I have a really hard time because of the weight difference. And its not practical to fly with it.</p></div>		</li>
