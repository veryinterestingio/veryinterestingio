			<div class="markdown"><p>Still is the best material to use for crowns. You can make the crown thinner compared to ceramics because it won't fracture (meaning less tooth is cut away during the crown preparation) and it also wont wear down the opposing tooth like a ceramic crown will due to it being less dense than ceramic.</p>

<p>Why did my dentist discourage me from going with gold for my back tooth and instead insisted on zirconia?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gold was also cheaper than other options at one point, and having gold teeth was considered a sign of poverty because you couldn't afford other materials to replace your teeth. Fast forward to the late 80s and you see rappers making it a fashion statement. Now it is significantly more expensive to do, but it's associated with power and wealth amongst some communities and looked down on by others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>gold teeth in the black community has a pretty interesting history. in the south having a gold tooth for a long time was a symbol of wealth because it showed you could afford to get the tooth replaced. that idea stayed alive thought the time when in other areas it was considered a sign of poverty until it became &quot;a fashion statment.&quot; If it hadn't kept it initial meaning through that time then it wouldn't have turned into fashion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about that.  My grandmother was born in 1892 to an affluent family.  She and all her old blue haired cronies all had one gold tooth in their dentures to show off.  In fact we used to joke about the rappers in the late 80s/90s were turning into old white women with permed hair and gold teeth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mercury itself is fairly harmless, the danger comes when it forms compounds that are soluble in water. Silver amalgam isn't water soluble and doesn't degrade to anything water soluble, so it's fairly harmless.</p>
<p>When you are mixing the mercury with silver or other metals it starts out very pliable, almost like dough, but becomes much harder if you let it cure for a bit. Of course that's great for modeling teeth. Cody's Lab has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZPUcKTeyjo" target="_blank">great video</a> demonstrating the effect with copper amalgam (and of course <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PF7fP106xZU&amp;list=PLKhDkilF5o68Xk8LOxrUCWbbz-hbS6Ttj" target="_blank">a whole playlist</a> of him playing around with mercury).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The mercury is only a small part of the filling.  The main component of an amalgam filling is Silver.  The main exposure part is placing the amalgam and removing the amalgam.  So if there was an issue with it, dentists would all be mad as hatters, mwhahahahahahaahaha</p></div>		</li>
