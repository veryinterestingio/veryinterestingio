<p>I went to UCF to register and parked in a metered lot.  I paid for my space just a little after 12pm (noon).  When I returned to my car, there was a parking ticket.  I went to parking enforcement and they were telling me that it's impossible to get a ticket because the ticket writers are electronic and wouldn't allow a ticket to be issued if the space was paid for.  They tried telling me that I paid for the space at 12pm-midnight and got the ticket at 12am-noon and they weren't going to fall for my tricks.</p>
<p>I made them get the manager.  Then I made them call a fucking professor cause the manger was a fucking idiot as well.  When they finally relented, I told them to switch to 24 hour timestamps because they can't handle the 12 hour ones properly.</p></div>		</li>
