			<div class="markdown"><p>No. That would imply that empty space is somehow creating energy right now. </p>
<p>The CMB was created 14B years bp. When it was created, it was done so at every point in space. Each photon of the CMB that one detects today has been travelling for the last 14B years, until it has finally collided with your detector. Thus we might say that the origin point of the CMB (the bit that we observe) is &quot;the edge of the observable universe.&quot; This means that the CMB we detect is coming from all directions, but not that new radiation is being created at every point in space.</p>
<p>In our example, you would see (through the window of your spaceship) a white light immediately in front of you, to the sides you would have microwaves (i.e, you would see the CMB as normal), and behind you the CMB would be redshifted into extremely low energy radio waves.</p>
<p>If you closed your eyes you would be unable to see the CMB- just as if your spaceship didn't have a window at the front. Unless of course you were going so fast that a significant amount of the CMB was blueshifted into Gamma rays, in which case you would see a bright light, followed by nothing at all, as your retina was burnt out.^(Ask a biologist to confirm that part).</p></div>		</li>
