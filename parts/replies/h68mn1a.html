			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it also has to do with the differences in life spans and the difficulties in having large amounts of offspring in larger animals. It takes an elephant many many years to mature and an elephant may have only 1 or 2 offspring, so a system where grandparents also help raise the kids would probably be evolutionarily advantageous. Rats and rabbits, for example, have tons of children, so losing a few isnt a big deal because their genetic code will still be passed on</p></div>		</li>
