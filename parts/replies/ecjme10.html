			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you still vomit when you have one? </p>
<p>I’ve been told by numerous people (who don’t get migraines) that vomiting helps. But I’m always reluctant to make myself sick because I feel like it would make me feel worse, plus I’ve almost always had my tablets and I don’t want to lose them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love the migraine vomits. Usually I'd never love throwing up, but that feeling of such intense pain coming to a rapid end just because I puked makes me all giddy and feel relatively great. I wonder how much has to do with the serotonin release from the vomiting, especially because that's kind of related to how some migraine meds work. </p></div>		</li>
