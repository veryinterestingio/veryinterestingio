			<div class="markdown"><p>When my dad was young back in the 40s (or so), Stewart-Warner made an auxiliary car heater called the South Wind that mounted on the firewall on the passenger side. It took in gas from the carburetor via an insert that went between the carb and intake manifold. It had another tube that exhausted the combustion gases back to the intake. My dad said the heater put out heat INSTANTLY, which was great on cold Nebraska mornings! The ads claimed that the heater could warm the inside of the car to a comfortable level in 90 seconds. Naturally, these heaters posed a considerable safety hazard and eventually went away, but what a great idea for cold country.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a small radiator (heater core) that provides the heat. Two hoses come off the engine to provide coolant flow to the heater core. So the engine has to heat up the coolant that is flowing through the heater core in order for the heater core to warm up the air that gets blown into the vents by a fan to heat the cabin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your cheaper combustion car robs engine heat from the coolant. Luxury cars now have electric heaters and instant heat (as well as the engine coolant heat). Electric cars have electric heaters as well, and many newer electric cars feature heat pumps which are basically reversible air conditioners so you can rob latent heat from the outside.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I could see vw doing that because that engine took so long to heat up. In that era emissions was a problem during warmup and could see vw leaving the heater control valve closed until the engine fully warms as a way of making that happen faster. Oh that german over engineering and emissions fuckery.</p></div>		</li>
