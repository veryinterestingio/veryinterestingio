			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's safe to say that for the average driver cruise control is best. </p>
<p>My car has an eco cruise as well that feathers the throttle as I would when maintaining speed. It's not afraid to lose a few mph</p>
<p>It's only major failure now is not being able to anticipate road grade</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I agree with the premise that you should spend your money, not your life, I also note that he's not adding in a lot of other long term factors that go along with more aggressive driving:</p>
<ul>
<li>Replace the brakes sooner.  </li>
<li>A speeding ticket can cost you an extra $3000 in insurance premiums over time.  </li>
<li>Increased risk of accidents which can permanently change your quality of life (or you know... end it.)  </li>
</ul>
<p>There is a happy medium to be found. Balance is important.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if I had to buy brand new brakes every year, and the 3k extra for insurance, and assumed risk of accidents (very little risk difference in going 10-over speed limit versus exact speed limit unless snowy weather)... I'd still value time more than money.</p>
<p>5hrs/mo over 30 years is 75 DAYS.</p>
<p>Let's say you need a complete brake job every year (~300 bucks times 30 years = 9 grand) plus the increased insurance (3k). I'd GLADLY pay 12 grand for 75 days of my life back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where do brake pads cost $300 for 4 front and 4 rear?? And I can't imagine ever, ever having to replace them yearly. Even replacing the rotors you wouldn't scratch $200. </p>
<p>Also, AutoZone has lifetime warranties for their pads, just bring em in and tell em your pads are shit and boom, $27 pads for life</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can only imagine the heartburn/stress from intentionally driving like a “dong” purposely everyday for the rest of your career. To save 55 days. </p>
<p>I am sure you are going to loose more then 55 days from the stress. </p>
<p>Live 10-15 minutes early for where ever you are going. You will have extra time within 2-5 miles of your house to circle back and get something you forgot. You will have time to buy gas that you forgot to get your last trip. You will have some time to address minor issues like a dead battery or air in the tires. </p>
<p>Plus you won’t be rushing.  Plus your boss will be impressed that your are always early. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Some insurance companies, Progressive is one, offer devices that monitor your driving habits. Depending on which state you live, flooring it and hard braking with the device attached can actually raise your insurance rates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>10 minutes per day to drive safer and not break the law. Avoid killing yourself or someone else while also not getting pulled over. Time wasted being pulled over, plus cost of tickets and maybe time spent doing defensive  driving. If its not satire its just stupidity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Slower =\= safer. If traffic is moving at 75 (20 over) and you are plodding along at 55 in the left lane (a situation that I often see), you are most definitely less safe and a danger to those around you, even if you are technically “right”.</p></div>		</li>
