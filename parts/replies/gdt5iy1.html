			<div class="markdown"><p>The electronic/magnetic structure (how electrons arrange and orient inside materials) of those compounds is such that they would spontaneously depolarize when the field is taken away. This is governed by the laws of thermodynamics. Changes in state of a system tend to follow the direction that decreases something called its “free energy” (thermodynamic quantity) and these materials can go to a lower free energy state if they depolarize. In this case, the depolarization is spontaneous because there is no energy barrier to do so. Any small deviation towards depolarization lowers the system’s free energy when the magnetic field is gone, which results in a chain reaction that destroys the magnetization.</p></div>		</li>
