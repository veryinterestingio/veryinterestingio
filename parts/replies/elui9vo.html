			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s right.  When closer to the horizon you’re viewing the moon at a shallower angle meaning the light from it travels through much more atmosphere.  This is also why the moon looks larger lower in the sky. The atmosphere bends the moons light so you effectively peer over the horizon and anything near the horizon appears stretched.</p>
<p>Fun fact: when the sun is setting and just barely touches the horizon, that is when it’s fully set already. I.e. the angle from your eye to the top of the sun touches the horizon.  It’s just that the suns light is bent upwards by an amount equal to the diameter of the sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dies the moon <em>really</em> look larger close to the horizon, or is it just an illusion of the brain as it has things to compare it to? I didn't think it ever changed size, apart from when it is closer to us in its elliptical orbit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know for sure, but I would guess yes. This is the same reason the sunset and sunrise are reddish/orange. There’s more atmosphere at that angle to scatter the other colors in the visible range.</p></div>		</li>
