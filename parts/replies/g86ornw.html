<p>You should get a second opinion on this, and get a home monitor and take readings daily to see how it changes (morning is best, take maybe 3 readings 2-5 minutes apart, should be sitting still and relaxed - ideally with the cuff level with your heart), things like needing the toilet can raise your BP. There's also something called White Coat Hypertension where your BP is measured higher than normal in a Doctor's office / Hospital setting - I have this, I don't get nervous or anything when I'm at the doctors but for some reason my BP reads higher than at home (I had to have a BP machine attached for 24 hours and it read every 15 minutes to check my BP at home... I got pretty much 0 sleep that night).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah bro. High blood pressure over a long time causes damage to your blood vessels particularly your eyes and kidneys (end organ damage). </p>
<p>Eating better, exercising, losing weight, avoiding too much salt and getting any other conditions under control will help.</p>
<p>If you take the BP measurement in the pharmacy try to sit down for a few minutes before taking it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>150/90 is too high full stop. Get it checked more thoroughly and start thinking about the following: weight loss, even if you on paper are not heavy. Exercise, even walking. Diet (less meat and more veg) , stress relief of choice , and then medication. At 26 your bp should be 110/70</p></div>		</li>
