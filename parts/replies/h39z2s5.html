			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh no! I didn't mean it like that. When I first read it, I was mad because I wanted a simple answer like &quot;Yes, little birds are descended from Velociraptor and big birds are descended from Utahraptor&quot;. But after I finally started to get it, and I realized that the answer is way more complex, I understand how great your answer is. There is some common ancestor, but its not like a single species that I would call a dinosaur evolved into all modern day birds. The ancestors of living birds had probably already existed, and survived the KT extinction.</p>
<p>Your answer wasn't what I originally wanted, but it really got the the actual core question I had asked and didn't even realize. You went above and beyond in your answer when you could have simply said &quot;Your understanding of evolution is so poor that this question makes no sense&quot;. Thank you for taking the time to answer it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On this note, it's pretty wild to try to imagine all the life that existed, thrived, and then died out without leaving anything behind. Hell, it's entirely possible (albeit seemingly  extremely unlikely) that we're not the first to develop speech or &quot;civilization&quot;. </p>
<p>Assuming there's no reason to doubt that life was as... everywhere as it has been during the age of humans, then there's millions and millions of extinct lifeforms things that we'll just never know about because the conditions to preserve bones or other remains for millions of years required such exacting conditions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find this detail absolutely fascinating. We only know of the fossils we've found because they happened to be preserved (slim chance to begin with), weren't broken up or destroyed over the millennia, and were found in discoverable areas. To think of all the specimens that may have been preserved only to be lost or refolded back into the planet over millions of years is mind boggling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing that can really mess with your brain now that you've gotten into this is looking into the the mess that comes with trying to define a &quot;species&quot;. Lineages makes sense because there's a pretty simple definition - a line of descendency.
When we try to talk about whether two different organisms (of the same species) are actually the same species or not, we end up having to create all kinds of definitions for what a species is, and, as far as I'm concerned, none of them are very satisfactory.</p>
<p>The actual ramifications of species being a completely human term/grouping and not a natural grouping aren't huge (as far as I can tell), but I think it does help evolutionary biology prioritize genes over organisms when necessary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Basically it's impossible to create a phylogenetic group that includes snakes, lizards, and crocodilians which excludes birds. </p>
<p>Birds are more closely related to crocodilians than lizards or snakes are.</p>
<p>Either birds are reptiles or crocodiles aren't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a biologist but would not say that birds are reptiles. I don't see this as a scientific debate, but more an argument about who gets to name things, and whether academic usage (and redefinition) of words should take precedence over common usage. </p>
<p>Monophyly is an important concept for building phylogenies and understanding evolutionary relationships. Birds and reptiles are part of a monophyletic group in that they share a common ancestor. This is very interesting but it does not give academics licence to redefine everyday words. It's perfectly okay to have a term that does not refer to a monophyletic group! </p>
<p>We use plenty of terms in our daily lives that do not refer to monophyletic groups - 'tree', 'shrub' and 'herb', for example. And to take this further, 'fruit', 'vegetable' and a thousand other words have well-understood common usage but are not consistent or logical from a scientific perspective. I think it's fine for 'reptiles' to be treated in a similar way.</p>
<p>EDIT: I can't reply to them all, but there are some good counterarguments in the responses to this. I'd advocate reading them before making up your mind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, I'm a linguist and I actually disagree with this. These kinds of terms should be updated to match our ever growing understanding of the world of science. In this particular case, we don't lose as much as you're implying we do because the term &quot;reptile&quot; is more scientific and less colloquial than it appears. For example...</p>
<p>&quot;If I went for a walk and told my friend &quot;Hey I saw some cool reptiles!&quot; They'd be baffled if Ibhappened to be talking about birds&quot;</p>
<p>This is true but I'd argue, if you were talking about a group of crocodiles, it would still be a weird thing to say. Same applies if you would say, &quot;I saw some cool mammals.&quot; The reason is these terms are not used outside of scientific categorization, even if they categorization can be simplified to a level that school children can participate in. We lose more by not allowing our language to reflect what we know about how the world works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What do you gain by saying that birds aren’t reptiles? You lose a lot of context. I mean, birds and crocodylians are each others closest living relatives, and nobody would argue that crocs are reptiles. We should be thinking about reptiles this way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly! Whenever I see photos of a Brachiosaur equating them to modern birds, I always think, “That CAN’T be right.” The kinds of dinosaurs that evolved from birds were the Raptors, Compys, and other similar creatures and other Theropods (from my understanding).</p></div>		</li>
