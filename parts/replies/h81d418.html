<p>&quot;Hey, are you free? I need to talk to you about something.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure, what is it?&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've found taking the more dire approach is likelier to net results. If I ask my wife an innocuous question like, “So, what would you like to do for dinner?” I'm probably going to get “it doesn't matter.” But a more direct question such as, “listen, we need to talk about our dinner plans” will yield dividends.</p></div>		</li>
