<p>But Chinese people don’t drink much coffee, what’s “affordable” in the US is still expensive in China, and Starbucks’ other items like cakes/desserts are also not popular.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/06/starbucks-ceo-were-going-to-apply-to-the-us-what-we-learned-in-china.html" target="_blank">Starbucks CEO: We're going to apply to the US what we've learned in China</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since Starbucks first launched in China back in 1999, the nation has become the firm's second-largest and fastest growing market.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, it seems Starbucks is doing quite well in China.</p>
<p>China is a hyper competitive market and costumers there aren't blindly loyal to any specific brand. Companies needs constant innovations and new products to stay on top; which Ford isn't doing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I read up top this point, it seems that it takes energy resources to constantly pump out several short-timed products to quickly jump on the next one in the war with specifications and price.</p>
<p>One can look no further than another aspect of over-production/over-storage with some facets of Chinatown areas in some crowded shops of inventory. This is not including cars or coffee either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cultural differences are huge. </p>
<p>For example, in the 90’s Pizza Hut wanted to expand to China. Knowing that the culture difference was a thing, they did extensive research into how to appeal to Chinese audiences, and tailored their menu accordingly. There are now over 1300 Pizza Hut restaurants in China. </p>
<p>Dominos, on the other hand, did not do this. As of 2014, there were 40 Dominos in China</p></div>		</li>
