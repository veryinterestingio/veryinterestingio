			<div class="markdown"><p>A <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2*atan%28%28venus+radius%29%2F%28%28venus+semimajor+axis%29+-+%28mercury+semimajor+axis%29%29%29" target="_blank">quick and dirty calculation</a> suggests that Venus would subtend an angle of about 0.8 arcminutes in the sky of Mercury when they're closest.</p>
<p>Estimates of the angular resolution of the human eye vary, but are generally around 1 arcminute.</p>
<p>So yes, it's likely to appear as a point source.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That image was inaccurate, it was a radar image of Venus's surface with no information about the sky. I have removed it. I don't think you could see stars through Venus's atmosphere, but I'm not sure if it would be &quot;pure black&quot; or have a little haze from the sun on the other size scattering around in it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it should, but it would be pretty close to being resolvable at closest approach, taking up 0.0178 degrees compared to an estimated minimum of 0.02 degrees minimum for the human eye to distinguish something as more than a point. At its largest it would appear around 28 times smaller than the moon appears from Earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might be in full sunlight, but <em>Venus</em> wouldn't be. If you had looked through a telescope, Venus would've looked like it was somewhere between a crescent and a gibbous. The worst part is that the closer Venus is to Earth, the less of it's illuminated face we can see (when Venus is at it's closest,all that is visible is a thin crescent). From Mercury, Venus would appear &quot;full&quot; when it was closest.</p></div>		</li>
