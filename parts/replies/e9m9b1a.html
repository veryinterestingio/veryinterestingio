<p>the universe’s expansion is faster than light and accelerating</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Could you say more on this? Am I right in my understanding that, while nothing can move faster than the speed of light, space between any two points is being &quot;created&quot; (&quot;inserted&quot;?) and thus increasing the distance between them quicker than light can travel? And the expansion of space appears to increasing in rate as you look further out?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Space is not being created... The &quot;same space&quot; is expanding or inflating.</p>
<p>But the net effect in terms of observed distance would be the same as if space were being created or <em>as if the objects in space were moving</em>.</p>
<p>Also, the fabric of the universe is not traveling or moving or expanding faster than the speed of light.</p>
<p>The distance between things is increasing by virtue of the expansion of space.  This produces an <em>apparent</em> movement, but the things <em>in</em> space are not actually moving away from each other - instead space is growing.  Things are not moving <em>through</em> space - space is &quot;carrying&quot; things with it as it expands.</p>
<p>Say we have two dots.</p>
<p>Imagine each dot is a &quot;thing&quot; in space, and the space between, under, and around the dots is space.</p>
<p>Every iteration, every dot moves 1 space away from every other dot.</p>
<p>Say we have two dots:</p>
<pre><code>..</code></pre>
<p>1 iteration  </p>
<pre><code>. .</code></pre>
<p>2 iterations  </p>
<pre><code>.  .</code></pre>
<p>3 iterations  </p>
<pre><code>.   .</code></pre>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>So after 3 iterations, the 2 dots are 3 &quot;spaces&quot; apart.</p>
<p>But that only simulates short distances.<br />
Let's look at 8 dots now to think about long distances:</p>
<pre><code>........</code></pre>
<p>1 iteration  </p>
<pre><code>. . . . . . . .</code></pre>
<p>2 iterations  </p>
<pre><code>.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .</code></pre>
<p>3 iterations  </p>
<pre><code>.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .</code></pre>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>After 3 iterations, the two central dots have still only moved 3 spaces away.  But in the same amount of time, the distance between the two outer dots has increased by 21 spaces.  Therefore, the more distant dots are <em>apparently</em> moving away from each other at a far faster rate than the dots closer together.</p>
<p>Now take that same concept, add billions and trillions upon trillions of more dots and apply it to unfathomable astronomical distances, and you can imagine how two <em>very distant</em> objects would <em>appear</em> to be &quot;moving&quot; apart from each other faster than light could keep up.  </p>
<p>Again, though, it is important to remember that the objects are not actually moving <em>through</em> space faster than the speed of light, just that space is expanding everywhere and at long enough distances the cumulative effect makes them <em>appear</em> to be moving, <em>relative to each other</em> at faster than the speed of light.  But the expansion of space itself, at any single &quot;point&quot; in space, is <em>not faster than the speed of light</em>.</p>
<p>(As a side note, space *did expand faster than the speed of light in the first few seconds after the Big Bang, during a phase known as &quot;.hyperinflation&quot;.  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/9wnkfv/z/e9muogu" target="_blank">The speed of light &quot;speed limit&quot; does not apply to space itself</a>.)</p>
<p>Just to really drive this point home - it's not just the two central dots.  Take <em>any</em> 2 contiguous dots among the 8 above and note they've only moved apart 3 spaces after 3 iterations.  So in terms of things localized to the same area, everything seems to be moving apart slowly.  It's only when we &quot;zoom out&quot; and compare things at opposite extremes that we get an appearance of things moving apart much more quickly.</p>
<p>Also remember that all of this ignores the fact that things <em>do move through space</em>, sometimes at speeds near the speed of light, and for certain particles at the speed of light.  So the <em>apparent</em> movement between objects in space is a <em>combination</em> of both their <em>actual</em> speed <em>through</em> space <em>and</em> the <em>apparent</em> speed of the expansion of space over distance.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But what is a dot, in the sense of a thing that does not expand itself?</p>
<p>For example, lets say two apples are floating in an empty space with same speed, velocity and vector and are 1 meter apart. So in N billions of years the distance between those two apples will increase because of the expanse of the universe. What about the apples themselves, will they also become larger?</p>
<p>If yes, will the distance between atoms expand? Will the atoms themselves expand? What's the tiniest thing that will remain constant?</p>
<p>If no, what's the strength of this force pulling everything apart, so that atomic bonds can counter it? Is this force constant or does it increase/decrease through time?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I don't think &quot;looking further out&quot; has anything to do with the increase in expansion rate. It's just constantly expanding faster and faster everywhere.</p>
<p>Also, as someone else previously said, we don't really &quot;look out&quot;. The telescope just receives light that happens to come from far away. The better the telescope, the better it can distinguish between the different light sources it receives. So the quality of the telescope doesn't really change &quot;how far&quot; it can see, it affects how clearly it can see. If the image is clear enough and has a big enough resolution, we can make out the difference between 2 stars that are billions of light years away. If the telescope is not good enough, it might just appear as 1 star instead of 2 for example. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, can someone get philosophical with me for a second? These cool guys keep saying telescopes don't look out or see, but they way they describe how it works is how our eyes work too (basically), so how is this different? </p>
<p>Is it the mere suggestion that &quot;looking&quot; implies a level of something like sentience, or am I going to far here?</p>
<p>Something is amiss. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that's right. Nothing in space can move faster than light, but space itself can expand such that the distance between objects grows faster than the speed of light.</p>
<p>For every 1,000,000 parsecs, space expands at about 67km per second. Which means that over about 4.6 billion parsecs, or 14.6 billion light years, space expands at the speed of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not correct. The only reason you can't &quot;see&quot; the big bang is because the universe was opaque for the first 380,000 years of its existence. You can see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background" target="_blank">Cosmic microwave background</a>, which is the universe as it existed just 380,000 years after the big bang.</p></div>		</li>
