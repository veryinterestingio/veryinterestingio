			<div class="markdown"><p>I question your last point</p>
<p>Losing weight is a matter of calories in vs calories out. People lose different types/placement of fat and burn muscle at different speeds, I’ll give you that. </p>
<p>While it may appear that the weight loss is more drastic in men based on which fat is lost first, it would occur at the same rate as a woman when all other variables are accounted for on a caloric deficiency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's more nuanced than that. Cico is true, but different kinds of calories are metabolizes differently, and because humans are sexually dimorphic, we burn things differently too.</p>
<p>Given that men and women have vastly different body composition in terms of muscle vs fat, you have to equalize those as well under &quot;all other variables.&quot; 25% body fat looks wayyy different on men and women. Muscle continues to burn calories after exercise, and fat just doesn't.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that women's bodies are designed to keep weight on so that we have enough extra energy to make a period and eventually support growing another human. There are lots of hormones that contribute to this too and you can't really equalize for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your body stores energy in several ways - in your blood, in your liver, in your muscles and in various fat reserves.</p>
<p>It doesn’t draw from them evenly. Sugars in your blood and liver are the “instant, on demand” reserve. Visceral fat is one of the next stops down the line and will be drawn on early when calories in are less than calories out.</p>
<p>Subcutaneous fat is more “long term storage” that your body doesn’t like to draw from - it’ll often try draw from muscles instead, and lower energy use overall. </p>
<p>So getting rid of it takes a longer and more persistent approach.</p></div>		</li>

No way its just calories.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your metabolism slows down as you age. Metabolism is responsible, in part, for the &quot;Calories out&quot; part of &quot;calories in, calories out.&quot; So even if you're eating exactly the same as when you were younger, your body is converting more of those calories to fat rather than expending them.</p>
<p>By the way, in addition to this, it's likely that your diet, appetite, routine, or level of exercise has changed slightly as you've aged and you just haven't noticed such a gradual shift.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’d be cheating thermodynamics if it were anything but calories in vs. calories out. Testosterone levels drop with age so you’ll have less muscle mass which will slightly lower your basal metabolic rate. But it’s more likely that you’ve changed <em>something</em>. Or it’s just that it took you some time to notice. The important thing is to stop gaining weight and preferably start losing it, if you are overweight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cardio, slow and long. There is an optimal fat burning pace for cardio. Try incline treadmill walks, 15 minutes at a brisk pace on like 3.0 incline. Do it everyday you’ll burn that shit right off. </p>
<p>It’s not fast enough to cull any muscle you have, you’ll just burn fat.</p></div>		</li>
