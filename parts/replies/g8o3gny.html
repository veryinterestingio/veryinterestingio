			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve worked shifts for 6 years now. One week early, one mid day and one night. And all sorts of shift’s inbetween. You are absolutely right, the internal clock get’s messed up pretty easily and you will end up feeling tired all the time. </p>
<p>You either sleep for 12hrs, or you sleep for 3-4 and still feel like shit. I also have days where I sleep 4-5hrs, work all day and when I get home I pass tf out, wake up late making it even worse. </p>
<p>Keeping a schedule is very important, because humans are made for habits. Going to sleep at the same time everyday, and waking up the same time is the best indeed but we have so many distractions now that we can easily end up staying up too late, sleeping less and still working the same amount burning ourselves out. It can take a few years, but you can really mess yourself up later in life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to do shifts like that and it was the worst. I got a new job this year and it started out great... but now we're working from home I started imposing my own messed up routine by deciding I'll get up an hour earlier every other day to exercise. </p>
<p>I should probably just commit to getting up an hour earlier every day, but I also love sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to do the same shifts as you, earlies, lates and nights, one week about each. Fucking killed me. You never know whether your coming or going and sleep is all over the place. Going from nights (10pm-6am) to earlies (6am-2pm) was always the worst for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work a set shift plan, after my 8 hours I just leave everything to the next guy. Once a month I work a 12 hour shift, usually free every weekend but it happens that I work a day or two extra. I work 7-15, 15-23 and 23-7 rotating every week.</p>
<p>By distractions I meant TV, phones and computers. I usually play games, and I tend to sit up a bit later than I should have lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have been telling my job for years that making our schedules with a damn metaphorical random number generator is not the way to go, but nooo, everyone has to be available at any time of day, so we're better off not getting used to any regular cycles.</p>
<p>The result? No one gets used to any cycle and everyone hates the morning, as opposed to the times when I used to stop my alarm a minute before it rang, consistently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would sacrifice a goat on a blood moon if it meant I could find a fulltime job that has a consistent schedule and predictable hours. &quot;Flexible&quot; schedules really screw up your health and ability to plan events, especially when there's a 90% chance you'll work any given holiday or weekend.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yeah, I love flexible. Even when I pressed some people above me to explain how flexible schedule benefits me, because they always try to spin it as a plus, it somehow always boils down to &quot;because we can schedule you to work whenever we need more people&quot;....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Waking up at the same time would be important if you can pull it off. Your sleep cycle can adjust easier if you’re constant. But it also depends on when you wake up. If you’re always working night shifts, you might not be able to recover fully until you stop. Our cycles depend on sunlight and we weren’t meant to stay up all night, even if we get the right amount of sleep.</p></div>		</li>
