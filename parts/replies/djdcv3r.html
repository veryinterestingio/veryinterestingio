			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget the world is pretty big and we're fairly small. Hide 50 bright yellow tennis balls into an overgrown grass field the size of a typical yard I bet you find less than half of them without spending hours looking. Now imagine trying to do that with animals specifically evolved to hide in that habitat. </p>
<p>There's a reason hunting is hard. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who hunts and spends a significant amount of time outdoors, I could not agree more with this. Was once out shooting in the desert in the same spot for a few hours. Heard a noise that sounded like a fart and thought to myself wtf was that. Turns out there was a dead cow not more than 10 yards from me. A fucking COW. 6 of us shooting and not one of us noticed </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that a common strategy for animals is to hide when dying or being sick. It makes sense since nothing can save them, and if they're sick or got caught due to being stupid, they're betting off staying away from their herd/flock/friends.</p>
<p>Injured cats for instance are known to hide in bushes and wherever else they can in urban areas, so you won't see them falling down in the middle of the street.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I think that animals simply dying of old age in the wild are rare. Moose for instance have very few predators but wolves will attack old and sick moose. A lot of animals are also more active at night, when we don't walk in the woods, so by morning, there's probably often very little left over.</p>
<p>So in conclusion, I would say it's the combination of hiding to die and being rapidly eaten when dead that makes it so that we don't see many dead animals when going on hikes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say a heavily wooded park probably has a lot to do with it. I live in a big city and I see dead birds (sparrows) on the daily, also a lot of dead cats and squirrels. Depending on the environment, your wood might have a variety of scavengers and decomposers that can get to the body before you get to see it, something that a city lacks. It's a competition for survival out there, so those that depend on corpses usually get to them pretty fast. </p>
<p>It's also important to take into consideration that a lot of animals die by just straight up being eaten by other animals. Not many just kick the bucket of old age or natural causes and leave behind a body. Lots get eaten, or killed by human interference, or a variety of other ways. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live right next to a very large state park and on occasions I see a large animal carcass like a raccoon or deer, it's amazing how quickly the corpse will disappear, birds and other animals pick it apart real quick and then other scavengers dispose of almost everything including bones.  I guess they drag away parts of the skeleton for the bone marrow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What the hell man. I've lived in a big city for more than 20 years and seeing dead birds and cats was never a daily occurrence. Maybe once a month or something. Yes, I did go outside often. So what the hell is going on in your city? </p></div>		</li>

<p>OP taking this passive aggressive comment much better than I would have. I go for a jog every single morning when I wake up. Right through a dense, heavily populated forest, and rarely <em>ever</em> see dead animals. </p>
<p>Maybe death is just drawn to you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, I had the same initial thought as u/NeverTopComment. This is an interesting and valid question that most people probably can relate to. There are tons of birds around my house and my wife and i often walk a trail near us through the woods and countryside. For all the live birds I see, I'd expect to see more dead ones than I do as well. Even just around my house doing yard work. I'm not saying I never see them. I can think of maybe 5 dead birds I've seen in my yard in 5 years. I guess we all should get out more <em>sarcasm</em>   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember watching a show on discovery or something where some researchers watched the entire decay process of a full sized elephant. </p>
<p>It was stripped to the bone in like a weeks time. The sheer amount of maggots was staggering and attracted tons of birds to eat them.</p>
<p>Fascinating too, since all of what the elephant was was redistributed back into the system by birds, maggots turning to Flys, hyenas and lions coming by to scavenge earlier on. </p></div>		</li>
