			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, if you could somehow get two metal surfaces in the shape of a bottle and lid, perfectly flat, you could make a seal. You would need the threads to keep it together, but it would seal if kept together. O-rings just allow for more error in the fabrication of the metal parts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kindof. Yes, they're all metal. But at least one of the metals will be soft and deform to create the seal. It's possible to create a seal with hard metals (or at least without deforming them), but it requires very precise finishes, it's not normally done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can also do this in a vacuum (or at least an oxygen-free environment) by scraping off the oxidized outer layer of the metals, and then simply touching them together, in a process known as cold welding.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Meanwhile, put a highly crushable and deformable rubber 0-ring in between and it will fill in all the uneven gaps in the seal between the two metal fittings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or, if you're going really high pressure or temperature, you can  use something a bit sturdier.</p>
<p>For example, a copper &quot;O-ring&quot; crushed in a stainless fitting.</p></div>		</li>
