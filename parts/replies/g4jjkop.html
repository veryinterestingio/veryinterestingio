			<div class="markdown"><p>From my past week of googling Hepa filters are able to filter out small particles including covid. They are used in ventilators in hospitals and are effective.</p>
<p>However a personal air purifier with Hepa will only filter out a small portion of air, and since homes are not air tight there's still risks. So it seems like a toss up, it def wouldn't hurt, but good purifiers are pricey.</p></div>		</li>
