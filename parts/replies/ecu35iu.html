			<div class="markdown"><p>How complete are these songs? I remember after Prince died there was a mention of his many unreleased tracks. With people popping up to say that many were abandoned tracks that got reworked into other songs. Or just quick blurbs that he thought of and never worked on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>4k songs means tracks that they discarded as well. Like when trying to lay a track back in the day if you fucked up you didnt delete the tape.</p>
<p>So most of these tapes will probably just be that and some of him talking when ever he messed a lyric up and asked to restart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Love the sentiment of your post, but he does not have 4,000 unheard recordings left. In his life he maybe recorded 300-500 songs total, which is still a huge amount (educated-guesstimating). There have been a large amount of leaks over the last 22 years, and so the amount of true unheard songs has likely dwindled to under 50, and these are likely held by a combination of WideAwake or whoever is currently in ownership of 2Pac’s music AND by random parties like Daz, Majesty, Big D, Shock G, Leila Steinberg, Ray Luv, and other artists who ‘Pac worked with (there’s a reason that we haven’t seen an official full length LP in 12 years). Additionally, “Changes” was written and recorded in ‘92 after the L.A. riots, and was intended for the album Troublesome 21, which was eventually scrapped and re-recorded as Strictly 4 My...The title song to that scrapped album, “Troublesome,” is different than the “Troublesome ‘96” song on Greatest Hits, and it ended up on the How to be a Player OST. So you can check it out there to hear a somewhat less heard ‘Pac song.</p></div>		</li>
