			<div class="markdown"><p>It might sound strange that something as big as an oil platform would float but they can be designed like massive boats or giant wine corks. Because oil is less dense than water it can even sometimes be stored in the part of the platform that is submerged. This can have an added benefit of adding ballast to help with stability.</p>
<p>It’s important to remember that these platforms have wells that are connected to the sea floor and pipelines coming to and going away from them. This means that they must be anchored to the sea floor to avoid drifting away and ripping all of those riser out of the well heads and causing a disaster. The size of the chain links are incredibly large. I’m a large dude and they can make me feel small.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well depending on the environment you use different kinds of solutions. You could just have a really deep ballast bringing stability to the rig, then anchors to keep it from moving. Or just have enough anchoring and buoyancy to force the rig to stay in place.   </p>
<p>Because water is quite &quot;hard&quot; if you got a long and big thing under you, moving it takes quite bit of energy. The mass and size of this stabilising thing is measured according to the environment the rig is in. You could use engines to deal with this if you want to, something like Azipod.   </p>
<p>There are many methods to do this, but they all rely on the resistance water has. Because at the end of the day, water is quite hard and heavy. As long as there is enough mass and surface area, the thing takes a lot of energy to move. Then whatever method you use to counter the other forces like impulse from wind, waves and current, is up to you.   </p>
<p>But it isn't like the rig has to be absolutely still, there is some tolerance with the drill system and borehole.</p></div>		</li>
