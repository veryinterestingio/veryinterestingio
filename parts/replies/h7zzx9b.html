			<div class="markdown"><p>I had not considered that wind speed were a factor, so thanks for pointing that out. Also, the relatively lower density of gasses would imply that collisions are less frequent and therefore that vertical disturbance is also less frequent than in liquids. </p>

<p>For the same reasons, gases are miscible in all proportions. In other words, they don't segregate the way that some liquids do (like oil and water).</p>

<p>Why exactly would gasses behave any differently, seeing as they are fluid just like liquids? In a scenario where a concoction of different gaseous molecules are mixed in a fish fish tank with no forces other than gravity, wouldn't it separate eventually, albeit very slowly?'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;In a scenario where a concoction of different gaseous molecules aremixed in a fish fish tank with no forces other than gravity, wouldn't itseparate eventually, albeit very slowly?&quot;  No.  Even if the starting point were oxygen at the bottom and nitrogen on top and there were no convection (no wind), the gases would mix completely.  In theory there would be a tiny excess of oxygen on the bottom due to tiny differences in gravitational force, but I doubt it would be a measurable difference. </p>
<p>The molecules in liquids have substantial intramolecular forces, and this can cause liquids to be immiscible (meaning they separate into layers). Molecules in gases have no intramolecular bonding, so they don't behave like liquids.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>In an ideal gas this would be true, however real gasses differ significantly from the ideal. The intramolecular forces are substantially less in the gas phase than in the liquid phase but they do exist and have measurable effects. </p>
<p>Hereâ€™s a good overview of these interactions:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I could swear I've answered OPs exact question years ago.</p>
<p>There was a paper that did the math behind the statistical thermal/kinetic spread of gases at STP and found that even without convection, there would be a significant overlap at any elevation.</p></div>		</li>
