			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for a very informative answer. In relation to the current pandemic, I sometimes hear that they are testing for antibodies, to test if someone went through the infection. So how does this work if everyone essentially has different antibodies?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't test whether people have a protein of a certain structure, because everyone's antibodies are different. Rather, you include some parts of the virus on the test, and if something in the patient's blood binds to one or more parts, it has to be antibodies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify further, many antibody tests actually use a secondary antibody specific to IgG or IgM, so not only does something bind to the antigen in the test, but the secondary antibody then sticks to that (they often call this a sandwich ELISA for this reason, because the patient antibody is “sandwiched” between the antigen and the secondary antibody), and a fluorescent marker on the secondary ab gives you the positive result. This is how they can differentiate between IgG and IgM, and tell that it’s not just non-specific binding of some other non-antibody protein in the serum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While everyone has different antibodies they all have one in Common they can bind to the Virus. Viruses have &quot;recognition&quot; (Not Sure that is the correct Word in english) proteins with which they would normaly bind to the target cell and infect it. Antibodies have proteins which &quot;fit&quot; onto those recognition Proteins of the Virus making it harmles (they can also bind more than one and mark it for your Immunsystem). This &quot;fit&quot; can be achieved through many many ways and the rest of the antibody can also be vastly different. But If you test for antibodies you search for this fit and it doesnt matter how it is achieved or how the rest of the antibody is structured.</p></div>		</li>
