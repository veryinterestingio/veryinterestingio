			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I used to work as an order filler for a warehouse, which was basically like doing cross fit for 10 hours straight, four days a week. I feel like if I could have cut the time down to maybe like 2-3 hours a day, I would have been in phenomenal shape. But it was just too much. I developed great stamina, but for the most part I seemed to be breaking down muscle faster than I could put it on. And I was eating a lot of calories and a fairly high amount of protein. I ended up getting tennis elbow so badly I could barely bend my arm, and my back started giving me issues so I had to quit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did this for HEB. 8-12 hour days. 5-7 days a week (no exaggerating) went to the gym after work 4 days a week. I ate soooo damn much and have never been more fit in my life. That being said I blew out my knee after a few months and quit soon after.</p>
<p>Those kind of jobs just take too much of a toll.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in film and television and our hours are at least 10-12 hours a day and often more. It can be like manual labor and in the elements. However, my freelance lifestyle allows for time off to recover. I may work three separate gigs back to back over a few weeks with no time off but at the end of that I get 3-5 days. I can also turn down work if I need to but I never do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pulling cable in a crawlspace.</p>
<p>If you're lucky there's conduit between the start and end, so it's just yanking on a very strong string, then pulling the cable itself.  If you're not lucky, you're crawling the length of that crawlspace and tugging a cable with you.  A half pound per foot of cable isn't much, until you're pulling a few hundred feet of it while crawling over/under/through things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, I think of it like this: if I accidentally pull a muscle or fuck up my shoulder while lifting, I can take a break. I can wait until an appropriate time to continue that exercise.</p>
<p>If I fuck up my shoulder while I'm in the middle of a construction or contracting job, what am I going to do? I have to finish, because that's my paycheck. So you work through the pain and maybe it heals slower, maybe it's not as good as it once was, but you keep working. Over time that takes a toll.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm, been doing Landscape construction since I was 11 years old, was out from 18-25, been back in now for 8 years. My shoulders are fucked, right elbow is fucked, wrists are fucked, lower back is fucked, ankles are fucked and I have torn cartilage in my right knee. If I stop deadlifting for a month I can't sit in a chair for 5 minutes without my back wanting to murder me, if I slack on forearm exercises my elbow starts to mutiny etc. I have mobility exercises that I have to do a few times per week just so I can sleep without feeling like there's a knife in my shoulder.</p>
<p>The job has changed the gym from something that I want to do, to something that I have to do in order to live <em>mostly</em> pain-free.</p></div>		</li>
