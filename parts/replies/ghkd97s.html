			<div class="markdown"><p>There are different types of ways to go about it. And it's not always so nefarious - in fact almost every time you have some leak info that's pertinent, chances are they spoke with a reporter off the record.</p>
<p>The off the record agreement is pretty serious though and isn't just a wishy washy thing. Certainly yes, you can't just say off the record and think you're completely safe. But for a reporter to break an agreement of off the record is pretty serious and basically agreeing that you'll never have a source willing to talk to you again. It's the kind of thing that even a hedge on revealing a source's name is a like, straight to the editor complaint that will have the hand of God brought down on you, and likely will have you fired and turned into a pariah as a reporter. So unless it's something like, &quot;off the record, I'm the murderer&quot;, breaking an off the record agreement is a pretty serious offense. </p>
<p>There are other forms too - things like speaking on background, which is a bit more flexible and requires some definition on what you can attribute, but is basically a way for a source to say, let me explain what's going on here but don't quote me. Sometimes that means do not quote me at all but I can confirm that's right. Sometimes that means you can just say an aide or a staffer confirmed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just treat reporters like cops with shorter arms. I dont say anything I wouldnt want repeated or shared, however I’m willing to go a little wild here and there because I know they arent going to arrest me.</p>
<p>The way I see it I would never believe a cop who says “You can tell us, you won’t get in trouble.”  Similarly, if I mentioned the words “off the record” and the journalist nodded, I still wouldn’t say anything I dont want repeated. Whether its attached to me directly or not, someone probably knows who that journalist talked with. I dont expect any journalist to try and ruin my life through dishonesty, that would risk their rep and career. But why take a chance?</p>
<p>And If the cynical view doesn’t convince, I have written research papers referencing interviews. I’ve in that process unconsiously slipped in shared info that came out in the interview but wasn’t written down in my notes. Journalists aren’t infallible either, and even my best friend might slip up when talking to a large audience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They can also use off the record sources to help validate something else. </p>
<p>For example, if an email leaks from the White House that says that there was a meeting say about removing children from their parents as an asylum deterrent. It's unlikely that someone close to that would go on record having knowing about it, but off the record they might be willing to say &quot;yes it's real, it happened&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A reporter I worked with in the past treated it as a tip to investigate something deeper on her own. Like if I told her the mayor's &quot;free gym membership for homeless people&quot; program was just a cover to recruit people for a &quot;bum fights&quot; video franchise that he secretly owned, she's not just gonna run that story with a quote from me. But she is definitely going to start paying close attention to that gym program and yank hard on every loose string she can find.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the right answer not the top one. I worked in DC for far too long. If a journalist ever published something off the record then we'd forever boycott the entire company and they'd essentially be blackballed from other places. It's a social contract and a very binding one since journalists, staffers, and politicians are always trying to climb the ladder. It's so rare to publish something off the record. That's not to say some journalists wouldn't agree to it beforehand, but that's also super rare. Like others have said, off the record is a euphemism for &quot;you didn't hear this from me&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if the person being interviewed randomly says &quot;off the record&quot; and blurts something out right after with no previous agreement of actually going off the record?</p>
<p>I'm not in journalism but everything I've heard backs up what the top comment said about having to pre-agree to go off the record and saying &quot;off the record&quot; randomly in a interview doesn't mean squat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my experience, the off the record card is usually gonna be played after they realize they talked too much. It's all up to the journalist and how valuable he thinks that  OTR info is against the prospect of losing the person in question as a future source (and possibly making a reputation for spilling the beans). Most of the times this happened I could do without it because it's hard to correlate that kind of info in any meaningful way anyway.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not always.</p>
<p>That stunt is what got The Mooch fired ten days before he was to assume his post in the white House. No retrospective declaration of off the record.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The movies just skip the reporter agreeing because of pacing, they want to go straight to the juicy bits.</p>
<p>If you are on the position to go off the record and have more than three brain you’ll wait for confirmation for the very reason that you didn’t say it on the record: giving that info is conditional on it not being connected to you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In another perspective:</p>
<p>A journalist that agrees to &quot;off the record&quot; then includes that content probably isn't going to keep getting interviews with high profile people.  No one wants to let a spiteful/two faced journalist interview them.</p>
<p>There's direct career incentive to keep that agreement.</p>
<p>See also: It's analogous to protection of whistleblowers and other &quot;sources&quot; in that it's going to be better material which makes for more readers/headlines which makes for better career opportunities such as more &quot;anon&quot; sources coming to you which leads to higher and higher positions/pay for the author.</p>
<p>There's a whole arena of Journalistic Ethics to keep in mind as well. - Not that a lot of modern journalists abide by it, hell that should be in quotes as modern &quot;journalists&quot; are often ideologically driven activists themselves that don't have a whole lot of room for ethics at all.  (not that they're all bad, but a great many <em>are</em> ethically bankrupt)</p></div>		</li>
