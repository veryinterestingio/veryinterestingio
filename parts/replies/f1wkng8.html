<p>Not just drugs. Back in the day, overindulging in alcohol was also referred to as &quot;getting high.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A bit of a stretch, connotatively, but denotatively a drug is &quot;a medicine or <strong><em>other substance</em></strong> which has a physiological effect when ingested or otherwise introduced into the body.&quot;</p>
<p>By the strict terms of that definition, chocolate is also a drug.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree in general with your explanation (though many phenomena can be said to fit this type of continuous curve with a max without &quot;high&quot; used this way) but I'm just curious as to why you are the adjective &quot;linear&quot; for &quot;linear graph.&quot; Because that's generally assumed; is there something special about this context?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, there are fifteen graphs I can quickly think of off the top of my head. So to be certain no one was confused and thinking of other graphs or charts, I specified a linear graph. Also, the linear graph in this context shows the duration of your high similarly to a roller coaster.</p></div>		</li>
