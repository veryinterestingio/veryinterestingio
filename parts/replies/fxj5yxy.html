			<div class="markdown"><p>This explanation nails it. When you're sitting at 99 heads and 1 tails, then getting another heads increases the ratio of heads from 99% to 99.01%. but if you get another tails, the ratio of tails increases from 1% to 1.98%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is probably why when I have a 95%* in a class and I get a 100% my grade barely goes up but if I get an 80% it drops a ton</p>
<p>Edit: changed a number to make the example correct</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might want to check the grading then because a 80 and 100 should affect a 90 average in the same amount.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This phenomenon is also why movie/game ratings are so hard to maintain &gt;90% positive. It's the exact same logic as you described, just applied to review systems and removing the random chance elements. Mainly, those ones seen on places like Steam where it's a &quot;Yes or No&quot; not a star-like rating system.</p>
<p>But the math works out the same way, if your game has 99 positive reviews and 1 negative, a 100th positive doesn't mean much, but that second negative hurts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, I'd never heard this explained in terms of pure math like that. My background is in behavioral science so I had always heard it explained in those terms and therefore just assumed it was a behavioral phenomenon. TIL regression to the mean is a math thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Off topic,but how close to reality is Criminal Minds in portraying behavioral science? I'm thinking you might've been asked this question like a million times but I've never met or known someone who has worked in the field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Forensic Psychology isn't my area but if it's like other areas of psychology it is probaby way oversimplified or just wrong in TV and movies.  I suspect this is true for all subjects depicted on TV I just happen to know better when it comes to psychology.</p></div>		</li>
