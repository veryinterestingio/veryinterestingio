<p>They said that a good rule of thumb is that the concentration of gut flora increases by an order of magnitude each organ it passes, such that it's the most concentrated at your large intestine. But it's the same bugs throughout, more or less. There are a &quot;big five&quot; or so by the time you get down to the pooper. That's why when you kill them with antibiotics, you can sometimes get very, very sick from what sets up shop down there (that being said, if you've been given antibiotics, you've probably got more urgent problems than &quot;you might get sick later&quot;).</p>
<p>Messing up your gut flora is a great way to make yourself depressed, since most of the seratonin you get comes from your microbiome. Eat healthful things, people!</p></div>		</li>
