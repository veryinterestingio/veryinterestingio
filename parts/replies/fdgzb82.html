<p>if something is very radioactive, it won't be for very long. (order of weeks at the most).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thorium definitely, that half life is so long that you're getting more rads from the carbon-13 in your own body.</p>
<p>Uranium ore does have enough short-ish half-life U-235 to register so prolonged exposure is not recommended, there's a long term cancer risk.  Depleted U-238 is &quot;safe&quot; to handle (there's no truly safe dose of radiation) and used in munitions and armor plating for its extremely high density.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The exposure risk with ore is not the U-235 content, it's the uranium daughter products (like radon gas). You can handle uranium ore with your bare hands (you know, wash them before you eat something), but you don't want to be around too much of it at once without proper ventilation of the gases. </p>
<p>Uranium is a heavy metal and has toxicity associated with that which is separate from its radioactivity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember hearing and Reading about depleted Uranium on my Tour to Iraq, they told us to stay as far away from tank and vehicle wrecks as possible, because they were VERY radioactive.
So they possible told us that just to keep the stupid grunts away from any possible radiation threat, because they knew we would climb all over those wrecks and taking home parts? Oh my god lol.</p></div>		</li>
