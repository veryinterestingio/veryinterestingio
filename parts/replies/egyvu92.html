			<div class="markdown"><p>It's almost scary how they can keep track of others. Crows even keep track of whether another crow has seen it hide something. It will wait until that other crow goes away and rehide the item.</p>
<p>They're way smarter than most people would guess, even demonstrating mental problem solving where they can think a step or two ahead to find a solution without trial and error. Two examples are pulling down on a string hanging over a fence to lift the other end up. Then food hanging from the other end is within reach. Another is dropping nuts on the roadway so cars will crack them open.</p>
<p>Corvids (includes crows and ravens) seem only one intellectual &quot;feature&quot; away from being the second intelligent species on the planet. Maybe language, or passing down knowledge to their young. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's so interesting to watch them solve problems, there's something alien about their intelligence. Like you said, they don't seem to muck around with trial and error like a human would, testing things and gathering information. They seem to grasp the complete solution all at once, and then act very deliberately and confidently. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course, as a social species. Corvids like jackdaws (yes, yes, obvious Unidan joke is obvious) especially live in large flocks where every member knows its place in the social hierarchy and that of others.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In his book King Solomon's Ring, Konrad Lorenz described and analysed the complex social interactions in a western jackdaw flock that lived around his house in Altenberg, Austria. He ringed them for identification and caged them in the winter to prevent their annual migration. He found that the birds have a linear hierarchical group structure, with higher-ranked individuals dominating lower-ranked birds, and pair-bonded birds sharing the same rank.[62] Young males establish their individual status before pairing with females. Upon pairing, the female assumes the same social position as her partner. Unmated females are the lowest members in the pecking order, and are the last to have access to food and shelter.[62] Lorenz noted one case in which a male, absent during the dominance struggles and pair bondings, returned to the flock, became the dominant male, and chose one of two unpaired females for a mate. This female immediately assumed a dominant position in the social hierarchy and demonstrated this by pecking others. According to Lorenz, the most significant factor in social behaviour was the immediate and intuitive grasp of the new hierarchy by each of the western jackdaws in the flock.[62]

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cats are an interesting example of this. I feel like I have a great imitation &quot;meow&quot; that sounds to my ears completely authentic. But neither my cats nor any others particularly respond to it in any way other than they would to my normal speaking voice. But put any video with a cat meowing on and they immediately go into high alert, looking for this strange cat. Even if it is a cat making unusual sounds (the &quot;oh long Johnson&quot; cat for example -- sounds nothing like a normal cat to my ears but my cats immediately shift into &quot;strange cat warning&quot; mode).</p>
<p>I've wondered if there are some frequencies or tones that we as humans just don't register that alerts them to real vs fake cat sounds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If they're playing back a video, it's likely the audio is sampled at 44.1 Khz and therefore can only reproduce sounds close to the human hearing range. Most common speakers would compress that range on top of that too.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As a side note, my cat's tail starts vibrating when I whistle, and the cat starts looking for the source of the noise. I think she thinks there's a bird in my mouth or something.</p>
<p>If I growl, my cat's ears go backward in alert mode.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is where I doubted the comment too. I have three dogs. Not only can I tell their voices apart, even at a park full of dogs, but I can hear which one is walking around  on hardwood floors when I can't see them (a bit of a cheat because one is tri-pawed), and which one is wagging it's tail by the sound of it hitting things around it. </p>
<p>I can tell which one farted, and they all eat the same food. I can tell which one puked, chewed something up, etc. I even know which one has been snoozing somewhere by smell. </p>
<p>Maybe this is unique to human-dog companionship, but I know those asssholes better than I know my SO.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also, dogs and people have lived with each other forever. We have evolved to suit that relationship just as they have evolved to suit us.</p></div>		</li>
