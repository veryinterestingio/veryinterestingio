			<div class="markdown"><p>Good sleep is so very underrated.. er, maybe not underrated, but not taken seriously by most.</p>
<p>We've all done what you said you do (stay up until 1, 2, 3am) to do whatever. I did it because it was peace and quiet.</p>
<p>Once upon a time I cleaned up my act (long story) and ended up in bed by ~9:30pm every night. Out like a light. Took a while to get to this point. I'd thwn wake up at ~4am and, no word of a lie, jump out of bed with all the energy in the world. Gave me ~5 hours to myself before work to which I'd do the things I would have done earlier (1 or 2 am), but now I'm completely rested. Plus, I really enjoy watching the sunrise with a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>A proper sleep is the best drug I've ever experienced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ahh I want to get to that stage so bad. I struggle with distractions so my productive hours tend to be after 10pm, but that's always at the end of the day. If I could wake up, energised before everyone else that would be great.  </p>
<p>How did you get to that stage?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Luckily biology is all about balance and greys not black and white.  But regardless you are certainly not doing yourself a favour by wracking a regular sleep cycle.  Don't underestimate its influence- think on it if you ever get the feeling of underachieving in life...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking of hormones, important ones ,such as testosterone, are made during sleep. Your daily dose of natural steroids helps with healing. This is why most weight lifters are advocates for getting proper sleep.</p></div>		</li>
