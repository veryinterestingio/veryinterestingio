<p>They've made 3 fucking feature movies about a cardboard cutout of a man shooting things for an hour and half.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They still managed to fit something like a plot in the first movie, and to a lesser extent the second.  The third movie was basically what you described.  A bunch of action setpieces and no real character development.</p>
<p>I bring up the first movie because it had a clear plot and a clear direction of what it wanted to do, something I can't really say about the others -- especially the third installment.  It was pretty to watch, but there was no substance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw the third as the conflict between <em>John</em> and <strong>John Wick, the man you send to kill Baba Yaga</strong>. He wants out but keeps being pulled back in. The Adjudicator was an exceptional character and they elaborated more of the universe rather than Wick. We know Wick, what makes him tick and how his gunplay is slick. The movie also builds upon the medallion system from movie 2, adds the Elder, redemption system within the ranks... I really like the Wick-verse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like John Wick's writing, to the extent that I find the lore and worldbuilding of this hidden sub-culture of assassins working out of plain sight fascinating. But in an overall sense, you go see John Wick for the spectacle, not the deep characterization. </p>
<p>I mean, you have the project-yourself-onto-them Hero, the Lady with Attack Dogs, and the Pigeon Man fighting against a crime syndicate that goes all the way up to a mysterious Arabian Shah hidden in a magical desert. It's a Saturday Morning Cartoon. It is what it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ever notice how there is no dialogue or character development in any of the League trailers?<br />
I am all for a League movie but I'm afraid it would be a huge let down.</p>
<p>The scenes are short and fast cut to hype music, it's a lot harder to make a full movie out of it.</p></div>		</li>
