			<div class="markdown"><p>good point, just to add to it those kind of incitive to polute less is all good and fine in principle but when you the know the vast majority of polution is made by shipping and industry and the vast majority of it is outside of western countries it's pretty ridiculous, they better take regulations againts the real source of pollution (but educating ppl is good aswell, they just need to do both).</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>To be fair the shipping pollution and much of the manufacturing pollution in other places is created to supply those western countries with all the consumer good they buy. So even that pollution is really caused by those of us in western countries. Important to remember that there is no way the current population of the planet can live at western country levels of consumption and their still be a healthy planet. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very true although the localised air pollution in cities, especially those without any major industry, is all car exhaust and building works. The city I live in the air is terrible in the winter mornings with all the cars churning out fumes my throat is actually dry compared to the same walk in my last city with little in centre traffic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What two cities? I live outside of Chicago and some days going into the city you can see a brown hazy bubble over the city, but I always attributed it to factories and industrial buildings. The traffic going into Chicago in rush hour is a nightmare, but you don't see the haze where the cars are. Just around the city.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course a cold engine is less efficient but mostly the extra emissions comes from the fact that the car is running in open loop. Also due to fact he catalyst is not lit off. When it's cold outside, the car is usually in dew point waiting mode to avoid cracking the hot o2 sensor element by thermal shock with water. When the car warms up, you no longer have liquid water and so the o2 sensor can now be fully heated and car can go into closed loop operation.</p>
<p>Modern cars, anyway. Really old cars with unheated o2 sensors could only warm up with hot exhaust gas so those took forever. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why Bosch uses double injection in their ME series ECUs for catalyst heating. Heating the catalyst as quickly as possible reduces initial emissions greatly. Also leads to some ungodly sounds with a modified exhaust/catless down pipes. </p></div>		</li>
