			<div class="markdown"><p>If it helps at all, when whales die their corpses sink to the ocean floor where they become nutritious oases for deep sea creatures for several months. To the best of my understanding, hippos are morphologically similar. So the hippo might not have made it, but it likely brought life to many other creatures.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except on the rare occasion when they wash up on the beach in a coastal village in Newfoundland. Then you've got to figure out what to do with 20,000 pounds of dead blue whale right outside your house: <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/dead-blue-whale-gets-second-life-at-the-rom-1.4004547" target="_blank">https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/dead-blue-whale-gets-second-life-at-the-rom-1.4004547</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Most mammals are naturally buoyant, but <strong>hippos</strong> have especially dense bones to help them stay on the bottom. <strong>Seawater</strong> is about 2.5 per cent denser than fresh <strong>water</strong>, but the extra buoyancy this provides isn't enough to offset the weight of a <strong>hippo</strong>, and it will still sink in the <strong>sea</strong>. &quot;  </p>
