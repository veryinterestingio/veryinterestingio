			<div class="markdown"><p>An ex of mine who once worked as a tour guide at a cathedral explained that prior to the Second World War there were only a few companies who could produce a vibrant blue glass, and all of them were German. </p>
<p>During/after the war someone essentially stole the information required to copy their process, which is why stained glass installed in the late 40’s and into the 50’s made use of so much blue. For a lot of the companies doing windows it was a new and novel colour to use.</p></div>		</li>
