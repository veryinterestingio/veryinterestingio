			<div class="markdown"><p>Same. I even thought I could fix it because if you lay down on the opposite side as the blocked nostril, it will slowly become unblocked and you can breathe through both nostrils. </p>
<p>But it’s only momentarily because if you continue to lay there, the other nostril will become blocked. </p>
<p>So whatever that is blocking the nostril seems to be affected by gravity.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It’s hypothesized that this inconvenience cause you to alternate sides when laying on your side to reduce pressure ulcer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The human brain is great at ignoring repeated sensations. Like the sensation of the nasal cycle. Or the fact that your nose obscures part of your vision.</p>
<p>But... When those sensations are called out, say, by reading a reddit post about it, the mind notices it again for a short while before fading into inattention again.</p>
<p>In other words if you notice your nasal cycle from time to time it's probably not something to worry about unless you are suffering other symptoms (pain, difficulty breathing, etc.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To follow up on this. (From the wiki article)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Turbinates consist of bony projections covered by erectile tissue, much like the tissues of the penis and clitoris. The turbinates in one fossa fill up with blood while the opposite turbinates decongest by shunting blood away. This cycle, which is controlled by the autonomic nervous system, has a mean duration of two and a half hours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>TIL we have penis tissue in our noses. </p>
<p>Also...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some[who?] postulate that this alternating positional obstruction has the purpose of causing a person to turn from one side to the other while sleeping in order to prevent bedsores. Others note that the asymmetric airflow may have some benefit to overall olfactory sensitivity.[6] The nasal cycle is an alternation in both time and between left and right sides, with the total resistance in the nose remaining constant.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think Vsauce might have been the one to show how your nose purposefully clogs one side in order to make air pass through it slower than the other side. This provides a difference in olfactory sensing between the two sides and supposedly enhances your sense of smell. Its similar to why we have two eyes, they provide slightly different reference points to give us depth and enhance clarity.</p></div>		</li>
