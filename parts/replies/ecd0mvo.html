			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun facts!</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The guy who created the febreze chemical used to smoke heavily. He didn't think it was anything special until he came home one night and his wife thought he had given up smoking because the chemical he had been working with neutralised the smell so well. </p>
</li>
<li>During market research one woman who worked with skunks said it changed her life as she should finally date and have people over to her house again. </li>
</ol>
<p>Edit:  the guy discovered the use for the chemical and didn't create it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Despite fact #2, Febreeze was almost a massive failure.  Even though it worked magic, it was barely selling because people get used to their homes smells and forget their house may be foul smelling to others.</p>
<p>It wasn't until they marketed it as a rewarding fresh scent you use to top off your cleaning routine that people started actively using it.  It's the cleaning equivalent of that 'minty fresh &amp; clean' feeling you get after brushing your teeth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another fun fact- there’s a book called The Power of Habit that talks extensively about the creation/marketing of febreeze! It’s super interesting. The same book talks about how a marketing guy working on a toothpaste campaign essentially to American dental hygiene from non existent to a booming industry. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting fact: a cyclodextrin called suggamadex is a drug we use to bind and reverse a particular paralyzing agent (rocuronium) by injecting it.</p>
<p>There is evidence though that repeated exposure can cause anaphylactic reactions in susceptible individuals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the time - however they can possibly increase your chances of having an allergic reaction under anaesthesia. Sugammadex is a cyclodextrin used in anaesthesia to reverse muscle paralysis (by trapping the drug which causes paralysis in a similar way to how they trap odour molecules). </p>
<p>Sometimes a patient can have an allergic reaction to Sugammadex, even if they've never been exposed, and it's thought one mode of prior exposure is these sprays! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aside from the chemistry:</p>
<p>Are the cyclodextrins sprayed straight out of the bottle, or are they dissolved in something? Do they hit the &quot;smell molecules&quot; mid-flight? (Do sprayed things tend to waft around the room and hit everything? Do they get attracted to smelly things/vice versa? Do they eventually settle on surfaces?)</p>
<p>As another commenter kinda asked, can they go up your nose, sit in your mucus and stop you from smelling anything?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as your last question, your upper airway  produces a lot of mucus that gets cleared pretty regularly. It's actually mostly lined by a cell layer called <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_epithelium" target="_blank">ciliated epithelium</a>. Cilia are these little tentacle like things that sit on the top of these cells and constantly beat in a wave-like motion, slowly moving the mucus that sits on top of them. In the nose, this helps to clear mucous away from your olfactory cells, preventing the molecules from sticking around. </p>
<p>Edit: a word </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I would imagine they are dissolved in some kind of small droplet at first. You can see this as you spray the Febreeze. Eventually though the droplets probably disperse to the point where the molecules are just floating around. No, they don't go straight to the smell, they just float around until they collide with something that fits inside them. They can totally go up your nose but remember that they can really only collect one particle so they're effectively useless after that. It wouldn't affect your smell anymore than if they caught a particle in the air like they're supposed to.</p></div>		</li>
