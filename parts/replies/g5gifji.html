<p>Reminds me of what happened with dating when humans moved to North America. You basically had to have an entire old guard die before evidence would be accepted that humans in NA predated Clovis. You had evidence of pre-Clovis people in Florida and other locations just discarded entirely because the scientific establishment was certain of this fact and to admit the possibility that they were wrong would ruin a lot of careers this particular field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a historian of science, I will say, there is not a lot of evidence that resistance to new assumptions is because it would &quot;ruin a lot of careers&quot; (the people whose careers were well-established probably could not have them &quot;ruined&quot; by new data, either intellectually or practically), but more because once you are dug into a particular view of the world, and have spent a lifetime working on it, it is very hard, psychologically, to get outside of it. This is not unique to any particular form of science or even science itself; it is why generational change is often necessary on core questions. </p>
<p>As Max Planck, the physicist and quantum pioneer, put it: &quot;A new scientific truth does not generally triumph by persuading its opponents and getting them to admit their errors, but rather by its opponents gradually dying out and giving way to a new generation that is raised on it. … An important scientific innovation rarely makes its way by gradually winning over and converting its opponents: it rarely happens that Saul becomes Paul. What does happen is that its opponents gradually die out, and that the growing generation is familiarized with the ideas from the beginning: another instance of the fact that the future lies with the youth.&quot;</p>
<p>Of course, the institutional hierarchies of science are essentially gerontocracies (for a variety of reasons), like a lot of human cultures. You can see that as an essentially conservative setup, and there are ways to justify it (sciences that do not establish firm &quot;foundational beliefs&quot; tend not to make much &quot;progress,&quot; because the real everyday progress of science is not in revolutionary discoveries but incremental ones), but it can lead to very slow changes by the scale of individual human lives.</p>
<p>This is essentially the thesis of Thomas Kuhn's <em>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</em> (1962), which, despite its title and reputation, is really about how conservative the social and psychological structures of science are, and why that actually is why they are successful (again, the fields that change rapidly are the ones we typically think of as not being built on much).</p>
<p>(I am not weighing in on this <em>particular</em> scientific controversy, as I know nothing deep about it.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TL:DR -- The type of person to form these views, is the same type of person who has hard time letting them go.</p>
<p>Complete speculation, but perhaps in1955 extreme confidence in your theory was rewarded due to less overall information (and inherent racial bias in this particular case). Quite possible this culture cultivated a kind of &quot;stubborn&quot; worldview in its participants. Could be off base , but modern practice is more quorum based, significantly more informed and open to focusing on what they don't know, which comes in conflict with dogma inherently (Kuhn also talks about this in <em>Structure</em>)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hello. Although I'm not OP, I thought your explanation was really clear and interesting. I had a question about U-Th-dating: what does it mean for the relative order of the determined ages of various layers to be correct? I'm asking because if it means what I think it means, then I'm not clear on how that makes the absolute ages reliable. </p>
<p>I'm imagining there are layers with the younger ones on top of older ones. We could have dating results that give relative ages like &quot;this layer is 1000 years older than the one right above it.&quot; Is this what you meant by relative order?</p>
<p>If that's right, then how does having a correct relative order give us a reliable absolute age? Do the layers go up and up until we're near enough to the present day (or some other time we can use as reference)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your question. Sorry, I was a bit in a hurry to write this, I could probably have been more clear. </p>
<p>Essentially, U-Th-dating is based on Uranium that's washed out of the soil and deposited inside the mineralisation. Only Uranium is water-soluble, Thorium isn't. So the starting concentration of Uranium can be assumed to be 100%. However, this is only true if the sample hadn't its balanced disturbed later on. Such a disturbance would <em>notably</em> shift the date determined.</p>
<p>Say, for example, you probe five layers. They give ages of 5000, 7500, 10'000, 11'000 and 15'000 years. Could it be that <em>all</em> those layers are actually three thousand years younger? Yes, but it's <em>very</em> unlikely that contamination affected <em>all</em> layers equally and preserved their relative order. </p>
<p>What you're likely to see in case of contamination is something like 5000 years, 7'500, 1'500, 11'000 and 8'500, which is obviously complete nonsense. In that case, it would be valid to not only question the third and fifth date but all five.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes, but we usually don't have that luxury in the case of cave paintings because that's mostly the case for stalagmites, and they grown on the floor, not on walls.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your assertation is essentially correct. The relative order, with small error, does say that piece 'x' is an amount older than 'y' and so on.
So say if we know around when the Hall of Bulls from Lascaux was made, and we see certain patterns in its construction - materials to make paints, in example - and we can date piece 'y' to that. This means that 'x' would have to be a set amount older.
At least that's how the applied science works</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're talking about a different idea. This principle of &quot;linked&quot; chronologies works reasonably well in historic times. Say we have an absolute dating in Egypt, thanks to a list of pharaos, and can absolutely date a piece of pottery. Then we discover a similar piece in Greece and conclude it must have roughly the same age. </p>
<p>For cave paintings in particular, this is not a necessarily invalid but potentially dangerous method. From what we can tell, development of techniques in paintings doesn't seem to be happening linearily towards increased complexity. Also, various stages of paintings may differ many millenia in age but can be similar in appearance becasue they follow previous images.</p></div>		</li>
