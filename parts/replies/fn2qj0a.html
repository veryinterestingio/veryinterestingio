			<div class="markdown"><p>It's been observed that humans have been sleeping in a biphasic pattern, and even having schedules for wake/sleep different than what post-industrial society tells us to do. Many theories arise that try to explain it, for example it's a time for watching or absorbing the dreams you just woke up from. </p>
<p>Fact is, sleep is a very complicated area of study and we still don't have a one for all answer for why we can't sleep or wake up. We know for certain that every person is different and that sleep needs to be taken in account with all other factors in life, like past experience, biology, whether there are people next to you when you sleep, and more. </p>
<p>I suggest next time it happens to you not to worry about why you are up, and know that you will sleep soon and it's just normal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's something that keeps getting asserted, but nobody seems to want to support the claim with evidence. </p>
<p>Worse, most of the people in this thread are giving wildly different interpretations of (and names for) this two-part sleep pattern.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My bf sleeps in a couple chunks rather than for one extended period. And now that we’re quarantined, it’s been exacerbated. He comes to bed around 6am and sleeps for maybe 5-6 hours, which will be his longest period of sleep. So he gets up around 11-noon and gets his day started. Then takes a nap in the evening for 2-3 hours, gets back up and will be awake all night until 6am again. Some days his bigger chunk of sleep will only be about 4 hours, and then he’ll take a late morning nap of about 2 hours, and a second even later nap around 9pm of another 2 hours.  </p>
<p>Before quarantine, he had a pretty solid schedule of sleeping 6 hours per night, going to work, coming home around 3pm and promptly taking a 2-3 hour nap.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans are hardwired for biphasic sleep (two distinct sleep periods), but that’s actually one major sleep period at night (7-8 hrs avg) and then a second smaller sleep (or nap period) in the mid afternoon around 2pm. Obviously if you have a sleeping disorder that disturbs the larger night block you may experience segments during that but that isn’t sleep functioning properly. </p>
<p>A lot of our sleep patterns these days are shaped by society and not what our bodies actually are hardwired for / need.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, it seems to be geographically dependent.  Probably relates to seasonal variation in daylight hours.</p>
<p>What you describe appears to have been the norm in tropical and equatorial regions, but in more northern areas, segmented nighttime sleep appears to have been the norm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Edit: My mistake, it definitely can be dependant on geographic location. But that is more whether or not the people will have a sleep in the mid afternoon. From what I have seen people in colder climates are more likely to have a monophasic sleep cycle where they will just sleep for a solid block. And warmer climates will lean more toward biphasic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading the natural biphasic sleep pattern is you wake up in the middle of the night for 1-2 hours and then go back to sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mistake, miscommunication. I’m not referring to NREM and REM phases of sleep, but to the two time periods that people sleep for. Ie go to sleep at night for 7-8hrs and receive multiple phases of NREM and REM sleep, and then a second smaller period where depending on the length of time the phases they experience change. </p>
<p>I can go find the references to the studies if you wish, but as I’m about to hop into bed it’ll have to be tomorrow I post them.</p></div>		</li>
