			<div class="markdown"><p>You realize most semi auto rifles use rotating locking bolts right. And like 99 percent of precision semi rifles do. The action isn't moving back immediately after firing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it a fact that the gases that escape through the port in the barrel which ultimately move the piston and/or bolt carrier do so before the bullet leaves the barrel? </p>
<p>And if this was the case, and it did indeed cause a decrease in accuracy, wouldn't the simple and obvious fix be to move the gas port forward, towards the muzzle, and/or increase the distance between the port and the piston so as to maximize the time it takes for those gases to move any mass giving the bullet more time to escape the barrel and thus not be affected by the movement of that mass?</p>
<p>If the bolt, piston or any part of the locking system remains unmoved until after the bullet leaves the barrel, then there is no way that such a system could be inherently less accurate than a manually operated one, all other things being equal, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is that there has to be pressure for the gases to move the bolt carrier or the piston. Once the bullet is out its like popping the cork on a bottle all the pressure will exit by the path of lease resistance which would be the end of the barrel instead of by they way that would require it to move something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When do you think the bullet leaves the barrel on a semi auto precision rifle like a MK11? After the bolt starts unlocking?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theotetically. Yes but this would also result in a slower rate of fire as it takes longer for another round to rechamber.</p>
<p>So theres give/take everywhere.</p></div>		</li>
