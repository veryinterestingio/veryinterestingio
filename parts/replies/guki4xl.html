			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m the odd man out, then. </p>
<p>If I wake up before the alarm, and I can’t see the clock, I stress myself fully awake thinking about what time it <strong>might</strong> be and how much time I <strong>might</strong> have left. </p>
<p>If I can see the clock, even if I’ve only got 15 minutes left, I can settle down and get back to sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been able to do this too but if it's 2-3 hours before I need to wake, I contemplate whether I should just get up. Thus keeping myself up. Now I close my eyes and pretend it's 1am.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, is this why, whenever I set an alarm for waking up early, I ALWAYS wake up right before it goes off? As in, several times I opened my eyes, turned to look at my phone and at that moment the alarm began to sound?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some people use the trick of nodding their head on the pillow before they go to sleep. 1 nod for every hour.</p>
<p>But really you can do it simply by checking the time before you go to sleep and thinking to yourself a few times: the time is now x I need to wake up at y, the time is now x I need to wake up at y.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't needed an alarm clock in like over a decade, I always wake up when I need to. It's not a waking up at consistent time thing by training myself either. Like if I had a flight and needed to be up in 3 hrs for it, I will wake up at least 10 mins before. I can take a nap or even a full sleep and just say to myself &quot;Okay I need to be up in x amount of time&quot; and wake up without fail. If I fell asleep in class and the teacher asked me a question or to start reading I'd somehow be pretty aware of what was happening even though I was slump. </p>
<p>Idk why I can do this, it's really strange and I honestly have had terrible sleeping patterns my entire life and a super light sleeper so maybe that's why. It's my weird mundane super power lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a heavy sleeper, and I can do this, but only when I've had fairly good sleep hygiene for a while. Like if I go to bed at midnight every night and wake up at 8am, one night I can tell myself &quot;okay, have to wake up at 4am for a flight&quot; and it'll happen. I don't leave it to chance, though, there's always a backup alarm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. If it's just everyday sleeping patterns, it will sway wildly (and actually the main reason I do use an alarm, since my internal rhythm tends to desync with 24h over time, for just mundane things), but if it comes to catching a morning flight, or meeting someone in the morning, I'll do the same thing where I'll wake up before my &quot;safety alarm&quot; goes off. I feel like it's just that my brain will recalibrate because it's an important, non-routine thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting to see there's quite a bit of people who do the same thing! People are always amazed that I can do this since most people struggle with snoozing their alarm and I can't even fathom sleeping til an alarm. The human body is a crazy thing.</p></div>		</li>
