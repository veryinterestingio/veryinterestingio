			<div class="markdown"><p>This is funny to think about technically. I would guess that he'd breach a portion of the hull and that a compartment of the ship would be flooded but that our fast acting submariners would seal the rest of the boat and protect the crew. The blunt force, while causing vicinity damage, would spread out over the rest of the structure pretty quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While plausible to seal some smaller beaches in our hull, we would not be able to seal that size quickly enough. And any of the compartments on the SSBN's full of water, would probably result in the loss of the entire submarine. With maybe the exception of the forward compartment. </p>
<p>Engine room, you lose all power, steam, and propulsion. Much against many people's thoughts, you can keep a heavy boat at a certain depth with speed.</p>
<p>Missile compartment is freaking huge. Also, O2 makers are there, so after some time submerged, you'd suffocate. </p>
<p>Forward compartment... Gallery, cheifs, officers, control... It would hurt, but the engine room has the capability to manually steer the ship, and adjust the rear planes, which overpower the front ones... It's also the smallest IIRC.</p>
<p>Really, at any point it's iffy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's say that instead of steel, that ring were made of a titanium alloy - something known to become more hard and brittle the more you work it. Would that ring be more susceptible to cracking and breaking? The Soviet Submarine Force circa the mid 1980's would love to know!

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically any alloy will work harden to different degrees (even mild steel). I believe Ti is less ductile to begin with though, so it's probably more severe. You also get temperature effects which aren't insignificant though (see the liberty ship ductile-to-brittle transition problems).</p>
<p>As a side note, using titanium for a hull seems <em>enormously</em> expensive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Soviets had essentially all the titanium supply in the world at the time, it may have been to show off as much as for any practical reason. Current prices for raw titanium are about 20x that of steel, depending on... things. So it's expensive but feasible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about asymmetric loading? I haven't seen the movie, but if Aquaman pushed so that it was pushed sideways, that's not a loading it would typically take. Also, (what is effectively) a point load in a specific location that wasn't meant to distribute that load would also be problematic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In all honesty, I couldn't answer the question. I'm sure the Navy has done Finite Element Modeling to determine the ability of the hull to be hit by a blunt object (rock, pier, another boat, etc.) That's pretty technical stuff. The Navy would have to make a judgement regarding the likelihood of an object striking the hull and the cost/ability for them to design against it. Pressures due to deep ocean dives are going to happen, therefore they design for it. Pressure from ship hitting it broadside, probably too expensive to design against. Interesting, submarines follow other submarines so close to each other that 'bumps' aren't that uncommon. The US Navy has a long history of bumping into Russian subs they were following and causing damage to both.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not the Navy; Electric Boat and Newport News do though. </p>
<p>As for collisions, check out the San Francisco. SSN711. Submarines can take a lickin and keep on ticking. </p></div>		</li>
