			<div class="markdown"><p>The -200C is about the average energy level of the molecules floating around in empty space. However, since those would be so few molecules (maybe 100 million in a cubic metre), they cannot transfer any significant amount of energy from any object that is a higher temperature.</p>
<p>The +200C is about how warm some of the things we put into space get when exposed to the Sun. They are taking in the full heat of the sun on whatever side is facing it, and that heat needs to transfer through the object and radiate away in every direction. The 200 degrees is about where this processes reaches equilibrium (i.e., as much heat radiating in as radiating out).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Temperature is the average kinetic energy of the molecules in the space you are measuring.</p>
<p>So a true vacuum would not have a classical temperature as we know it on earth.^^* ^^conditions ^^apply.</p>
<p>The vacuum of space is not a true vacuum and does contain some molecules. So it does have a classical temperature.</p>
<p>Now, this temperature can be quite extreme. Either very cold (near absolute zero) or very hot (multiple thousands of degrees). The thing is, something feels hot or cold because you come in contact with the molecules in the medium you are feeling. When you touch something hot, the molecules in that hot object/medium transfer part of their energy to you by hitting you.</p>
<p>In the vacuum of space, because there are so few molecules to transfer heat to or from you, you would not feel the hotness or coldness of the medium. You would not really feel anything.</p>
<p>Pop culture often portrays people who are ejected into space as instantly freezing for example. This is unrealistic. Sure, you would suffocate rather quickly, but your body would not freeze. In fact, it would lose it's heat a lot slower than it would on earth, as most of your heat loss would be through radiation, and not convection.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I think most of your heat loss would actually be from evaporative cooling?</p>
<p>That said, I think you're underestimating radiation here.  Roughly 2 square meters of surface area, times Stephan Boltzmann law for 300K, is nearly 1kW.  On earth, it's generally not very much power due to both comparable radiative input power, and conduction being so efficient.  However, if you're in the shade in space, it's a quite significant effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Temperature is an average when there's far too many molecules involved to feasibly measure their kinetic energy individually. In intergalactic space, though, for instance, where I'm reading there's only ten atoms per cubic meter, you wouldn't need to resort to such an approximation; you could simply measure the kinetic energy of each of the handful of particles encountered in a given, arbitrarily reasonable and restrained quantity of space. Would it then be meaningful to speak of their temperature?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ELI5 version - stuff has temperature (temperature is just heat energy) and space is called space because it is a lack of stuff, or, that there's a lot of space between the stuff... No stuff, no temperature. Also, add a zero to the + temperature to be closer to accurate. The suits are white so they reflect heat away.</p>
<p>Around the ISS there is still atmosphere (thermosphere), but it is so thin that there is maybe a hand full of molecules per cubic kilometer. But, since there are so few molecules to share heat energy with, the temperatures in sunlight can be well above of 1500°C for those few molecules. You run into one, then yeah, it might transfer a lot of heat to a tiny spot on the suit, but it won't do much to the suit as a whole.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's way more than that around the ISS. I can't find a good number right now, but suffice to say it's still many orders of magnitude above that. Even the interstellar medium has something like 10^6 molecules per cubic meter (not kilometer). But for comparison the Earth's atmosphere is something like 10^25 molecules per cubic meter, so comparatively speaking it's like nothing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a slightly more &quot;like im five&quot; version, imagine getting into a pool of water at a given temperature. Now imagine you are instead standing out in the open air, with the air at that same temperature. Which one will make you colder, faster? The water of course, because water is better at transferring heat than air. So if you wanna survive in super cold air, you dont need NEARLY as much insulation as you would to survive in super cold water.</p>
<p>In the same way that air doesnt transfer heat as well as water, empty space doesnt transfer heat as well as air. So if you wanna survive in the super cold vacuum of space, you dont need nearly as much insulation as you would to survive in super cold air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think an even better ELI5 is air with something like an oven. </p>
<p>Imagine a pot of water at 200F versus an oven set to 200F. You can stick your hand in the oven with little pain but not the pot of water. </p>
<p>This is because water is much denser than air and transfers temperature much better. </p>
<p>A vacuum is even less than air (the oven example)</p></div>		</li>
