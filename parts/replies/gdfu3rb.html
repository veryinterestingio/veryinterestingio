			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe, a little. It's mostly just the fact that burning hydrocarbon fuel creates water vapor. That vapor quickly condenses at high altitude, like your breath does on a cold day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fuel is a hydrocarbon, a long chain of Hydrogen and Carbon</p>
<p>To burn it, you combine Oxygen with the hydrocarbon (and an ignition source-a spark/flame/heat/pressure)</p>
<p>Carbon+Oxygen=CO or CO2 (carbon monoxide/dioxide)</p>
<p>Hydrogren+Oxygen=H2O (water, in the form of vapor, because it's hot)</p>
<p>(Oversimplified, of course, but that's the basics)</p>
<p>The hot water vapor condenses in the cold air. It doesn't just look like a cloud, it literally is a cloud. </p>
<p>Cars are no different, you'll notice a drip of water out of the tailpipe, or clouds on cold days, for the exact same reason.</p></div>		</li>
