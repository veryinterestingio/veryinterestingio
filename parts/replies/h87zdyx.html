<p>So the infection can't go systemic.</p>
<p>And on a small scale what happens to cells when exposed to repeated surface level infections? Is there going to be damage or scarring on the surface of the lungs from these superficial infections?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the amount of viral particles were talking about might be some relatively tiny amount in the scale of a general infection.  Assuming you have a decent amount of antibodies, later exposures wont produce nearly the effect to even be noticable, generally speaking.  </p>
<p>Most of the damage and scarring is from inflammation starting to attempt to combat the infection.  Its what you're seeing from breakthrough and repeat infections, is the symptoms are much less because the body already with antibodies can respond faster before the infection can get worse... so the symptoms are generally less.  On an extreme scale, if the antibody production has been strong enough, the new exposure is effectively nothing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, very surprising. I would have thought it would have been worse given the frequency of reinfections you mentioned.</p></div>		</li>
