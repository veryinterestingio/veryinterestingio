			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a placebo - ears, nose and throat are all connected to the extent that ENT specialists are a thing. In the case of ears and throat, they're connected by the eustachian tube, so it's possible that your ear irritation is coming from an issue in your throat.</p></div>		</li>
