			<div class="markdown"><p>Animals usually bite off the cord. It’s easier to hold/manipulate/feed a baby without a cord and a placenta attached. </p>
<p>Among primates, Jane Goodall witnesses that chimps would leave the cord attached and it would dry and fall off within a day of birth, but apes will bite it off. </p>
<p>From this we can extrapolate that early man would either leave it until it dried and fell off naturally (4-5 days?  That’s how long the cord stump needs) or they bit through it so they wouldn’t have to carry it around. </p>
<p>Medical doctor, not an anthropologist, but I did some reading on the topic in med school because I thought it was interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a more or less recent trend called Lotus Birth, which leaves the placenta attatched to the baby until it falls of (because it's decomposing.) There's obvious heavy <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_birth" target="_blank">health risks</a>  for the baby though.</p>
<p>Cutting the cord early and not clamping it could be a risk of bleeding out for both mother and baby I think. It's generally clamped on both sides and cut between the clamps.</p>
<p>Cutting and clamping is usually done after the cord has ceased beating to give baby the benefit of added iron and oxygen. (source: am third time mom with four week old baby)</p></div>		</li>
