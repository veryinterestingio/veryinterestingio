			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually super common! I work for a coal mining company (Am not a miner, just an IT guy), but we use something called “Long wall mining”. If I remember correctly this basically means that the miner (Huge ass coal mining machine) drives down the “seam” of coal while actual human miners bolt the ceiling and such behind it. Then once the seam is all finished up the long wall is pulled back and the shaft is collapsed!</p>
<p>In my area of the country it is quite common to drive around and see houses with wooden braces and brackets on them, due to foundations/walls cracking not long ago part of our major highway collapsed for the same reason. You’ll also find a lot of people lose their water-wells, causing them to have to get water tanks and refill those every week or two.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because it creates an opportunity for a sink hole later on and it’s under public land. In this case under a popular camping area. The use of robots was required because it was so deep that people couldn’t withstand the temperatures. I’ll see if I can track down a video explaining it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The plan for the <a href="https://resolutioncopper.com/" target="_blank">Resolution Copper Mine</a> is to use &quot;block caving&quot; in order to extract from below. It's a fairly low-grade deposit of copper, requiring more efficient methods: crack it up from below, creating a funnel that allows the ore to be removed from the bottom for extraction.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-pWzUb6How" target="_blank">Interesting video on the subject.</a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, Oak Flat Campground, a sacred site as per the Apaches, will be destroyed in the process.</p></div>		</li>
