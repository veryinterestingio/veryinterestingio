So while it may seem we're making choices, we can't actually be doing so.  More accurately, the choices are also baked in and are fully determined.  There's no ability to choose differently than you actually choose.  If there's no way things could have been different, there can't be free will.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've also heard the &quot;no free will&quot; argument from a chemical reaction perspective.  Basically we are experiencing electrical impulses and chemical reactions in our brains.  We have the illusion that we're making decisions and having independent thought but in reality we are just going through biological reactions that are outside of our control.  </p>
<p>Since we come to where we are through a series of events we have no control over, and our brain chemistry is out of our control, and the outside influences are outside of our control, we are basically just reacting to stuff.  Like, think of how much different we act when we're hungry or extremely tired.  You don't want to be irritable and cranky but you can't help it.  It's because your body is low on sugar or something.  </p>
<p>Or, say someone suffers a brain injury, they physically are incapable of speech or remembering a period of their life or whatever.  All of our thoughts and decisions are physical reactions we have no control over any more than that person with brain damage can control losing their memory. Because all of these things are outside of our influence it is only an illusion that we have free will.</p>
<p>I'm tired and my brain isn't functioning optimally right now so hopefully that made sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From a philosophical point of view (I'm probably going to butcher this description but hopefully it makes sense) and to quote the Matrix, I'd look at it like Neo talking to the Oracle, know thyself, we didn't make the decision just now, we already made it. We had the free will to make a decision, its just already been made by us. We're here to understand why we made that decision.</p>
<p>This is further compounded by time all existing at once, our idea of free will is making a choice in the moment, but moments don't exist, our perception of a moment is what exists.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never understood the idea of free will in the first place. Yes, we feel like we are making choises, but when you try to explain what free will is, the whole concept breaks down instantly.</p>
<p>As I understand, free will means to most people that in a given situation, they could make different choises. You clearly have a personality that determines most of your choises, but beyond that, what exactly should be the reason you decide differently in a given situation?</p>
<p>Lets assume I could turn back time and let you make the same choise over and over again (in the exact same circumstances). If you would always make the same choise, free will wouldnt exist, right? But if you change your choise, where exactly does this come from? Isnt this just a randomized process then? </p>
<p>Free will is such an important concept for many but I dont see why it is important to think &quot;I COULD have chosen the whole grain bread in this situation, but I chose the muffin&quot;. Maybe, you could have, but what about this is 'free' and a 'will'?</p>
<p>So even if determinism is untrue, I dont understand what people mean by free will.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its something like this: in physics, if you have a closed system, then you can deterministically calculate the final positions of everything- example if you drop a ball in a closed system, you can tell where it will go.</p>
<p>Now imagine the entire universe is a closed system. Although there is a ton of mass and stuff, it is all finite, so it could be calculated how everything will end up. This means that even how we as individuals think and act can be calculated based on the chemicals in our brains (given enough computing power). Therefore, everything is pre determined and we have no free will although we cannot feel it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The statements made here aren’t really true. I think things fall apart more than a little bit at the loaf of bread argument. If you think about the universe in time sliced chunks, you have information about all of space at one point in time. You cannot. If you think about someone inside the system , they can only know about their co-ordinate at one time (slice of bread). They can also only know about areas of the bread where there has been time for a signal to reach them. This is the idea of a light cone. If somewhere is outside your backwards light cone, to get information about it a signal has to be sent faster than light and you can’t know about it. So really you can only know about the things in your backwards light cone, and do anything to affect things in your future light cone.</p>
<p>The bread analogy lacks the idea of causality, so it leads to false assumptions... and comments about free will.</p>
<p>Further to this if you think about the loaf of bread, it is best to think of the loaf as background and the individual molecules of bread as us. You can in effect ignore the effect of an individual when considering the full spacetime (bread) but the inverse is not true. You can have things propagate and interact on the background spacetime and it doesn’t really have enough of an effect the change much of the back ground (this is an aspect of perturbation theory) </p>
<p>Quantum physics on a spacetime is usually done by Quantum field theory. In QFT there are true random events with probabilities given by looking at how fields interact. This is not compatible with determinism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of statements like if I have A and B happen then what is the chance of C and D happening?</p>
<p>But now A and B might be an electron and a positron colliding and C and D might be the output being say a Tau and it’s antiparticle. The probability of this happening is given by a set of integrals in quantum field theory but whether it happens or not is like a number being chosen in a distribution, sure you could have τ and anti τ  but also you could have had a load of other final state particles (within the sensible bounds of the theory) This distribution shifts around based on how much energy is in the collision. But the point is that if you had just a single particle collision, you couldn’t definitely say what the outcome is, but you could predict the ratio of the probabilities of possible outcomes. This is what happens at many particle detectors, they do a very large number if collisions and look at the relative likelihood and compare to theory</p></div>		</li>

<p>There may not be true random events even in QFT, and it is likely that there aren't, since it would necessarily violate unitary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I say true random here I mean this in the sense that computers tend to do fancy maths to generate random numbers, and are in this sense pseudorandom. </p>
<p>However I’m interested to hear what you mean by this statement. I know that whether the standard model is actually unitary or not is a pretty active area of research but how does unitarity relate to this topic?</p></div>		</li>
