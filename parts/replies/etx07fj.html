			<div class="markdown"><p>not typically.  reattaching a finger tip may or may not come with full feeling of that digit, circulation may be impaired somewhat as well..  ultimately, you may not care.  Its there, its alive, worst case is that its always a bit numb, better than nothing.  The tip of the finger just needs to be present to be of significant use to its owner.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>An arm is infinitely more complex to reattach, its also very unlikely to &quot;slice&quot; an arm off.  In most cases of losing an arm, it is pulverized in some way, which changes the ball game entirely.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But assuming you did lose a samurai sword fight, its very unlikely that they would be able to reattach an arm with any significant functionality, feeling, or control.  Unlike a finger, an arm cannot be a passive thing.  If it cannot move, its more of an inconvenience.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Nerves are tough, because when they do get cut, they quickly scar, and that makes it difficult to reattach them without impacting their function.  I recall a recent post about a new injection that worked in mice to prevent that scarring action I think.</p></div>		</li>

Apparently he managed to get immediate medical care and the surgeons did a good enough job that he regained a lot of function in it. The guy taught kendo for years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Friend was in a motorcycle accident and went in to a guardrail.  His arm was hanging by a thread and they were able to re-attach.  He has 80% strength and almost all feeling and dexterity.  Pretty amazing.  His X-Rays are insane with all the screws and brackets still in him.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what helps in finger injuries though is most of your finger function luckily isn't mostly from nerves/muscles in your finger. There's a big ol' tendon (read: easier to reattach compared to nerves/blood-vessels) that runs down through your forearms, and that's where most of the control comes from at least for opening/closing fingers.</p>
<p>Very different from something like losing a whole arm/leg, where there's a lot more going on within that limb itself that controls itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you‚Äôre talking about the full arm transplants in the USA, my hats off to you. They go through hell and many have opted to just have the arm removed if they don‚Äôt end up committing suicide due to other issues along with this. </p>
<p>It‚Äôs a crazy field and making gains, however it‚Äôs fucking hard to do on everyone including the physical therapists and other no surgical staff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my case, I had my middle left finger shot off.  They were able to reattach it, and i have full feeling in it still.  It's shorter than it was, and i can grip with it, but I can't extend it due to ligament damage.  I'm mostly glad that I still have it since I do animal surgery for cardiovascular research as a job, but it does get in the way of other stuff.  makes a great grocery bag handle though.  Surgery took about 3 hours to get it back on, and had another follow up to loosen up some tendons after the swelling went down.  0/10, would not recommend.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This reminded me of when my dad chopped his finger off cutting wood. He was just chopping wood when he heard something hit the garage door, he looked up and saw nothing, but when he looked back down and he saw blood everywhere. It was his finger he heard hit the door. He grabbed a towel to put around his still attached finger, walked upstairs, got a ziplock bag of ice, went back outside, grabbed his detached finger and placed it in the ice bag. He then walked back into the house, woke my mom up (she worked nights at the time) and calmly said ‚ÄúI chopped my finger off, will you drive me to the hospital‚Äù and showed her the bag with his finger inside. üòÖ They ended up not being able to reattach his finger for whatever reason, but he tried!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Probably the ice, if you put the finger in with the ice it'll ruin it. But my source for that is the Punisher MAX comic where he first fights Barracuda so don't take my word for it.</p></div>		</li>
