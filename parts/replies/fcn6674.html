			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually used to be pro pyro, and this was one of the biggest things I wanted to learn, like, how to make the smiley face or heart shells. Get ready for this. You just draw the designs inside the bursting charge with the individual color star marbles. Want a heart? Draw a heart inside the bursting charge with the color marble charges.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I remember correctly it's due to how they set up the internals of the fireworks as in the gunpowder and the pellets.</p>
<p>EDIT: If this is allowed<a href="https://www.howitworksdaily.com/how-do-fireworks-make-shapes/" target="_blank"> here's a website that can explain it better than I can </a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you asking about the colors? </p>
<p>Inside each firework is an aerial shell  a that contains gunpowder and dozens of small modules called &quot;stars.&quot; These stars hold fuel, an oxidizing agent, a binder and metal salts or metal oxides (the source of the firework's colors). A time delay fuse ignites the gunpowder and bursts the aerial shell once the firework is midair, causing the stars to scatter and explode far above the ground, producing a shower of light and color.</p>
<p>Each chemical element releases a different amount of energy, and this energy is what determines the color or wavelength of the light that is emitted.</p>
<p>Tl;Dr</p>
<p>Different metals are inside the firework and each metal creates a different color when it burns.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, yes the colors, but also I've seen happy face designs, mickey mouse faces, and planet-esque designs. How they got the fireworks to make that formation is my question. (I'm sorry if this is confusing I just don't know how to word it)</p></div>		</li>
