			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a pretty good explanation. </p>
<p>When I was younger, I used to think a PhD meant that someone was really smart in general. Now I know that a person with a PhD is really smart but maybe on only one tiny little area of study. They may be a complete idiot about everything else because they spent all their time and energy learning about that one thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a master's and my wife is a PhD. I have worked in higher education for many years, so I have been constantly surrounded by PhDs and I count many as friends. What I can say about them is that they are... people. They are not usually geniuses. On average they tend to be intelligent, they tend to be curious and they tend to be driven. In general they are interesting people, and very passionate about their field and research. But, they are just people. Some are good, some bad, some are nice and others not so much. I have never met someone with a PhD who is a &quot;complete idiot about everything else,&quot; but sometimes they lack in social graces and they may not care about mundane things that most people would take for granted, which can make them seem like idiots because they don't know something everybody else does. They could certainly learn it, they are just not very interested in many of those things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of nuances there. Someone may be an incompetent person with a PhD, for example. I have witnessed people in the 2nd year of their doctorship asking for help to understand simple concepts, that could quite easily be explained by a bachelor. </p>
<p>I have also met people with a PhD that seemed to have a very fine understanding of things well beyond their areas. </p>
<p>I think it's a mix of competence, studies and opportunities. Eighter way, I think you're safe in assuming doctors aren't really great geniouses just because of their titles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of my closest mates has a PhD and this describes him perfectly.</p>
<p>Sure in his area of Chemistry he's among the best in the world and got job offers in 6 different counties around the world.</p>
<p>But my word, you try discuss something general or &quot;real world&quot; and you'd swear he was dropped one to many times as a baby.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The more you learn and study the more things you’re exposed to that you really don’t know much, if anything, about.</p></div>		</li>
