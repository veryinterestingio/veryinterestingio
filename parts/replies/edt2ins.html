			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. It's called (I think) a logarithmic decomposition, where it halves, and halves again until there's a negligible amount.
A set rate would be like if you had 1 litre of alcohol in your body, and exactly .2 litres were filtered out every hour until it's gone, versus having 1 litre of caffeine, where 50% is filtered out, then another half, and repeat until it's so close to nothing that it doesn't matter anymore.</p>
<p>Edit: First example has a set rate of -.2 litre of alcohol per hour. Second example has a variable in the rate, -(latest amount of caffeine)/2 per hour. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>N(t)=1*.5^(t/5)
This represents the amount of caffeine in your system.</p>
<p>DN/dt=-ln(2)/(5*2^(t/5))
This represents the rate that coffee is leaving your system. Notice how it depends on t, so it isn't constant.</p>
<p>Another way to think about it;</p>
<p>At t=0, you have 100% of the caffeine.</p>
<p>At t=5, 50%.</p>
<p>t=10, 25%.</p>
<p>t=15, 12.5%.</p>
<p>t=20, 6.125%.</p>
<p>t=25, 3.0625%.</p>
<p>You lose 50% of the caffeine in the first 5 hours, and roughly an additional 47% in the next 20 hours. Clearly the rate must be changing.</p></div>		</li>
