			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not completely accurate. Drums do have a fundamental frequency, at least when they are tuned properly (doing that is the worst part about being a drummer. Apart from the sheer amount of noise it makes. And from the hassle to move it around). Cymbals also do (most of them), but they cannot be tuned (well they can but you have to do some metal work).</p>
<p>The bass drum sounds atonal probably because it is muffled and so low frequency that you don't get much vibration out of it.</p>
<p>The snare may sound atonal because there is so much noise on top of the drum sound itself (depending on how it's tuned).</p>
<p>Tomtoms definitely sound tonal, again at least when they are tuned properly (which they should).</p>
<p>I never did frequency analysis of a cymbal but most of them definitely sound tonal (I would guess from vibrations along its diameter or concentric ones). There is just a bunch of high frequency noise on top of it (from vibrations across their thickness? Maybe?).</p>
<p>And all those together definitely sound out of place when they are not tuned correctly relative to each other (again, you cannot tune cymbals, but you can choose them, or tune the rest to the cymbals you have). If you listen to a random drumset and a well tuned drumset, you will definitely hear the difference. And if you play, you will definitely feel like you're far better a drummer on the latter :)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's no real &quot;proper tune&quot; though.</p>
<p>Toms being the easiest example: you can tune the batter head and resonating head slightly differently for a certain sound, turn them &quot;normal&quot; for a normal sound, etc. The two heads have ranges of looseness / tightness where overtones are eliminated as air pushes back and forth between the two after a blow</p>
<p>A drum is only out of tune if the drum has bad overtones, or if the drummer / song / bandmates want a different (achievable) sound of of the drum. </p>
<p>It's 95% of the time up to what the drummer wants to hear from their instrument (assuming unwanted overtones are eliminated) rather than achieving a frequency of D minor or whatever on a guitar. There's no real set spot. </p>
<p>Source: I also play drums </p>
<p>P.S: Not saying you're wrong at all. </p>
<p>P.S for non-drummers: Drummers just get to have a lot more freedom while tuning than a guitarist does, for example. And drums can definitely be out of tune, typically you'll know when you hit it. Does it sound good, or does it sound shitty? Shitty usually being ringing overtones or loose vibration rattling noises, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are standard-ish tunes, yet I agree you can tune things in a completely different way and it will sound good / match the music genre.</p>
<p>But indeed there is not a single proper way of doing that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many drums and cymbals are considered unpitched instruments. In isolation, you can distinguish the differences in pitches of cymbals, but they are not related to the pitches of the music being played.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine sound/music being a massage given to you by balls of different sizes.</p>
<p>Drums are like exercise ball or beach balls, you just feel pressure all over, and you can kinda tell if it was aimed at your head, but it still hit half your back.</p>
<p>Other instruments are like baseballs or marbles, you know exactly where each one was aimed at, and it hurts if it hits the wrong parts. Really &quot;pointy&quot; instruments (like a violin) are like needles, if its played/tuned right, its awesome acupuncture, otherwise its just stabbing your ears.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a crappy amateur violinist, can confirm. The &quot;pointiness&quot; is also why vibrato is so important to playing &quot;classical&quot; strings - the player uses the vibrato wobble to smooth out the sharp edges while also buying some time for the ear/finger to fine-tune around the tone center. </p>
<p>Another analogy : the fineness of a point on a paintbrush.
a bass drum is a paint roller,
a tomtom is a wide brush,
a China cymbal is Jackson Pollock</p></div>		</li>
