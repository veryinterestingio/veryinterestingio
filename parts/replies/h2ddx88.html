			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. And even I'd you plant already grown plants most of them soon die. What we see in the wild are the ones that got in best location.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to all of this, keep in mind that not all wild plants survive either. You may have thousands start, but only hundreds survive, the ones in suitable conditions, but it still looks like a ton.</p>
<p>In your gardens and pots, you're dealing with way smaller numbers.</p>
<p>A big part of it just boils down to statistics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, while I don't doubt plants do better in the wild, plenty of plants in the wild will die if they're in a bad location or are outcompeted by other plants, or get damaged too badly. We're just seeing the ones that made it. They grow big and resilient because they're in good conditions, if they weren't they wouldn't, and sometimes don't.</p></div>		</li>
