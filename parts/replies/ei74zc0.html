			<div class="markdown"><p>Modern permanent magnets are made of special alloys that have been found through research to create increasingly better magnets. The most common families of magnet materials today are ones made out of Aluminum-Nickel-Cobalt (Alnicos), Strontium-Iron (Ferrites, also known as Ceramics), Neodymium-Iron-Boron (Neo magnets, sometimes referred to as &quot;super magnets&quot;), and Samarium-Cobalt. (The Samarium-Cobalt and Neodymium-Iron-Boron families are collectively known as the Rare Earths.)</p>
<p>If a magnet is stored away from power lines, other magnets, high temperatures, and other factors that adversely affect the magnet, it will retain its magnetism essentially forever.</p>
<p>Modern magnet materials do lose a very small fraction of their magnetism over time. For Samarium Cobalt materials, for example, this has been shown to be less that 1% over a period of ten years.</p>
<p>The factors can affect a magnet's strength:</p>
<p>Heat, Radiation and strong electrical currents in close proximity to the magnet</p>
<p>Other magnets in close proximity to the magnet
(Neo magnets will corrode in high humidity environments unless they have a protective coating.)</p>
<p>Shock and vibration do not affect modern magnet materials, unless sufficient to physically damage the material.</p></div>		</li>

That's how they make the huuuuge speakers at festivals sound so loud. That and the fact that there's also a lot of speakers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your needle wasn't originally magnetic.  You stroked it with a magnet, and that aligned some of the atoms fields, so it would then act as a weak magnet.  But you're carrying it around, or leaving it around, and it's experiencing other magnetic fields.  Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.  The particles in the needle are trying to push all the ferrous and magnetic objects in it's vicinity in one direction.  But all those things are pulling the needle's atoms in opposite directions, all sorts of directions, slowly turning your ordered magnetic fields into a mishmash of counter-balancing ones, as it was when you first found the needle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to take a stab at ELI5 magnetism all the way from base principles. </p>
<p><strong>What is magnetism?</strong></p>
<p>Let’s start all the way at the base principles and I promise it will be worth it. It will make things really intuitive.
It actually has to do with special relativity. </p>
<p>According to the laws we discovered when measuring magnetic fields (Maxwell’s equations and Lorenz invariance), photons have to travel at a fixed speed regardless of the speed of anything else. This is the speed of light.</p>
<p>But that’s confusing. If you're on a train going nearly the speed of light and then flip on a flashlight, it seems like either you would perceive the speed of light as slower relative to your fast speed or your speed gets added to the speed of light and a stationary observer would disagree about the speed of light. But the equations say neither happens. Somehow both observers would see the speed of light the same relative to themselves. But are the equations right?</p>
<p>Measurements like the Michaelson-Morely experiment seem to back this up. When lasers are fired North-South and compared with lasers fired East-West (adding the rotational speed of the earth, roughly 1,000 mph) there isn't a difference in measured speed of light at all. </p>
<p>How can this be? Well Einstein figured out that of you do the math (simple geometry really) the implication is that a bunch of really counter-intuitive things happen to allow light to stay a fixed speed. <em>Space itself warps</em> to accommodate a fixed speed of light relative to all observers. </p>
<p>One kind of warping is called <em>length contraction</em>. Doing the geometry, you can see that an object traveling in a straight line relative to a fixed observer actually must contract (shrink) in the direction of travel. To put that another way. A stationary person watching our superfast train go by would see a shorter train. All the people on it would looked squished to be thinner only in the direction of travel. And it's not an illusion. They really are compressed. Space has compressed. </p>
<p>So what does this have to do with electrons?</p>
<p>Picture an electromagnet - the kind you might make for a grade show science fair. You have a copper wire coiled around nail. When you supply a voltage difference across the wire, electrons start flowing from one end to the other. The wire itself has no net charge. For every electron (-) there is a proton (+) to balance it out and a stationary observer sitting on the head of the nail feels no net electrical charge. </p>
<p>As electrons move, according to relativity, they <em>length contract</em> even if just a tiny bit. So looking down onto the coil from a tiny chair on the head of the nail, what would you see? Well instead of seeing an equal net amount of electron and proton charge, you'd see fixed protons at full size and <em>length contracted</em> electrons right? There is now <em>less electron</em> than proton from the perspective of a stationary particle on the head of the nail. And again, it's not an illusion. There is less electron relativistically. So you get this wierd electric field that is imbalanced but only in the directions perpendicular to the flow of electricity. According the the right hand rule, when this is a coil, that direction gets concentrated along the axis of the nail. </p>
<p>Boom <em>that's</em> what a magnetic field is. It's an electric field born of relativistic effects and that's why it arises from motion of electrons according to those weird geometric rules. </p>
<p><strong>Permanent magnets</strong></p>
<p>Okay, so maybe you're guessing permanent magnets are similar already. At an atomic scale, electrons are &quot;moving&quot; around the protons in the atom. Maybe you've taken some QM and been discouraged from thinking of electrons as moving little balls of charge. But they really do act like it. Take the limit as the diameter of that ball approaches zero and all the equations work out. Electrons &quot;orbiting&quot; in their orbitals generate magnetic fields and these fields are what force other electrons into compatible orbitals. Electrons revolve but also rotate on an axis. This is referred to as spin. Since they have zero diameter, it's not totally clear exactly what spin means, but it behaves just like a spinning top would.</p>
<p>For this reason, I prefer a debroglie-bohm model. Pilot-Wave qm is really intuitive. </p>
<p>When fenced into an atom, there are only certain positions electrons can inhabit without pushing other electrons away. If you want to think of them as waves, think of them like standing waves in a guitar string. Harmonics are allowed right? But other waves getting in there could cause destructive interference. So other electrons are positioned as 3D harmonic waves around the atom. Or you can simply think of them as balls of electric charge and avoid the whole wave thing. </p>
<p>If one electron is producing a magnetic field in one direction, a compatible nearby electron must produce it on an orthogonal axis so as not to constructively interfere and generate a repelling field - this is Pauli's exclusion principle on a nutshell. </p>
<p>Do all the math around the geometric rules and you'll see some patterns appear. Sometimes the rules mean the electrons are spinning in the same direction but sitting in a different orbital (like notes on 2 different strings) often enough to give a net magnetic charge in the atom. That's a permanent magnet. Many materials have individual atoms with a bit of magnetic charge but since the atoms are all facing random directions in the materials they comprise, the charges cancel out at a macro scale. </p>
<p>Metals like Nickle and Iron form crystals when from a molten liquid state, they cool slowly enough that their net electric/magnetic charges allow the atoms to all line up. If you let them cool in the presence of a strong magnetic field (like the one the swirling coils of magma in the earth's core making the earth's magnetic field produce) you can get metal crystals where all the time atomic magets lign up to make a big permanent magnets. That's lodestone – the natural magnet. </p>
<p>People makeagnets out of highly magnetic atoms called <em>rare earth</em> magnets and cool them in strong magnetic fields created by electromagnets like the one we explained higher up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question. Relative orientation of atoms (or molecules in compounds) by their electric poles is how we get crystals. Take the water molecule, the H has a different charge than the O, so you get ice crystals (and snowflakes) when water cooled down enough because the H of one molecule is attracted to the O of some neighbor molecule. </p>
<p>The atoms inside can reorient however they want when they have enough energy to do so. That's what temperature is. It's the average kinetic energy of the atoms. So if it doesn't have enough, the weak magnetic influence of the nearby atoms will determine the orientation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Atoms do touch. I don't know why saying they don't has become some pop sci fad because any not stupid definition of touching would tell you they do. Like the ones that don't would also say that you're not touching a soccer ball when you lightly put your fingers on it because you can make it deform if you put more pressure on it. </p>
<p>Another big shortcoming of their writeup is that they completely ignore delocalization which is a big deal when you're not talking about some atomic gas. I don't feel like explaining it simply at the moment, but just know that these atomic orbitals they described can and do interact with each other which creates a pair of orbitals, one lower in energy and another higher. These new orbitals can then interact with other orbitals and do the same thing and those orbitals can interact with other orbitals, etc.</p>
<p>That delocalization is part of the picture. The other main part is the obvious conclusion when you realize that these things do interact with each other in the lattice. They can vibrate pretty freely, but rotations would come at a big energy cost thanks to coulombic forces from the increased overlap, so they only do appreciably when the temperature is sufficiently high.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you said about electrons orbiting is wrong. Electrons do not orbit, and if they did that would be related to their orbital angular momentum, not their spin angular momentum, which is the real source of magnetism. The classical (but wrong) explanation of spin is a charged particle rotating and therefore creating an electric current in that direction, which creates a magnetic moment orthogonal to the direction of rotation. When these magnetic moments of unpaired electrons on multiple atoms line up, you have magnetism.</p>
<p>However my explanation of spin is wrong. Electrons are point particles with no volume so they can’t really rotate. There is no eli5 explanation for spin it’s purely a product of the complex math involved in explaining the behavior of electrons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably not. The actual answer is simple, it just requires pretty hefty knowledge of group theory to understand. /u/Redingold posted it a little bit ago.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The electron is not really spinning - what spin really means is that the wavefunction has components that transform under SU(2). Since SU(2) is a double cover of the group of 3D rotations SO(3) this is sort of like rotation, but it isn't.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though I think I've heard mumblings that spin appears with SO(3) alone, but don't quote me on that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s a purely quantum mechanical phenomenon. It drops out of the math when you treat time and the three spatial dimensions the same. There is no way to explain it in a simple way and there’s no classical or real world analogy other than the particle spinning analogy but that’s not accurate. Spin doesn’t even fully exist in this space, it exists in its own space and we can only observe a projection of it into this space. Electrons have a spin value of 1/2, does that sound like something that can be simply explained? I don’t even know much about it, but I know it isn’t simple enough to be meaningfully explained to anyone without operator algebra and shit.</p></div>		</li>
