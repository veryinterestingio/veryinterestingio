			<div class="markdown"><p>FM Radio exists in between band 1 &amp; 3, as [CH 2-6]-[FM]-[CH 7-13]. Channel 6's audio ends at 87.75Mhz and FM's lowest station begins at 88Mhz.</p>
<p>In fact some naughty TV stations used to use 87.7 or 87.9 FM as a zombie radio station double dipping on their FCC license.</p>
<p>Inversely, if you have a wide range tuner <a href="https://www.drti.com/rft4-dual-channel-20-6500-mhz-wideband-tuner/" target="_blank">like this</a> you could listen in to the audio of local TV stations. Some old handhelds could go a little below 87.9 too.</p></div>		</li>
