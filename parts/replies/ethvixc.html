Naturally, a fetus will be one of the fastest growing/dividing groups of cells in the body, so will be more strongly effected by radiation than the mother.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So that rules them out. </p>
<p>Oh and the Russians allowed the idea that drinking vodka would flush contamination and radiation form the body. They flooded the region where the refugees were with cheap, plentiful vodka. </p>
<p>There are some studies that show the average consumption hit over  1.5 liters of vodka a day by most of these people.  Her child was born and died from liver failure of a cirrhotic liver.  </p>
<p>Radiation does not specifically cause cirrhosis. Hum. What does cause cirrhosis? Maybe alcohol?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is exactly this sort of thing in movies and TV shows that makes educating people about radiation so difficult. I've come across several people who think radiation behaves differently than how it does or who don't realize that the world is literally covered in radiation from many sources.</p>
<p>Certainly, it is and can be dangerous, depending on the type, method of exposure, dose, etc. but it is highly based on averages, and does not behave like chemicals do. The body has systems in place for filtering, sequestering, and expelling chemicals/materials it does not want, but it cannot do the same thing with radiation. Sure, it can deal with cell damage, and can fight radiation effects that way, but it cannot gather radiation to give to a fetus. That just doesn't make sense.</p></div>		</li>

<p>However, the fetus doesn't accumulate or absorb more contamination than the rest of the mother's body.</p>

<p>This may not be quite right. The thyroid gland of the foetus will likely bioaccumulate radioactive Iodine-131 that the mother inhales or injests from contaminated food and water, the child might have an increased risk of thyroid cancer as a result, in theory this might minutely reduce radiation exposure to the mother's thyroid as some Iodine-131 is accumulated in the foetuses thyroid instead.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Conclusion: Our results suggest that in uteroexposure to radioiodines may have increased the risk of thyroid carcinoma approximately 20 yr after the Chernobyl accident, supporting a conservative approach to medical uses of I-131 during pregnancy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's also Strontium-90, which is incorporated in bone. I think similarly, Strontium-90 might bioaccumulate in the bones of the growing feotus, theoretically reducing by a tiny amount, Strontium-90 accumulation in the mother's bones. </p>
<p>Yes, found a paper that supports they idea. </p>

<p>Ah, sure. I meant that the fetus would not be more susceptible to accumulation than the mother would have been. So the fetus would be at risk of accumulating radioactive iodine and strontium, but the mother would be as well.</p>
<p>The bigger effect I'd be concerned about, and which I wasn't able to find any references, is the fact that the fetus is growing and so is naturally incorporating material into its body. I don't know if the fetus is more likely to incorporate contamination in that scenario or not.</p></div>		</li>
