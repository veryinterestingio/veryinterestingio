			<div class="markdown"><p>What really matters is that the partial pressure of oxygen is correct, IIRC. Humans can withstand remarkably low pressures, as long as about .2 atm of whatever you're in is O2. The Project Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo spacecraft was 5 psi pure oxygen (for technical reasons it's different at launch, but this is what it was in space, for the majority of each flight) and astronauts remained in these environments for weeks at a time. Space suit pressures, as stated previously, are even lower (3.7 psi for American spacesuits, for example).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With a few minor (very important) exceptions, the human body can probably withstand a hard vacuum fairly well. If you had a sealed helmet with an oxygen supply, you’d probably do fairly well in nothing but your birthday suit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That may be true for how the devolped prototypes to test in an actual vacuum but that is definitely not how they guarunteed that the suits would be safe. They actually test those things in a vacuum chamber.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't seem all that much safe to test, though. If a hose flies off or whatever, you still have to worry about nitrogen narcosis and lungs exploding and such.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well does it then seem more safe to not test and then use it without testing? I’d imagine that the testing procedure is gradually progressing from equipment testing to different usage scenarios, while ramping up the pressures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I left out the word &quot;more&quot; in &quot;all that much more safe&quot; sorry. You should definitely test it, but either way seems similar to me.</p></div>		</li>
