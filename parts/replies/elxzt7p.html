			<div class="markdown"><p>What I find interesting about this is the the muon replaces an e- in the 1s orbital but orbits closer. The orbital density apparently changes in a compressed manner. I’d love to see what it looks like and how muons could affect MO theory.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The orbitals for muonic hydrogen-like atoms look the same as those of  regular hydrogen-like atoms, just with a different effective Bohr radius.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't replace the electrond in the 1s orbital, it has it's own separate 1s orbital. The reason you can only put 2 electrons in a 1s orbital is due to the Pauli exclusion principle, but only electrons interact with other electrons in this way. There's nothing preventing you from having 2 electrons and 2 muons in the same type of orbital.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And while I'm not well read on this research, it was my assumption that the electron and muon spin paired and in the same orbital as the Aufbau principle would have it. With the muon being so close to the nucleus and the electron having a much bigger radius a &quot;dipole moment&quot; is created, making the electron more reactive as though it was unpaired. I wouldn't rule out a spin +1/2 e- COULD spin pair with a spin -1/2 muon in a different orbital. I'm excited to learn more about this in time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would expect all the muonic [element] to occur briefly in nature when negative muons from cosmic rays are stopped before they decay. Man-made muons can be captured as well, of course.</p>
<p>We just didn't produce these things deliberately to study them so far.</p></div>		</li>
