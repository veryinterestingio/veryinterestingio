			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. You could be in a room full of UV and it would still appear dark. To you anyway. Other animals would see it as bright as day. </p>
<p>So would Vincent Van Goch btw he and a few other artists i cant remember could see UV. I have a little of it, very annoying...</p></div>		</li>

<p>People with certain surgeries that remove the filters can see UV.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So-called &quot;neon&quot; colors don't just reflect more light. They fluoresce. The pigments absorb high energy photons like blues, violets, and ultraviolets, get excited, and re-radiate whatever the emission wavelength of that pigment is. So they're actually reflecting and emitting back more orange, yellow, or green photons than even hit them in the first place.</p></div>		</li>
