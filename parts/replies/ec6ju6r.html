			<div class="markdown"><p>I would reaaally love to use this planner, but sometimes I fall asleep in mere minutes and sometimes after spinning in bed for 2 hours. I tried everything - going to bed and waking up at the same time every day, reducing caffeine intake and even removing it completely, exercising, not looking at screen before bed, changing my diet etc. Still, most days I just can't fall asleep fast enough.</p>
<p>Edit: wow, I didn't expect this many comments. Apparently there is still a ton of stuff I haven't tried. Thanks everyone for suggestions, some of those sound exactly like something I need so I'll be sure to try them out!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same boat.  I can't <em>just fall asleep</em>.  It usually takes a while, but theres no real set amount of time either.  I wish I could.  The only times I've ever been able to go to sleep consistently within 10 minutes of getting in bed/bag/concrete wall/whatever have all been during army shit, and it would be impossible to mirror that amount of physical activity with my day job haha.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Try audiobooks, or listening to podcasts, preferably ones where the dude speaking has a really monotonous voice. I had problems with laying down in bed for 2 hours, thinking about shit and not being able to fall asleep, but podcasts completely cured that for me. </p>
<p>Currently I'm listening to <a href="https://player.fm/series/series-2407362" target="_blank">Mysteries Abound</a> when trying to sleep, and it works like a charm. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it takes a long time for my brain to shut down, too. I’ll lay in bed and start thinking shit that happened in the 3rd grade or something, and I’m 25,
Now I take melatonin. I’m usually asleep within half an hour of closing my eyes when it used to take over an hour</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a few pals that have this problem. I’d recommend </p>
<p>1) Making sure that every bit of light in your room is covered so that you cannot see it from where you sleep. Do your best to get it to a point where you cannot see a thing in your room.</p>
<p>2) Have a fan on low/medium setting pointing away from you. A lot of times people are kept awake by the faintest noises and they don’t even realise it. They can even be the source of the noise themselves. The fan will keep a constant noise in the room and (assuming it’s a good fan that doesn’t creak every 3 seconds) will allow you to fall asleep easier.</p>
<p>3) Adjust the temperature of your room. Personally I cannot sleep with warmth in a room. It makes me too uncomfortable. Try opening a window very slightly to allow heat to leave the room. If you have a decent blanket then you don’t need to worry about getting cold.</p>
<p>4) Similar to above, if you wear pyjamas to sleep try wearing just underwear. If that doesn’t work try the ol’ trusty birthday suit. Some people are more accustomed to sleeping with clothing than others. I myself can sleep in skinny jeans which creeps a lot of my family out.</p>
<p>5) Take a shower. Sounds obvious but a nice hot shower really helps you fall asleep.</p>
<p>6) This is probably the biggest one for me. Change your bedsheets and pillow cases. Take full advantage of a tumble dryer if you have one. Having a shower and then getting changed into warm pyjamas with new bedsheets is the underrated heaven of this world and more people should utilise this when they have trouble sleeping. Plus it’s more exercise that will just wear you out.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My doctor suggested a bunch of things for sleep hygiene. Good sleep hygiene means only using your bed for sleep and sex. If you're in bed but can't fall asleep after 20 minutes you should get out of bed and go read on the couch or something until you feel yourself getting sleepy then try again (rinse repeat.) This, paired with no caffeine after noon has helped me a bit. I'll still have days where I can't sleep but that's almost always cause I had caffeine late in the day. Idk, just food for thought.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be clear, the <strong><em>average</em></strong> length of an individual's sleep cycle is 90 minutes. Those alarm apps use intervals of <strong><em>exactly</em></strong> 90 minutes, meaning they only work for people who happen to be precisely average. They're little more than a placebo for people who think their phone can magically fix insufficient sleep. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all of them. Some require that you put your phone somewhere on your bed (to feel the vibrations) and will use the accelerometers of your phone to find the frequency of your REM cycles. They will then wake you up when they believe you are in the correct phase.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That assumes you believe the phone can actually detect that data accurately being on the bed next to you (and let's not even get started with sleeping in the same bed as someone) which in almost all cases is going to be unlikely.</p></div>		</li>
