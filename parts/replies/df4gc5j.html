			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I consciously decided why I do so. Also open eyed kisses would have crept all of my partners out. The awkwardness of opening your eyes and seeing that the other persons eyes were open is priceless. Even if both parties just so happened to open their eyes for just a fraction of a second at the the same time, you can't tell if the other person was purposefully doing so the whole time.</p>
<p>I think people in love should occasionally perform open eyed kissing. Sure, the tactile sensation of kissing is the best part, but varying it up a little could be useful somehow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A few weeks ago I was making out with someone at a club, but I'd had a lot to drink and while I was kissing her with my eyes closed I kept getting nauseous and having to open my eyes briefly...thankfully I felt better later on in the night.</p>
<p>It was kinda funny because on the one hand I really wanted to make out with her, but every time she went in for a kiss I was dreading feeling sick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My wife and I have done that. We have some silly kisses. Like puffed up cheeks like in cloudy with a chance of meatballs. Or the Spider-Man kiss. But a new one I've done is &quot;aggressive open eyed face smash&quot; which she said is &quot;shockingly rapey and creepy as hell&quot; and makes her laugh uncontrollably. </p>
<p>Talk about romantic </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is neat, and not totally surprising. I have a difficult time looking people in the eyesâ€‹ during important conversations, too. I want to hear and absorb every word they say and if I'm watching their face and feeling their emotions I get distracted and forgot what I heard. Silly stuff.. I like the kissing one more :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why I listen to music with headphones and eyes closed. It makes the experience more intense. </p>
<p>It also works like a meditation technique for me. </p></div>		</li>
