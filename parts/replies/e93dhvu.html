Having a separate person fact-check a story is time-consuming, and it also adds to the cost of producing the piece. Publications that are covering breaking news, for example, don't necessarily have time for a separate person to pore over every last sentence (although they typically will have another system in place to help catch errors). For more on this, check out our recent report on fact-checking in science media: <a href="https://www.moore.org/docs/default-source/default-document-library/fact-checking-in-science-journalism_mit-ksj.pdf?sfvrsn=a6346e0c_2" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.moore.org/docs/default-source/default-document-library/fact-checking-in-science-journalism\_mit-ksj.pdf?sfvrsn=a6346e0c\_2" target="_blank">https://www.moore.org/docs/default-source/default-document-library/fact-checking-in-science-journalism\_mit-ksj.pdf?sfvrsn=a6346e0c\_2</a></a></p>

<p>As for the least factual articles I've personally checked ... I once worked for a science magazine that was originally published in another language and then translated/published in English. We didn't have any contact with the original authors and often didn't get their source material. I would have to correct all sorts of errors there, from photo captions that misidentified species to claims from scientists who were never actually interviewed for the original story. It was stressful!</p></div>		</li>
