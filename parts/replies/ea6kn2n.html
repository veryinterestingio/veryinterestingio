			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahhh you glorious bastard. I've been trying to find this book forever and have never been able to identify it. I picked it up in grade school at some point and never finished it. The book got lost. All I could remember was that it was about living on Venus, and there was some cool description of Venutian rain. </p>
<p>I'm 95% that's it. Thank you.</p></div>		</li>
