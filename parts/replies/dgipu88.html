			<div class="markdown"><p>Yay, my time to shine! I'm a plant molecular biologist that work with a legume known as <em>Lotus japonicus</em>, which can form a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria known as rhizobia. </p>
<p>Only plants from the legume family and an unrelated family (Parasponia) can form this symbiosis, and it is a very complex genetic trait that requires cooperation and coordination from both players. </p>
<p>It is purely my speculation (I got asked the same question at my dissertation defense), but the reason why the ability to accommodate nitrogen-fixing bacteria is not widespread among the plant kingdom is due to a balancing selection. </p>
<p>Positive selection pressure is present, in the sense that fixing nitrogen increases chance of survival in nitrate-poor soil. On the other hand, the trait is very costly to plants: the process of accommodating the rhizobia requires the plant root to form special organs known as nodules, which is very resource intensive. This comes at a cost of reducing resources available for growth. </p>
<p>Another issue is that the symbiotic process requires the plant to fine tune its defense systems in order to allow infection by symbionts. This process is extremely delicate and is prone to both hijacking by non-nitrogen fixing fakers, and by opportunities pathogens alike. </p>
<p>Lastly, this trait actually benefits other non nitrogen fixing plants because once these nitrogen fixing plants die, they decompose and enrich the soil with nitrogen, therefore benefiting other plants that cannot fix nitrogen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plants do not fix nitrogen themselves. They require symbiotic (rhizobia, Frankia or cyanobacteria) or associative diazotrophs. Free-living diazotrophs are usually much less productive in terms of nitrogen fixation since it requires mega shittons of ATP per N2 fixed (theoretical minimum of 16 but up to 30). Photosynthetic cyanobacteria probably account for the bulk of free-living biological nitrogen fixation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Based on Galloway et al. (2004), biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) accounts for almost half of the global natural sources of nitrate. Terrestrial BNF: 46% (107 teragram; 1 Tg = 1 million metric tonnes). Marine BNF: 54% (121 Tg). These are the estimated amount from natural sources, not accounting crop legumes. </p>
<p>Crop legumes cumulatively contribute to only about 21–31Tg of anthropogenic, biologically fixed nitrogen (Herridge et al., 2008). I do not know what constitutes the rest, but it wouldn't be surprising that microorganisms contribute to the bulk of it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fascinating! Thanks for the answer. I appreciate it.  </p>
<p>So, is it fair to say that many life forms do not nitrogen-fix because it is biologically costly to do so and they can simply take advantage of other life forms that do nitrogen-fix?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the correct answer. All in all, nitrogen fixation is a really cool thing to have but also a really expensive trait. Animals don't really need to do that since we simply consume nitrogen from plant materials. Plants don't really need it since as long as a small subset of noble plants are willing to take the jump, they don't worry too much about it. </p>
<p>Nitrates are also more accessible in the natural environment compared to other elements like phosphorus, hence the selection pressure for nitrogen fixing is not excessively strong enough to drive a kingdom-wide adaptation of the trait. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep - which is why the process created by man (read about Fritz Haber and the Haber process) to react nitrogen to ammonia and thereby creating fertalizer revolutionized Mankinds success and got him a nobel. He's arguably the single man most accountable for saving billions of lives in the 20th century and he did it by boosting food production capability and feeding billions. Now we don't need to be concerned about topsoil and manure as much, and can grow miles and miles of corn over and over and just spray all the sweet sweet nitrogen into the depleted ground and do it again. </p>
<p>Ironically, I believe he also created Mustard gas or something rather diabolical for the Germans. But hey, corn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! Actually, there have been a lot of effort being invested in porting the nitrogen-fixing ability from bacteria to plant. After that was considered impractical (see my next paragraph), now scientists are mostly trying to port the ability to host nitrogen-fixing bacteria from legumes to other non-legumes (say, from soybean to wheat). There is a working group called <a href="https://www.ensa.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Engineering Nitrogen Symbiosis for Africa (ENSA)</a>, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and some of the team members are in my alma mater (Aarhus University).</p>
<p>The reason why simply expressing nitrogenase in the root is not feasible is because nitrogen-fixing is a very complicated process that requires a strongly anaerobic (low oxygen) environment, as well as a host of other genes involved. In a way, you need to engineer a plant cell that can produce a new compartment that can support high levels of nitrogenase activity. In the natural symbiotic process, the plant produces membranes that encapsulates the differentiated rhizobia (the friendly bacteria), and the compartment has high levels of oxygen-binding molecules (leghemoglobin) to make it anaerobic.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It seems like the symbiotic relationship, not just fixing nitrogen, is so strong that some might consider a forest one large organism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, one of the most prevalent form of symbiosis is arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis. Mycorrhiza is a fungi that invades the roots of most terrestrial plants, where a tightly knit interface between the fungal membrane and the plant membrane occur. The fungus branches out into the soil, and acts like an extension to the plant roots. This greatly increases the total surface area of the plant root available for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>In fact, this very ancient form of symbiosis is postulated to have arisen around 450Mya, which is just about the time when marine plants start to migrate to terrestrial habitats. The running hypothesis now is that AM symbiosis is either instrumental to, or helped with, the colonisation of land by plants. Without AM symbiosis we probably will not have Earth as we know today.</p>
<p>An interesting side note: nitrogen fixing (NF) symbiosis and AM symbiosis share a hell lot of similarities, down to the genetic mechanisms. Legume researchers postulate that NF symbiosis, which emerged around 30-50Mya, is a spin off of AM symbiosis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_fixation#Non-leguminous" target="_blank">A few others have managed to do it.</a></p>
<p>Why not more is an interesting question. Perhaps nitrogen fixation is not the limiting &quot;reagent&quot; in the formula for successful plant competition? After all, there are many weedy, successful plants that aren't able to fix nitrogen.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note from that list that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azolla" target="_blank">azolla</a> is one of the plants capable of fixing its own nitrogen, and it <em>is</em> weedy as hell:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Azolla is a highly productive plant. It doubles its biomass in 3–10 days, depending on conditions, and yield can reach 8–10 tonnes fresh matter/ha in Asian rice fields. 37.8 t fresh weight/ha (2.78 t DM/ha dry weight) has been reported for Azolla pinnata in India (Hasan et al., 2009).[7]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Weedy enough it once crashed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azolla_event" target="_blank">global climate:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Azolla event occurred in the middle Eocene epoch,[1] around 49 million years ago, when blooms of the freshwater fern Azolla are thought to have happened in the Arctic Ocean. As they sank to the stagnant sea floor, they were incorporated into the sediment; the resulting draw-down of carbon dioxide has been speculated to have helped transform the planet from a &quot;greenhouse Earth&quot; state, hot enough for turtles and palm trees to prosper at the poles, to the icehouse Earth it has been since.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But other weeds- aquatic and terrestrial- apparently do not fix their own nitrogen, and seem to compete just fine without it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Very... Interesting...<br />
Hey, I have an idea!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Seriously though, is that a 'last resort' option we might be able to engineer into happening again? (Obviously with some mind to making it controllable)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The surface area required to do something like this is vast; I did the math once, figured out even if we used the whole of the Great Lakes (not warm enough, but hey- just as an example) it would barely put a dent in it. The Azolla event really had some special conditions going on at the time.</p></div>		</li>
