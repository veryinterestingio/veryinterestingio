<p>To us maybe. It took almost 4 thousand years from the 1st practical example of humans using the tides and an actual explanation as to what caused them.</p>
<p>Not all cultures in antiquity recognised (or believed) the Moon as being the cause. Many (most?) had other views which were typically related to gods (and in some cases the breathing of sea monsters).</p>
<p>edit - I made a post detailing a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/l1ryov/how_did_humans_figure_out_that_the_ocean_tides/gk237b1/" target="_blank">bunch of important contributions</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all Greeks believed it was related to the Moon, Aristotle (384—322 BC) believed they were due to the rocky nature of the coastline. Posidonius (135—51 BC) was the first Greek philosopher to notice the pattern between tides and the passage of celestial bodies. An important point to note is that although the pattern between the Moon/Sun and Earth-tides was recognised that does not imply a recognition that the Moon/Sun caused the tides. It is also a bit western-centric to attribute the observation to the Greeks as the Chinese also made such observations around the same time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proper systematic study of the tides did not really commence until around 1544-1603 with William Gilbert. This is a significant time after the earliest evidence of a practical understanding of the tides (2000BC). It is also worth noting that even Newtons proposed theory of the tides was not accepted until after his death in ~1740.  (My post in this thread details the major historical theories.).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why does that make sense? The moon is the same size/mass regardless of how much of it we see? Thus it would pull on the ocean just as much full as half, no?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason for the bi-weekly variation is that the Sun exerts tides too, though not as strong as the Moon.  So the timing of high/low tide every day is linked up with the Moon's position in the sky (eg. high tide is a little after the Moon is at zenith or nadir), and the day-to-day height of the tides is linked up with the Sun-Moon geometry, which is also the cause of the Moon's phases.  At full and new moon, the Sun and Moon are pulling together.  At half moon, they are working against each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>~50% of the effect of the Moon, although the effect on the tides is more complicated. But it's notable. <a href="https://www.tide-forecast.com/locations/New-York-New-York/tides/latest" target="_blank">Here is a random tides chart</a>. Even by eye it's clear the tides reach a maximum ~Jan 30 and ~Feb 12, which is shortly after full Moon and new Moon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It makes sense because the sun is also involved and sun, moon and earth are (roughly) lined up during new/full moon, amplifying the tides.</p></div>		</li>
