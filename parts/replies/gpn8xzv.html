			<div class="markdown"><p>You're joking but bees actually do have a voting system. I remember a doc showing how when bees  need to change nests, they will have a general vote, and they all vibrate according to their position (two types of vibrations, one for yes and one for no). Once they are all in agreement (all vibrations match) they execute the decision.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>hmmm the issue is not too much honey and pollen, the issue is space.   Bee colonies need bees  - to do work, to stay warm, to protect hive etc.   When colonies continue to gather and store food and not eat enough OR not expand space you get &quot;honey locked&quot;.    What is locked is space - remember the same cells that store food is where the queen lays eggs.<br />
So what happens with lack of space is the queen has no where to lay eggs.  IF this condition is during a time the hive should be growing the hive will take this as a signal that they need to split/swarm.<br />
Beekeepers try and avoid this either by swapping full honey comb for empty or adding space to the hive.   Bees will try and avoid this if they can by adding more comb (more space) if they can.   </p>
<p>ELI5 - more and more food means no space for having new bees, 1/2 the bees leave to find a new house with more space.</p></div>		</li>
