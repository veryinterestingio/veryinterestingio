			<div class="markdown"><p>There's loads of different ways to calm sympathetic nerves, but some only work of some people. The most common is called a vagal maneuver, which is just bearing down. The vagal nerve induces a parasympathetic response, which calms down the fight or flight response (sympathetic). Reverse psychology works, but is generally unreliable in a lot of people. The problem is the subconscious brain and body perceived a danger, and most people can't consciously turn that feeling off. Plus, you should TRY to turn it off. Evolution has trained our bodies and minds to do well at recognizing danger. Sometimes it's wrong, but most of the times, the brain is picking up on something that hasn't consciously registered yet</p></div>		</li>
