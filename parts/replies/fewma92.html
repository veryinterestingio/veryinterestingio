			<div class="markdown"><p>The cable itself isn't much more expensive. it's that converting on each end gets expensive. You need specific hardware at each conversion, also fiber cable is more sensitive to bending. So this makes it great for running long distances, and almost completely pointless/useless for short distances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially yes. Copper is cheaper. You can use silicon electronics. If you want to do anything optical on the transmit side you need GaAs, GaN or some other more expensive semiconductor. Which just makes monolithic integration harder and more expensive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For reference, look up the price of an ethernet modem+router vs. a fibre one. Literally 2-3 times the price, just because of the fibre-to-ethernet conversion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also a much more thorough answer than some of the others. Imo I like the range of responses these questions generate, from actual 5-year-old level through informed-laymen level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be honest, OP's answer is really clear and you can just get a lot of the terms from context and the big picture here is really easy to understand. Specifics like the frequency of the signal add detail for the people that already have a basic understanding of the functionality of cabling and transmission.</p></div>		</li>
