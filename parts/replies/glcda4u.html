<p>This is also why there are often population centres close to volcanos. Rich fertile soils.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thatâ€™s actually an interesting point. They have these barges that float around the lake with a pipe that goes straight down to nearly the bottom. All they have to do is start the water flow out of the pipe and then the gasses do the rest. These barges spray water hundreds of feet in the air without any power source. Just the effect of the expanding gas does this. They are trying to slowly degas the lake his way but it will take a very long time at current rates. Mixing the lake water is precisely the thing they want to avoid. In a very small scale way, this is exactly what they fear if there is an earthquake. The expanding gas would explode like a shaken pop bottle but like a pop bottle 60 kilometres across</p></div>		</li>
