			<div class="markdown"><p>Reminds me of an exhibit at the Tech Museum in San Jose, California.   It had a block of concrete with an extremely sensitive strain gauge attached, and you could push on the block with your hands, and see the deformation show up in the gauge output, even though it felt like nothing at all was happening to the concrete.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's nuts. It's been a while for me, but is there a pressure factor in that loop of equations for the cycle of the reactor? I got taught an acronym along the lines of &quot;Every fine sailor loves the fine navy...&quot;, but with the word &quot;fine&quot; probably replaced by something else?</p>
<p>I was in a commercial reactor but was surrounded by ex-Navy nukes</p></div>		</li>

<p>If I remember correctly, pressure affects both the resonance escape and fast non-leakage probabilities, but it's been a while for me as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was no &quot;heavy water&quot; in any large quantities found in Navy reactors.  Just regular water used as both moderator and coolant. There was no need for the &quot;extra dense heavy water&quot; as a moderator in the naval reactors since the fuel is so highly enriched it can function with regular water.  In reactors with less rich fuel it takes an extra efficient moderator(ie heavy water) in order to make sustained fission efficient/possible.</p>
<p>The moderator is what reflects neutrons back into the core to cause more fissions. In naval reactors there is such a high concentration of fuel that regular water will work just fine. In commercial reactors where the fuel is much less dense they need a more tightly packed moderator to reflect the neutrons back into the core so they use heavy water.</p></div>		</li>
