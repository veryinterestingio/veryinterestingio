			<div class="markdown"><p>On a somewhat related note. Some wild mice (deer mice in particular) carry an even more fatal disease called Hantavirus which can cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome; similair symptoms to Covid-19 but higher mortality rate overall! This is why there's special procedures for cleaning mice droppings or clearing out a mouse infestation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a man riding a bus in China who died from that virus in the third week of March.  </p>
<p>Luckily this virus isn’t new and tends to spread via direct contact with the animal’s waste. Not  so much human to human. Let’s hope it stays that way.</p></div>		</li>
