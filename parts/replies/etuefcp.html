			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: for some reason all the vowels in English basically shifted away from the vowel sounds used on the continent, this happened around the same time that the printing press was getting traction and literacy rates were going up.  So spellings which up to that time had been pretty loose, became standardized at the same time that the sounds were all changing. And that's why vowels are completely crazy in English spelling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I studied Latin, one of the first things we learned was that all the vowels are pronounced differently than in modern English. And each vowel only has one pronunciation! It is so much easier. I love Latin!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just the vowels in the spelling, but yes, the Great Vowel Shift was going on. However, the people who had the printing press were mostly those in the upper classes who at the time didn't have the shift, and thought people who did have the shift were low class and &quot;not speaking right&quot;. So they were the ones who kept the older middle English spellings, and the printing press was a major reason for the spelling standardization. So at the end of the day, our ridiculous spelling issues were created by people who didn't understand language change. And the circle continues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, silent letters occur in many languages. The sound changes that cause silent letters are universal, whether a language has silent letters or not depends on how long spellings have been frozen. Some languages have undergone relatively recent spelling reforms, so they don't have many silent letters. English and French spellings have been mostly unchanged for 400+ years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since semitic languages are a separate group this is not a case of language heritage but instead cultural osmosis, loanwords. Ie, when crusaders/pilgrims/traders encountered something that they didn't really have a word for before they borrowed the arabic word. While Europe decided to go &quot;Nah. We're can't afford to remember stuff like concrete, sewers, aqueducts or stuff like that&quot; after the roman collapse most of our sciences decided to chill in the Islamic caliphate for a while, where arabic scholars borrowed from roman, greek, persian and indian science/medicine to create the scientific part of the Islamic Golden Age (8th century to 14th century)</p>
<p>I think the most interesting of these loanwords is Chemistry.Chemistry is derived from Alchemy, which is derived from the Arabic &quot;Al-kimiya&quot; (the art of metallurgy), which is in itself derived from an even more ancient term meaning &quot;the Egyptian art&quot; which may or may not have taken a detour through ancient greek before ending up in the arabic language.</p></div>		</li>
