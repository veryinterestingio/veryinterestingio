<p>Republicans tried to make that taxable income a couple years ago.  Imagine having to pay taxes on 130K in pretend money you never actually received.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The tuition waiver is not nearly so high in most universities. I am a research scientist at a large, R1 institution and our tuition waiver is $12k / year. All in a grad student here cost a little over $50k / year. To get a qualified person dedicated to doing some research that benefits you it is actually a good deal overall.</p></div>		</li>
