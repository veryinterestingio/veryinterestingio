			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d say grainy or gritty both describe it very well but those are not words often used to describe the sensation of chewing so they don’t come to people’s minds when talking about eating. But eating sand, and similarly eggshell, is gritty</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did research on this contrasting English with various West African languages and Japanese who have significant numbers of words for taste, texture, etc. I had people with no prior knowledge of this come in for a three course meal, one from each region, and describe the tastes and textures. The speakers all were comprised of three people, native speakers of their language, and the same age group. The Japanese and West Africans seemed to have no trouble describing the food. The English speakers had a harder time, especially with texture. They often resorted to comparing the food to other things like weed or food from Mordor. Possibly my favorite research I’ve ever done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry about that, thought the conclusion seemed obvious, haha. The people from West Africa and Japan had a much easier time describing the food they ate. The English speakers struggled to find the words and often resorted to describing how the food looked instead of texture. They also related food to other things from weed nugs to food from Mordor.</p></div>		</li>
