			<div class="markdown"><p>An interesting side note is that gravity does not decrease very quickly with elevation. So taking a zeppelin to max altitude would not lead to a noticeable difference in gravity. Even the astronauts that are “floating” in the International Space Station <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/nasa-knows/what-is-microgravity-58.html" target="_blank">would experience 90% of their earth-gravity</a> if they were able to stay still. It’s really the orbiting that gives them the illusion of weightlessness, the same way that a person would perceive weightlessness in a falling airplane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No.  Because they were still falling, just falling around something else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even when traveling to the moon the astronauts were in free fall at all times except when they were performing an orbital maneuver. During these maneuvers they felt the thrust from the rocket engine as a force of acceleration, but they experienced weightlessness the rest of the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And to add to your note, because gravity falls with the square of distance, it won't take too large a distance before the lack of gravity becomes significant.</p>
<p>A simple equation to find the distance to the Earth's surface D for any given strength of gravity relative to Earth's surface is:</p>
<p>D = 3960/√(G%/100) - 3960</p>
<p>The distance at which Earth's gravity is 50% of surface gravity is 3960/(√.5) - 3960 ≈ 1640 miles, or about 6.5 times the distance of the ISS.</p>
<p>100(3960/(D + 3960))^2 = G%</p>
<p>Conversely, the above equation gives you the strength of Earth's gravity for any distance D.</p>
<p>At the distance of the Moon, Earth's gravity is 0.014%</p></div>		</li>

<p>At the center of a spherical Earth of uniform density, you would accelerate equally in every direction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is true even if a spherical Earth didn't have uniform density, as long as the density variations were concentric spheres. The non homogeneous, but still perfectly concentric spherical layers, density case changes what the gravitational acceleration at points throughout the sphere would be and deviate from what you would calculate for a uniform density sphere, but at the center, everything would still average out to 0, i.e. you are being 'pulled' equally in all directions so experience no acceleration.</p></div>		</li>

<p>but there would be more mass between you and the surface of the Earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mass between you and the surface of the Earth does not matter. By the shell theorem, the mass above you perfect cancels out.</p></div>		</li>
