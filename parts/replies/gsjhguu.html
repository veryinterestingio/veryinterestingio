			<div class="markdown"><p>I have epilepsy (not photosensitive), and yeah it’s absolutely crazy!! There should be a seizure warning in the trailers of movies (and before tv shows as well!!) so people who <em>are</em> photosensitive know “hey this one is probably not a good idea.” </p>
<p>Something I really appreciate is when YouTubers have a warning at the beginning of their video that there will be flashing lights or right before it happens so people have a minute to skip ahead. I really hope Hollywood wisens up and adds seizure warnings.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The only thing better than a warning is not having that at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tom Scott did an excellent video on the subject. This is about sponsored content, but the same process applies to all “warning labels.”</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say because you're looking at a game made way more recently than 28 Weeks Later. Photosensitive warnings, while not nonexistent, were much less common even five years ago than they are now.</p></div>		</li>
