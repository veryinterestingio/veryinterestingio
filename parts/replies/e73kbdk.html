			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. I find when people use the term restart that's where they get confused. Because you could answer the question of &quot;Does a defibrillator restart the heart?&quot; in 2 different ways....</p>
<p>When people say &quot;restart&quot;, it can mean 2 things: electrically restarting or mechanically (pump function) restarting. So by resetting electrical activity, and can restore pumping function so in this way actually can &quot;restart&quot; the heart's pumping. But it doesn't 'restart' a stopped (meaning absent, asystolic, flat-lined, non-existent) heart rhythm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. No, it does not 'restart' a stopped heart. But it does 'restart' in the same way you reboot you computer: it turns it &quot;off&quot; and &quot;on&quot; again.</p>
<p>Edit: Changed 'restart' for 'reboot' in the computer analogy</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's brilliant about these new defibrillators is that they tell you exactly what to do. So if it's not a shockable rhythm, it'll tell you to do chest compressions etc. Hopefully that gets them into a shockable rhythm. Cardiac arrest has very low survival rates, but these machines do help. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So can I still feel a pulse? If I don't, do I start compression until I get a pulse then administer AED? Cause I read somewhere that the AED machine will tell that there's no pulse. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You won't feel a pulse.  You should use the AED immediately.  Chest compressions won't restart a stopped heart.  You aren't going to get a pulse from doing chest compressions.  Compressions just push the blood through the body for the stopped heart until the paramedics can come and restart the heart with drugs.</p>
<p>The AED isn't checking for a pulse.  It's checking the electrical rhythms of the heart.  If it's a rhythm the AED knows it needs to stop, it'll advise a shock.  If it's a rhythm it won't be effective on, it'll tell you no shock is advised and will tell you to keep doing chest compressions to keep the blood flowing until the paramedics get there.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wow. I had no idea. I suppose it's not important to know that distinction necessarily but I wish someone explained that to me when I took a CPR course ages ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can get a pulse from good chest compressions. </p>
<p>Chest compressions alone will occasionally result in the heart beating again. </p>
<p>I’ve seen both these things happen on several occasions. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chest compressions are literally the only intervention shown by evidence-based-medicine to have positive outcomes in cardiac arrest.  Not epi, not amio, not tPA, not intubation/MV.  Chest compressions.</p>
<p>You can feel a pulse with quality compressions.  And compressions alone are sometimes sufficient to achieve ROSC.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The AED itself will tell you whether or not it can be used.  If you can't find a pulse or it's weird and fluttery, you should hook the AED up and turn it on.  It will run a diagnostic on the patient and will say &quot;pulse recommended &quot; before instructing you how to deliver the shock. If one is not needed, it will say so and won't activate the button that delivers the shock.  It may tell you to keep chest compressions going.</p>
<p>That being said, if theres a cardiac event but the pulse is still there, you should have the AED set up and on the patient or within arm's reach with pads connected.  I had someone's heart stop when I was in the middle of trying to get their airway clear. I had the AED right there and set up, and the paramedics had just rolled in.  They were literally able to slap the pads on the patient and start compressions in about 5 seconds because I had it prepped and ready to go. Patient didn't make it in the end but it turned out that this particular incident was her third heart attack in two years so....... ?‍♀️</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just want to add that it is not recommended for civilians to try and find a pulse from an unconscious person. They should just start CPR (chest compressions) while another person gets the AED.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, this.  There's a study I've read that was testing nurses and EMTs on finding a pulse, and found that in 10 seconds (the recommended time to check) they were barely better than a coin flip at determining if a patient had a pulse or not. It took a full 26 seconds for them to reach a level of certainty to give accurate answers.</p>
<p>If nurses and EMTs are this uncertain, your random responder on the street is going to waste a ton of time, and in these situations seconds matter.  Plus if they aren't breathing and have a pulse it's only a matter of minutes for that to change.  So start CPR and use the AED because the AED won't shock if it isn't needed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of my many recert CPR instructors used to say that in babies and small children most heart issues are mechanical and most likely the only time you might actually  restart someone's heart. Adult cardiac events are almost always electrical problems and CPR mostly serves to maintain blood/oxygen flow to the brain until a defibrillator can be started. Most defibrillators that are in publicly accessible spaces are automatic. They tell you where to place the pads then decide if a shock is needed and administers the shock without outside input. </p></div>		</li>
