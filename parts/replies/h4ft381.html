			<div class="markdown"><p>There is significant evidence of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangean_megamonsoon" target="_blank">megamonsoon</a>. Evidence of hurricanes would be very difficult to tease out of this larger climate pattern as the traces would be similar. There hasn't been a whole lot of research into this topic, (and is outside my own wheelhouse) but my understanding is that paleoclimatologists generally agree with your supposition.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Somewhere in central America. I'll try to scare up the article.</p>
<p>No where near Pangaea time frames though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They also would have had less land area at risk of hurricane strikes. The vast majority would have never made landfall. Think about now, how few hurricanes hit land, and that's less than half (maybe even a quarter) of all of them that form. Our land area at risk of strikes is almost triple that of Pangaea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True but life would still have generally lived near the coasts. On the one hand there was less coastline, but on the other hand the interior of Pangaea would have been an uninhabitable desert vaster than any we have now. So probably a lower proportion of life super near the coast, but maybe not to the extent the simple fraction of land area would make one think.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is my thinking. Any volcanic islands dotted in the middle of Panthalassa would be tiny isolated Oases in a vast ocean. The steep cliffs would allow cold nutrient rich water to well up to support a whole ecosystem. The rest would be very similar to vast stretches of the Pacific. These are the ocean equivalent of deserts. Nutrient poor water that can't sustain algal growth which is the bedrock of most oceanic ecosystems. Can you imagine the kind evolution that would go on around these islands? Sadly such fossil records would have been completely destroyed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ferns are a major colonizer of islands because spores can travel a very long way on the wind, so  I would expect that a lot of islands would be dominated by ferns and other spore plants.  </p>
<p>I would also love to see what life on some of these super isolated islands looked like.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Coconuts can float and be carried by currents for miles and miles before washing up on a beach and growing. So there may be an ancient equivalent or two that could travel the same way. I wouldn't imagine much in the way of smaller plants, since those seeds aren't as buoyant, but it's possible even without birds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the islands will have been mostly barren unfortunately. As you said there were no birds then. Pterosaurs appeared about 230 million years when Pangea still existed but I doubt they would have been capable of traversing the vast ocean if they even felt so inclined. IMO there would have been a rich marine ecosystem around these islands.</p></div>		</li>
