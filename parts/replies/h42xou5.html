			<div class="markdown"><p>You're referring to the xiphoid process, and you need a lot of pressure to snap it, like what is applied in CPR, except that if you're doing CPR, you shouldn't be that low on the chest, and thus shouldn't break it if performing CPR. Your abs and your diaphragm are attached to it, and your diaphragm is more prone to being lacerated by it breaking off than your liver, but both can happen. If you're capable of applying that much pressure in a fight, you would be better to apply it to the head to have the fight over with ASAP, not try to aim for a 4-6cm tiny bone.</p></div>		</li>
