			<div class="markdown"><p>We have one of those floor to ceiling windows in the front of the house and since I've been working in that room since covid wfh, I can basically watch all day with my dog. I wonder how many delivery people get to the door and the person is already there, waiting, before they even ring the bell. Or face pressed against window waiting for them to drop it and leave?</p></div>		</li>
