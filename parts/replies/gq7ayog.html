			<div class="markdown"><p>The generated wave isn't stepped and is <strong>exactly the same</strong> as the original recorded waveform.  There is <strong>no</strong> approximation here.</p>
<p>Note that the originally recorded waveform has been cut off at 22000 Hz -- nothing above that is recorded.  But we can't heard anything up there anyway.</p>
<p>The digital data, when passed through a DAC, generated the <strong>exact same smooth waveform</strong> that was recorded, limited to that 22000Hz cutoff.</p>
<p>So if you were to put on a pair of headphones that cut off all sound around you above 22000Hz, and then listened to a digital recording of that same sound, the waveform hitting your ears is exactly the same.</p>
<p>Have a watch of these two videos for a more in-depth discussion on just why this is the case, and why the waveform isn't stepped.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree, finite bit depth introduces noise which prevents the original signal from being reproduced. Obviously all analogue formats also are subject to noise, but that doesn't change the fact that a digital file is only an approximation of the true waveform.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Finite bit depth is only about the noise floor, nothing else.  If the noise floor is below what you can hear, and you can still capture your loudest sounds, there is nothing to be gained by increasing the bit depth - absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>Arguing there is &quot;more there&quot; is like saying a digital image on a screen doesn't faithfully reproduce the same image in print form, because the print form emits more infrared light than the digital one.  Perhaps, but we can't see IR so there is zero difference in image quality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be perfect if we had perfect low pass filters (everything above a certain frequency gets cut off, everything bellow passes without attenuation), but we don't. Real world low pass filters just attenuate high frequencies more than low ones and there's a region where the attenuation really skyrockets and that's what we cell the cutoff frequency, but it's not a sharp cutoff. That's where the imprecision comes from.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So long as there are enough values and short enough timesteps the digital shape is a close enough approximation to the true shape that no human can hear the difference. </p>

<p>It's actually better than that. For any given sound, you can identically and continuously replicate the sound through sampling if you use a sampling rate of at least twice its frequency. This is mathematically provable. See: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem" target="_blank">The Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem</a>.</p></div>		</li>
