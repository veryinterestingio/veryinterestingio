When you take a shot of vodka, for example, much of the alcohol can be absorbed before it even reaches the stomach. Something like beer will have most of the alsohol absorbed in the stomach or intestines. </p>
<p>Alcohol is most readily absorbed in the intestines. If there is no food in your stomach, the alcohol will basically go straight through the stomach to the intestines. Thatâ€™s why drinking on an empty stomach is so dramatically different than with a meal. If you have food in your stomach, the alcohol will sit there and be absorbed more slowly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For alcohol, you could even have vapour entering via your lungs, though I guess that would be a minimal effect.</p>

You just need a bicycle pump and a bottle with some alcohol. Create vacuum in bottle, suddenly release vacuum: Bottle filled with a cloud of ethanol.</p></div>		</li>
