Especially compared to double-stranded DNA, which is extremely stable in comparison to single-stranded mRNA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to Paul Offit recently interviewed on Peter Attia's podcast, it's because mRNA is labile, ie breaks down easily.</p>
<p>mRNA vaccine developed by Pfizer/Biontech uses a proprietary liposomal (eg fat) encasement to stabilize the mRNA delivery into cells, while Moderna uses another. Hence different storage temp requirements. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a myth that floats around in molecular bio labs about RNA being unstable. It's not. It's just as inherently stable as DNA and can be stored at room temp, no problem. <em>HOWEVER</em> there are a <em>ton</em> of RNA-degrading enzymes all over the place that can chew up RNA. The same is not true for DNA. So, if you have pure RNA that is kept in a clean nuclease-free vial or tube, it's totally stable, no freezing required. As mentioned above, the temperature requirements are mostly due to the other stuff in the vaccines (the lipids, etc) that need to be kept at low temp.</p></div>		</li>
