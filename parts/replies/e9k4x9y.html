			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know of any no-teleportation theorem, as long as you consider quantum teleportation as light-bound. You can certainly &quot;quantum teleport&quot; a squeezed state.</p>
<p>Did you mean the no-cloning theorem? That has nothing to do with squeezing itself, it's rather a quantum information theory result. It stays true no matter what, you couldn't clone a squeezed state, or any other quantum state for that matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was only sort of off on my definitions, been a while since I had focus on that side of CS. No-teleportation is &quot;can't represent quantum state accurately using classical bits&quot; it's a symptom of no-cloning.</p>
<p>I was trying to ask is the &quot;squeezed state&quot; was copying information, but I'm pretty sure I misunderstood what the squeezed state actually is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Standard Quantum Limit for repetitive position measurement of a free mass arises from the relation x(t) = x(0) + p(0)*T/m where T is the time between the two measurements, the first being performed at t = 0 and the second at t = T. It has been proved by Yuen et al (1983) that some initial states of the free mass end up reducing to a state that reduces the spread of the wavefunction for a certain time after the first measurement. However, Caves later showed that, if we take the uncertainty Δx(0)  of the first measurement to be smaller than the resolution sigma of the apparatus, then, the variance of the second measurement, which the apparatus gives us to be the spread of the wavefunction at the time of the second measurement squared ( Δx(T)^(2)) + sigma squared, which is greater than  Δx(0)^(2) +  Δx(T)^(2), which by the uncertainty relation between  Δx(0) and  Δx(T) comes to be greater than the exact value that Yuen had claimed to breach. So, in conclusion, while Yuen managed to make the second measurement of the free mass break the SQL, <em>repetitive</em> measurement hasn't yet acquired the precision. The ambiguity here is whether the value Δx(0) is the spread of the wavefunction before or after the measurement? Does the measurement give us the state the system as <em>just before</em> the measurement, or the state that it has reduced into <em>after</em> the measurement?</p>
<p>SQL generally does not equal HUP. In optics, shot noise of the photon count that makes the uncertainty in the estimated phase of the interferometer vary with the inverse square root of photon number is called the SQL, whereas the HUP has it vary with the inverse of the photon number. In this case, the SQL has been breached theoretically using squeezed states and N00N states, and my question is whether the <em>SQL</em> has been breached in the case of the repetitive measurement. In the review article by Giovanetti et al (2004), they show the above derivation by Cave equaling the HUP and SQL, but then go on to say that &quot;The standard quantum limit is not a fundamental precision threshold. However, at present its conquest is still an open experimental challenge.&quot; So how are they saying that it's not fundamental if it's equal to the HUP? Also, this was in 2004, so my question was also about the consensus today, about the definitions of resolution(sigma) and precision, about whether SQL is fundamental or not, and what research is going on in the field, if any.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know quantum optics and time-domain measurements enough to answer your question completely.</p>
<p>That said, my understanding is that in most fields the SQL is the <em>naturally occurring</em> quantum limit when you have <em>standard</em> common states. Thus it might not coincide with HUP if the saturation of its uncertainties requires a complex engineered state (Squeezed, Fock, Bell, etc.).</p></div>		</li>
