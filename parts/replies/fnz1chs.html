			<div class="markdown"><p>> A house fan only needs to move relatively little air at high efficiency</p>
<p>A house fan is also stationary, and unconcerned about drag in the direction of its spindle.  A propellor contributes drag as well as thrust, so increasing the frontal area of the blades increases drag.  If an engine fails the propellor is _pure_ drag; aircraft are fitted with feathering mechanisms to pivot the blades to the position of minimum drag, but it still isn't zero.  Even with the blades feathered if they are close enough to each other to interact that too induces drag.  An aircraft with a stopped engine and a many-bladed fan would not be a fun place to be.</p>
<p>All of this is why constant-speed propellors were developed, to minimum the frontal area of the propellor as much as possible.    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant-speed_propeller" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant-speed\_propeller" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant-speed\_propeller</a></a></p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't think the amount of blades on the propeller or turbine really come into play for most anyone in that scenario.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Assuming they start at a reasonable altitude, planes can glide surprisingly far without power.</p>
<p>Even something like a 747 has a glide ratio of about 16 to 1 - so for every metre of altitude, it can travel 16m forward.</p>
<p>At cruising height, that might mean it can glide about 100 miles (160km), so if you're over land, that is often enough to get to a runway. Obviously a shit situation, but not as hopeless at it would first appear.</p>
<p>But the more drag, the worse that ratio becomes, and the less likely it is the plane will make it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are plenty of two, three and four engined propellor aircraft in service.  All are perfectly flyable on n-1 engines provided the propellor is feathered.</p>
<p>Even for a single engine aircraft, with the propellor feathered they usually have decent glide ratio and can trade altitude for distance.</p>
<p>In both cases, a many-bladed fan would be seriously bad; for a multi, the asymmetric drag, as well as the drag itself, would make the plan hugely challenging to fly, and on a single, the glide ratio would be massively worse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You've missed two important things though.</p>
<p>For the same rotational speed, you can only increase your blade length so far. At a certain point that blade will start to break the speed of sound, and at that point efficiency drops and sound levels go up. This isn't a big deal for house fans, but is for propellers.</p>
<p>So if you are at the limit of how long your 2 blade prop can be, the only thing you can do is go to 3 blades. 3 blade props are less efficient than 2 blades, as each blade is travelling through more disturbed air. Think of it like drafting another vehicle, it's more efficient for your vehicle as the air has been pushed out of your way already. The same thing happens to a prop but with a prop you are wanting the air to be there so the blade has something to bite into.</p>
<p>We have a Cessna ag Wagon with a 520cu in engine, and a Cessna 180 with a 470 cu in engine. Both have 2 blade props. The ag Wagon makes an incredibly loud high pitched noise on takeoff, that is because the 2 blade prop is spinning so fast the tips are breaking the speed of sound. A common stc (modification) for those planes is to go to a 3 blade prop to quieten them down. You lose some efficiency, but gain alot of comfort with a quieter plane. </p>
<p>Our 470 cu in Cessna 180 doesn't have this problem as the engine speed/prop length combination doesn't result in the speed of sound being broken. A 3 blade prop is not a common stc (mod) for them as sound level is not an issue, and you'd just be losing efficiency. Around 500 cu in (generally) is the point on small planes where 3 blade props start making sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Please see my answer replying to the same comment. Disclaimer I don't design propellers, I just work on planes.</p>
<p>It seems the general design principal is determine amount of thrust required and profile of blades. Start with fewest number of blades possible, increase length until required thrust is obtained or blade tips hit the speed of sound.</p>
<p>If you get to required thrust first, stop you have your design. If you hit the speed of sound first, reduce length and add another blade. Keep increasing length until you hit thrust required or speed of sound. Keep repeating until you have your blade design.</p>
<p>Very simplified I'm sure, but this seems to be the process for planes I work on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also not an expert, but I've heard another consideration is turbulence.  At least for windmills, adding extra blades means the blades are moving through air still roiling from the passage of the previous blade, which reduces efficiency, and thus power generation.</p></div>		</li>
