			<div class="markdown"><p>All galaxies are roughly the age of the universe, they were formed relatively quickly after the big bang. Globular clusters surrounding the Milky Way are leftovers from this era and they're easily 10 billion years old. Our Solar System, on the other hand, is only 4.5 billion years old.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would it not then be beneficial to categorize galaxies into generations? I mean, none of the stars in our galaxy today existed 10bn years ago afaik, so I would guess that we're apart of the 2nd or 3rd generation of stars in the Milky way, right? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While on the topic of universal age, there’s a question I’ve had for awhile now. </p>
<p>In which direction have we concluded that the universe is 14 billion years? Thinking of a circle, if we only look in one direction we only get the radius, or half the total. Do we get 14 billion for the universe because looking in one direction we get events from 9.5 billion years ago, and then 180 degrees the other way we get 4.5 billion for the age of our solar system?</p>
<p>I’m curious what direction points to “old” universe and what direction points to “new” universe. It cannot just be 14b in one direction because that’d imply that we’re at the edge of the universe. </p>
<p>And on that, is the universe (still poorly) better thought of as a sphere with the Big Bang at the center, or a cone with the Big Bang at the tip and everything is expanding out into only positive x-axis?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our modern galaxy is the result of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-25dEcY-WU" target="_blank">countless mergers of smaller galaxies</a>. Due to the effects of special relativity and assuming you consider all the progenitor galaxies as one and the same it is likely that from our perspective our galaxy is the oldest galaxy in the universe.</p>
<p>We will experience <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4disyKG7XtU" target="_blank">one last giant galactic collision</a> with Andromeda in about 4 billion years, after which the resulting galaxy (often called Milkdromeda), along with a few dozen small satellite galaxies, will be completely isolated from the rest of the universe due to the effects of dark energy. Trillions of years in the future all other galaxies will have moved beyond the cosmic event horizon and left the observable universe, making our galaxy not only the first but also the last galaxy in the universe.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And our planet is the result of the merger of at least a couple planets.  There were perhaps as many as 20 &quot;planets&quot; (definition of a planet being challenged at the moment I believe) in the young solar system.  One of those planets - Thea - collided with the young earth and today at least part of our core is suspected to be a part of Thea.  Disclaimer:  I'm not up on the very latest on all this - my knowledge is a decade or more old here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Milky Way contains stars, still shining to this day, that formed when the Universe was only a few hundred million years old, implying that the Milky Way is about as ancient as anything in the Universe can be.

			<div class="markdown"><p>An important disclaimer has to be added to all of this, though: we don't know how supermassive black holes accrete. </p>
<p>A lot of research, including the one you linked above for <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/370/1/289/1026607" target="_blank">gas cloud collapse</a>, relies on the Bondi model of accretion, or slight variations to it. This model assumes that the system is about as ideal as it can get, with a perfectly homogeneous, warm, spherical cloud accreting directly to the surface. But this is unphysical and we know it. Just like how the planets sit in a plane, gas will rotate and accrete through a relatively narrow disk too. In addition, many disks are <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.01489.pdf" target="_blank">not homogeneous</a>, and will feature multiple phases where temperature, density, pressure, etc all vary. They are also <em>temporally</em> variable, so this distribution not only changes with position but also with time, and this is something that we see as variability in the light-curve of the object. </p>
<p>On top of that, add in all the ways that supermassive black holes can interact with their host galaxy. They often produce huge jets of material which <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0806.4570.pdf" target="_blank">can affect star formation</a> in the host galaxy, but can also <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1108.0110.pdf" target="_blank">influence accretion</a>, perhaps leading to jets turning themselves off. The idea being that gas must cool down before it can accrete in order to fuel the jets, but the jets themselves prevent this cooling, thereby starving themselves until they shut off, allowing cooling to resume and reigniting the jets, just for this process to repeat itself again and again. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this related to the thing where some SMBHs seem to have super high angular momentum and some don't? I seem to recall hearing that the low angular momentum SMBHs are likely the ones that collected a bunch of smaller black holes with a range of different angular momenta thus cancelling out. However there are some that have just insane angular momenta that we don't know how they formed. Not an astrophysicist, just going off memory from a podcast. Would love Insight into this though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our current gravitational wave observatories (LIGO and VIRGO) are only sensitive to high frequency (hundreds of Hz) gravitational waves. Tight SMBH binaries would give off much lower frequency waves that we can't yet detect. Detection of such waves would require observatories far larger than our planet. <a href="http://cdn.media.discovermagazine.com/~/media/images/bonus/gravity/redshiftSpectrum.jpg?mw=2000" target="_blank">There are tentative plans for space-based observatories a few decades in the future that could potentially detect these events</a>. LISA and eLISA would utilize space probes millions of km apart orbiting the Sun, and Nanograv would use nearby pulsars to simulate an observatory lightyears across.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>PBS spacetime discussed this, and concluded that it is possible but would be unlikely to happen on an observable time scale. The problem is that the SMBHs are so old that they are all now very far from each other. If two are to collide now, it is like two arrows fired from opposing sides of the solar system striking each other mid flight. It can happen theoretically,  but within the observable universe, it is vanishingly unlikely to occur. </p></div>		</li>
