<p>reverse repo</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Its a form of loaning money with stock as security.</p>
<p>This what the Fed says:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What are the reverse repurchase agreement operations (RRPs) conducted by the Desk? </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>a transaction in which the Desk sells a security to an eligible counterparty with an agreement to repurchase that same security at a specified price at a specific time in the future. The difference between the sale price and the repurchase price, together with the length of time between the sale and purchase, implies a rate of interest paid by the Federal Reserve on the transaction.</p>
