			<div class="markdown"><p>This is just from Cleveland Clinic site:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A neuropsychological evaluation is a test to measure how well a person's brain is working. The abilities tested include reading, language usage, attention, learning, processing speed, reasoning, remembering, problem-solving, mood and personality and more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And..</p>
<blockquote>
<p>mental functions tested include:</p>
<p>General intellect.
Reading/reading comprehension.
Language usage and understanding of what others say.
Attention/concentration.
Processing speed.
Learning and memory.
Reasoning.
Executive functions, which are higher-level skills you use to organize and plan, manage your time, problem solve, multi-task, make judgments and maintain self-control.
Visuospatial skills.
Motor speed and dexterity.
Mood and personality.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From sociological theories of knowledge, societies place greater value on knowledge associated with upper class white men. For instance, historically women have needed a lot of knowledge to be housewives; budgeting, first aid, nutrition, proper chemicals for different household tasks, but that was given less value than a deep knowledge of Shakespeare. </p>
<p>So when white, non-working class (to be able to access education) men designed these tests they would have set the language standards as their own, not dialects spoken by other sections of society. The knowledge they would have expected as standard would not be the same as the standard knowledge for different lives, knowledge that they likely lack.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the difference between standard english and AAVE isnt great enough to throw off the tests to the degree that we see, since english isnt big enough of a factor in these tests to make the difference. also, they adjusted for economic, and educational differences, meaning a white person and a black person of the same background are scoring differently on this test on average.</p>
<p>also, its not like an old-school reading test for voting, its not based off knowledge of the constitution or something, its measuring shit like reaction time, attention span, memory capacity, visuospacial skills. none of that is &quot;based on what a white man was taught&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If your test gives a quantified value, you can calibrate the test separately for each group. It's like how &quot;above average height&quot; is different for men and women because the average is different.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If one group of similarly situated people (age, sex, education, etc.) who are white have an average score of 20 with an SD of 4, and another group of similarly situated people (same factors) who are black have an average score of 18 with an SD of 4, and you're evaluating a black patient, you use 18 - 4 = 14 as your threshold for impairment rather than 20 - 4 = 16. So, for example, a white patient with a score of 15 would count as impaired, but a black patient with a score of 15 would not be. </p>
<p>Please note that the numbers I just gave are examples that have no particular relationship to reality.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It seems to me like medical science is saying a bunch if african americans that should be in the normal range are showing up as cognitively impaired...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, that's what they said. Without adjusting the norms, far more black people would potentially be assessed as having a neuropsychological disorder than would be expected. Therefore, <strong>because it's not true</strong> that almost half of black people are NP impaired, the norms require adjustment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Seems to me, unless you want to claim african americans are dumber than whiteys, you probably just arent controlling for enough factors. I didnt see socio-economic background or early life trauma being controlled for. Seems to me these are the dominant factors in just about anything.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The point of these tests is not to determine whether white people or black people are smarter</em>. The point of the tests is to provide a quick, objective, consistent way of evaluating someone's NP performance relative to what would be expected. </p>
<p>The more factors you attempt to control for, the less relevant your research becomes and the more history you need to collect from your subject, which may or may not be possible and the information may or may not be reliable. Furthermore, the study and associated statistical testing demonstrates that race is an adequate <em>proxy</em> for whatever the underling cause actually is to provide significant predictive power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we're looking at the NFL, they're all at high risk for brain injuries.  It seems like getting a baseline when they start would really solve this issue.  That way after an injury you can compare and measure degraded neurologic function for each individual.</p>
<p>Race itself is not the causal factor, but (in the general population) it is an indicator of an underlying factor that isn't easy to identify.  The population of football players is so small, I would be interested to see if the effect you cite is present in when analysing just NFLers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The NFL actually requires players to take a number of tests in the process of declaring for the draft. One of the most famous being the Wonderlic Test. </p>
<p>The trouble is a lot of the players don't take some of the tests seriously, and while it might hurt their draft stock to be seen as irresponsible or illiterate because they got a bad score on a cognitive test, good players still end up having good, long careers.</p>
<p>For example, how do you correlate neurological damage for someone like Frank Gore, who has had a 15 year NFL career to date, who plays the running back position with a particularly physical style that doesn't shy away from contact, but who got an extremely low score of 6 on his Wonderlic? </p>
<p>Furthermore, some players have said (I know for a fact that Pat McAfee has mentioned it with AJ Hawk on his podcast) that they intentionally downplay their intelligence when giving baselines for the concussion protocol, so that they aren't held out of games for minor concussions. How do you incentivize them to give a proper test when they're afraid of being punished for being held from playing because of an injury?</p></div>		</li>

<p>By telling them that they'll miss out on the payout when they actually have severe concussion that permanently gets them out of the game.</p></div>		</li>
