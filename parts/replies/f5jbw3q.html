			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you explain the sequence by which the xenon poisoning occurred in a little more detail?  I have never fully understood this, and the combination of what I have already read, your explanation above, and the second source you cite leave me a little confused.</p>
<p>On page 18, the source says the reactor had originally been running at 3200MWt, and they reduced it to 1600-1500MWt in preparation for the test.  This got extended, as you said, before they finally attempted to reduce it to the lower level for the test.  I don't understand the dynamics of xenon creation and destruction well enough to see how this longer interim power level raised the level in the core; can you help me with this?</p>
<p>Also, page 18 says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The  necessity  of  the  withdrawal  of  practically  all  absorbers  out  the  core  was  dictated  by  a  very  strong  xenon  poisoning as a result of very quick decrease of the reactor power.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sounds like OP's claim that the abrupt lowering caused the xenon poisoning rather than the other way around.  What am I missing here?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the fission products of the uranium is xenon. At normal operation, it is burned off as quickly as it is formed, so it's not a problem. But running at decreased power for so long allowed it to build up instead of burning off like normal. I'm not super clear on why turning the power down further (to get to the goal of 700 MW) was enough to make the power level plummet to 30 MW/why it didn't start dropping sooner while it was being held at 1600 MW.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Uranium-235 fission produces Iodine-135, which beta decays with a half-life of about 6.5 hours into Xe-135 . And Xe-135 beta decays with a half-life of about 9 hours into Cs-135 . So even after shutting off a reactor, Xe-135 will continue to accumulate at the rate of U-235 fission from about 6 hours prior.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just replied to another user who had a similar concern, but essentially xenon continues to be produced after lowering the power. Xe-135 is not a prompt fission product, rather is arises from the decay of I-135, which is a fission product and has a half-life of 6.7 hours. After lowering power, I-135 production also decreases, but Xe-135 continues to increase until the competing half-lives of Xe-135 (9.1 hours) and I-135 (6.7 hours) reach equilibrium, after which xenon concentration in the core will begin to decrease. Hence, maximum xenon concentration occurs several hours <em>after</em> lowering the power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And that's why the dispatcher's delay was 'helpful', since the maximum concentration period had passed by that point. An earlier test would have fallen close to the maximum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know why I even bother posting this anymore, but the power surge had nothing to do with the dissipation of xenon.</p>
<p>The power surge was caused by the falling control rods, which entered the bottom of the core where there was very little xenon to begin with.</p>
<p>Really irritating that the HBO version of events has so completely infected the science sub.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is my understanding that the control rods were made of boron with graphite tips - which (due to the graphite) momentarily increased thermal power when inserted. This was a design flaw in the RBMK which was unknown to the operators at the time. This spike in thermal load boiled the water - combined with the safety systems being disabled for the test - etc. etc. etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>really it's that each rod is half graphite (boosts reaction) and half boron (slows reaction) so each rod can either boost or slow, but the graphite has gaps at the top and bottom for technical reasons, so moving the graphite down essentially &quot;inserted&quot; graphite into the bottom gap. For technical reasons, the spike in reactivity was happening in that bottom gap, so the reaction exploded, steam exploded, the rods got stuck, the lid blew off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 'tips' are actually several meters long, and are more properly called displacers. Their purpose is to prevent water from filling the channels and absorbing neutrons, while also increasing the influence of the control rods.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>No disabled safety systems had any ability to prevent what happened.</p>
<p>It's hard to discuss Chernobyl because of all the information pollution from when the Soviets completely hoodwinked the IAEA into thinking the operators blew up a good reactor.</p></div>		</li>
