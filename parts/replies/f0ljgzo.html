			<div class="markdown"><p>It certainly is humbling. On some level, I’m not constantly bombarded by the grandeur of space because my day-to-day work (coding, observing, being on telecons, etc.) doesn’t always require it. But to be completely honest, it in some ways reinforces my existential anxiety; it’s impossible to conceive of how big and old the Universe is, and the improbable chain of events that led to &quot;us&quot; (and especially our having consciousness). The other side to that, though, is that it highlights just how personally important our small “corner” of the Universe really is. All in all, it makes me grateful for Earth and my time on it.</p></div>		</li>
