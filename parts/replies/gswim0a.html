<p>Nice read. Quoting it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even with low power density, we could theoretically fill a warehouse-sized building with millions of NDBs and hook them up to the electrical grid. This would provide steady power for thousands of years.</p>
<p>Probably it will all come down to cost-effectiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Ten microwatts per cubic centimeter is not a lot of electricity, but it’s not nothing either</strong>. Clearly, you won’t be powering a cell phone, let alone a car, with such a power density. So what is this company talking about? While I have yet to see an interview or report that says so explicitly – <strong>the nuclear diamond battery must be incorporated into a regular chemical battery, like a lithium-ion battery</strong>. This actually makes perfect sense, and is a great idea. So the chemical battery provides the power density and the output to power the device, and the embedded NDB slowly recharges the battery. The company claims – “<strong>With the same size battery, it would charge your battery from zero to full, five times an hour</strong>.” This sounds like a claim that needs to be verified, and seems to be out of proportion to the typical power density of such devices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I agree</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am always skeptical of claims that a technology can be “scaled up”</p>

<p>So where is this research in 2021? Who bought it? Who invested on it?</p></div>		</li>

<p>What?! With their own measurement of 10 microwatts/cm^3 that doesn't make any sense whatsoever.  </p>
<p>Let's say we're talking about a phone battery. I have a Nexus 5 battery here that is about 6x5.4x0.4 cm (13 cm^(3)). Say we manage to magically double Li-ion density and so this new battery gets half that volume, 6.5 cm^(3). That gives it a power of 65 microwatts! It can change the full 8.74 Wh (31.46 kJ) battery in just ... 5601 days...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait so if it has to be incorporated into a normal lithium ion battery, the 24,000 year life span doesnt make sense then. Lithium ion is trash after just a few years of regular use. </p>
<p>At first I was thinkin maybe space stuff that runs on simple low power systems and nobody is nearby for the radioactivity to matter, but the lithium ion part makes that useless too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As per the linked article they say the specific power is about 10 microwatts per cubic centimeter.</p>
<p>To put that in perspective, the average cell phone uses about 2.24 watts when plugged in and fully charged (so that's just needed to maintain). So you'd need 224,000 cubic centimeters of this battery just to keep your cell phone from losing charge when it's idle.</p>
<p>If you're use to imperial units and have a hard to imagining that, picture 59 gallon milk jugs.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Phones certainly do not use anywhere near 2.24 watts while idle. The source you’re using was actually just looking at how much power is wasted by leaving a device plugged in after it has completed charging. If a phone actually drew that much power while totally idle even a modern large 5000mAh battery would be drained flat in under 9 hours.</p>
<p>Actual device power draw while <em>active</em> (meaning screen on, wifi connection, browsing the web or scrolling social media, etc) is somewhere around 1-2W depending on various factors such as display brightness, etc. Generally it’s below 1.5W.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The article is quite sensationalized. The heat conduction isn't necessarily what is generating electricity, it even says so in the beginning with how it is a alpha, beta, and neutron voltaics cell! This just means the free electrons from the nuclear waste are filling the electron holes in the graphite like a semiconductor. The heat dissipation from this radiation is important, but technically not what is powering it. I think if they are using a high enough energy density material (tritium is about 24 watts/kg) they could feasibly scale. Traditionally nuclear batteries don't really use diamonds, they use silicon carbide as it has more electron holes that can be filled. Maybe a composite of these is what they are building which is exciting!</p></div>		</li>
