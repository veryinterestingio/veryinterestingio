			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it going the other way around - a speck of dust hitting the ISS is the same as the ISS hitting a speck of dust. The ISS is stronger, so it basically vaporizes whatever tries to hit it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not entirely true though, because if the ISS was on the ground and I threw a baseball at it, the baseball would just bounce right off. If someone threw the ISS at a baseball, even if it was going 1/10 of the speed, it would crush the baseball completely. </p>
<p>When huge numbers are involved things get wonky. A piece of dust can scratch glass that would normally take diamonds to scratch just because of the immense amount of force involved, and a thing the size of a quarter could punch a hole in the side of a space station if it was moving fast enough, but even if I shot a quarter out of a gun on Earth it wouldn't probably penetrate the first layer</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worth noting that the insane numbers you see for orbital velocities imply that everything in stable orbit has that same velocity.  When a resupply vehicle docks with the ISS, they're both doing that ~7.6km/s.</p>
<p>So, anything that hits will have to be in a different (non-circular) orbit, which happens to cross the ISS's.  The collision is only with the difference in their velocities.</p>
<p>Unless you have something orbiting the wrong direction.  That would be extremely unusual... but is technically possible, and has been considered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I assume that something orbiting the &quot;wrong&quot; way would likely not last long because of frequent VERY high speed collisions with things going the &quot;right&quot; way?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ISS orbits at 51.6 degrees inclination, with a RAAN that shifts constantly due to nonspherical gravity. Stuff is in orbit in all kinds of directions. (See the website <a href="https://stuffin.space" target="_blank">https://stuffin.space</a> for a good illustration). The typical orbital debris impact is somewhere around 11 km/s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why is there a wrong direction? Is that because any human induced thing has been launched in the same direction? What about random space debris?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think Netflix has a documentary about Scott Kelly's long duration stay on the ISS. If I recall correctly they include a bit about this, how NASA scans the trajectory of the ISS for possible collisions, warns the astronauts if its an item large enough that it won't be harmless and if so they can use their thrusters to avoid it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>JFCC-Space out of Vandenberg AFB, CA, provides this service as well (at least when I was there in 2006-2009). The local elevator pitch was &quot;we track any object in orbit larger than a shoe.&quot; If they identified any potential collisions with any satellite (commercial or domestic/foreign government), they would contact the owner and suggest evasive maneuvers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure it might be. I just search for &quot;iss space debris collision&quot; an picked the window image from a NASA source. I think they are the same because the look very similar if you zoom in.</p>
