bad reviews can be a very graphic description of how it will give explosive, hellborn diarrherea. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I beg to differ, overly positive reviews can often be promotional. When someone comments 'it does what it's supposed to do', it appeals to me more as being honest.
Most of the comments like &quot;it stopped working after a month&quot; are never genuine (unless it's a product purchased from an online reseller in China); people, in general, do not use products as they are intended to do and end up with broken or non functioning things.
Although I agree with you about looking at a common theme in the negative comments. </p></div>		</li>

we live in the era of planned obsolescence it has become difficult to find a product that will last as intended and work  as expected.  Being happy to find a &quot; ye it works&quot; review participates in lowering the consumers standards overall and i dont think thats good.
I always look for negative reviews that present a specific pattern. like part of the product breaking before the rest or it becoming dysfunctional after the same period of time for a statistically significant number of users. Of course people tend to mistreat what they buy nowadays but if you want efficient shopping you cant put  everything on that . However if you happen to find that one product that seems to work fine for everyone, youre never 100% safe it can still die on you because it happens but this is a matter of having the least chances of that happening.
This is especially true for countries/regions with poor  &quot;refund services &quot;(  couldnt find the right term) where youre trying to make the most out of your money</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I... really disagree with the &quot;it stopped working after a month&quot; reviews part. I've purchased a lot of items that broke or stopped working shortly after buying them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also look to see if the seller replies to reviews, if someone complains but the seller is like &quot;you could just contact us to get a free replacement since that sounds like a defect&quot; then that's better.</p></div>		</li>
