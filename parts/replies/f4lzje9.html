			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep.. this is the right answer. All the chemicals in your brain (neurotransmitters) need to be in the right balance in order for you to sleep, think rationally, maintain a stable mood, and not experience serious psychiatric problems (such as mania and hallucinations).</p>
<p>There are quite a number of different neurotransmitters, they interact with each other and scientists dont agree on what they all do (one of the bigger ones for example, dopamine, has some 11k research papers and growing around its purpose!!).</p>
<p>These neurotransmitters have also been linked to serious diseases when they are out of balance. To borrow from dopamine again.. too low dopamine has been strongly linked to Parkinsons disease while too high dopamine has been linked to Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia.</p>
<p>In the case of people with dopamine regulation problems, taking drugs which affect serotonin levels can actually have disastrous results and exacerbate a lot of the issues meant to be addressed by SSRIs and antidepressants.</p>
<p>So, yeah, messing with these chemicals without knowing what you are doing would be inadvisable. Even psychiatrists have to be extremely careful about how they prescribe medications which affect these brain chemicals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just adding a little tiny tidbit to your last point;</p>
<p>This is why psychiatrists start you off on very, very low doses, and ween you off very, very slowly. They need to be aware of <strong>all</strong> the effects that the drug is having, good and bad. Rapid changes to these brain chemicals is <strong>dangerous</strong>. </p>
<p>When I first started on SSRI's, it took 2 years to find the right medicine at the right dose. One of them made me so paranoid that I didn't leave my bedroom for two weeks, not even to go to the restroom two steps out the door. It was terrifying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oof! That's rough.
Was prescribed effexor and maxalt by the same Dr. Effexor was a daily preventative for migraines,  while the maxalt was for as needed use during a migraine episode. After taking the effexor for a month the Dr decided to double my dose (yes, double. No subtle raise) due to my migraines not improving.  Had crazy shakes and sweats for a few days, then was hit by a cluster migraine.  Took my maxalt and ended up in the hospital.  Serotonin syndrome.  I dont remember a lot, but my sister took me to the ER. She said I had to be sedated because I tried to rip out my IV and run away. I kept saying I had to get out of there, and after being sedated she said my body still twitched like crazy even though I was unconscious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Decade+, if I assume correctly that by 'hormones' you also meant neurotransmitters. First we need to fully understand the endocrine system(hormonal) and neuroanatomy(nervous system), then develop a technique for non-invasively measuring the various components at potentially the deepest parts of our brain(for example <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/images/cdr/live/CDR680415-571.jpg" target="_blank">hypothalamus, pituitary&amp;pineal gland</a>) in real-time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>allowing people to take the stuff whenever they feel a little down would end in massive tragedy</p>

<p>There has to be a better reason. I mean who's to say it'd need to be allowed? Like heroin isn't exactly allowed but people do that.</p>
<p>Isn't it more that it'd be hard to do? Like doesn't it only work in the brain and just injecting it wouldn't get there (unless you like injected it into your brain maybe, which uh, yeah probably safer to just do the heroin)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Serotonin isn't derived from a plant, it's created from a biochemical conversion. Heroin can be made by your average junkie; take some poppy plants, cut open the unripe ones, gather the sap, dry it out, boom; opium. You don't need an expensive laboratory, you don't need trained professionals, you don't need scientists. </p>
<p>Serotonin does stuff all over your body, but it can't pass through the blood-brain-barrier. All the serotonin in your brain has to be made in your brain, so you couldn't really inject or smoke it.</p></div>		</li>
