It's not just about the words themselves, it's our entire means of processing the world around us and how we categorize and conceptualize it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The vernacular a lion would use to describe the world would be filled with things a lion can comprehend. </p>
<p>So even if they could speak english they might not call prey even prey. </p>
<p>Maybe they'd call prey, belly-filler or hungry-go away, if they could even comprehend what a belly, hunger, or even the what concept of being filled is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the things we do don't apply to other animals, our intelligence, our instincts and everything are all shaped by our collective ancestry. So a lion even if given our intelligence would not comprehend certain feelings or instincts we have. Our brains are wired differently</p></div>		</li>
