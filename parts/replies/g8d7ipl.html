			<div class="markdown"><p>Body odor smells bad because sweat sits on our skin and then odor causing bacteria forms and then we stink. Sweat doesn‚Äôt generally come out of us with much of a smell unless you are eating very strong smelling foods that come out of your pores like onions, cumin, etc. It‚Äôs when it sits for a while that you start to reek. </p>
<p>Fun fact: some people, mostly Asians have a certain gene that makes them not get BO and also have dry flaky earwax as opposed to the wet earwax most of us have. They think it‚Äôs something to do with their bodies not producing a certain amino acid that encourages bacterial growth and thus body odor. I‚Äôm half Asian and my dad has this gene and never had to wear deodorant, sadly I did not inherit it. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>

<p>That is partly cultural.  We've been using deodorants and perfumes for so long, that natural body smells are unusual and not what we associate with being clean.</p></div>		</li>
