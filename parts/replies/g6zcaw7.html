			<div class="markdown"><p>Talk about a real test of devotion: in 19th-century rural Austria, eligible lasses would keep an apple slice crammed in their armpits during dances. At the end of the evening, the girl would give her used fruit to the guy she most fancied. If the feeling was mutual, <a href="http://now100fm.cbslocal.com/2011/07/14/how-sweaty-apples-used-to-be-a-sign-that-he-likes-you/" target="_blank">he’d wolf down</a> the stinky apple. (Something’s telling us Austrian guys weren’t too broken up over the death of this ritual.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>You can buy rocks on Amazon and rub your pits with those if you like instead</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been using alum blocks for shaving for the last year or so. Then I read that it can be used as a natural scent-free deodorant. Sceptical as I was, I gave it a try. Lo and behold, my pits NEVER stink when I use that stuff. Granted, you still need to shower every day. But when I used modern deodorants and antiperspirants I'd get the occasional whiff of armpit pong. I'll never use anything else now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Questionable - This study appears to only be about the possibility of absorption of aluminum into the body through the use of cosmetics, it does not address any potential issue of the sweat being physically blocked, or <em>localized</em> high aluminum exposure, or any other issues, only systemic aluminum dosing.</p>
<p>So to say &quot;no&quot; is a poor summation of the findings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sweat is mostly just salty water plus a minor percentage of other chemicals. The smell is bacteria eating your dead skin cells and giving of the odour.
Fun fact: Sweat isn't the fat you're trying to burn, oozing out of your pores... Sweating is just the bodies natural thermal management, trying to cool you down while you're exerting yourself. You lose weight by breathing out the carbon in carbon dioxide.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Studies have been inconclusive but there are some correlations between antiperspirant use and certain cancers. More studies are finding stronger links though. </p>
<p>Aluminum can seep into the body and accumulate in the breast tissue, which <em>may</em> increase the risk of breast cancer. </p>
<p>There is <em>some</em> evidence of a link between the aluminum building up in the body and Alzheimer's disease and dementia, though the link has never been found to be conclusive. </p>
<p>Beyond those, you can be allergic to the aluminum salt which can cause you to break out with inflammation. </p>
<p>Clogging the pores can result in acne in the underarm, especially if you shave your pits. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I personally do not use antiperspirant anymore, and use an aluminum free deodorant just for a little scent. After a while, my underarms don't even sweat like they used to. </p>
<p>Another plus side is that I don't get that nasty, greasy yellow pit stains on my shirts anymore either. Those come from the aluminum too.</p></div>		</li>
