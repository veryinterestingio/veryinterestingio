			<div class="markdown"><p>It is worth pointing out that this evolutionary process happened incredibly fast. Up until ~3 million years ago baleen whales were at most the size of minke's (who are the smallest species of baleen whales) and adapted to living in vast continental shelf regions. Their size was also likely constrained by macro-predators such as Megalodon and Lyvjatan. Then the current ice age begins, the continental shelfs are vastly reduced in size and the macro-predators go extinct. As do most baleen whales in fact, genus diversity among rorquals has fallen from a peak of ~12 before the Cenozoic to 2 extant genera. But the survivords remarkably quickly figure out that there are <em>massive</em> algae blooms happening during the polar summer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And now I know of the genus Lyvjatan ( or Livyatan), species Melville. Who says cetologists don't have a sense of humour?
But seriously,  I'd never heard of this before. Fascinating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This explanation seems to be about rorquals. Does the same argument apply to others, or are they not large enough to really be part of this question?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I assumed the question was about baleen whales (rorquals) because there was an added part in the question about krill-feedingl, which most baleen whales do. As you also stated they are the largest whale species so there could be further evolutionary evidence supporting the relatively smaller size of toothed whales such as orcas and sperm whales. However, the large sizes of most whales could be mainly tied back to thermoregulatory reasons (blubber) in cold waters and maintaining energy expenditure during migration/hunting for food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Minor correction: not all baleen whales are rorquals. The pygmy right whale is a 3000 kg baleen whale, which should have the same feeding requirements but may not have the same thermoregulation possibilities. Unless 3000 kg is enough.</p></div>		</li>
