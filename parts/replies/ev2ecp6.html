			<div class="markdown"><p>G. H. Hardy, a famous British mathematician in the early 20th century, famously wrote in 1940 that &quot;no one has yet discovered any warlike purpose to be served by the theory of numbers or relativity, and it seems unlikely that anyone will do so for many years.&quot;</p>
<p>Within 5 years, number theory was used to crack the German Enigma cipher, the theory of relativity helped bring about the nuclear age, and today number theory underpins cryptographic algorithms used literally millions (billions?) of times a day.</p>
<p>All that to say, even if the answer today is &quot;no&quot;, just give it a few years and see what shakes out :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imaginary/complex numbers were thought to be a cheap trick for solving quadratic equations. Then, quantum mechanics came along and complex maths mapped onto it incredibly well. like a lot of pure math, this is a solution looking for a problem. Theoretical CS might benefit from this</p></div>		</li>
