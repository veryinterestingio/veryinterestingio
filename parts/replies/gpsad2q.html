			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a librarian, and this is basically true. Except:</p>
<p>Most of the time they're not RFID chips, just small strips of magnetized metal inserted somewhere in the book.</p>
<p>RFID book inserts do exist, but they're a lot more expensive than regular security strips. They're pretty cool, since you can use them for fancy stuff like automatic checkouts and tracking down misshelved books, but I've never worked in a library that could afford them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the circulation desk has a magnetizer (it may look like <a href="https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/cqAAAOSweI1cWcSv/s-l300.jpg" target="_blank">this</a> or like <a href="https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/9YAAAOSwt6Fbu~zq/s-l225.jpg" target="_blank">this</a>). They slide the book through it, and it changes the magnetic charge on the strip. In one state, it sets off the alarm, in the other state it doesn't. </p>
<p>If you notice the staff sliding the book along the underside of the counter when they check your books out, that's probably what they're doing.</p>
<p>Notice how that second image has a &quot;no videos&quot; sign taped to it. That's because the magnet will mess up the magnetic tape in a VHS tape (which fortunately doesn't matter very often these days).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is from memory.</p>
<p>The strips are called EAS tags. They contain a number of metallic strips which can be magnetized or demagnetized easily.</p>
<p>The detector is simply an oscillating magnetic field. When you bring an active EAS tag near a detector, the oscillating field causes the metallic strips to also osculate. Because of resonance, though, they actively try to oscillate at a slower frequency than the detector. This changes the load on the electromagnet in the detector which trips alarm.</p>
<p>An active EAS tag is active when it has uniform magnetic alignment and inactive when it has a randomized magnetic alignment.</p>
<p>You can reactivate a tag on something you bought with a strong neodymium magnet. Simply stick the tag to the magnet for a moment and then move the magnet away slowly.</p>
<p>Protip is you're a thriving bastard: you can deactivate an EAS tag with a strong neodymium magnet by rapidly rubbing the magnet I've the tag and then quickly removing the magnet.</p>
<p>There are also EAS devices with a could of wire and actual circuitry which always trip detectors and cannot be deactivated. They use these in those secure polycarbonate boxes and spider wraps you see in stores sometimes.</p>
<p>EAS tags are really small and easy to hide in stickers and things like that.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work in a library and insert the metal strips. Basically they're 4-6&quot; long with a self-adhesive backing. You carefully slip the strip into the spine: in hardcover books there's always a gap between the sewn binding and the flexible cardboard spine, so you basically stick it in between and press down on the outside to seal. On paperback books you insert it in between two pages, or between the cover and pages, ideally as close to the spine as possible, sometimes even hidden in the middle of the book. The adhesive is pretty strong, intended to be permanent, so ripping it out is likely to cause damage.</p>
<p>The reason it's important to put it close to the spine is, not only is it the safest and most convenient place, but also workers know to always hit the spines against the de/magnetizer which usually looks like an old beige piece of plastic office equipment behind the checkout station. If the strip were in a random place it wouldn't work and would be annoying, the de/magnetizer only has a range of maybe an inch. Underneath the plastic is a set of electromagnets that's either set up to create a magnetic field in a randomized direction or a single direction, depending on whether you want to activate or deactivate the strip.</p>
<p>As said below, there's some kind of magnetic resonance with a radio wave going on to detect it. Protip, do not wear earphones when walking through one of those sensors, I did once and it sounds like crap.</p>
<p>Also fun fact there's often only one Librarian per library, it's a formal title with training like Doctor or Scientist. Everyone else doing routine work on the floor is most likely a librarian's assistant or lower even if we colloquially call them all librarians.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My library has rfid and it's pretty slick.  Walk up to the self serve checkout, scan your card, set your stack of books on the counter and you're done.</p>
<p>They also released an phone app so I don't have to carry a physical library card anymore.</p>
<p>They don't have the security scanners by the doors.  Not sure if there is something more discrete to detect rfid or if they just dropped that requirement.  </p>
<p>They also recently dropped late fees.  My library is pretty cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, those strips are quite small and inobtrusive.  Often hidden in the spine, or glued inside the cover.  You don't really notice them.</p>
<p>But, theoretically, you could take one of those strips that hasn't been demagnetized and stick it in your friend's jacket or book bag somewhere.  Or even in their shoe.  And then every time they try to go into or leave the library they'll set off the security sensor, but a thorough search will never turn up any unchecked books.</p>
<p>Theoretically this can go on for months and months, and eventually drive them insane.  Especially if they're a university student, and going to the library nearly every day.</p>
<p>This is all theoretical of course, and we definitely did not do this to my friend and put the strip in the liner of his boot, where it stayed all winter until he was a nervous wreck who was certain that the entire library staff hated his guts.</p>
<p>We also did not theoretically discover that many video rental places used exactly the same magnetic strips, and so he would set off their security systems too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is awesome.</p>
<p>A lot of retail stores use security strips. I worked at a bookstore, and it was common for someone to set off the alarms because there was a similar strip, never deactivated, in their purse or backpack. So we'd do a cursory check but wouldn't hassle them about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did that in college as well. I helped the librarians one summer remove some books that were to be replaced which they would sell, and I grabbed a half dozen of the tags. Book bags are bad locations because people tend to have them all the time, so it goes off every time, and it's easy to just try it without the bag, thereby isolating it to the bag. Shoes are better - nobody pre 9/11 would think to take off their shoes. Ideally you want something that they wear occasionally, but not seasonally. The seam of a pair of jeans is pretty good. If the librarian asks you to take off your pants before entering the library - you have a whole other set of issues to deal with.</p>
<p>I may have tried this numerous times with multiple people, including my advisor, who figured it out fairly quickly. There are lots of ways you can't really prank physicists.</p></div>		</li>

Set off the alarm at the gate every time and then his active pass would scan and let him through.  This went on for weeks since we worked there.  He couldnâ€™t figure it out.</p></div>		</li>
