			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a high school biology teacher and this is one of my favorite stories to tell my kids. Because I grew up at the perfect time. When I was a high school student I was told by my biology teacher about the project. The projection at the time was that it was a &quot;multi-generation&quot; megalith undertaking. I was imagining being a scientist and working my whole career on this and knowing that my grandkids might see it complete. I got my undergrad degree in biology with emphasis in genetics, and by the time I graduated from college it was done. I worked as an undergrad in a lab working on some of the first breast cancer genes. I did my first PCR my senior year. Which was completely and totally insane. The rapid expansion of knowledge in the field of biology at the time was mind-boggling.</p></div>		</li>
