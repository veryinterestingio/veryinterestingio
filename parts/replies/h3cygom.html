			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey other hvac guy here. Yes, the ideal refrigerant that’s going to be used on most commercial and industrial units will be CO2 in the future but I highly doubt that they’ll be in residential units anytime soon if at all since the working pressure is like 1000 psi</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also HVAC guy. The person listing the refrigerants is a little behind the times, as the R410a is mostly what’s taken the place of R-22 for residential, and R410a will be replaced as well. 22 depleted the ozone, but was better as far as greenhouse gas. 410 not as bad for the ozone, but worse greenhouse gas. Trend appears to be toward CO2, Propane, things like that in the future. (For refrigeration cycles, not to use as fuel).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is the development of co2 and propane for these fields because the industry has too much of the stuff, or is it actually a better choice for the job?</p>
<p>Why didn't we use it/them to begin with or switch to it during the ozone hole crisis?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean I just took my refrigerant license test, and yes you are correct 410 is going to be replaced but as of right now it is still the main refrigerant used. So idk what you meant by behind the times as this is the times and you are speaking on future times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That being said though yes we are starting to transition away from 410 to other substances but when we are still changing out r22 units for 410 units and still carrying around a jug of expensive r22 then we are still in the process of transitioning from the older hcfc models.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct refrigerant is used in both systems. Possibly what op had meant was why are straight ac systems more environmentally destructive than heat pumps, at least thats the only correlation I can think of. To answer that a straight ac system is placed on top of an existing gas/oil furnace to cool the homes during the <em>edit</em> summer* so maybe in conjunction with that op is correct ac is more environmentally hazardous than a heat pump, as it is only running half the year and in the other half they are burning fossil fuels. At least that is the only idea I have on it.</p></div>		</li>
