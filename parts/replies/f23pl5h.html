			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say that most incidents of transmission by bugs (outside of ticks, kissing bugs, etc) are in hospital settings. Where a spider, ant, fly, or anything else can climb it’s way through patients trash where something may be living (pathogen) and make it’s way to another (usually sick) Patient’s room. Also worth noting the pathogenicity and virulence of said bacteria or virus plays a large role. Lots of pathogens don’t do well as fomites, even then, we have to actively introduce ourselves to that organism.</p></div>		</li>
