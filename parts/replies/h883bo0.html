<p>As others said, you'll just lose money.</p>
<p>Sportsbooks aren't idiots. They have guys on the payroll that use analytics to initially set the lines. There's no way they'd set lines internally that would let you place bets in a way that would guarantee profit.</p>
<p>Now, there's times where you could bet 3/4 outcomes and profit if any of those occurred.</p>
<p>Playoff series: bet 7 game series to be completed in 5, 6, and 7 games might give you good enough odds to profit if any of those 3 outcomes occur. But you'll never see a way to bet every outcome and still profit. Not on the same sportsbook.</p>
<p>You may be able to do so on multiple books. This is called &quot;arbitrage betting&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the very early days of the internet betting sites you used to sometimes find soccer games or horse races where the odds were different enough across 3+ sites that you could spread your bet across them and not lose. The main issue was the margins were low and to make money on it you needed to bet a decent amount of money to get back your money + fees etc. You could game it even more if you tried to only win money on the favourite and make even on the others. I never had enough initial cash to try and make money though and it was risky with some of the sites. Is that arbitrage?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Really? That seems baffling. What if I wanted to bid 1¢?</p>
<p>I guess if it's online or if they charge some kind of a fee per-bet it doesn't hurt them any. Are they going to spend 50¢ to mail me my 1¢ winnings?</p></div>		</li>
