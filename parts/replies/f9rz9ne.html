<p>Which is totally how it should be. You can't prove Santa isn't real, it just doesn't work like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There isn't a point in the past you can point at and say &quot;here there be humans.&quot; There were people who had slightly less modern human features, and before that, slightly less modern, and so forth across thousands of generations. Over time the entire population changes with successive generations.</p>
<p>Now, there were certain events in the past the are hypothesized to have narrowed the human population causing a decrease in genetic diversity, but these are populations still numbering a minimum of several thousand individuals.</p></div>		</li>
