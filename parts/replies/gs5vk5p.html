			<div class="markdown"><p>There is definitely a relationship. The most common relationship we think about – because it affects so many women – is oral contraceptives. That’s one of the biggest things we see between the endocrine system and clotting. It gives people a significant risk factor for blood clots overall. Other medications include hormone replacement therapy, which increases your risk of DVT and PE. Many people may not know about the significant risks. To read more on this, I would recommend NBCA’s site <a href="https://womenandbloodclots.org/" target="_blank"><a href="https://womenandbloodclots.org/" target="_blank">https://womenandbloodclots.org/</a></a>. If you are a young woman on hormonal oral contraceptives, know that you are at a higher risk and know the signs and symptoms of a blood clot. You can read more about the signs and symptoms here: <a href="https://www.worldthrombosisday.org/issue/vte/deep-vein-thrombosis/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.worldthrombosisday.org/issue/vte/deep-vein-thrombosis/" target="_blank">https://www.worldthrombosisday.org/issue/vte/deep-vein-thrombosis/</a></a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you comfortable with patients taking progesterone only birth control with underlying clotting mutations (ie G2021a)? I’ve read a lot about estrogen methods increasing risk as mentioned on the above site but have received conflicting info from two different hematologists about if progesterone only pills increase clotting risk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a CVST that they think was from birth control I was only on for three or so months total. That's the conclusion until they finish testing for other things, anyway. Have you heard of clots happening after such a short time span of oral contraceptive use?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is a hormonal IUD the same risk? I'm about to have a longer surgery and am wondering if I should get it removed first?</p></div>		</li>
