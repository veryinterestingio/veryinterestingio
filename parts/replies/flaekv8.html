			<div class="markdown"><p>Only if it gets stuck. That feeling of a pill stuck in your throat? Sometimes (usually?) it really is stuck. It’ll dislodge itself if you drink plenty of water, and no harm done. But if you leave it there and ignore the feeling, it can do real damage to your oesophageal lining.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you swallow, the food bolus goes directly into the stomach, so it's a quick process.  The 30 minutes is to allow the iron to absorb so it's not concentrated enough to do damage if you get acid reflux.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I might be misunderstanding what you are trying to say, or maybe you wrote it funny, or probably both, but I just wanted to say that iron is not absorbed in your stomach. Iron is absorbed in the small intestines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not entirely correct, pill esophagitis is believed to be due to the tablet causing irritation to the lining of your esophagus via direct contact when it gets lodged there, just like the doctor wrote above. Source: also am doctor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was already kinda answered but the goal is for the pill to make it beyond the stomach. Many people have reflux where juices from the stomach will back up into the esophagus so that medication can still cause esophageal erosion even though it’s mostly in the stomach. So sitting upright is giving enough time for most / all of the medication to make it to the small intestine.</p></div>		</li>
