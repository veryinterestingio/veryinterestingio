			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true, but this kind of testing is not always accurate. Pepsi ranks higher than Coke in small blind taste tests because Pepsi is sweeter than Coke.</p>
<p>But, if you ask participants to drink more and see which soda they actually buy... The preference flips to Coke because Pepsi is perceived as too sweet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait...is that true? Is Pepsi actually sweeter than Coke? I've always preferred Pepsi and the reason was because I thought it was <em>less</em> sweet than Coke, not more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pepsi has slightly more sugar than Coke. But, as OP was explaining, Pepsi has a hint of citrus which can make it seem less sweet than Coke to some people.</p>
<p>Perceptions of food can be very complex.</p>
<p>And as this article points out... What people buy may also be driven by branding more than actual preference:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it was quite famous during the pepsi challenge days.  Pepsi being sweeter than coke causes people to like it in small amounts more.  When forced to drink an entire can, it flips on its head.  IIRC the numbers were like 70/30 in favor of pepsi in small amounts but an almost direct flip to being 70/30 in favor of coke in large amounts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right. This kind of sensory analysis is very difficult for many reasons. </p>
<p>In that particular case, what most people like best on the basis of a few sips is not the same as what they most want to drink in large amounts. You have to be asking <em>exactly</em> the right question to get the answer that you need. But you cannot ask people to chug down bottles of soda in a test of their preferences.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They did get exactly the right answer they wanted since they wanted people to say they preferred Pepsi during the taste test. The Pepsi challenge was marketing. I am sure they did actual testing that wasn't as publicized.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the context of the taste test, they were only having a sample, not a whole can.</p>
<p>They probably set up the portion size for that very reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the reason why I've become so motivated to cook more. There's craptons of sugar everywhere. Once you cut more sugar out of your diet it becomes quite obvious. My MIL had some store made pico de gallo and when I tried it I nearly spit it out. Checked the ingredients, and of course, sugar. What kind of sick monster puts sugar in pico de gallo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. I cook my own meals 90% of the time. The other 10% might eat out or make an easy button meal (think frozen pizza or a frozen casserole. I read the labels to avoid junk as much as possible). </p>
<p>Eating out or processed foods tend to taste either sickly sweet and full of sugar or overly salty. Some restaurants I can't even stomach, like olive garden tastes like eating a salt lick.</p>
<p>Or when buying food like mentioned above, why is there sugar in pico or salsa or ranch dressing or any host of other foods it doesn't belong in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I started keto 8 years ago, and I was absolutely shocked at all the added sugar in every-fucking-thing. Back then, keto wasn't even close to being a fad, so there was almost no &quot;normal&quot; food I could eat. Low carb has picked up a lot of steam the past couple years, and now companies are making a lot more things without sugar, and it's awesome. But man, those were some dark times. Lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it took me a couple years to completely desensitize my taste buds to sugary stuff, but now everything with sugar in it is too sweet. now sweetness is just a taste like hot, sour or bitter and too much is painful.  I do put some steveia on my oatmeal or its too bland, but just a bit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since sugar can be somewhat addictive I wonder if that has a cultural impact as well, like the more sugar kids eat in that country the more they will basically put in everything, I heard that in some countries like the us there is way more &quot;hidden&quot; sugar in products than in some other countries, which you can't even taste that much for some reason</p></div>		</li>
