			<div class="markdown"><p>For background, in case people are unfamiliar with dialects: Song learning has arisen a few times in songbirds, parrots, and a couple other groups. Some species use social learning to learn their songs, which means that they copy songs from other individuals of the same species. They have a “neural template” that is a general idea of what their species sounds like, but will never develop a functional song without tutors. It’s like how babies can babble randomly and recognize human voices, but children never learn language if they aren’t exposed to it soon enough. Species that learn songs like this generally have geographic variation in songs, like different accents. Often, the variation is continuous, so maybe the pitch of the last note increases slowly as you go south. I’m from the midwest, and people say the Knoxville accent is different from other southern accents. I’m sure they’re right, but it all sounds the same to me. By the time you get to Pennsylvania or New Orleans, even I can tell there’s a difference, but I couldn’t mark any place where it clearly changed. Dialects have discrete variations or “versions.” If you go from one dialect neighborhood to the next, you know you’ve crossed a boundary, and the songs are different on each side. It’s not necessarily as neat as, say, the German-French border, but it’s there.</p>
<p>Most research I’ve read on dialects consider dialects memes. They’re learned socially from parents and other surrounding adults, and phenotypes are units that are discrete from neighboring phenotypes. Aside from the neural template for the species song, I haven’t seen evidence of a genetic influence on birds that have dialects. Within each neighborhood, there’s conformity bias to sing the local dialect, since females prefer it, and it’s effective in male-male competition. There’s not generally an incentive to remix and make a new dialect. That doesn’t mean that dialects don’t evolve, though. They can adapt to new circumstances, like urban noise, or through learning error. Dialects can be pretty stablem, and researchers have found dialects in a few species that are still basically the same as they were upwards of 50 years ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Amy, I read Carl Safina's book &quot;becoming wild&quot; last year and loved it, what you wrote here really reminded me of what he wrote about parrots. Are you familiar with the book and his research, and what's your take on the conclusions he came to?</p></div>		</li>
