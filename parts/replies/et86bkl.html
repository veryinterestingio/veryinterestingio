<p>A MLM does rely on recruitment and it does ride that line between legitimate business and pyramid scheme however a legal MLM has to show that its members get at least X% of its income from outside of the company and not from pure recruitment. I don't know the actual % and it probably varies state-by-state but there was a recent expose done that showed some Nutralife company was violating that and had crossed over to pyramid scheme.</p>
<p>At least that is the theory. Yes lobbying does a lot to alter that % but that is the fundamental difference: incoming coming from inside the company vs. outside the company.</p></div>		</li>
