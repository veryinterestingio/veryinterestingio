			<div class="markdown"><p>My friend had a similar, albeit more complicated, experience. Horrid sinus issues his whole life.  Debilitating pain. Multiple surgeries. Eventually a doctor asked him how much he drank water. The guy was chronically dehydrated, which triggered sinus pain, which caused horrible migraines. No one ever thought to ask about his hydration levels......</p>
<p>He still had some less severe lingering issues after upping his water intake, most of which got resolved when he found out he was allergic to gluten and cut it out of his diet. (Like, he legit had sores and stuff on his arms. Disappeared once he stopped eating gluten.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My solution to this has been to find a single reusable water bottle that I like and carry it around with me at all times. You'll drink more water if it requires less effort.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it’s the illusion that you drink a lot of water. I personally drink 1 glass when I wake up and 1 before I sleep. But other that that I’d maybe drink 1 throughout the day and sip to quench my thirst. So I never felt thirsty but I definitely didn’t get enough. Once I made a conscious effort to drink 2 full glasses besides the mandatory one, it felt muuuuch better. And even then that’s not as much as you should drink.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At least in my case, my body is horrible at telling me that I'm thirsty.</p>
<p>I've noticed that I can go hours without drinking water, and even though I'll be dehydrated, I won't feel thirsty at all.</p>
<p>It's only when I get hungry and eat something that my thirst also kicks in.</p>
<p>I think I'm broken.</p></div>		</li>
