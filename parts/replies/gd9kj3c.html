			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also potentially dangerous, because the battery is important for the stuff in the car.  Unless you have, say, dual batteries, that's an issue.</p>
<p>You would need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disconnect battery from alternator and normal car load</li>
<li>Put a large artificial load (attached to the car just for this test) on the battery for a couple seconds</li>
<li>Monitor how it handles the load test</li>
<li>Reconnect (And then test the other battery).</li>
</ul>
<p>My UPS does a self-test like this every week or so probably.  It switches to battery power for a couple seconds, monitoring how the batteries handle the load.  The thing is though -- if something goes wrong with that test it can just immediately fail back to wall power so nothing bad happens.  If you load-tested a car and broke the battery while on the highway, that would be a Bad Thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I think people are seriously overthinking this problem. This would not be hard to simply monitor during normal operations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is what my car does. Saab from 1994. It forces on the display of lowest battery voltage during starting for 10 seconds or so after start.</p>
<p>It is an old car so it will not hold your hands - there is no message &quot;battery old, replace&quot;. But if you know what the numbers on the voltmeter mean, it is a great help.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having a dead battery on most modern cars isn’t a concern safety wise, the alternator is the thing powering all the electronics when you are actually driving. The battery is only used to start the car. If the alternator is faulty that’s the point when it becomes safety critical as modules in the car may cut out and all sorts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An alternator is a pretty noisy power supply. A battery smooths out the voltage. While things would run without a battery, it could impact modules and sensors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do some cars need the batter to keep running? Cause my friend was driving our '06 cobalt and it suddenly died on him on an exit ramp. Ended up being the alternator. But if the engine was running why did it die?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AFAIK all modern (like, newer than '70's) cars need electricity to run.  Basically all the engine control bits are electronic -- ECU and spark plugs, for starters.  (Also fuel pump, on some engines I believe valves, and probably some other things I can't think of).</p>
<p>With an alternator but no battery, it <em>might</em> be okay -- I'm not sure how much of a contribution the battery is to voltage stability.  With no alternator, the battery will steadily drain; if it does, that could result in spontaneous failure.</p></div>		</li>
