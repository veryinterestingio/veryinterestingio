			<div class="markdown"><p>The big difference is the bans back then had the full force of law enforcement to back them up. I don't think people today would be happy if the government tried something similar, we just have to hope that people are courteous enough to not do stuff that could spread the virus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spanish Flu also got a lot more time to spread under the radar because of WWI. Reports of the flu started from US army bases in 1917 but due to the war there was an effective gag rule on the papers talking about a highly contagious and deadly pathogen. That's also the reason it's the Spanish Flu, Spain was neutral and no such gag rule was in place. Meaning the first reports of the flu to reach the international community came from Spain. So idk we are not letting the Corona virus spread for nearly over a year before alerting the public to it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both- If you take a look at my above comment I address the question of paradoxical immune response in healthy young people. That being said the crowding of people into military camps, trains, and ships where conditions were often very unhygienic and the transport of sick people and asymptomatic carriers around the world meant the virus spread far faster than it could be contained. On top of this it is though that the coming of peace itself helped spread the epidemic into a pandemic: the massive victory parades and mass gatherings around the world were perfect grounds to spread this particularly virulent form of the flu.</p>
<p>Edit: it is thought that the epidemic actually began in a military camp in the US, the first patient to present symptoms was a cook. Within 24 hours they had nearly a thousand sick men in that one camp.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>The major troop staging and hospital camp in Étaples in France was identified by researchers as being at the center of the Spanish flu. The research was published in 1999 by a British team, led by virologist John Oxford.<br />
In late 1917, military pathologists reported the onset of a new disease with high mortality that they later recognized as the flu. The overcrowded camp and hospital was an ideal site for the spreading of a respiratory virus. The hospital treated thousands of victims of chemical attacks, and other casualties of war, and 100,000 soldiers passed through the camp every day. It also was home to a piggery, and poultry was regularly brought in for food supplies from surrounding villages. Oxford and his team postulated that a significant precursor virus, harbored in birds, mutated and then migrated to pigs kept near the front.[21][22]     </p>

<p>The Spanish flu made the immune system attack its own body. The stronger the immune system, the higher the chance of death.</p></div>		</li>
