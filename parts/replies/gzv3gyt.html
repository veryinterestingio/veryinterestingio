<p>Edit: wow, this comment was well received! For what it's worth, I'm starting to hear more about a return to electric home appliances (eg furnace, water heater) for similar reasons. If may not quite be cost effective yet but that's not the only reason to do it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The future of the grid is <em>millions</em> of power sources, like rooftop solar, and millions of battery storage nodes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not only energy efficiency. The exhaust scrubbing tech on a power plant has to be vastly superior to a small catalytic converter common on ICE engines. So you produce more energy per unit of fuel in a power plant and that energy generation is done more cleanly when considering the scale of energy creation.</p>
<p>There are some environmentally 'dirty' issues with the EV supply chain, but as the industries mature, so will the supply chain.  People love to use this argument against EV cleanliness but I believe it's a shortsighted argument and I doubt the EV supply chain creates more pollution than cars burning fossil fuels, but this statement is purely a reasoned guess as I haven't researched it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is one of the take aways from my reading.</p>
<p>Yes, the early ev supply chain could be better.</p>
<p>This is actually an argument in favour of EV, as the ways to improve the supply chain are so obvious that they will be happening as the industry matures.</p>
<p>An old ICE car will only get worse as the engine gets old and the exhaust system gets less effective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah this is, to me, the biggest thing. Cars last a while. An electric car produced today will hopefully average a 10+ year life, some as much as 20 (hell, I've got a friend still driving a late 60s truck). But unlike his truck the electric car can get more efficient as the grid gets more efficient. It's hard to put numbers straight to the concept, but the trend is clearly there.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I drive a 2012 Nissan Leaf, which my son will get when he turns 16 next year. Our 2003 Honda Civic Hybrid survived until 2016, when I got caught in a 4-car chain-reaction rear-ender and was totaled by insurance. The Leaf will need a new battery in another couple of years, but the battery tech is much better in the current generation of EVs, and cheaper to replace, to boot. Other than that, the only maintenance costs for the Leaf have been a set of tires, and I'm probably going to need to replace the brakes soon. Not bad for a car I bought six years ago for $10k.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A gallon of gas contains about 36 kWh of energy. A nice efficient Corolla goes about 40 highway miles on that. </p>
<p>EPA estimates say a Model 3 runs at about 26 kWh/100 miles, or roughly 138 miles on 36 kWh - more than 3 times the distance on the same amount of energy. Many owners say they’re getting even more mileage than that, but I used the conservative government estimate. </p>
<p>You can do all sorts of fun calculations with this information, like $/mile, but I won’t repeat it here as it’s widely available on the googles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also not to mention the cost of distributing fuel to cars probably being a lot worse than distributing fuel to power plants. There are significantly less power plants than pumping stations, with power plants usually being in easier to reach places to do larger deliveries. Distributing gasoline to pumping stations already requires gasoline.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is huge reason big oil has attempted to go all in on hydrogen fuel. It allows them to use the same infrastructure, equipment and pump stations they already have even though it is far less energy efficient that grid based EVs. Don’t be fooled into hydrogen.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hydrogen does have the ability to refuel quicker though. EV chargers have a huge issue with throughput. If it takes 30 minutes to charge and you are 3rd in line, that will add a huge chunk of time. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Who killed the electric car?&quot; is still a good documentary to watch.<br />
One of the things in that documentary is that oil companies will push for hydrogen, so that we are still dependant on them.<br />
If you go fully electric you could charge your car with solar panels or even something like a bicycle generator.      </p>
<p>Also: did you have an electric race track as a kid? Did you ever open one of those cars? That's how simple an electric car can be. You only need to grease the axles. (oversimplified, but you get the idea)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hydrogen has its place and it's an important place. Someday batteries might charge in 5 minutes, but until then the fast fill times for hydrogen will make it an important player. The transition away from fossil fuels will require hydrogen as a storage medium. </p>
<p>I think not as much for consumers, but for industry. Maybe look at as a replacement for diesel in the US and not as a replacement for gasoline. Time is money and no one wants an end loader out of service while it recharges. And where does it even recharge on a remote construction site? But the hydrogen truck can come every night and fill them up just as the diesel delivery truck does today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was just about to ask about this.  Is not a manufacturing plant in general considered a requirement, to manufacture anything, and cars are considered luxuries?  If we got right down to it and went back to caveman economics, we would want cars but we would need to feed and clothe ourselves.  Leaving out the debate about whether cars are requirements in certain locations/societies, it's that we would be manufacturing something anyway. May as well manufacture something that reduces the frivolous use of fossil fuels, even if the manufacture uses fossil fuels, because some use is going to happen anyway.</p></div>		</li>
