<p>Some of these immune cells are literally like bouncers shoving through a packed crowd.  The push between cells that normally do not have any space between them, and in their wake extra plasma may flow in. </p>
<p>Imagine a packed club, and then 50 or 100 huge bouncers show up and begin push through the crowd, interogating people. No one can leave. People get pressed against the walls. That is your sore throat. (And yeah, sometime some of the zombies who look like real people explode and then everyone who got goo on them becomes a ticking time bomb zombie unless the bouncers blow their heads off first.  But still - no one gets to leave)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great post and I will just reiterate that most of the viruses that cause sore throats are literally attaching to the throat and other portions of the upper respiratory tract. It’s not usually random. Also if you look at the respiratory lining of the nose on electron microscopy it looks like a bomb went off; it’s a miracle it ever recovers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great thought process. Yes, there are studies that show faster improvement from illness without taking anti-inflammatories, but the difference in time is fairly negligible. Something like recovery from the common cold in 4 days instead of 5. So, the trade off is between 4 bad days versus 5 moderate days in terms of comfort.</p>
<p>This gets a bit more complicated when talking about something like a swollen ankle. Too much pain and swelling may cause you to limit joint movement  to the point where excessive connective tissue will grow around the joint and limit long-term mobility.</p>
<p>-Fun fact, soon after something like a rotator cuff surgery, passive range of motion exercises are essential for preventing this.</p></div>		</li>
