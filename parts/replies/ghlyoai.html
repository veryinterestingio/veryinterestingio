I was there <a href="https://external-preview.redd.it/fJjNP9jGTY63irvDkvQxn32TZ2YDMvLD8NqBT3Sb2pI.jpg?width=539&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5fddb59be2e69dfc87237195d814f0463bdaf26" target="_blank">that fateful day</a>.  It crested the hill and was on us in no time.  The ice did nothing to slow it and only served to heighten our terror as we struggled to escape.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To illustrate that, look at this video of a <a href="https://youtu.be/MuanfpL1o18" target="_blank">herd or giraffes running alongside a moving car</a></p>
<p>Though they have a running speed of ~40 km/h (25mph) they very much appear to be moving in slow motion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They sort of were mythical! In Arthurian legend you have the tales of the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questing_Beast" target="_blank">questing beast</a>, described as having &quot;the head and neck of a snake, the body of a leopard, the haunches of a lion, and the feet of a hart (deer)&quot;.</p>
<p>The common artistic interpretation looked something like <a href="https://imgur.com/a/Zrj055i" target="_blank">this</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think their shoulders are moving up and down a little as they gallop, so their neck moves with it because it's attached to it. It's also probably related to their balance a bit as well, due to the sheer length of the neck</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why lots of insects appear to be moving faster than they really are, spiders being a notable example. They're fast for their size, no doubts, but they're not faster than a human, despite people feeling like they move super quickly when they scurry across the floor</p></div>		</li>
