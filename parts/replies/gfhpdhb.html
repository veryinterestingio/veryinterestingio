<p>I was a volunteer for an HIV vaccine study back in the early 2000s through the HVTN.  The vaccine was a failure, only producing some antibodies they wanted but not enough to be useful.  I came out with about 3 of ~24 HIV antibodies on a western blot, which with HIV means nothing.  Once the virus gets in, you're HIV+ forever (short of a bone marrow transplant, ideally from someone with the delta 32 mutation).  The analogy I've come up with is that its like going to the front lines of a war, but bringing a pocket knife; technically you're more protected, but realistically you're not.</p>
<p>The antibodies to HIV (and the false positive on rapid HIV tests - vaccine induced seropositivity) have stuck around for over 15 years now.  I carry around a card in my wallet in front of my insurance explaining the study, so I don't have my blood drawn for HIV tests and incorrectly end up labelled as HIV+.  I can't donate blood or be a potential donor for bone marrow.  And I need to be careful who I tell, because people with low-medical-knowledge don't hear beyond &quot;I test positive for HIV&quot;.  That also made dating and the &quot;hey, are we both clean?&quot; pre-sex talk complicated.</p></div>		</li>
