			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, nobody likes to get humiliated. When we show our bodies we're in terrible shape and we demonstrate that this bad feeling is going to keep happening (why does this jerk keep taking stairs, ughh!) it triggers the release of chemicals that are often the byproduct of metabolic stress which trigger growth, repair etc.</p>
<p>Everything in nature in order to preserve resources is usually just good enough to cope with our environment, which is why we have to artificially make our environment harsher so it's not a panic moment if our environment actually becomes harsher.</p>
<p>We have to remember that biology only selects for traits that allow us to produce viable offspring.  So if you can make it to 35 or 40 years old then that gives you enough time to have kids around 20 and watch them make it through puberty and be capable of having their own children.  If you want to survive past that, you have to give your body a reason to believe that it needs to make to 80, 90 or 100 by stressing our environments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That last paragraph isn't really true though. Humans have one of the biggest life expectancy to body mass ratios of all mammals. It's thought that the knowledge of our elders was so important to early humans, that there was actual selection for longer life spans.</p>
<p>Remember, evolution isn't just selecting for if you reproduced or not. It's selecting for if you reproduced and your offspring also reproduced, and their offspring also reproduced, etc. So an elder generation living longer and being important for the success of their grandchildren and great grandchildren can definitely select for longer lifespans. This is also thought to be why women go through menopause, so that they can continue to support the tribe and younger generations, while not producing more children of their own, which would make resources more scarce.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks man. Pushing yourself outside your comfort zone works for many things, not just your body.</p>
<p>I recently agreed to participate in a project at work that I was intimidated by and involved lots of things I didn't understand and how to do it wasn't clear to me.  It absolutely kicked my ass but in that 2 months I learned more than I would have learned in 1 year of normal work.</p>
<p>Now I'm proud of myself and feel like I can handle that same situation better because I made it through and learned some things at the same time.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p></div>		</li>
