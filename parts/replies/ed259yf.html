			<div class="markdown"><p>I think so; when I had pet frogs I was advised to put them in the freezer when going on holiday - slows them right down without killing them, and they won't starve! Always seemed a bit too risky for me so I never did it, though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mind blown. I googled this cos I thought you were having a laugh, I couldn't find anything other than a few &quot;preserving frog legs&quot; or &quot;how to humanely kill a frog&quot; articles so I'm still skeptical. True or not, my entire holiday would be spent worrying about my damn cold frog. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I can gather, the reason why frogs organ's dont die is because there is an excess of glucose/glycogen that is released and then stored in organs as they are freezing to <em>prevent</em> them from truly freezing/causing damage. If you just had the legs, there wouldnt be a glucose release, and thus no protection.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not an expert here, but I would think that the antifreeze is not a passive component that hangs around but rather something explicitly produced for hibernation. Therefore, logically, the freshness would only stay if you chopped up the frog in its hibernation state, and if the cooking process doesn't destroy the antifreeze, so rather unlikely. I repeat tho, not an expert.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>well, I'm atleast a talented amateur outdoorsman/hunter/angler and I can tell you that before you put any meat in the freezer, you want clean it thoroughly, removing as much blood from the meat as possible. With smaller sources like fish and frogs it's a simple matter of a good washing to remove enough of the blood to safely freeze it. With larger game like deer, I usually pack the meat in an ice chest and drain it regularly until the water drains mostly clear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If a limb or other body part (e.g., ear, nose, penis) is severed, do not put it in direct contact with ice. Direct contact with ice can cause freezer burn and damage it. Wrap it in plastic or put it in a ziplock bag first, then surround it with ice.</p>
<p>With limbs, you usually have 6-12 hours to reattach it.</p>
<p>Longer for smaller body parts.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When Cryonics to be waken up again far in the future, the blood is drained and the body is filled with some anti-freeze-like solution &amp; stored. There is, however, no procedure yet to reverse the proces and repair the remaining damage caused by the process</p>
