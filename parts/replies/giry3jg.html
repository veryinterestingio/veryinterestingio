			<div class="markdown"><p>I am sorry, but that's not true. Even for a point source, temporal coherence is important on scales comparable to the time difference of passing through the different routes. Most &quot;human sized&quot; sources probably fulfill that rather easily though? But for non-point source (which even the laser diode easily is) spatial coherence is crucial - in astronomy you can literally use it to measure properties of unresolvable objects (in intensity interferometry).</p></div>		</li>
