			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a race on my head to see what will happen first: going bald or going completely gray. After several years it looks like the gray is winning out... just barely.</p>
<p>My uncle is in his 80s and still has a huge bushy head of longish hair; he looks pretty cool. But it turned silver in his 20s. I'd rather have his luxurious silver hair than my almost-no-hair. I got the bad genes from both sides: my mom's father was bald like a cue-ball, and my father's side seems to turn gray early.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I started going noticeably grey at about 21. I'm now 38 and have about 45% grey hair. I generally don't care but I do hate when you get the odd mile long white wire-like hair out of your eyebrow (or worse, your lady-tache) that you didn't notice and you're like &quot;how the fuck did that get so long without me noticing it?!&quot;. That sucks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This could just be genetic, but ya'll should really pay attention to and be intentional about your vitamin intake, especially if you're vegetarian or vegan. If the greying is actually the result of an underlying deficiency you might have a lot of other issues coming up soon if you don't take action!</p>
<p>Vitamin D, Vitamin b12, magnesium, iron, and iodide are all very common deficiencies. Take a close look at your diet and make sure you're not missing out on one of these.   </p>
<p>And take a close look at your sun exposure too for vitamin D, in particular if you're dark skinned and/or living somewhere without a lot of sun. Where I live in the PNW a huge portion of the population has an ongoing vitamin D deficiency unless they look after it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does the slowing down of cell division affect cancer rates in older adults? I remember when seniors were volunteering to help out after the meltdown at Fukushima. They were saying they had less of a chance of developing cancer from the radiation due to their age. Any insight into that?</p>
<p>Edit - Off topic I know but you reminded me of that and I couldn't find the info I was looking for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The more a cell divides, the more chance of a mutation occuring. Our cells are actually pretty good at preventing mutations and we have all sorts of mechanisms in place to prevent it, but sometimes a mutation slips through. Cancer occurs when there are multiple mutations in a cell and when these mutations occur in the genes that work as a defense mechanism, basically disabling our defense against developing cancer. Radiation can damage DNA and damaged DNA is more likely to result in mutations. The reason old people are less likely to develop cancer due to radiation is because their damaged cells will not have such a long time to continue duplicating and to form multiple mutations in the DNA.

			<div class="markdown"><p>So yeah cell division rates slow down as you age, and if you didn’t develop a mutation that would lead to cancer at that point, then the chance of getting it later diminishes. </p>
<p>The radiation would still damage their DNA, but because their cells are not dividing as rapidly, there is less of a chance a cancer mutation develops. In mice, this isn’t the case and they have similar chances of getting cancer independent of their age.</p>
<p>An analogy I can think of is an athlete slowing down as they age and so they have less of a risk of an injury because they aren’t exercising as intensely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! That's where my own logic was leading me but I just couldn't find info about it. So it's just that any damage the radiation does to the DNA wouldn't cause cancer by itself because those particular damaged cells wouldn't be dividing as much and they would probably pass away from something else before any cancer caused by the radiation. At the same time any damage that built up during their life could still cause, let's say, prostate cancer.</p></div>		</li>
