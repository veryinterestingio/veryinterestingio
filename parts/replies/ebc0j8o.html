			<div class="markdown"><p>Oooh I hated tomatoes for the longest time. I started getting into them after having a really good and fresh 3 tomato salad at a Mediterranean restaurant. I gradually started leaving them on burgers, sandwiches. It really is just like beer, trying it whenever you can. I’m still super picky, and the “fast foody” tomatoes at Taco Bell and McDonalds I still usually skip, but they have an awesome texture and can really recommend them</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh believe me I've tried (and keep trying). I can do processed tomatoes, like sauces, soups and even sun dried tomatoes. I'm slowly warming up to more raw-based stuff like salsa, but the chucks still make me gag. I once had a kebab and I always order without tomato, but they forgot and I gagged again. I do remain hopeful that one day I can enjoy a salad with a tomato. As for now I am able to pick them out just fine, whereas I couldn't even do that before because of the taste it left behind.</p>
<p>It's super odd though, because my family loves tomatoes, so it's not something I never tried growing up either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know that feeling. That’s how I am with Brussels sprouts. My whole family loves them, but I can’t even swallow them. I can normally be polite and at least pretend to munch on other things, but not those little green balls of gross</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you like tuna or chicken salad (just chicken, no celery). Make that on a toasted bagel, get some lettuce and cut up tomotoes into very small like m&amp;m size pieces and just put a few, maybe 5 of those on there. You won't even notice the texture of the tomotoe, but you'll get the flavor, which is very subtle. That's how I started eating tomotoe. I still won't eat tomotoe sliced round on a burger though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can go the other way too. I was confused about how my toddler could possibly not like strawberries, so I tried really hard to think &quot;this is so disgusting&quot; as I ate one, fixating on any little thing that was unpleasant about it. And sure enough, that strawberry was extremely unpleasant for me to eat. </p>
<p>I remember as a kid I loved Lima beans until I got to school and all the other kids hated them... sure enough, I hated them too until adulthood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get like that when I eat eggs. If I think too much about what an egg is, I get grossed out and won't have it for a good while. And yeah I definitely remember similar phases in school.. Group mentality and the need to fit in is one hell of a thing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I have a rescued pet indoor duck who lays tons of eggs. I cannot bear to eat them, it just grosses me out to no end. It’s weird lol. But yes the more I think about it the creepier it seems </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you Camilla Cream?!? She's in a children's book called A Bad Case of the Stripes and she stopped eating Lima beans because everyone at school hated them. The moral of the story is non-conformity is the way to go, so you do you and eat your darn Lima beans!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not Camilla Cream. However, with how frequently they serve Lima beans at school despite not a single kid eating them, I'm not surprised that the experience made its way into a book.</p></div>		</li>
