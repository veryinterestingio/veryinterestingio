			<div class="markdown"><p>The fact that dogs are the most common vector is the reason why vaccinating dogs is so important. In my country, we are virtually free from rabies since the 70s, with just a handful of sporadic cases from illegally imported dogs, and not even 40 cases in more than 40 years of rabies transmitted by bats. This is all due to extensive rabies vaccination campaigns.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which reservoir hosts are most important varies from region to region. According to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/images/rabies-us-map.jpg" target="_blank">this map from the U.S. CDC</a>, skunks and bat are the main hosts in the midwestern U.S. and racoons are mostly significant as hosts in the eastern U.S.. Other hosts are important in other parts of the world, including mongooses and jackals in Africa and foxes across much of Asia. As the other pointed out, dogs are signficant almost everywhere (at least where vaccination is not common). Though I don't know if  dogs are technically reservoir hosts since I think rabies tends to be pretty rapidly fatal for them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bats survive rabies. <a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/blog/viruses101/is_rabies_really_100_fatal/" target="_blank">14% of dogs survive rabies.</a></p>
<p>There are data from <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/spoonful/2012/08/antibodies-found-in-peruvians-suggest-natural-resistance-to-rabies-in-local-vampire-bats.html" target="_blank">Peru</a> suggesting people have antibodies to rabies without ever having been vaccinated for it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Knowing that the Peruvians had contact with local vampire bats, CDC scientists closely examined the blood samples of the eight residents. They found a mixture of neutralizing and non-binding antibodies against rabies, leading them to deduce that the individuals had overcome exposure to the virus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there is the possibility that even <em>humans</em> may get infected with rabies and never get sick from it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is fascinating about the Peruvians. The transfer of rabies via organs has always made me suspect it may be possible to develop protective immunity naturally. We know people make antibodies on their own, even when they die, its just they haven't made the right ones. Some people are bound to have made antibodies against better active sites on the virus and achieved neutralization: these people would likely never be noticed by the medical community as they are blissfully unaware. Still it is undocumented.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some diseases cause almost no symptoms in their &quot;preferred&quot; host, and that makes them very successful, even if the disease is too lethal to reliably spread in other hosts.</p>
<p>As another example, herpes is incredibly common in humans (~50% of all adults), and usually only causes cold sores or mildly annoying blisters every once in a while. The same type of virus is fatal to 85% of infected elephants, sometimes killing them in under 24 hours.</p>

<p>Closer to 80% in older Europeans. </p>
<p>This is off topic, but the craze about herpes is the result of a very successful marketing campaign by the producer of acyclovir.</p></div>		</li>
