<p>I've always toyed with the idea of a typical electronics engineer being transported back to the 1800s knowing what we know today. What could we actually build given the tools and materials that were present back then?</p>

<p>There's a great essay, <em>I, Pencil</em>. The author traces all the inputs, components and processes it takes to go from raw materials to a simple but fully finished pencil. The point is that even seemingly simple products rest on the shoulders  of staggeringly complex economic and technological underpinnings.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: here is his story. I guess it only took 6 months, not a year.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Precisely.</p>
<p>Related to this James Burke's &quot;Connections&quot; series dealt with this.  The evolution of inventions is the subject at hand.  Many &quot;new&quot; inventions are a progression of previous ideas that are refined for another purpose.</p>
<p>In his series (for example), he used perfume sprayers and their evolution to carburetors.   Also Napoleon's saving of food in Champaign bottles evolving to rocket engines (no kidding).</p>
<p>Life (and inventions) are a series of seemingly insignificant forks in a series of roads.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An artefact like this would drive technogical advancement simply to understand it.</p>
<p>Once you figure out how to decap an IC (fuming nitric acid), you can see gross structural details with the naked eye, at least enough to tell you there's something fucky happening at the microscopic level. This would drive the development of more powerful microscopes, probably up until the point that simple optics just can't magnify further. I think it's a couple thousand times magnification?</p>
<p>I'm not totally sure what the state of electronics was in 1920, but I think it's unlikely they'd get anything super useful from inspecting an IC like this. The designs just get too complex, especially with the different types of memory structures we bake into ICs now. It'd take a couple of decades, probably, to figure out what it does and how.</p>
<p>What <em>would</em> be revolutionary and actually useful is the radio circuitry. We take for granted that we have phones that contain multiple radios capable of transmitting across miles and capable of receiving from space. At one point, an fm radio transmitter took up a whole room. Imagine what they'd do if presented with a tiny solid state transceiver. The need to reverse engineer the radios alone would spawn industries overnight, probably a multinational effort to understand the engineering processes involved.</p>
<p>All in all, there's enough easily accessible technology to fuel decades of research.</p></div>		</li>

<p>With WW1 ending several years prior, I doubt many would be keen to trust a multinational sharing of this &quot;alien&quot; technology.</p>
<p>I do agree with most of what you wrote. Think of all tech we have today that we take for granted, that came out of the space race. Different scenario of course, but there was a goal set and may industries that had to be built to supply the needs of achieving that goal.</p>
<p>If the goal here was, &quot;understand what this magic brick does and how&quot; then you can imagine what would be discovered just trying to figure it out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ooh. There was a fun discussion in r/chemistry this summer, something like “what would you do with your chemistry skills in a post apocalyptic scenario?” Talking about making soap, isolating methyl salicylate and salicylic acid for pain relief, (making acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is surprisingly difficult with minimal supplies,) making HCl, using that to do some basic halogenations, distilling ethanol, possibly making diethyl ether.</p>
<p>Those books sound right up my alley, I’ll write that down.</p>
<p>Edited slightly for clarity.</p></div>		</li>
