			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. Back when I was in college studying for psych I remember doing alot of research into dreaming.</p>
<p>It's fascinating how some of the tropes are true, but never absolutely. Your dreams <em>do</em> take bits and pieces of what you're feeling, going through, your daily routine and all that; which is why all those elements have a way of bleeding through (people you know, dreaming you're at work/school, etc)</p>
<p>Buuut your brain is also taking cues from all the basic stimuli around you. Sounds, light, temperature, touch, etc. I remember reading studies on sleeping patients. They would have people sleep in total darkness, but at different stages (such as deeper REM cycles) they would take a candle and put it near their faces. Some dreamers would report &quot;lights suddenly turned on&quot; in their dreams, or a similar facade such as a &quot;sunrise&quot;</p>
<p>Others would do the &quot;put their hand in water&quot; thing (or running water for the sound) which, no, will not make you pee yourself, but many of the patients reported water suddenly appearing in their dreams. Rain, rivers, floods, swimming, etc.</p>
<p>They most important thing though is not one variable is ever the <em>only</em> explanation for what you saw and felt.</p>
<p>Your brain is taking all this stimuli, all your feelings, virtually everything bouncing around in your mind and it makes a dream soup. Each time the soup will have slightly different ingredients/ratios and each and every person will have a different way of &quot;mixing&quot; this into your dreamscape: take two people and do the &quot;water thing&quot; and one might see it as going swimming, the other might see it as torrential rain. Then add in the possibility of 10-20 minor variables and you can imagine how mixed up it can all get.</p>
<p>That is why they say your dreams <em>can be</em> meaningful but there's a TOOON of reading between the lines. And sometimes it's just dream soup nonsense.</p>
<p>Our brains are so cool!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That explains something that happened to me recently! Through the night we were having a really heavy rainfall and i remember dreaming
about a waterfall or some kind of water feature and as i awoke i remember being confused as to why i still heard water running. Turns out my ceiling was leaking. It's cool how my brain turns factored that into my dream</p></div>		</li>

<p>Last week apparently my dog was on the bed, standing with one paw right above my hip and in towards my abdomen. </p>
<p>In my dream I was in a fight and got slammed on the ground and the attacker had placed all his weight on his knee, resting in that same spot. </p>
<p>I remember it feeling SO heavy but not much pain at all, very panicked though. </p>
<p>Woke up to my dog licking my face lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can't find the source, but I remember reading dreams sort of &quot;collect&quot; right as you're snapping into consciousness while waking, by taking all the random thoughts and making a memorable string of events out of them. It was a theory presented by some dude who had an elaborate dream of becoming a beloved turned hated king, sentenced to the guillotine, and just as he was beheaded, he was startled awake by a fallen book landing on his head.  </p>
<p>LOL sorry I can't be more specific than ~that dude~</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dream research sounds so cool.  Do you know why some people seem to dream more than others? I tend to dream almost every night and can often remember parts of my dreams with clarity. My partner says she either doesn't dream or can't remember dreaming... Always wondered why that was.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately it's been too long for me to give you a truly informed answer. Life and work catches up so I just meddle around when I can.</p>
<p>My instinct would say first, as always is the case with our brains, we're all on a big spectrum. Base physiology for everyone is different. Just like your active walking memory and recall might be better than your partner's, but worse than your neighbors. Some people can just do it. Couldn't tell you what the technical reasoning behind that is but I'm sure a more informed professional can.</p>
<p>Past that environmental conditions are definitely a factor as well. Not only do we all respond differently to outside stimuli (such as OPs question of why just saying his name wakes him up, while others would be out cold) I'd say some of this we might be &quot;born with&quot; and other times it can be conditioned in.</p>
<p>I can sleep like a rock but some triggers wake me right up.  I don't know why but for some reason I am in complete tune with my bedroom door. If someone opens my door when I'm sleeping I wake up instantly. Even if they make no noise whatsoever.</p>
<p>I've had people wake me up just by <em>walking up to my door</em>. I've been up and staring at them before they even open the door which definitely freaks some people out because if I fall asleep with the door open I'm out like a light.</p>
<p>But if someone tries to be polite and close my door.. I'm up. I wasn't always like this so at some point that got conditioned in. Not sure when or how.</p>
<p>Anywho, back to environment. Even things like physical health, diet and chemicals can have an effect on the more technical aspects.</p>
<p>I remember a while back a study claimed the THC in weed was a &quot;blocker&quot; for some people's dreams.  Not sure if that was verified but the gist is: They still dreamed of course, but some reaction with the THC prevents the memory from being consolidated, much like an alcohol or xanax &quot;blackout&quot;. You <em>had</em> the memory but your brain couldn't properly process it from short term into long term so it dumped it along with all the other useless info were constantly taking in.</p>
<p>So, tl;dr, brains are complicated and there's alot of variables at play. An expert could answer it more specifically I'm sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm no expert, but I saw an article in a science journal once where it basically gave the answer that actually we all dream about the same amount... it's just that some people remember their dreams more often, probably relating to how deep their sleep is. It's more about whether you consolidate the memory when gaining consciousness, than whether you actually dreamed in the first place.</p>
<p>I don't remember all the details but the gist of it was that most people who remember their dreams often will tend to be fairly light sleepers, whereas most who don't remember dreams will tend to be heavier sleepers. The light sleepers wake more often through the night (so have more chances for the brain to remember the dream on that boundary) and also have less time between REM sleep and consciousness so there's less time for the memory to disappear.</p>
<p>This bears out with my experiences - as a heavy sleeper I very rarely remember dreams, and when I do it's usually when my sleep has been disturbed so I've woken more quickly. It also tallys with the fact that you can often feel the details of a dream &quot;slip away from you&quot; over the first moments of consciousness: the faster you wake up, the less of the dream is &quot;lost&quot; before you can make sense  of it in your waking brain</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have had insanely vivid mostly nightmares my entire life from age 4/5 and beyond. I distinctly remember the one night in 7th grade that I had a “good” dream (I’m 28). I remember my dreams every single night and fairly often mix up small details between reality and dreams. I’ve experienced sleep paralysis, worked with lucid dreaming, have had dreams that can be interpreted as premonitions (by friends/family I do not believe them to be) — and because of this have read a ton of different things/theories about dreams. </p>
<p>As far as I know, everyone dreams — it’s just that people who don’t think they dream don’t remember them. The brain isn’t supposed to remember all of your dreams because they are weird/can be traumatizing so it’s a normal function to forget. It’s not known why some people remember or have more vivid dreams on the regular. A theory I read into several years ago suggested that people who have really good memories tend to remember their dreams better. It was also suggested in line with memory, that people who are highly observant of details also tend to remember their dreams more often. </p>
<p>THC withdrawal is known to cause more vivid dreams for a couple days after a heavy smoker stops smoking. I’m a huge stoner and my god do I wish THC prevented you from remembering your dreams. Depending on the severity of the nightmare, I often spend the first hour of being awake just reacquainting myself with this reality. I wake up with the thoughts and feelings of the dream. It really messes with your head and I wouldn’t wish it upon anyone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Furthermore, your brain actually processes ALL auditory input but chooses what to bring to your attention and what to filter out. Psychologists refer to the “Cocktail Party Effect” as an example - in a room full of people having conversations, you have no idea what everyone around you is talking about, but if one of those conversations says your full name, you’d notice that!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. It's actually very similar. The low powered core has very little memory and just listens to the hotword only. It's constantly listening but not recording, but once it hears the hotword, it wakes up the rest of the system which is more powerful now to listen and transcribe your actual command.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting there is a further subtlety to this.  The low powered , low capability processor in the Echo (or similar) devices themselves don't make the final decision as to whether the wake-word is correct.  If they hear something that sounds sort of like the wake-word, to the best of their limited computing power, they will record it and submit it to the cloud for verification.   For Amazon Echo devices, the yellow ring flashes when it does this, but nothing further happens if the more powerful cloud servers decide no one actually said the wake word.   This means that things do get sent to the cloud more often that you might assume, but these recordings are (supposedly) discarded if the wake word was not detected.</p>
<p>You can test this behaviour by using similar words that sound similar to Alexa, for example &quot;Alexis&quot; or &quot;Adessa&quot; - you probably can get the yellow ring to flash meaning it's sending a recording to the cloud for verification, but it won't answer since you didn't actually say the correct wake-word.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Anyone who's worried about devices like Amazon Echo or Google Home constantly monitoring what people say vastly underestimates the processing power required to send and store literally everything to a server.</p></div>		</li>
