I think adrenaline accounts as much for the My blood ran cold feeling as blood draining from the stomach.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This kind of phenomena does not exist in humans; it exists in some reptiles though like snakes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Handling snakes too soon after eating is the second major cause of regurgitation (vomiting in a sense). After a snake eats in the wild, its normal pattern of behavior includes finding a secluded spot to stay for a few days, where it can rest and digest its meal. During this time, it will display very little activity.</p>
<p>If the animal gets stressed of startled, such as by a potential predator, a full stomach makes fight or flight difficult. It then regurgitates its food item, thus evacuating its stomach, which makes activity [such as defense] much easier.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can still handle ourselves with food in our stomachs.</p></div>		</li>
