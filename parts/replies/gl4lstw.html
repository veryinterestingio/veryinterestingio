			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite. Observations of Oumuaua are pretty easy to reconcile with the hypothesis that it’s simply a rocky/icy body not unlike the asteroids and comets in our solar system. The claim that it’s an extraterrestrial spacecraft is tied to observations showing it undergoing a very tiny amount of acceleration. An alien spaceship could certainly accelerate, that’s true, but there are plenty of ways to get that kind of dynamics out of something like an asteroid or comet.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, that's what I was saying: the observations, <em>including the observation of acceleration</em>, point to it either being an alien spaceship or a comet. The reason I said &quot;new kind&quot; of comet is because there's a debate about whether it could be hydrogen or something else that we haven't observed yet, which would allow it to both have a hard-to-see tail and have travelled for so long.</p>
<p>Loeb rejects the hydrogen comet hypothesis, but it seems like, even if you agree with the rejection, it's hard/impossible to reject &quot;some other kind of unknown comet.&quot; So then it's just a question of which is more likely, absent other data.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it was an alien spaceship then why is it tumbling and why is the acceleration slow.  If it was a light sail, for instance, shouldn’t the acceleration be higher?</p>
<p>So it is either a comet or a very inefficient alien spacecraft?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are they not cowed by old assumptions, though? There are not many reasons to assume the absence of other civilizations’ space-junk in the galaxy, at least. Even if both life and “advanced life” are extreme rarities despite the relative commonness of the conditions-for-life, across time, all of those (perhaps) tiny probabilities multiply. Assuming that the “control” (Earth) is the anomaly isn’t grounded.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The (convincing, in my opinion) argument is that we expect something like ten septillion of these comet/asteroid-like interstellar objects to be floating about the Milky Way. If something comes careening through the solar system behaving in a manner consistent with it being one of these objects, there's no compelling reason to assume it's something as exotic as an alien spacecraft without a lot more evidence. Now if we had observed it to, say, emit a sequence of primes or undergo more significant acceleration, then sure, let's think about aliens.</p>
<p>But if it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, and we naturally expect there to be like a trillion ducks nearby, well...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>“Assuming the absence” is backwards. Realistically, you’d have to assume the presence of something. Absence is the default. We should NEVER assume something exists then prove that it doesn’t. It should be the other way around. That’s like saying unicorns exist until you can find reasons they don’t... It doesn’t work that way. </p>
<p>Really, we have observed a far off body undergoing acceleration. That is the observation. Anything more is an assumption.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're not equal in terms of Occam's razor. Oumuamua being a spaceship requires the necessary precursors for life, life evolving, intelligent life evolving, culture developing, technology advancing, civilization arising etc. that are historical processes that may fail disastrously every step of the way.</p>
<p>Conversely, a &quot;misbehaving rock&quot; might be just a misbehaving rock without taking on this enormous explanatory debt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Moreover, of the many possible alien intelligences that could be out there, very few are consistent with such an unassuming event as this.</p>
<p>Put simply, how likely is it that the first evidence we would get of an alien civilization is a barely-detectable object just a little different than expected passing by the edge of our solar system, as opposed to something like a colony ship moving directly towards the sun at relativistic speeds in order to colonize our solar system?</p>
<p>As rare as you would expect alien intelligences to be by default, alien intelligences producing phenomena this bizarrely understated and lacking in a comprehensible goal should be that much more rare.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, if we've already crossed over into science fiction, we could easily portray it as the ship of an extremely shy civilization of alien nerds trying to look for resources undetected. And which autopilot failed, killing everyone on board, just surfing the universe listening to intergalactic radio, minding its own internal cosmos.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The opposite is obvious to me, you'd only want to subtly give yourself away so as to just be camouflaged and observing the life not intelligent enough to figure your subtlety out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with you.</p>
<p>But Loeb's stance appears to be that of Sherlock Holmes: &quot;One you've eliminated the impossible, whatever remains....&quot;</p>
<p>Except in this case, he <em>must</em> mean &quot;the extremely improbable&quot; instead of impossible, as I can't imagine even Loeb believes that there is literally no possible alternative, however remote, besides aliens.</p>
<p>Therefore, it seems that Loeb's argument is that aliens are a <em>more likely</em> explanation, or an explanation requiring fewer other assumptions.</p>
<p>Obviously, many people disagree. But, just as clearly, it's not as trivially obvious that Occam's Razor must clearly favor one side or the other if there is such a disagreement.</p></div>		</li>
