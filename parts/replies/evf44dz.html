			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes - Earth's core will still be quite active by the time our Sun expands to engulf the planet in about 4-5 billion years.</p>
<p>Irrelevant, though, as the sun will continue to get hotter through it's life cycle. In about 1 billion years (irrespective of climate change) - the energy released by the sun will be so much more intense that liquid water will no longer be able to exist on the planet, and the last vestiges of surface life on the planet will be gone. </p>
<p>(That seems like a short time, as life began here nearly 4 billion years ago, but in human terms, that's about 1000x longer than our species has existed. In fact, 1 billion years ago, all life on the planet was single-celled, and the <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Oxygenation_Event" target="_blank"><em>great oxygenation event</em></a> was just ending.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>wow, these are two interesting additional answers to the Fermi paradox (why haven’t we discovered intelligent life/communications in a super huge universe that should statistically have tons) in the form of two “great filters” —  1. not just intelligent life being doomed by its sun going nova, or expanding to engulf it, but also simply growing too hot to sustain life,  and 2. perhaps a planet's core and resultant magnetic field could slow down and peter out, allowing destructive solar radiation to sterilize a planet.  </p>
<p>I'm sure scientists who study and philosophize about the Fermi paradox have these among their possible later-stage great filters, but they just occurred to me from your statement! I thought we humans, barring our own self-induced or external extinction-level events, had the whole 4-5 billion years to figure out if interstellar travel was possible and continue our species elsewhere.</p>
<p>Oh well, another lesson and opportunity for embracing impermanence!</p></div>		</li>

<p>This makes me sad for all the land, sea and air critters :(</p></div>		</li>

<p>I have another reply that says we don't know for sure. Do you have a source?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't know the exact mechanism that keeps Earth's core active. It could be simply residual heat, a nuclear reaction, some gravitational friction, or a combination. So.... Maybe?</p></div>		</li>
