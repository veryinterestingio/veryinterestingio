			<div class="markdown"><p>I love this feeling during SCUBA diving. We just call it diver's reflex. It stuns your brain for a split second and is incredibly calming.</p>
<p>It can help with anxiety attacks, too. If you put a wet wash cloth in your freezer and when feeling anxious, cover your mouth and nose and breath through the cold. It will shock you for a few seconds. </p>
<p>This is specifically face for me - but that's because only my face is showing on cold water diving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the mammalian diving reflex not the cold shock reflex.
MDR reduces your heart rate very fast and pulls blood toward your core, it is activated by receptors in your face that react to cold temperatures from liquids. This reduction in heart rate is the main reason it helps with anxiety attacks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did know about the mammalian diving reflex, but not how it can be activated to help with anxiety. That’s cool! I read about the diving reflex and what it does, and how it was studied using seals (I think). Fascinating article and what I thought about first when I read the OP.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Besides the fact that washing your face with cold water would help reduce redness and swelling from crying. It makes a lot of sense why going to the bathroom and wiping your face with cold water would calm you down. Lowered heart rate and getting out of the situation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans arent really meant to swim for pleasure. Evolutionarily, we get near water to drink and that's it. The cold shock reflex makes sense to rapidly acclimate your body when falling into snow or shallow rivers. Everything else is just kinda beyond the intended scope.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely false. Humans are literally born able to swim. We have been swimming and wading into water to get food since the dawn of time. In fact one theory proposes that is why we walk on two legs (and are the only primates that can speak, because we control our air intake the way water mammals do, and why we are hairless like water mammals).</p></div>		</li>
