			<div class="markdown"><p>40% overall vaccination should absolutely have an effect at the community at large. You'd see it in a reduced R number. R won't trend towards 0 until you approach herd immunity, but you'd still expect to see an effect.</p>
<p>The kicker is the lag time. 2 weeks after the first shot for moderate resistance, another 2 weeks after the second for maximum efficacy. On top of that, it takes a week or two for new infections to show up in hospitals, and another week or two for people to start dying. The vaccine's impact will take weeks, if not a month or two, to start really showing up in national statistics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not really an &quot;obviously&quot;-thing. Eventually you reach a &quot;herd protection&quot; level where the disease doesn't find hosts to infect and reproduce -&gt; even the non-vaccinated people will see a reduction.</p>
<p>How many people need to be immunized to reach herd protection varies from disease to disease (and mutation to mutation). More the better - always.</p></div>		</li>
