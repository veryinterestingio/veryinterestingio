			<div class="markdown"><p>This whole thread used ACE enzyme (pardon the redundancy) and ACE receptors as synonyms. ACE inhibitors affect the enzyme, not the receptor. That is why we don't use ACE inhibitors to block the binding of Corona virus to the ACE receptor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes theoretically but a negative one would be expected as ACE inhibitors actually increase ACE2 receptor density. That said, recent studies on people with COVID-19 on these drugs suggest no benefit (or a negative outcome) to halting therapy. This suggests either that receptor density is not important to clinical outcomes or that there are more severe effects to halting ACE therapy in those that need it. In other words, current best practices dictate that the ACE therapy should not be stopped to limit the spread of the virus in the body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ACE inhibitors upregulate ACE2 receptors. Hmm. Makes perfect sense. It’s always amazing how something can seem so straightforward but then there is a layer of complexity that can disprove your thinking. This is why actual clinical evidence and clinical correlation will be so useful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's some thought that Vitamin D, due to it promoting expression of ACE2, can actually help as well.  At least I read that recently, I don't really understand the science behind it.</p>
<p>Due to this time of year for the northern hemisphere to be more vitamin d deficient, it is thought that this may be a factor in why warmer, southern hemisphere countries have correlated somewhat with lower rates of infections and less deaths.</p>
<p>A friend of mine who works in infectious diseases in Canada also recommended I take a supplement of 1000 to 5000 IU of vitamin D/day.</p>
<p>Check out this response for reference, it is very insightful: <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.m810/rr-24" target="_blank">https://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.m810/rr-24</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any links to those studies? Very interested in reading, I will search though.</p>
<p>The thing is, if you have a high expression of ACE2 receptors wouldn't it take quite some time for those two die off after ceasing the drug?  I don't think the benefit would be seen until quite a while after cessation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! But there is not yet a consensus on I'd that effect is good or bad, basically. There is a possibility that ACE inhibitors and ARBs drugs lead to more severe response to the virus, but there is also the possibility that the opposite may be possible. Last I read, in the recent publications, we just don't know yet. Either way, it's recommended to stay in touch with your healthcare provider if you take either class of meds. Edit: I meant to come back and post this link for my source, towards the end of the page, there is an article about how the drugs could be beneficial. <a href="http://www.nephjc.com/news/covidace2?fbclid=IwAR37VoywiNRSqhEdRAp0Ry46V9vHxl0cwVSZAToFLGz-mUt6U9RyA_MvCYY" target="_blank">http://www.nephjc.com/news/covidace2?fbclid=IwAR37VoywiNRSqhEdRAp0Ry46V9vHxl0cwVSZAToFLGz-mUt6U9RyA_MvCYY</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Folding@home has retargetted a lot of their power towards investigating potential drugs for their effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2. (I found this out when I didn't get cool visualizations for protein folding because... I guess drug interactions aren't the same thing and they don't make cool visualizations?) Do you know if this sort of a thing would be what the project is investigating (they have a blog post here but I don't really understand like 90% of it - <a href="https://foldingathome.org/2020/03/30/covid-19-free-energy-calculations/" target="_blank">https://foldingathome.org/2020/03/30/covid-19-free-energy-calculations/</a>)</p>
<p>Also (for anyone reading this) if you have a PC with a cooling system that can handle running the CPU/GPU at 50-100% for hours (i.e. probably not a laptop) go download folding@home and help out!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good luck asking your healthcare provider and getting the right response. I am a resident at a major metropolitan hospital heading into the ICU next week. I also suffer from hypertension controlled on losartan. I've had numerous conversations with my attendings and colleagues if I should stop my arb before my exposure to covid and there is no consensus. There was a good NEJM article that came out recently but the results are cursory, of course, as the virus is only a couple months old. These are new questions that are being asked and no one knows the answers to them yet. Many theories and hypothesis but no actual answers yet. As for me, I am going to put my arb on hold and allow permissive hypertension for the coming weeks. If need be, I will go on a beta blocker despite the sexual side effects (CCBs make me constipated and HCTZ is a diuretic and I don't want to piss all the time). I am young, healthy, and in decent shape so permissive hypertension is an option. But please, speak to your healthcare provider before making decisions like this, because permissive hypertension may not be an option for you and other options may be on the table.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had the same thought, but the ace inhibitors would need to have a ligand binding coefficient that would rival the Covid-19 ligand binding coefficient to act a bit like an enzyme inhibitor to the virus...its been awhile since I took a pharmacokinetics class but I think it would be theoretically possible.  If the viral load got to be too much I doubt an Ace inhibitor would be very effective in blocking the virus, though.</p>
<p>Edit:  After seeing other comments and reviewing the RAAS I realize that ace inhibitors would not act on ACE 2, only ACE, and could theoretically up regulate expression of ACE 2, giving the virus more available substrate.  However, there is still a lot they don't know about everything, and the Mayo Clinic released a study on March 30th saying that Ace inhibitors do not seem to have a negative effect on treatment.  Drug classes that can control Ang II might be able to control inflammation and lung injury, possibly leading to a more positive outcome, so something like an ARB might be helpful in this pathology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)  is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines.  ACE2 lowers blood pressure by catalysing the cleavage of angiotensin II (a vasoconstrictor peptide) into angiotensin 1–7 (a vasodilator). ACE2 also serves as the entry point into cells for some coronaviruses. The human version of the enzyme is often known as hACE2. </p>
<p>ACE2 counters the activity of the related angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang(1-7) making it a promising drug target for treating cardiovascular diseases. CE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein, with its enzymatically active domain exposed on the surface of cells in lungs and other tissues. The extracellular domain of ACE2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the blood stream and ultimately excreted into urine.</p></div>		</li>
