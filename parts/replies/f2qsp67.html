			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of newer computers are able to use ipv6, at least for your home network. The main issue these days I presume is the network nodes that still only support ipv4. Atleast that is my understanding...</p>
<p>IP, NAT and the likes are fucking disastrous mess though. I'm surprised the internet works at all, its basically magic everything can talk at this point</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>5Ghz has been around for awhile and corrected this issue in numerous ways. Why go back and majorly upgrade the 2.4Ghz spec when 5Ghz is superior in nearly way?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>5Ghz is not superior in every way. </p>
<p>Theres a reason all these new routers now broadcast one SSID then toggle 5/2.4 to the device. Oftsn 2.4 is superior unless you have multiple APs (or “mesh”) bc most people have one router in a big house and once you get 3 rooms away the signal dies.</p>
<p>Number one thing I tell people with Internet connection problems is to connect to the network with the “_2.4Ghz” in the name. Then I recommend moving the router or just buying a consumer friendly mesh system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>5Ghz was dope because no one was using it at a time so channels were all free for grabs and many consumers live in small apartment so wall penetration wasn't an issue.</p>
<p>Today 5Ghz is just as polluted, however due to it shitty wall penetration you don't suffer as much. Like I don't live in a big house, but I can't use 5Ghz outside of my living room.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No one even conceptualized a world where routers would be so cheap that every single tenant in an apartment building would have their own radio transmitter sitting in a closet gathering dust out of sight, out of mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's overstating things. Anyone involved in IT for more than a decade was acutely aware at how rapidly things progress. The difficulty was that they couldn't imagine a future where these things would happen, it's that anyone smart enough would realise that you want <em>flexibility</em> in your tech to allow it to grow in ways you might not foresee. Rigidly limiting it in the way OP suggests is exactly the kind of problem that 20/20 hindsight had taught them was a bad idea.</p></div>		</li>
