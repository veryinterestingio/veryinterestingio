			<div class="markdown"><p>Practice, practice, practice. Being able to do algebra without making mistakes, being able to recall definitions from memory, being able to work through a wide variety of different style problems - these are all essential for any mathematician. Beyond this, just keep working hard at school and watch videos on channels such as Numberphile, 3blue1brown etc. so that you are exposed to a wide range of topics. Don't worry if you don't follow everything - you're not expected to - that will all come in time.</p></div>		</li>

I also maintain a journal filled with goodies from numberphile,Mathigon and futilitycloset (awfully cool website) to keep me engaged when I'm bored.
Thank you so much Dr.Tom!
Folks like you really help keep the spirit of curiosity alive!</p></div>		</li>
