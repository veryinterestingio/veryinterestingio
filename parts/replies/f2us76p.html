It's a cool little practical to see what wavelengths of light are actually being put out by stuff.  </p>
<p>The trick to making it clearer is mounting a piece of cd at 45 degrees at one end of a tube. Cut a window at the cd end of the tube and cover up the other end, except for a small hole/slit. Instead of the reflection of a whole light bulb, you just get a small line/dot split into its constituent wavelengths.</p></div>		</li>
