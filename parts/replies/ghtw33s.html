			<div class="markdown"><p>And the interesting thing to me is that \~50% number they are tossing around for efficacy &lt;21-28 days, it takes into account the first 7 days of infection which is likely driven by infections prior to antibody response. It appears, to me at least, that the efficacy is *likely* closer to the higher part of their CI (\~68%).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you start your window 7-10 days after  the first dose, the efficacy before the 2nd dose is 80+%. There's a sharp drop off in infections at around 10 days.</p>
<p>I think this is one of the main reasons why the UK was comfortable deciding to prioritize single doses for more people even without a dedicated trial. Protecting 2x at 80% seems to be a much bigger public health win vs 1x at 95%.</p></div>		</li>
