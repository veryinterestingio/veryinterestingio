			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey nonsequitrist!</p>
<p>I like this explanation! We care about the phase in radio astronomy because we treat the incoming radiation as a wave rather than as a particle like in higher energy astronomy. This requires the signal to be in phase at all telescopes we use in the interferometer. They are initially out of phase do to small differences in aprrature efficiency and distance from telescope to source (a meter or so matters even though the sources are parsecs away!!!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but here we're talking about using machine learning to produce an image out of insufficient data. I'm under the impression that people who didn't follow closely their approach are being a bit mislead when they are told it's a photograph.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a camera you have a lens which causes an image to form at a focal plane at which a multi-pixel sensor resides. For the event horizon telescope, the lens and sensor were made from the algorithm rather than a physical lens and sensor the size of the Earth. Hence why this was actually a photograph of a black hole. Normally, radio telescopes can't take photographs since they have a single antenna and not a multi-pixel sensor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would that not be what Pixel Night Sight is? I feel like his explanation is closer than you'd think. Sure, the black hole image isn't a picture per se, but he's right in that the Pixel is using AI to take superior images than the hardware should allow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think I have seen it referenced as a photograph anywhere. It's almost always referred to as an image and a photograph may be an image but an image is not a photograph</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey Alberius,</p>
<p>Yes this is very true. I unintentionally implied they don’t, and added an edit explaining how CCD chips function if you’d like to check it out :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The computational photography techniques that are starting to show up in the newest smartphones go quite a bit beyond the &quot;normal&quot; computation that needs to be done to get an image out of any digital camera sensor.</p>
<p>All a &quot;normal&quot; digital camera does is sample and digitize the voltages out of the CCD, add some metadata and maybe compress the result. It's not nothing, but it's trivial compared to stuff like built-in HDR or machine-learning-based simulated shallow depth-of-field.</p>
<p>It's fair to say that this black hole imaging synthesizes an image in a computational photography way, but it's not fair to claim that kind of thing is 'required' for all digital cameras.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on this a bit as well: any astronomical image you see that was used in some significant result has likely been through quite a few processing algorithms along the way. </p>
<p>In astronomy, if you want to find something new or test something that is yet untested, there's a few avenues:</p>
<ol>
<li>Build a new observatory to meet your needs. This is extremely expensive. For instance, ALMA (one of the radio observatories used for the black hole imaging project) cost around $1.5 billion USD to build. JWST appears to be pushing the $10 billion level for final production costs. This option only really occurs following a collection of many such individual needs. </li>
<li>Build a new instrument for an existing observatory to meet your needs. Often, previous-generation telescopes can be used to accommodate &quot;next-gen&quot; projects by adding new instruments. The costs here vary quite a bit, but are almost certainly in excess of the options below. Examples would be the so-called 3rd generation exoplanet imagers: CHARIS (Subaru), SPHERE (Very Large Telescope), and GPI (Gemini South).</li>
<li>Collect new data to meet your needs. Less expensive than the first two options, but observing time at major observatories is very competitive and observing runs are often valued at tens of thousands of dollars. </li>
<li>Improve data processing to meet your needs. This could be simply running the same software on more powerful computers or implementing altogether new techniques. It isn't uncommon to see interesting papers where a group has answered a question by using a new technique to reprocess publicly available archival data. Compared to the first two options, this amounts to a &quot;shoestring budget&quot; solution (especially if we don't attempt to convert the cost of graduate student souls to $USD). </li>
</ol>
<p>In some cases (such as the black hole image), you need to use a combination of the above to get a result. But, because of the extreme cost differences in the options above: to justify a budget proposal for option 1 you likely need to have pushed option 2 to its limit, and likewise down the chain (ie if you propose for Hubble observations of a target that was observed by Hubble already, and you don't address the existing observations to explain why they don't fulfill your needs, your odds probably aren't great). And because of this, any big result in astronomy is either the culmination of one of these avenues and the avenues below it, or a lucky &quot;needle in a haystack&quot; find (and often both).</p></div>		</li>
