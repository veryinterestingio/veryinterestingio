<p>That's not the whole story. While it is the same protein misfolding, it does misfold in a different way between strains. For example, you can distinguish CJD and Kuru in anti-PrP immunoblots of proteinase K digested samples. There are also distinct differences in the specific neurological symptoms. It's more than just the origin.</p></div>		</li>
