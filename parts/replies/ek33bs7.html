			<div class="markdown"><p>You're limiting your understanding of the human body by applying your knowledge of current technology. Something that has been done for centuries. </p>
<p>When electricity was discovered all of a sudden the brain was described in electrical terms such as 'pulses'. When telephony was invented the brain was described as sending 'messages'. </p>
<p>Our understanding of the brain is limited by our understanding of other external processes when the truth is the actual workings are unknown. </p>
<p>Referring to the body as a machine is an analogy following this same trend. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The brain does send electrical pulses as messages to different parts of the body. The reason these terms weren’t used before is because we had no idea how the brain worked without modern technology. Also, “messages” was used long before telephones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I sometimes get pains in my body that feel like an arrow or Ray has been shot through my body. I'll feel the pain on my shoulder, then inside my body, then say on my side, creating a straight line through my torso.</p>
<p>I've always imagined it was like a random electron or ray of something  emitted by the sun. No idea what it really is or why I have that obviously incorrect answer. </p></div>		</li>
