			<div class="markdown"><p>The reporting regions send two representatives which all convene together and vote on representative strains for inclusion in the vaccine. This is based on circulating strains and efficacy data of various putative vaccine strain seed stocks. All of the circulating strain data is more or less compiled from sentinel sites within the geographic regions. </p>
<p>Based on my conversation with one of the reps (albeit not with this is mind obviously) I think this would ostensibly throw a wrench in overall international cooperation but would not leave the US (or other regions) high and dry. We vote based on our data, more or less, and like minds agree. The CDC never rejects this recommendation, which would also not change much assuming WHO is outside the process for one year. The data the WHO curates is also freely available, though as others point out this might delay some reception of it. </p>
<p>But at the end of the day these are mostly all academics who know each other and would easily be able to have back channel communication should it be required in the case of a purely political move like this. Certainly none of the US sentinel sites are on board with this move.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even without knowing what kind of damage might be caused, can we list any benefits of the withdrawal. It sounds to me like participating in such an international program is among the most beneficial things we can do per dollar. In fact, it sounds like a few salaries are all it should cost to participate, so what's being earned here?</p>
<p><em>Edit: I suppose I'm not informed here so I should also ask... are we withdrawing as a source of data as well as funding? I assumed we are.</em></p>
<p><em>Edit edit: welp, looks like a second round of looking into this shows that the WHO does ask for mandatory contributions, so there is a significant cost to participate. What a shame.</em></p></div>		</li>
