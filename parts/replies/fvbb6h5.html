			<div class="markdown"><p>For anyone reading this. You don't have to go 5 times a week to swim. Even 1 time a week makes a really noticeable difference. Even once every other week will be a good start for muscles! I also have neck/back problems because of sitting office work and that is how I started.</p>
<p>I just go and swim until I don't feel like anymore. I don't set any goals, Im not on diet and don't plan on doing one. It's just a thing I do for my neck as a &quot;thank You&quot; for working many hours in one pose. And it is really amazing how responsive muscles are. Half hour of swimming per week is compensating for 40+ hours of sitting at desk. (Your experience may vary)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I'm a software dev, my work is tied to my computer. I spend at least 40 hours a week in front of one, more because some of my downtime is playing games.</p>
<p>I'm also 2m tall (6'6&quot; for those metrically challenged), and the world ain't built for us tall people.</p>
<p>Triathlon has been a fixture in my life now for 5 years or so and my back health has never been better.</p>
<p>The guy below though is right too, you don't need to swim every day, I'd say 2-3 times a week is ample if you have decent sessions of at least a half hour consistently. Like running, the durations can be shorter because there is no 'rest'.</p></div>		</li>
