<p>FFA-induced insulin resistance</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I didn't know this was a thing. So can someone become highly insulin resistant from a low carb, high fat diet?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not so strictly diet-related, since FFAs will be elevated in obesity anyway. Most diets won't trigger much de novo lipogenesis but the capacity for it is absolutely there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the answer is yes, but only in the context of a hypercaloric diet. Otherwise, even with higher than normal FFA concentrations, they are used up frequently enough that they don't cause insulin resistance. Otherwise, FFA and intracellular lipids are a signal to reduce insulin mediated glucose uptake (because the cells already have an energy source in FFA), which means higher glycemia, and so higher insulin release, which in time builds up insulin resistance.  </p>
<p>this article goes in great details about it<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep.  Meat consumption is highly related to diabetes.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. One study makes a general connection to meat while another rules out meat consumption itself as a trigger after more careful analysis and identified highly processed meats and increased storage of heme-iron as the main risk factors, both of which can apparently damage insulin producing pancreatic cells. Another study shows a gradient of meat eating increasing your risk (red meat&gt;fish&gt;eggs and milk&gt;vegan). However, these remain observational studies, which means it's impossible to truly tease out relationships amongst covariates since you're relying on what subjects tell you they've eaten and do vs. what they actually eat. And as noted below, these studies are from western countries. Indians have one of the highest prevalences of diabetes yet also one of the highest rates of vegetarianism in the world.</p>
<p>In the end it's unlikely meat itself is causing diabetes. More likely, it's various other lifestyle factors in western society that come with eating meat, especially processed meats, such as over-eating, obesity, high sugar consumption, low physical activity levels, etc. These same conditions are probably prevalent in Indians too. Without controlled studies models cannot effectively disentangle these effects from one another. The good news is you don't need 10s of thousands of subjects to identify patterns as you do in observational studies. But it's nearly impossible to conduct these kinds of controlled studies for long periods of time.</p></div>		</li>
