<p>Wait what? I thought something is visible when light reflects of it. If it doesn't reflect even after colliding, it will be dark, if it doesn't have anything to collide its transparent. I am intrigued by your explanation about absorbing light, could you please explain it? May be I am having a brainfart, so don't judge me</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought air is transparent because its so loosely packed almost everything passes through it, even light. Now my doubt is, is air bad at absorbing light as well? Do does that mean, in a hypothetical scenario where air is so densely packed, it would appear as white?</p></div>		</li>
