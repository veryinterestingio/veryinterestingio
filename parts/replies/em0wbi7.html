			<div class="markdown"><p>News articles are constantly talking about how some new movie is the highest grossing film of all time or best opening weekend. When you adjust that for inflation, it's not always the case. It seems to me less people take it into account then we should.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The movie companies are themselves encouraging it because saying that you are the no 1 grossing film of all time leads to even more sales, saying you sold the 50th most tickets probably LOSES sales.  It's all about hyping up the movie.  Because of this, those are the numbers they give the media, and the media report the numbers that they've been told.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, when it comes to news articles, they are mostly just trying to get attention so people will read it and they can make money. They say that without making considering inflation because it is technically true, and big numbers and breaking records are exciting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's exactly why the studios talk about gross. It sounds better to say you made the highest grossing movie of all time. It's all about the ability to hype things up.</p></div>		</li>
