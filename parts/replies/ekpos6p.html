			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the commenter made a poor choice of words. </p>
<p>It's not about <em>removing</em> angular momentum, it's about <em>changing</em> it.</p>
<p>You need to apply a force to make the wheel spin faster, or spin slower. That's intuitive enough. What's not very intuitive is that you also need to apply a force to change the spinning axis.</p>
<p>So turning a spinning wheel doesn't necessarily reduce its rotation.</p></div>		</li>
