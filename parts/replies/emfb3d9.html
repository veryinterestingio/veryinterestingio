			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, I remember watching a Making of Planet Earth sequence about how they got the birds of paradise shots. It said that the camera man waited for days in a tree blind to get the footage he needed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember the one for a great white shark eating a seal or something like that they got on one of the last days at sea, a lot of luck, but also a lot of good educated guesses and learning shark patterns. They had been out for months or something trying to find that shot, moving all over the place.</p>
<p>The shot: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzxy3GtSzt0" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzxy3GtSzt0</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The one that really creeped me out and stuck with me is [this shot] (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkCsugMNfQA" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkCsugMNfQA</a>) where an exhausted seal struggles onto an iceberg and gets drug under the water by a killer whale. It knows it's done and doesn't even really struggle when the whale grabs it's tail and pulls it under the water. I just can't imagine the terror of that. Knowing that you're about to be eaten alive and not having the strength to get away or defend yourself. Having no choice but to just let it happen to you and only hoping that it's quick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The recent &quot;Our planet&quot; took 4 years to film and I heard that it was rushed because they needed it finished sooner because we needed to see the damage we are doing to our planet. </p>
<p>In &quot;Blue planet&quot; I believe they missed a huge mating season of some fish and had to wait till the next year to try and film it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An important thing to remember is that you don’t see the shots that they never get. Meaning - you see amazing shots because those are the ones they captured. There are thousands of excursions that you never see footage of because they didn’t result in any usable footage.</p></div>		</li>
