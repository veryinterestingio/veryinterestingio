			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, great answer. Your point that &quot;psychopaths aren't emotionless robots, they are capable of fear, pain,etc&quot; is really insightful and breaks lots of myths.
So, If I could summarise what I have gained from all the answers: yes, they can suffer from PTSD. Many answers suggest that some can even develop psychopathic traits as a result of traumatic experiences especially in childhood. Some research suggests that these psychopathic traits in those who already have it, can act as a protective buffer against conditions like PTSD. To add to this, psychopaths aren't emotionless robots, but they don't feel emotions all the time.
Please point to me if I'm getting something wrong.
Again, your answer was great and really insightful</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well more than capable is probably an overstatement.</p>
<p>Someone extremely high in psychopathy or a true psychopath almost never feels depression, heavy fear,anxiety ect.Or it's so weak that they often don't even notice such emotions.</p></div>		</li>
