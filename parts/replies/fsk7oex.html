			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, thanks for the explanation. I finally get it. And here's another analogy for guitar players that your explanation made me think of:</p>
<p>If you put a capo on the second fret, then an A chord takes the shape of what would be a G chord without the capo, so mentally we think of that as a G chord because the shape is more important even though we know it's not literally a G chord.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, horns like trumpets didn't used to have valve buttons.</p>
<p>Instead, you'd own a set of different pieces of tubing to insert into the trumpet at different times to change its key.</p>
<p>This is why many older pieces would have a section in, say, Trumpet in Bb, and then like a key change would just switch to, say, Trumpet in Eb.</p>
<p>You'd quickly pull out the tuning bit, stick in a different-length one, and continue playing in the new transposition.</p>
<p>Of course, this is an awful way to notate music today.</p></div>		</li>
