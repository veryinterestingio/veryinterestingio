			<div class="markdown"><p>No, because the cells in organs age too, or more specifically they divide a set number of times before becoming senescent. The process might be slowed if the organ is donated to younger people but a 200 year old liver would function exactly how you would expect the liver of a 200 year old to. </p>
<p>Also the organ will likely be damaged by the patients’ immune systems making it even less functional over time. This is why organ recipients need to take steroids to weaken their immune system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whaddya mean steroids aren’t used anymore? I’m a transplant pharmacist at a university affiliated hospital and for our livers and kidneys we continue to use prednisone. </p>
<p>The data does differ, and each center adopts its own protocols. Generally after age 65 we stop the steroids as the patients immune system is already naturally declining, plus we have multiple other immunosuppressants onboard still.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even with strong immunosuppressant drug therapy, the recipients body attacks donated organs and gradually damages them. That’s why organ transplants have a relatively short ‘lifespan’. The few cases of re-donation are people who die from other causes shortly after reviving a donor organ. Many people who receive donor organs need another one later in life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. I have a friend with five kidneys.</p>
<p>His MRIs look ridiculous.</p>
<p>What's crazy is that he was born with three. All of which worked fine - for a while. He had a transplant as a teenager and another in his mid 30s.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it's not looking good now. He's back on dialysis. His arms are stiff from scarring. He's pretty unwell :(</p>
<p>Five kidneys is definitely not a super power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to give sort of an idea of how rare re-transplants are.</p>
<p>In the same time period 650,000+ organs were transplanted in the US, meaning that only 1 in 10000 organs is a re-transplant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Organ donations aren't common in the first place. Over that time span there were (very) roughly 2 billion organs of the kinds listed in the U.S. (Current 330M population plus around 80M who died plus people who were temporarily U.S. persons for the sake of such counts for a total of 500M times 4 organs. Technically we should be counting the population in &quot;organ years&quot; rather than just organs.) That means ~1/3000 organs are donated overall, and previous donation only reduces that rate by a factor of around 3.3.</p></div>		</li>
