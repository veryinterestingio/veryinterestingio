			<div class="markdown"><p>Similarly in software development our goal is to change only one thing at a time, whenever possible, otherwise it goes badly.</p>
<p>For example, you have a team, with designated roles, familiarity with a standard set of tools, a certain architecture and set of components, and standard processes and procedures, and with working in a certain domain.</p>
<p>But then you want to do another project in another domain.  The best case would be to keep everything else the same, so you only have to focus on how to apply what you know to a new domain that you're learning.</p>
<p>In reality, it often means a whole new architecture with new components, new tools to work with it, new procedures and processes, and possibly even changing roles on the team.  Now everything you knew is wrong or no longer applies, and you have to keep <em>all</em> this new stuff in mind <em>all</em> the time to get it right, until you've built up familiarity with it.  The expectation that the productivity level will be the same, the quality will be the same, and the deadline can be the same under those conditions <del>rarely</del> never works out.</p>
<p>Developers love learning new things.  But not like that.</p></div>		</li>
