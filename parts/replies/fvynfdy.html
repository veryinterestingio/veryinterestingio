			<div class="markdown"><p>This gets to more of what OP was asking than most other answers.</p>
<p>It isn't so much how many light paths or how many frequencies of light that go over each path, but the idea of packets and addresses. We don't even need a transatlantic cable to see that. Your home WiFi is the same idea.</p>
<p>Think of your home internet. Cable, fiber, etc. You have one line coming in. Yet, you can have five people in your house watching five different things on YouTube, while you still get emails. How? </p>
<p>Each device has its own local address, and the data flows in chunks from the source to your house. Your WiFi router does, well, routing. It routes packets to the device that requested them. Even if they're all coming from YouTube, they have a destination, and the router sends them to the right device.</p>
<p>The transatlantic cables work that way, only on a far more massive scale. Packets arrive from everywhere, those going to the other continent get directed to the routers that handle the continental links, and scheduled for transmission. The number of fibers and number of frequencies of light per channel only determine how much information can be sent at once. At some point, saturation can occur, just like if you try to stream 100 different shows at once at home. Eventually nothing works if protection isn't put in place to limit and reject excess requests.</p>
<p>On the old days of dial-up, people would sometimes get two phone lines to connect at the same time to double the possible speeds. Same here with adding more fiber. Large companies still do this with multiple fiber links or a cable company line plus fiber, for prioritizing traffic and failure backup.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yep, and that's why it's called a router. Routers <em>route</em> the incoming packets from the internet (or other upstream network) to the device on the LAN that needs them.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of residential WiFi connections (it's not P2P), every access point also does its own routing to its connected clients, but those are called access points and not routers. But 99% of homes use a combo router/AP so that's just pedantry really.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Precisely.  Plus, most of those routers provide other services, like DHCP address provision services, even network file/print sharing and VPN access. They're basically small computers designed to perform many network functions. They're colloquially called WiFi routers, but they're certainly both router and access point, at a minimum. Many are also bundled with the cable modem and VoIP device as one unit.</p>
<p>Many commercial WiFi routers can be put into access point mode which disables the router functions and allows them to be used with another router. That way, both of them aren't creating their own networks and causing address conflicts or lack of access between devices on different access points.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically, none of that is routing. The only &quot;routing&quot; a home router does is send your packet to the internet 99% of the time. The connection between the access point and your phone/computer is entirely switched as it's within a single broadcast domain. </p>
<p>Your AP/switch send broadcasts asking for hardware addresses that map to IP addresses, builds a little address book, and sends packets to those hardware addresses. No need to route when everything can respond without congestion.</p>
<p>It &quot;routes&quot; your packets destined for other networks to those networks. This is very basic because 99% of networks just say &quot;everything you don't know about is out this link, no exceptions&quot;.</p>
<p>If we're being pedantic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, they just send a constant stream of them each way</p>
<p>Your ping is how long it takes each packet to travel between you and the server (and for the reply to come back). When you lag weirdly for a second, it’s sometimes high ping but more often “packet loss” which means a packet (or a few packets) didn’t make it to you in time, and so you didn’t get an update from the server and your client got confused</p>
<p>There are two main different types of protocol for sending packets: TCP, which sends confirmations for the packet arriving and allows the data to be re-sent if one goes missing, and UDP, which just throws the steam of packets at the other side and doesn’t confirm or re-send missing packets.</p>
<p>When downloading a file or webpage we use TCP because we want to make sure the file isn’t corrupted: we only care about the end result, so we’re happy to wait for any missing packets to be re-sent so that we can complete the file, and if it takes a moment longer to receive everything it’s no big deal</p>
<p>Phone calls, gaming, video and audio streaming tend to use UDP, because if a packet goes missing you don’t really want to wait for it to be re-sent - by the time the new packet arrives you’ve already showed the video frame or played that piece of the song etc, or the moment has passed in the game: so there’s no point getting the right packet, you aren’t going to play a video frame from a couple of seconds ago, it wouldn’t make sense. Instead you just corrupt the stream for a moment (for the affected frame or frames) or lag the game and then recover again ASAP. This is what’s happening when your game “rubberbands” or a video corrupts for a second, or the person on the other end of the phone call goes garbled for a second</p>
<p>Sometimes nowadays we use TCP even for streams, because connections are fast enough that we can buffer a few seconds ahead anyway - but for gaming in particular we just want things to be as fast as possible. (Edit: as noted by a commenter, we mostly use TCP for &quot;streaming&quot; of non-live content. Eg Netflix, Spotify. We tend to use UDP still for &quot;live&quot; streaming. Eg digital radio, phone calls, live sports. Although neither case is set in stone<strong>)</strong></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of streams are TCP now. I know you touched on that but quality of the stream is considered more important than dropping frames now. For real-time streams frames will get dropped but for on-demand streaming it's TCP.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I went to school for computer science, so i took a handful of comp engineering classes. When you are younger, computers and the internet all feel like magic.  After learning all the details, the truth seems more unbelievable.</p>
<p>Honestly, look up the journey a packet takes through the internet.  When you shoot at someone in a game, that packet has to be built and sent out through your local network routers. Then, up the chain of routers and possibly to your isp's backbone. It may even need to go up further to an internet back bone (e.g. across the ocean). All along this way, each router has to do some processing on the packet and it could even get stuck there for a little if it hits &quot;traffic&quot;. This is just to get to the server.  The server has to then calculate whether you hit the target, and send its own packet <em>all</em> the way back!</p>
<p>This all happens for every shot, yet it feels like that bullet hit the target <em>instantly</em>. All this happens while I'm ignoring the stupid amount of steps required to take that mouse click and turn it into a packet.  (Spoiler alert: &gt;!That's actually magic!&lt;).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Before the internet the answer was no. If you made a phone call, you were connected directly to the other person for the entirety of the call. Even when you are not talking you would have all of that line reserved for you. When people were making the internet they realized they could use packets to fit someone else's call while you were not talking. Now everything that is internet based is based on that idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. And even then, the T-carrier system used time-division multiplexing to share trunk lines among several active calls. A T1 can carry 24 64kbps data streams (DS0s) over a single physical circuit. Each channel takes turns sending its data 8 bits at a time.</p>
<p>There are more and more levels to this, but the concept is the same at each stage. </p>
<p>They got the whole &quot;stuffing lots of stuff simultaneously down a single pipe&quot; figured out a long long time ago. </p>
<p>But it was still a circuit-based network. When you're silent on the phone, your call still occupies a slice of time on each trunk between your location and the other party. When</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends, essentially.   </p>
<p>The dichotomy you're referring to is &quot;packet switched&quot; vs &quot;circuit switched&quot; networking.  </p>
<p>Phone is a hybrid. Starting as a circuit switched network, but now things like VoIP allow us to use packet switched networks to handle calls.  </p>
<p>Gaming is always packet-switched because the internet is really a group of technologies referred to as TCP/IP. Even though the TCP part let's us approximate circuit switched networks, it's not done to avoid latency as the other user described.</p></div>		</li>
