			<div class="markdown"><p>i only just found out that i had anxiety late 2018. i always thought that i was just being weird. any time i hear people laughing i get that feeling and my mind starts racing to try and remember if i did anything embarrassing that would make them laugh at me. at least now i know and can somewhat calm myself in those situations.</p></div>		</li>
