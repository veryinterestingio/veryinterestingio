			<div class="markdown"><p>Instinct is behavior that is ingrained in an organism. The organism is born knowing how to do whatever the instinct is, or with a drive to learn it. All flighted birds will try to learn to fly, spiders will spin webs appropriate to their species, mammals will walk, etc. </p>
<p>Intelligence is being able to learn new skills that aren't instinct. There are no instincts for humans to make tools, command fire, or build and operate machines. Learned behavior can also be taught. A single pride of lions in Africa has leaned to hunt elephants - and they teach their Cubs the skill. No other lions hunt elephants. All lions have the instinct to hunt. A cub in captivity will play hunt, stalking a toy, pouncing, etc, purely from instinct - but he has to learn to be an effective hunter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer is both are in the brain. But some parts of the brain come from a more 'primitive' part of evolution than others. The intelligence and learning parts of the brain are more recently evolved than the older, instinctual parts.</p></div>		</li>
