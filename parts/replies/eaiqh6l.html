			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure - but AFAICT it's only used for pronouns referring to actual humans. That's far different than every noun having a gender!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>hah, interesting.  i don't read/write chinese, i only speak it, so i didn't realize that!</p>
<p>a quick google search shows you're right, of course:</p>

<p>apparently it was a recent invention but it may go away again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only gendered pronouns (他她牠它祂, for males, females, animals, things, and gods respectively) though. Doesn’t make a difference grammatically. </p>
<p>Heck, not even the plural form has anything to do with grammar. It’s either understood from context, indicated by quantifiers, or by the tacked-on particle 們, working like the “-s” in English. Note, some traditional linguists have qualms with that in particular, as it’s considered a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westernised_Chinese_language" target="_blank">foreign influence on the language</a>, rendering Chinese cumbersome and inelegant. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i'm not totally sure what you mean, but the idea is that there is only one third person singular pronoun.  meaning that in chinese, we say &quot;he/she&quot; with a single word all the time, basically.</p>
<p>for instance, if a cop is asking someone &quot;what did the perpetrator look like?&quot;</p>
<p>the person would probably say &quot;he/she was a man who is tall and muscular.&quot; in order to specify if it's a man or a woman.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A quick google tells me that there are 14 vowel sounds in English too, not counting local dialects.</p>
<p>What's good in Hungarian is that everything is written as it is pronounced. The vowel sounds are very similar to English vowels and  once you learn them it makes it super easy to pronounce written words.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would never English is an easy language either.  After a significant amount of coaching from the locals we barely got to anything but egan that was consistently understood in the local tongue.  Mostly I jest of course, we had a really good time in Hungary I just leveraged the local language speakers as needed.</p></div>		</li>
