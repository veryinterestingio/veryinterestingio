			<div class="markdown"><p>A radio wave is information. An x-ray is information. Energy takes so many different forms (like energy that is in another dimension or crazy shit we dont know about yet) that to just say &quot;all energy and matter&quot; would maybe be leaving some things out.
For extra credit, there have been x-rays observed jetting out of (not actually out of but near) black holes but maybe because of the velocities of stars at the event horizon that are being spun up. Its interesting stuff. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p><del>What you're referring to is Hawking radiation.</del>
Hawking radiation is different, this person is talking about the xrays from accretion disks, which is the glowing matter that can be seen orbiting a black hole. I'll leave my explanation of hawking radiation here anyway though, in case someone wants it.</p>
<p>This is far from ELI5, but to try to explain it (somewhat) simply, sometimes matter appears out of nowhere, but to balance it out antimatter has to be formed as well. Because this happens so close together, the antimatter and matter particles almost always immediately annihilate, or combine together to create nothing. However, if this happens right next to a black hole, what can happen is one particle gets sucked in whole the other escapes. If the antimatter falls into the black hole, it will annihilate with a particle in the black hole and the mass of the black hole will decrease, and the matter particle escapes away, making it seem like the particle escaped from the black hole. I'm not at all an expert in physics and definitely quantum physics, so this explanation is probably somewhat inaccurate, but its roughly what happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats pretty rude. This is eli5 not r/science. Maybe climb off that horse of yours and explain what is wrong with my incredibly simplified version. Or you could just not be a downer.</p></div>		</li>
