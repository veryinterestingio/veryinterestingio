			<div class="markdown"><p>I learned I’m very slightly allergic to some fabric softeners and the contact with my pillow caused this.<br />
Actually just slept over someone else’s house and my left eye is all puffy as I sleep on my left side.<br />
This may or may not be your cause as well. If it never happens normally I would rule it out, but I’ve gotten it dialed into the Downy Unstoppables and some from the factory brands. So I just wash them with my own and don’t have any problems unless I’m careless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's called a sty. Just inflammation of the eyelid. Basically you have tiny  pores that drain oils from your skin. If one of those pores gets blocked, your eyelid will puff up a bit. It'll feel bruised and puffy for a while, but it's pretty much harmless. You can try using warm water and a cloth to cover it. The warm water can help open up your pores maybe allowing it to help drain the oils that are clogged up.</p></div>		</li>
