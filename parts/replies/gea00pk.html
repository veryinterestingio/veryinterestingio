			<div class="markdown"><p>are these Post-translational modifications preserved in offsprings- eg a protein with a typical fold required for certain functions? if so and if the specific fold is not influenced by any gene then how is the fold information passed on?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally speaking, yes the PTMs are passed on.  However, there are some PTMs that come about sporadically/aberrantly that can lead to disease pathology.  One of the proteins involved in Alzheimer's disease, called A-beta, gets processed differently and that leads the protein to refold into an amyloid fibril, which leads to the pathology of the disease.  Hope this helps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ok, but the PTMs that happen sporadically/aberrantly are examples of the exception right? as otherwise this would have caused the pathology in a high proportion of people? if so my question still is how the correct/health PTM information passed on?</p></div>		</li>
