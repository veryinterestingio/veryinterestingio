			<div class="markdown"><p>Yell that to walmart. It's been said if the rumor of a union starts in a store it basically gets cleaned out of all hourly employees and a new force is trained to replace them. They don't care if they have to close for a week or two</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting take. I assume that’s a big part of why unions have been dwindling. Labor as a whole has been trending away from skill, towards systematization. If skilled labor becomes unnecessary to a majority of the business operations, what good is the union?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While the skilled labor aspect is true, unions also tend to be more successful in industries where the companies have a significant capital equipment investment. This is because the potential losses from non-productive equipment outweigh the union wage demands. </p>
<p>For example, if an airplane pilots union were to strike, it would take a long time to replace those pilots and the company would have to pay all the interest or lease payments on their airplanes while that happened. Even if the pilots pay increase caused the airline to lose money, as long as that loss would be less than the cost of the monthly equipment costs, it would make sense to pay the pilots more rather than risk a strike. </p>
<p>As an example of the opposite, if a union of pizza delivery drivers threatened to strike for more pay, the company could be replace them since it's not skilled work and since drivers usually supply their own car, no lost money on unused capital.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked at Walmart years ago and they always told us if someone comes in talking about a union we are NOT allowed to talk to them and to tell a manager so they can get them to leave. I never had anyone approach me about one, but I always wished I did</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd love to see the rationale behind trying to kick someone like that off the property in the states, especially a 1 party consent state and the entire thing is being recorded outside.</p>
<p>Ask a guy about unions, 5 minutes later some 50+ year old balding man who looks like he drinks the deli gravy for lunch every day comes out to tell you to leave. If the only thing on the video is perfectly acceptable social behavior and well within your rights what can walmart really do?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unions also provide protections. You get reps who’s entire job is to negotiate better wages and benefits. Plus, they have lawyers so if your boss tries to pull something they risk facing an actual legal team.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unions are undoubtedly good but there is one issue that comes up which is that an incompetent worker is protected. Usually that's not a big deal and is just a minor efficiency hit to the company but it can be a problem if you have a bad teacher with tenure or something. It's not a problem for most companies but I do think it's worth mentioning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The flipside is that without a union, incompetent management is protected.</p>
<p>My very first business class in college was taught by a long-time VP of DuPont.</p>
<p>His very first lesson was about unions.  I'll never forget it.</p>
<p>&quot;Unions are a direct result of mismanagement.  Their formation represents a failure state of your company leadership.&quot;  He then spent the rest of the lecture spelling it out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>while not intelligent enough to explain anything as well as has been discussed thus far; I am a 28 yr UPS / TEAMSTER and would suggest anyone that has negative views of unions take a look @ UPS which other than the gov'tis the largest unionized workforce in the nation. From personal experience I can tell you there's good and bad in &quot;everything&quot;. Through the union our wages, PENSION, and  healthcare  are all negotiated for us. Health insurance cost nothing for members; and dues are1.5X our hourly wage per month.....roughly 1k a yr. UPS is union because its what the founder (Jim Casey) and his family believe in. I've seen nothing in writing but have heard it will always be that way as per his wishes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a manager of (non tenured) union employees, if an incompetent worker is still around forever, its because the management isn't that competent either. Progressive discipline has steps that have to be followed, with all attempts to retrain and improve performance having to be well documented. The process is a massive pain in the ass, but when you have a mile long paper trail, with no improvement, eventually HR will cut them loose, but things rarely have to go that far.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is horse shit.  Incompetent workers can be fired with a union, the problem is incompetent management.  I’m a union rep.  I had a friend of my GF complain about her poor performing union employee.  I walked her through how to discipline the employee and if performance didn’t improve, terminate the employee. Fast forward a few years, the GF and I broke up and I took a different job where I end up representing that very same poor performing employee. The ex’s friend  screws up the disciplinary process and I’m telling her, “I know you know how to do this!”</p>
<p>The “unions only protect bad workers” trope is on that is perpetuated by anti-union managers but created when people see someone get off of a disciplinary action based on the union’s involvement. The defense we usually use is unequal treatment.  This defense is only an option when the manager has played favorites and either not enforced the rules fairly or let other employees off for violating the same rule.</p>
<p>Believe me, I don’t want to represent shitty workers, I want the most productive and efficient workforce possible. It makes contract negotiations a lot easier!</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's so true. We all know stories of that one incompetent employee who was saved by their union, it sure is one of those 'memorable/distasteful exceptions'. They should have been fired the right way, not through workplace politics, but that's the point.</p></div>		</li>
