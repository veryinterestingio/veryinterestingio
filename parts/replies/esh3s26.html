			<div class="markdown"><p>Dragonfly uses optical navigation to track its position. Camera images are processed through specialized algorithms that allow the lander to recognize images taken on a previous flight or earlier during the current flight much the way a pilot might navigate flying on Earth. In fact, only these camera images are used and no map is generated, which is important because this greatly reduces the amount of data that must be downlinked. All flights are autonomous so Dragonfly must do this on its own. In fact, there aren’t any maps of the Titan surface, at least nothing like exists for Mars. Titan’s thick atmosphere makes orbital imagery impossible so Dragonfly will be forging its own path. The very first landing will be autonomously selected using flash lidar. Subsequent landing sites will be scouted and selected by the science and engineering teams before landing.  - Doug Adams, Spacecraft Systems Engineer at JHUAPL</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the Dragonfly power source is a Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG), the same kind used on the Curiosity rover.  It's enclosed in an insulated shroud (the cylinder at the rear of the lander) to protect it from the 94 K (-179 C, -290 F) atmosphere and to allow the lander to harvest the waste heat while on the surface of Titan.  During interplanetary cruise t's cooled using an active thermal loop, similar to how the Mars rovers are cooled during cruise.  No modifications to the MMRTG itself are required. There's some more information about MMRTGs at NASA's Radioisotope Power System (RPS) website: <a href="https://rps.nasa.gov/" target="_blank"><a href="https://rps.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">https://rps.nasa.gov/</a></a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dragonfly uses direct-to-Earth (DTE) communications with transmissions from the lander beamed directly to NASA’s Deep Space Network (DSN).  Were there an orbital asset in place then Dragonfly could communicate through it, but none are planned at this time so DTE is used for all uplink and downlink communications. - Doug Adams, Spacecraft Systems Engineer, JHUAPL</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>is there a way for Dragonfly to communicate absolute location so that a set of &quot;bread-crumbs&quot; are kept for future missions and flights?  </p>
<p>also, can you share the algorithms used?  that sort of visual navigation is ... not easy!</p></div>		</li>
