<p>There are also (at a much smaller scale) proof of concept installations that use giant weights in places like unused mining shafts for energy storage. Excess energy lifts the weight up and when energy is needed the weight will descend.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Expense. The amount of energy stored and released versus the cost of the batteries to store it doesnt really make sense.</p>
<p>Think of it on a small scale.</p>
<p>My energy company charges me $0.10/kwh for power.</p>
<p>A lead acid battery (cheapest available storage cost) which might last 3 years can store 1kwh for about $100 each and maybe has 1000 recharge cycles on average.</p>
<p>So in 3 years of you used it perfectly to 0% and recharged with excess energy to 100% every day you basically saved enough energy to break even but that isnt even the full story.</p>
<p>Typically in Deep cycle you only use 60-70% of the batteries total capacity to keep it healthy.</p>
<p>1in industrial settings the cost is worth it because they keep batteries going in the event of a power loss to give them time to start their own generators.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with a classic chemical battery is that all the parts are in the same place; for a petrol engine for example, you can have one engine, and just get a larger fuel tank if you want to go further.</p>
<p>For a lithium battery, the fuel tank and the engine are the same thing, you can't scale up an individual cell to store more power by connecting it up to some fuel tank, you just have to build another cell next to it, that does all the charging, discharging and storage together.</p>
<p>Most big long term storage systems work differently, they have something that connects to the electrical system, a pump/turbine system in the case of using water height for storage, and the energy store itself, the water kept in a reservoir up the mountain.</p>
<p>Storage systems that work this way tend to have much higher capacities for energy storage relative to the power they supply each second, because they have to get all that water through a smaller turbine, but they are also much easier to expand; all you need to do is enlarge the &quot;fuel tank&quot;, and they will store more energy.</p>
<p>There are a lot of different energy systems that care about how long you can store energy, rather than caring about providing a lot of power in a short amount of time. Batteries and other similar chemical things like &quot;supercapacitors&quot; will probably always beat them for cancelling out very short term cycles in power, because you need fast response at high power, and care less about amounts of energy stored because you'll be charging again very soon anyway.</p>
<p>For slower stuff, you'll probably see lots of battery techs developing that involve some machine connected to the grid, and some large reservoir or slow/static system that they work on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While a typical modern power station will produce multiple gigawatts of energy. Storage solution you mention is 30 megawatt, and the larger one is 100 MW. While South Australia peak demand is reported to be around 3000MW. Cute little battery you have there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A very large peaker will only produce a couple hundred megawatts, and quite often  they produce less than 100. So a 100 megawatt storage facility is right on par for a peaking source. They run for a couple hours out of the day at most. </p>
<p>Anything producing gigawatts is a baseload plant that bascily never shuts off and may not even throttle it's output much.</p></div>		</li>
