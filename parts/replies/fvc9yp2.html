			<div class="markdown"><p>Petrology grad student here, fantastic answer as usual, I agree on all points!</p>
<p>The only remotely gemstone-like minerals that you might find on the surface of the moon would be olivine (peridot) and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=labradorite&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enCA871CA871&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk036md85dUi6ndWWueFNpFMJYtFlhg:1592584487888&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwioh7PFp47qAhU6lnIEHTuQDc8Q_AUoAXoECBkQAw&amp;biw=1536&amp;bih=754" target="_blank">labradorite</a> (a variety of plagioclase feldspar). <a href="https://www.virtualmicroscope.org/content/76535-51-troctolite" target="_blank">Sample 76535</a>, brought back by Apollo 17, is a troctolite that contains large crystals of both olivine and plagioclase. Some of these olivines are probably hypothetically facetable into gemstones.</p>
<p>I'm less sure about the plagioclase. To have that particular labradorite look, you need very fine sheets (exsolution layers) to be present in the crystal. That rock in particular has been repeatedly annealed and reequilibrated by several cycles of being reheated, so doesn't show labradoresence as far as I can tell. I think that it's possible that labradorescent feldspars are on the surface of the moon, but I haven't seen an example of one yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a great question! </p>
<p>I don't think there are any crazy new minerals on the moon that don't exist on Earth. Chemistry is the same everywhere, so under similar temperature/pressure conditions, and with a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4128265/#:~:text=Previous%20estimates%20of%20the%20Moon,to%20the%20bulk%20Moon%20abundance." target="_blank">fairly similar bulk composition to the Earth</a>, you should get more or less familiar minerals.</p>
<p>Many of the really large (like &gt;5 cm) crystals on Earth are formed either through hydrothermal deposition at fairly shallow depths, or in pegmatites. There almost certainly isn't any shallow hydrothermal activity on the moon, and the mechanisms that generate pegmatites don't really exist there either. So I do think that the Moon just doesn't have the same environments that generate large crystals on Earth.</p>
<p>All of this comes with the asterisk that I don't study the moon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the processes that form gems on earth are not present on the moon, could there be gems left from the origin of the moon's material makeup? The prevailing theory as I understand it is that the moon formed from a collision with the earth. Could there be gems formed on earth and launched into space to coalesce into the moon?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Considering the impact hypothesis, a large portion of the material that accreted to form the moon was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_magma_ocean" target="_blank">molten</a>, thus at least at the surface there is no material that is preserved 'solid bits of Earth', for lack of a better term.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A more current origin theory of the Earth/Moon system holds that both condensed from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synestia" target="_blank">synestia</a> formed by a major impact. In other words, both bodies were completely vaporized and no solid parts would survive. This theory explains the puzzle of why the Earth and Moon are so similar in composition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The moon is made up of portions of the primitive crust and mantle, although some theorize that the moon is only made up of bulk silicate earth material, i.e. material formed prior to differentiation of the crust. However, the material was made molten by the impact so any &quot;gemstones&quot; would have broken down in the melt.</p></div>		</li>
