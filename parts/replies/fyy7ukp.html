			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmmm, I guess I've been doing it wrong then, because I've never liked their fries. Maybe I'll have to give them a shot &quot;well done&quot;. Though honestly, I shouldn't have to ask them to actually cook my fries just to have them be edible IMO. All those people clamoring for medium rare fries can order theirs to the soggy uncooked degree they wish, but standard should be crispy like literally everyone else cooks them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll give a huge +1 for the well done fries. They have to make a fresh batch so it takes a few more minutes, but it's a world of a difference. Are they mind blowing? No of course not, but they're definitely much better than their regular shit fries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's definitely worth a try! It finally made me enjoy them, especially animal style, well done. I think they undercook them a little on purpose so they can emphasize the &quot;never frozen, fresh potatoes&quot; mantra.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In part b/c they cook them raw. They slice &amp; fry them fresh. A better fry would be parboiled, then fried (so you could have a well-cooked on the inside &amp; crispy on the outside).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No the best fries are fried twice. First at 120° until they're golden and shiny, then you let them cool down and after you fry them again at 180° until golden brown and crispy outside.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In N Out prides themselves on 'always fresh, never frozen'. That's unfortunately not the best approach to fries.</p>
<p>Fresh potatoes do not make great fries. If you just dice a potato and toss it in a fryer, you end up with In N Out's fries. While arguably 'fresh' like that, a great fry like McDonalds' (yes, McDonalds' does have relatively 'great' fries) is created by boiling potatoes in vinegar, frying them once, storing them and then frying them again. This is kind of standard practice where I am from -- the Netherlands -- where fries are kind of a staple of our diet. Any frozen fry is simply already cooked, fried, then frozen. </p>
<p>S<a href="https://aht.seriouseats.com/archives/2010/05/the-burger-lab-how-to-make-perfect-mcdonalds-style-french-fries.html" target="_blank">erious Eats' amazing Kenji Lopez-Alt has a big breakdown on the science involved</a> (pectin! temperatures! a scavenger hunt to obtain frozen McDonalds French fries to study them!) if you are into that sort of thing (you should be) and if you want to make them yourself (it's easy and you should). Note that this will ruin approximately 85% of all fries for you, forever. For even better results, try frying in animal fat; cold fries are really good if fried in animal fat for some yet unstudied reason. Duck fat, tallow (beef fat), it all works. Super good.</p></div>		</li>
