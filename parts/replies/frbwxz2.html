			<div class="markdown"><p>There's some genetics involved. In each population, there is some distribution of blood types. A child won't necessarily have the same blood type as either parent, even if both parents have the same blood type because of dominant/recessive genes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My parents both have positive blood types and I'm O negative. Since it's clear from physical appearance that my dad is obviously my dad, I always thought there was a mistake on the part of my doctor's office. It always bugged me and made me want to get another blood test because for some reason it escaped my realization that we each have two alleles for rh-factor. For some reason I didn't put it together even though I have a basic understanding of how genetics work. </p>
<p>Tldr: Thanks for explaining away 12 years of confusion!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's unlikely that everyone in one group of people will have the same blood type unless that group has been isolated and interbreeding for a very long time. You might see a specific blood type be more prevalent but almost certainly wouldn't be identical for everyone.</p>
<p>EDIT: with regards to &quot;random from mother to child&quot; no, blood type is controlled by genes and is not sex-linked (ie. is not on the x/y chromosome) which means that it will usually (genetics gets weird once you start looking at corner cases) depend on which genes your mother and father have. If you'd like to get into surface level genetics let me know and I can go over it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, sometimes blood types make a person more or less susceptible to certain diseases. For a recent example, there is some evidence that having type A blood results in worse outcomes for COVID-19. It is hypothesized that this kind of effect is the cause of the different prevalences of blood types in different populations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Piggybacking on this answer:  blood type is defined, at least partly by the ABO molecules showing on your red blood cells.  Certain diseases such as malaria, one of the worlds most popular diseases, relies on infecting red blood cells as part of its 'life cycle'.  Different blood groups have different propensities/resistance to malaria, and there has been a kind of 'genetic arms race' between parasites and us.</p></div>		</li>
