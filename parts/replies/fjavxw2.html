			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this great answer:</p>
<p>Moving a magnet or even a piece of metal around a wire, or a coil of wire, will either induce a current in it, or change a current already flowing through it. This is how some stoplights know your car is there - you're sitting on a loop of wire cut into the pavement, and when you drive over it, the metal in your car causes a change in the current in the wire, triggering the light to change. </p>
<p>Also, the effect where the generator/alternator needs more power to turn when extra electrical load is put on it, works the other way. An electric motor that is spinning freely without a load doesn't draw as much current as one that is being loaded or even stalled out. When the rotor/armature is stalled out, that's the most torque the motor can put out, and it's the most current it will draw. As the rotor speed increases, the current needed to spin it decreases. </p>
<p>Lastly, just for fun - the alternator in your car needs your car's battery to generate electricity. It needs a few amps to excite the windings - basically, turn them from a coil of wire to a spinning electromagnet. Without that, it won't make any juice. The power plant supplying your house, assuming it isn't a solar plant, (Not sure about wind turbines either) needs power from the grid before it will generate electricity - because the &quot;generators&quot; are just scaled up versions of the alternator in your car.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Utility Wind and Solar need no other power source to generate assuming they are set up to power their own control systems via battery backup. If they don't have batteries, they have no controls, and won't start from a black condition. Thermal power plants need an external power source, either the grid, diesel generators, or in extremely rare cases another power plant, to &quot;black start&quot;. This is primarily due to the large parasitic loads needed to start motive fluid pumps and to warm the system up. In all those cases, you need battery backup for the controls to even start the black starts. Buying in grid power is usually an option, but most independent power producers avoid it due to the high costs associated with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Balancing authority here, my job is to balance our generation, load, and interchange (among other various duties). Your utility is constantly buying and selling power and it all has to do with who can produce it cheapest per MW. Last week a storm blowing through up north have us problems purchasing power from Canada to kentucky. </p>
<p>As for our black start units, we use mostly hydro since we don't utilize much solar or wind.  They can put out about 10 MW, which can start our natural gas units(some of these CT's can start themselves with a diesel generator) and put out about 100MW. From there some of our bigger coal units need around 40-80 MW in auxiliary power to start. Once they are running, they power themselves and have a minimal level they have to be loaded at to stay online before they stall or &quot;flame out&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would like to tack onto this that most hydro generators also do not need an external power source because, like wind turbines, they are using the fluid to spin the rotor.</p>
<p>Edit: unless it’s pumped storage, then you have to expend the energy to pump water uphill.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My engine idle at about 32% of it's full load capacity at 650RPM. Turning on the rear defroster bring this to about 36% load!</p>
<p>The rear defroster is a big load, 10-20A, which represent roughtly 120 to 240W of power. 1HP is 746W. But a car alternator is not that efficient. I couln't find any good sources, but 50-65% is what I keep seeing. Let's go with 65% and 170W. That is 170W/65% = 262W, divided by 746 = 0.35HP. It don't look like it is alot, but 1/3hp is still quite alot of power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You pretty much nailed the math so I'll come at it from an automotive electrician side.</p>
<p>A factory car has a 100 amp alternator(for example). It only makes that power at high RPM. At low RPM it makes a fraction of that power. That power has to be shared between climate control, lights, engine needs, radio, and other accessories. If the needs exceed the 50 amps(approximately) that the alternator can do at idle speeds, then it dips into the battery for power. That's when your lights dim for a second unexpectedly or your idle jumps up. The car is trying to sustain a new load that it didn't have before and technically can't support long term.</p>
<p>There are ways to fix this problem permanently but they require skill and/or money. As long as you get a new car battery every 5ish years you should be okay and will never have a worry. Even if your idle changes when you push buttons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know Ford has computer controlled alternators, too, that can vary the output at any RPM as well, so adding a bunch of load at once will cause a drop in voltage across the whole system and the computer will have to add some throttle and increase the alternator output and that takes a second or two.</p>
<p>I’m sure other OEMs do as well, Ford is just the only one I have fiddled with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Little known side fact, somewhat related (in general, not directed at you, u/lipdorne, I'm sure you know this ;)) — today, most diesel locomotives move by electric power. Because often people shorten the full name, <em>diesel electric locomotive</em> with &quot;diesel locomotive.&quot; What you see on top is the diesel engine. It turns a generator/alternator, among other things, that produces electricity to drive electric motors down in the trucks (the groups of wheels on the track). <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:DieselElectricLocomotiveSchematic.svg" target="_blank">Here's</a>  a helpful schematic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Diesel locomotives move by diesel engine connected to a mechanical transmission connected to the trucks. </p>
<p>Diesel-electric locomotives (far more common) use the alternator or generator combined with electric motors as you described.</p>
<p>At this moment, the (full size) train closest to me is a steam locomotive, and the next nearest is a diesel passenger train... each car having a cummins motor hooked up to a voith transmission to the wheels. Such a weird idea!</p></div>		</li>

CN M-420 3502 was hoisted off the rails by crane and rolled along a street in Boucherville QC in order to provide power in the community.
