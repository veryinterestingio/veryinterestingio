			<div class="markdown"><p>No. CENTIMETERS. No one ever put in the work to measure babies daily until Dr. Michelle Lampl, a professor at the Emory Center for the Study of Human Health, decided to measure 30 babies daily driving from home to home.  </p>
<p>&quot;Dr. Lampl measured thirty babies daily and found that babies grew between 0.5 and 1.65cm in one day, between two to twenty-eight days of no growth. These growth spurts changed their sleeping patterns, inciting tantrums as well as insatiable hunger. &quot; <a href="http://sites.nd.edu/emily-clarke/2019/12/06/chapter-8/" target="_blank">http://sites.nd.edu/emily-clarke/2019/12/06/chapter-8/</a></p>
