			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this a liquid Thorium reactor (LFTR), if not how does this compare? When I was asking questions on a different thread about them, it was explained (at least I thought, for liquid) that Th233 turned into Pa233, which would need to be held in a separate area as to not solidify the liquid Th233, and would be used as fuel once turned from Pa233 to U233.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Liquid fluoride thorium reactors (LFTR) are one subtype, out of about a dozen broad types of thorium reactors, that have either been tested or seriously proposed over the years.  </p>
<p>Most types are not liquid fuel systems, but all use U-233 as their predominate fissile material.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a long time between the machinery working at a small scale in labs and it being ready to power a country. It's still in development. Also, politically, people get scared by the word 'nuclear', which means that countries are less willing to invest the money to get the research done. Once some large country decides to put enough money in and build it, it will happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading about thorium in college and the main reason that was put forward as to why it hasn't been implemented sooner was that the backing from the govt. was looking for a way to weaponize it. One of the scientists on the Manhattan project was let go because he kept trying to get them to use thorium instead (not as a bomb, as a reactor). Not sure how accurate any of that is, it's been well over a decade sense I heard it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the designs use a molten salt as the coolant.  Molten salt designs are difficult to maintain.  For example, the Soviet Union experimented with two different molten salt reactor designs in its submarine fleet.  </p>
<p>The reactors from the first design they tried lasted about three years.  Reactors from the second design lasted about ten.  The short lifespan on both designs was due to the fact that the reactors were essentially unmaintainable, and the Soviet Union abandoned work on them despite the fact that they substantially outperformed conventional water reactors.</p>
<p>Other than non-proliferation, most of the benefits of a thorium reactor are the result of the molten salt cooling system rather than the thorium itself.  You can use uranium in a molten salt design and there isn't much of a reason not to if you've committed to dealing with the molten salt maintenance issues.  The reverse is also true - if you're using water as your coolant then thorium really doesn't offer you any benefit.  </p>
<p>India is developing a water cooled thorium reactor right now, but the only reason they're doing that is because its expensive for them to import uranium but they can produce thorium domestically.  Other than their ability to produce thorium domestically, the design has no benefit over using uranium.</p>
<p>And the molten salt maintenance issues are severe enough that everyone who has tried a molten salt design so far has given up on it and there's no reason to believe that they'll be solvable in the near term - if they ever are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that it's Uranium ore. Not refined and not nearly as dangerous. If you were to eat it or play with it you would suffer more harm from the chemicals used to mine it and heavy metal poisoning. Not radiation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's just a rock. Naturally occurring uranium is hardly radioactive at all and isn't really any worse for you than any other metal-bearing ore. That's the fundamental reason why there has to be this long production chain for nuclear fuel. The uranium pulled out of the ground is almost completely inert and is totally unsuitable for any nuclear reactions. It has to be extensively processed and refined before it can be used as fuel, similar to how crude oil can be pumped out of the ground but if you poured it straight into your car's gas tank nothing useful would happen.</p></div>		</li>
