			<div class="markdown"><p>There doesn’t seem to be a myostatin inhibitor drug that truly works well in humans, at this point. Once one is developed, it would cause large amounts of muscle gain over time, so an overweight person would gain <strong>lots</strong> of muscle. This would also help with fat loss.</p></div>		</li>
