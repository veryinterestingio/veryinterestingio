			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's say you're doing an 8W (60W equivalent) LED every 10 feet, and only a row near the windows. Using some Google values for city block size, let's say one block is about 400x600 ft. That yields a permiter of 2000 ft, needing 200 bulbs. 200x8W=1600W per floor. Let's say a normal workday is 12 hours (mixed shifts), 5 days a week, so we won't count that as the lights would be on anyway. So over a normal year, that still leaves 5400 hours those lights are on just for effect, coming to about 8,640 kWh. Electricity is fairly cheap where I am at about 12 cents per kWh, so the total would be just over $1000/yr per floor to light up one city block purely for effect. Not a horrible amount, but multiied over many floors in a block, and many blocks in a city, the cost is going to add up pretty fast.</p>
<p>And that's ignoring the fact you'll be replacing bulbs three times as often (which costs labor, not just bulbs), so the realistic cost is going to be higher still.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is making a number of assumptions. You can tweak the spacing if the bulbs, or using fewer but larger and more efficient fixtures. But at the end of the day, it's using a lot of power if you want to light up the entire skyline.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But here's the crunch. A lot of office buildings in western cities were built over 30 years ago, when motion sensor lighting wasn't common place, and they're usually owned by management companies that don't want/can't afford to put in the up front capital to upgrade them, even knowing that it will save money in the long run.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You got a source for that? When we lease commercial spaces, we can change virtually anything...we recently fully renovated a warehouse space to add offices and a lunch room, and poured a pad and installed 4 massive silos out the side.  Swapping out switches and/or fixtures for presence-sensing ones is trivial. A commercial lease isn't like you renting an apartment at all. </p>
<p>Take a look at <a href="https://officesnapshots.com/2016/06/28/penguin-random-house-offices-toronto/" target="_blank">what Random House did with their leased Toronto office space</a>. I am <em>pretty</em> sure they could have installed motion sensors too.</p></div>		</li>
