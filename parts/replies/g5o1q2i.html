<p>Memories are patterns of firing neurons. Chemicals are it's method of transmission.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's make an analogy, you say, reasonably enough, that a voice is nothing more than moving air.  In the same way, a memory is a pattern of neural connections being activated.  Saying a memory is nothing more than a chemical in the brain would then be like saying the voice is no more than moving lips....it's wrong, because the voice <em>isn't</em> moving lips, it's the moving air.  The lips are just a part of what gets the air moving.  Similarly, the chemicals of neurotransmitters are just a part of what causes the actual memory itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes I agree, I was being sarcastic sorry.</p>
<p>A memory is not just a chemical. My analogies, like a voice is not just moving air, was meant to highlight this. A voice requires intelligence, language, culture, a living being, presumably listeners with ears which can receive the vibrations, etc etc</p>
<p>To say it is &quot;just moving air&quot; is a vast simplification and doesn't give us much information to what is actually happening.</p></div>		</li>
