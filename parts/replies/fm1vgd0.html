			<div class="markdown"><p>Any tips to learn how to speak a language? I moved to the US 10 years ago and I have a difficult time speaking English. I finished high school and about to graduate from university this semester here in the US. Everything I watch is in English, everyone around me speaks English and I write in English but when it comes to speaking the language I have a difficult time and a strong accent. My native language is Spanish, when I read things in spanish sometimes I have to translate to English because I dont understand it. I really don't understand why I just cant speak English.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not that guy, but from my experience with pronunciation:</p>
<p>It's difficult to hear a sound you can't make, and it's difficult to know you should make a sound you can't hear.</p>
<p>To solve this, pick out a particular syllable you know you struggle with and a word that contains it.</p>
<p>First, look up the IPA for that word, find the syllable in question, and learn the technical details of the syllable.  There are diagrams for mouth shape and tongue position that can be very helpful.</p>
<p>Then, listen to someone say that word and say it yourself with as many slight changes in your pronunciation as possible (even ways you know are not necessarily correct). The intent is to create sounds you're unfamiliar with, and as you broaden the sounds you can make, you'll start being able to hear which ones are closer to correct.</p>
<p>Lastly, look for sounds that are very similar and understand what distinguishes them.</p>
<p>I know that the English 'v' is difficult for many native Spanish speakers and that they tend to pronounce it as an English 'b'.  For example, &quot;van&quot; would become &quot;ban.&quot;  However, Spanish speakers have no trouble at all making the 'f' sound, and a 'v' is simply a voiced 'f'.</p>
<ol>
<li>Say &quot;fan&quot;</li>
<li>Say &quot;ffffffffffffffffffffffffffan&quot;</li>
<li>repeat step 2, but hum during the &quot;fffffffffffffffff&quot;</li>
<li>Now referring to a humming 'f' as 'v', say &quot;van.&quot;</li>
</ol></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speak a lot of English. Put yourself in situations where you speak a lot. Go to groups to practice English. Just keep speaking and speaking and speaking. You'll get better. You may not lose your accent easily, but I promise you you'll be able to learn to speak more fluently, and be more confident too. And I know that your accent can work against you in certain situations, but, embrace your accent - it's you; there's no one right way to speak this language.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Full immersion is the biggest step, and you're already there.  Good job!</p>
<p>Now it's just a matter of practice.  It sounds like you've achieved passive fluency, which is good.  Active fluency is just a little harder.</p>
<p>You're clearly doing a great job of writing in English, but writing is always a little easier, because we have time to think.</p>
<p>You'll need to practice speaking a lot.  I personally wouldn't worry about the accent, unless you're really focused on pronunciation and like not having a Spanish accent.</p>
<p>You just need to get a few sympathetic friends who'll help you practice aloud.  Hang out with them, and encourage them to correct your word choices and pronunciation.  During the pandemic, this will mostly have to mean voice chat and video chat.</p>
<p>I find the best way to encourage friends to gently correct you is to be careful how you react when they do so.  Let them hear that you're genuinely appreciative when they correct you in a nice way that you find helpful.</p>
<p>You've got this!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Getting the degree was amazingly fun!</p>
<p>You learn lots of languages in the process, and gain passing familiarity with even more in your core curriculum classes.</p>
<p>I did two semesters of fieldwork in my senior year for a capstone, and I freaking loved it.  We took elicitation from a native speaker* of Susu, a language of wide communication in the Mande family.</p>
<p>While I went on to become a programmer rather than a linguist, learning languages and developing the mental flexibility to work in very different modes of syntax made me a better programmer.  Working with my informant and my classmates made me a better learner, and gave me a good start on taking down information from people in an ordered way to seek answers to existing questions and uncover new questions as we go.</p>
<p>Probably my favorite project in the whole major was my Tolkien linguistics final project.  I was learning Middle Egyptian as one of my lesser-known languages, and my professor in the Tolkien class had taken lessons from my Egyptology professor.</p>
<p>My final project was an ambitious translation of Namárië into Middle Egyptian hieroglyphs.</p>
<p>I had to work with my Egyptian professor to translate into German (which I did not speak), and from there into appropriate hieroglyphs from his German hieroglyphic dictionary.  It was seriously fun, and it turned out to work amazingly well.  The metaphor of &quot;Going Into the West&quot; already existed as a euphemism for death in Middle Egyptian.  I handed in a page of handwritten hieroglyphs and the Manuel de Codage transliterations, and my professor loved it!</p>
<p>If that kind of stuff sounds amazingly fun to you, then linguistics is probably where you belong!</p>
<ul>
<li>There are technically no &quot;native speakers&quot; of Susu, because it's a wide communication language, not a home language, but our speaker grew up learning it to fluency from grade school on.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the right answer. There are two very distinct areas of the brain that create this phenomenon. If anyone has doubts please look up Broca’s Area, the part of the brain responsible for speech production, and Wernicke’s Area, the part of the brain responsible for speech comprehension.</p>
<p>The other answers are great anecdotes and provide a good means to understanding the phenomenon and the experience of it, but this is the first answer that actually gets to WHY.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of people misunderstanding the question that it's about learning a new language. I don't think a lot of people are familiar with the phenomenon where you can understand a language fluently but can't speak it fluently or (in my case during child hood) at all. It's quite common though amongst immigrant children in America. Especially if you grew up in the 70s or 80s when bilingual learning in kids was actively discouraged</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This answer is completely pseudoscience, though. Critical period hypothesis for language learning is only central to learning a first language in that period; there is considerable contention about whether that critical period extends to L2s in the linguistics community.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn't make it pseudoscience. It's a scientific hypothesis with many supporters and many detractors. I happen to believe it, with some caveats. I think it's clear that children have a special ability to naturally learn accent that adults don't have, for example. Is that difference in aptitude explainable by a well-defined critical period? Maybe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually the pseudoscience answer, the common knowledge myth that gets passed around (which is why it feels &quot;real&quot;). Accents are trained into us by classroom environments where most of the input you receive is from accented peers, and where you're forced to output before you actually know how to make the proper sounds. It's a habit that can be learned and unlearned like anything else. This poster has added caveats like &quot;It's different for everyone&quot; to account for the growing number of people proving this myth incorrect. The truth is that it's all a matter of how you learned your target language. Accents are avoidable and fixable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree strongly. A child will pick up the proper sounds naturally within a short period of time. An adult can practice intensely using only native-speaker references for years and not have a truly perfect accent and intonation. </p>
<p>I live in one of the most diverse and international parts of the US, and I know a LOT (literally hundreds) of immigrants who learned English at various ages, formally or naturally. I don't know a single person who learned English as an adult who doesn't have a discernible accent. I think this evidence is particularly strong because a lot of ESL classes in the US are taught <em>entirely in English.</em> Where did they get incorrect accent cues from, if their English teacher was an American who didn't even speak their language to begin with? In my opinion, accent is innate, and unlearning an accent in a second language is probably about as hard as learning the language itself, if not harder.</p>
<p>I think one issue, from a neuroscience perspective, is that accent is an extremely subtle and nuanced aspect of language, with an immense complexity that rivals the entire vocabulary and grammar of a language. That is to say, accent is so complicated to learn that we can only really do it when our brains are biologically hard-coded to do so. After that critical window, it is much more difficult for us to pick up and imitate these subtle accent cues. The average adult learner would have to learn these cues explicitly, unlike a child. </p>
<p>Take a look at Dogen's lessons on pitch-accent in Japanese, and you'll begin to get a sense of how complicated these arbitrary accent rules are. He clearly has a much greater aptitude than the average adult for learning these things, and he's been studying intensely for many years, and yet he STILL feels that he frequently messes up the pitch-accents when he speaks.</p></div>		</li>
