<p>so yeah, it's pretty strong</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. A few years ago Altoona, PA had a transformer on the northern end of the city explode and it was visible miles to the south where I lived. Thre was a decent bit of moisture/fog in the air and it created an eerie flashing blue glow. </p>
<p>I remember hearing it blow, too. We were sitting outside on the patio and heard this rumbling boom echo from the north of us, the blue lights immediately started. Emergency services from seemingly everywhere nearby scrambled. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The corona effect is similar, but it involves currents due to self-capacitance, which necessarily limits them to be relatively small, resulting in dim blue light. For the transformer, I was talking about connected circuits running through the air.</p>
<p>If there is too much current, the air will heat to the point that there are too many free electrons to have discrete energy levels in the air molecules, and you get close to just a hot blackbody spectrum.  This is what happens with carbon arc lamps and arc welding.</p>
<p>In order to get a really bright light source which is also bright colored, you need a largish area of air with the current spread out so that the air where the current is flowing isn't too hot.    Most of the time when you randomly blow stuff up, this is not the result.</p></div>		</li>
