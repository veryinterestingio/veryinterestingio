			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I was gonna say. My legs ache horribly when I get a fever, but sitting in a really hot bath for a bit helps a lot. The relief OP is getting is probably from the hot water more than the Epsom salt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I take magnesium citrate during the day and magnesium taurine before bed and can anecdotally confirm, I recover from workouts quicker and sleep more easily. Family members have had the same experience. Worst that has ever happened was some diarrhea, but then I just take less the next day and I’m back to normal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My diet was poor and U was a smoker and started getting really bad foot cramps.  I would fill a bucket with hot water and soak my feet as I watched tv.  It helped but would have been more comfortable if I had a bigger bucket or smaller feet.</p>
<p>Told a doctor a while later at a basic check up.  He said &quot;banannas- you need magnesium.  You can take a supplement or just eat a couple banannas &quot;</p>
<p>Sure enough, when it happens, eating bananas does the trick.  I also buy Epsom salts as it was one of my mother's remedies but can't swear by it.  However it's good to have if you're growing tomato plants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it depends a bit on how high the fever is. If you're in dangerous territory, yes, bring the fever down, but a fever is your body fighting the infection.</p>
<p><a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003090.htm" target="_blank">MedlinePlus</a> says: &quot;A child has a fever when the temperature is at or above one of these levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>100.4°F (38°C) measured in the bottom (rectally)</li>
<li>99.5°F (37.5°C) measured in the mouth (orally)</li>
<li>99°F (37.2°C) measured under the arm (axillary)</li>
</ul>
<p>An adult probably has a fever when the temperature is above 99°F to 99.5°F (37.2°C to 37.5°C), depending on the time of day.</p>
<p>Fever is an important part of the body's defense against infection. Most bacteria and viruses that cause infections in people thrive best at 98.6°F (37°C). Many infants and children develop high fevers with mild viral illnesses. Although a fever signals that a battle might be going on in the body, the fever is fighting for, not against the person.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/fever-in-adults2" target="_blank">Harvard Medical School</a> says: &quot;Fever is part of your body's defense against infection-causing germs. By itself, fever is usually harmless, though a high fever can be miserable...Take a slightly warm, <strong><em>not</em></strong> cool, bath or apply damp washcloths to the forehead and wrists.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/safe-ways-to-treat-a-fever-4023633" target="_blank">VeryWell Health</a> says: &quot;Taking a bath can help bring down your fever, but the really important part is that it can't be a cold bath. Although that might seem like it would help more than taking a warm bath, getting in cold or ice water will cause shivering which can actually increase your internal temperature. Getting into a bath that is a comfortable temperature for you will help you relax and could bring down the fever as well.&quot;</p>
<p>So it sounds like a warm bath can be a good thing under the right circumstances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hrm, yeah, I can see that. I seem to get a low-grade fever for a couple days once every year or two; it aches all out of proportion to my actual temperature and the hot bath helps a lot. I can see where it could be dangerous, especially for a higher fever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what fevers do. Like an oven cleaning itself. However, a bath could be dangerous if you fall asleep or pass out.</p>
<p>Meds don't break a fever, they prevent it. </p>
<p>Be averagely sick for a week or two taking ibuprofen? Or be awful sick for a few days and not take anything? I think I'll just take the fever and be done in days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know the science but hot baths are soothing and probably increase bloodflow.  The dissolved salts mean your body has more buoyancy than in regular water which can relieve some pressure on people say with back pain because you float more readily.  You're giving your body a relaxing break if nothing else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hot water on the other hand helps increase blood flow, hence why people go pink in hot baths.</p>
<p>Edit: of couse salty water is denser than regular water, so it would make sense that the pressure would increase, but I doubt that it would be sufficient to do anything, but more likely is that for the water to dissolve the salt completely it helps to be hotter. Just thinking with my fingers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, freshwater has a density of 8.34 lbs/gal (ph for short) and high salinity saltwater is around 9.8 ppg. If you multiply the fluid density by depth in feet, the divide by 19.25, you get the hydrostatic pressure of the column of a fluid. Let's assume a 2ft deep bath tub. Fresh (tap) water would get us 0.87psi in hydrostatic pressure. The Epsom salt water solution would be 1.02psi. About a 18% increase in pressure which is a large increase, but still only a fraction of one pound per square inch. You wouldn't even be able to feel the difference if you tried.</p></div>		</li>
