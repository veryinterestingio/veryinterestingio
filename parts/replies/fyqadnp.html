<p>Sweden has Swish which is instant but thatâ€™s a different service, similar to Venmo I think.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Actually, it's not, it just seems that way.</p>
<p>If I swish 100 SEK to you, my bank will just temporarily pretend that my balance is 100 SEK lower, and your bank will temporarily pretend that your balance is 100 SEK higher. The actual transaction still takes a few days, but it's transparent to the user.</p></div>		</li>
