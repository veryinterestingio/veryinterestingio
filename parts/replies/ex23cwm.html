			<div class="markdown"><p>many species of spider can &quot;fly&quot; by putting out a little &quot;parachute&quot; or &quot;sail&quot; of webs that the wind then picks up. Your spider probably used a similar technique.Apparently they can travel quite far with this method. Charles Darwin observed spiders floating onto his ship while 60 mi offshore.</p>
