Thanks for your great in-depth response as well</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In terminal alcoholics the liver fails to filter ammonia from the bloodstream. The ammonia damages and / or kills nerves throughout the body including the brain.</p>
<p>My father had this condition after going on a bender that lasted for years. He was in the ICU for about three months. The nerves in his feet are completely shot, hardly any feeling at all. He also probably lost 10-15 IQ points and has early onset dementia due to general brain damage.</p>
<p>It's called Hepatic Encephalopathy</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe I had some version of this. For about the last year of my drinking I was basically unable to create any new memories, i.e. remembered being at my sister's new house on Christmas but could not remember where the bathroom was. After being in the hospital with acute liver failure and detoxing for a couple of weeks, I finally came to (could make new memories), and I actually woke up in a world that was shutdown due to covid. It was in April of 2020. I find that part just absolutely insane, it was very hard to process while coming out of that &quot;fog&quot;. It nows seems that my brain function is essentially back to normal, not like I lost any IQ points. But I continue to have some minor glitches in forming new memories, like I won't remember a conversation about a new movie or that something about a house I pass regularly has changed. I really liked the article on that link, as I find this all very interesting for obvious reasons, thanks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Omfg I think my MIL might have this. She’s a recovered alcoholic but she was awful for years. She always complains that her hands just don’t work right. And she feels like she has worms crawling in her skin. She wakes up crying constantly in the night, and she isn’t definitely not the sharpest tool in the shed IQ wise</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So HE is generally reversible, although some permanent dysfunction is often seen. In those with alcohol use disorder there are a TON of confounding factors- including chronic b vitamin deficiency that often causes peripheral neuropathy (ie that leg tingling you noted) and alcohol induced dementia. I’m sorry you have a family member that suffers from all this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ya they said when I overdosed that it was very likely I’d have short term memory loss due to lack of oxygen, no one knows how long I was laying there b4 they found me and such. Also some sort of lung issue from aspirating fluid and not breathing right. All good now 4.5 years later, don’t have the best memory but I smoke weed too so who knows lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neuroscience PhD here, this isn't quite right. Language is associated with the left hemisphere, but that doesn't mean it's the only part damaged - speech is probably just the most noticeable symptom. </p>
<p>Calling out lobes doesn't actually mean much. &quot;Parts of the frontal, temporal and parietal lobes&quot; = &quot;Parts of the front, side and top of the brain&quot;. They're literally just broad regions named after the skull bones above them.</p>
<p>Finally, I don't know much about drug toxicity in the brain but I'm pretty sure the impact would come from cell death and not some kind of 'blocking' of signals. It's more like parts of your motherboard burning out than pipes getting clogged. I would bet that drug damage to the brain is pretty similar to stroke damage where cells die off in an area due to adverse conditions and some function is lost.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice, I’m also a neuro PhD! My research is on psychoactive drugs. Just wanted to add that drug toxicity from (chronic) drug use very often implicates glutamate excitotoxicity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats right. Would it also be relevant to note that it might not even be just damage to these areas or certain areas causing this problem. For example, damage to the link between the visual processing area and wernickes are (for language comprehension) looks similar (in terms of what the patient can do) to simply damaging wernickes area. Therefore an inability to do something may not even be damage to an area, but might indicate damage to the connections between areas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a lot of the toxicity comes from the oxidation byproducts of excess dopamine.   Seriously neurotoxic compounds are produced by regular dopamine metabolism at neutralish pH.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to smoke a ton of weed throughout college, like every evening for at least four years. I often wonder if something similar to your explanation happened to my brain since it was still developing during that period.</p>
<p>I find it difficult to convey my thoughts sometimes, where I have the idea or concept but can’t find the right words as quickly. I don’t recall having that difficulty before I was a stoner and now that I’m sober, it’s more noticeable. I could have just gotten older and dumber though</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Weed isn't really neurotoxic per se, one of the issues with it is that constant heavy usage causes alterations and eventually shrinking in the networks responsible for emotion regulation, attention, memory, and reward, closer to a downregulation effect alongside an &quot;if you don't use it, you lose it&quot; mechanism. Evidence suggests that these functions can be restored to a significant extent with prolonged abstinence.</p></div>		</li>
