<p>But I personally want to know WHY human bodies overall decided that they need a lot of hair coming from the scalp and only a thin layer over the rest of the body. Why doesn’t my forearm need long hair?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just to be clear, nothing is decided here. Over thousands of generations, genes for hairy bodies/legs/arms became less common in the population due to natural selection. </p>
<p>Lack of hair, and sweating, are the aspects of the phenotype that were being selected for in humans for quite some time. It made our ancestors very effective long-distance runners. Hair on the head would have given protection from the sun. </p>
<p>Lack of hair on the body and arms helps sweat to evaporate more quickly, helping with endurance. </p>
<p>This is my current understanding of this, so it might not be completely correct.</p></div>		</li>

<li>We evolved in Africa, in a very hot climate.</li>
<li>Few animals rely on sweating to cool down. Most animals dissipate heat trough fast and shallow breathing, think of a panting dog.</li>
<li>Shallow breathing has an issue: think of drinking trough a straw. If you don't suck with enough force, water won't reach your mouth, it will just go up and down the straw. If you make shallow breaths, most of the fresh air will just go up and down your airways, without reaching your lungs. It still cools you down, though.</li>
<li>If an animal needs to run, he needs more O2, so he has to make deeper breaths, which are less efficient at dissipating heat. </li>
<li>We don't rely on respiration to cool down. We have lot of sweat glands instead. <strong>You want less hair on your body to allow sweat to evaporate more easily, meaning you cool down more.</strong></li>
<li>Studies have shown that a fit man can jog for long spans of time at a certain speed. At that same speed, animals need to breath deeply, so they eventually heat up too much and have to slow down.</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, we used to chase animals until they overheated, while we stayed cool because we had lot of sweat glands and scarce hair. This answers why we have lost body hair.</p>
<p>As for why we kept head hair, it's probably to protect the brain from the sun heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the result of natural selection and adaptation to human behavior.</p>
<p>Selecting mates with nice hair patterns, and wearing clothing to negate the need for total body fur coverage.<br />
Hair also serves to reduce friction/protect skin, short hair is best at this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The loss of hair on our bodies arose long before clothes. It's much more likely we lost it because sweat evaporates better with less hair, making those with less hair far better at maintaining their body temperature during exertion. Humans are fairly unique in the animal world for sweating. It's kind of our thing.</p>
<p>Still though, trying to figure out exactly what the evolutionary pressure for a certain evolutionary path is very tricky and ultimately an unknowable business. For instance, why do we still have some body hair? Maybe because it helps us feel bugs and what not. Maybe because it's insulative. Maybe it's sexual selection—as you say, that's very possibly why we have such crazy head hair. Probably a little bit of everything, but possibly none of those.</p></div>		</li>
