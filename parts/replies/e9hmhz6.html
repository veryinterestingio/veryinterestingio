			<div class="markdown"><p>In america yes. Bleaching processes in the paper industry have moved towards elemental chlorine free for the most part, but ClO2 is used sometimes, which does not produce elemental chlorine. Paper is one of the greenest industries in the US so there's not much impact.</p>
<p>Edit: I'm a paper engineer </p></div>		</li>

<p>Toilet paper is a mix of hardwood and softwood (roughly a 70/30 split). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bidet is off subject because when every jackass just jumps into this thread saying &quot;wadaboutBidets&quot; it doesn't add to the conversation, it doesn't address the question, and for some reason people want to pick a fight with me about why I don't like bidets when all I'm trying to do is stay on subject.</p>
<p>Yes alternatives exist, but talking about butt fountains doesn't address the impacts of TP. Make a different thread for it.</p></div>		</li>
