			<div class="markdown"><p>It me. Called it &quot;phasing out&quot; when I was a kid and was diagnosed as ADD. Adderall in middle school messed my junk all up and had really powerful episodes of disassociation and depersonalization. I don't drive because of it. I'm a great driver but I &quot;phase out&quot; almost immediately.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, I don't drive either. Freaks me out when I'm going about my business then realize I haven't been paying attention at all and I'm going 20km over the speed limit. Plus night driving is impossible with my visual snow added on.</p>
<p>Fuck me, though, I live in rural Canada and it's suicide to not drive. Nearest town is 30min away from me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a well known phenomenon.  Long straight highways require very little concentration to negotiate.  I remember 25 years ago when I was in drivers ed being warned about this.  They called it &quot;highway hypnosis&quot;.</p>
<p>Look, it's a thing:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can also happen when you drive a familiar route day in and day out. You don't exactly &quot;zone out&quot; you were always fully aware and awake, it's just  your brain doesn't think that anything important enough happened to keep it in short term memory.   </p>
<p>So when trying to remember what happened a few moments previously , the feeling that you &quot;zoned out&quot;is the brains way of saying &quot;oops! sorry,  Should I have kept that bit of memory?&quot;</p></div>		</li>
