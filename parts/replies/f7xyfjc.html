			<div class="markdown"><p>Morty: &quot;But, uh, Rick, why would we want to do that? I mean, don't you think that people are, like, stressed enough as it is?&quot;</p>
<p>Rick: -belches- &quot;Because we <em>can</em>, Morty! I don't know, maybe we can use it to build you an immunity to stress or something, Jesus. Maybe then you'll finally learn to go with&quot; -another belch - &quot;the flow.&quot;</p>
<p>Morty, slowly getting more stressed as he speaks: &quot;Aw geez, I don't think that sounds like a good idea, Rick. I mean, a lot could go wrong with that. And living with you is already pretty stressful and so is high school, and the world is a mess...with the political system, and the fact that the Earth is, you know, like <em>dying</em>, and I don't know if I'm going to get into college or be able to get a job afterwards and pay off my student loans.&quot;</p>
<p>Morty, continued, starting to tear up and panic: &quot;Oh God, I'm not gonna pay those loans off.&quot;</p>
<p>Rick, unimpressed: &quot;Here make sure you get that into the test tube.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>The biochemical variant of this claim, which has been introduced in the 1980’s (Frey, 1985), posits that crying influences well-being through the elimination, via tears, of stress hormones (e.g., cortisol) and toxic substances from the blood. In a test of this hypothesis, Vingerhoets and Kirschbaum (1997) measured the levels of salivary cortisol in women before and after watching an emotional movie. The levels of this stress hormone indeed decreased more in women who reported more intensive crying. While this finding seems to support Frey’s (1985) notion of clearance and detoxification of the blood via the tears, the fact that similar effects were observed after separation from the mother in young rhesus monkeys that do not produce emotional tears, but merely emit distress calls, seriously challenges the biochemical detoxification role of tears (Bayart et al., 1990). <strong><em>Such a finding thus indicates that decreases in cortisol levels are not necessarily the consequence of removal of this hormone through tearing.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's far from proven. I personally very much doubt it.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except that has nothing to do with reduced inflammation. It's an instant response that also occurs during dry heaving. It's the brain that does the stress releasing, not the actual act of evacuating toxins. I assume the same is true, really, with tears. Although tears happen to contain stress hormones.</p></div>		</li>
