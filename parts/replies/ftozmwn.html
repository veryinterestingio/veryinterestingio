			<div class="markdown"><p>US military submarines replaced ships speed and course based dead reckoning with the same gyroscope based inertial guidance system used by by the apollo moon missions. That system has since been replaced by a more sophisticated inertial guidance system.Same principals, but the gyro's account for any movement such as that from drifting with the currents and provide a true speed over ground not just speed thru the water. they are also incredibly sensitive. They also continuously account for changes in the speed needed to move one degree longitude at different latitudes and depth/altitudes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All of this it’s still essentially dead reckoning, however the inertial navigation systems on submarines are used to perform incredibly accurate dead reckoning by using many of the things you said, and a “few” additional factors: to include magnetic forces, gravitational anomalies of the ocean floor, and about a million other things which go into the calculations for the submarines position while it is submerged. While the internal navigation systems are gyroscopic in nature, the gyros have been replaced by laser embedded inertial devices. I spent 20 years in submarine navigation. And I cannot believe it took like 200 comments to mention Nathanial Bowditch, he is an absolute God when it comes to navigation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How can an inertial reference system tell the difference between the motion from the current and the motion from the ship itself?</p>
<p>I actually work in aviation, always wondered how the IRS could seperate wind speed from true airspeed since inertially they should &quot;feel&quot; the same to the unit?</p>
<p>Before that I worked in a factory doing R&amp;D on MEMS devices. We could fit a 3-axis gyro, 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis magnetometer and their ASICs on a 5mm x 5mm x 1mm chip :D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was trying to make a distinction between inertial guidance system dead reckoning and the course/speed dead reckoning the first commenter described.<br />
I was referring to ring laser gyro's when i said the apollo system was replaced. didn't go to far into that or the more complicated factors that need correcting for because of the nature of this sub. If this was ask science... but it's not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I'm not familiar with the Trident missile specifically, I am familiar with spacecraft guidance navigation and control. Inertial measurement works by integrating the accelerations on a vehicle to get velocity and integrating that again to get position. Inertial measurements are great in that they don't rely on needing to see anything. This is particularly useful during reentry environments where you may experience communications blackout. The downside is that errors accumulate, so over a long period of time the error can be quite substantial. For this reason, it's not unusual for spacecraft to primarily use inertial navigation and then use star tracking to eliminate the errors. </p>
<p>There are other ways to eliminate the errors as well. One particularly interesting way for deep space missions to do this is to receive communications signals from 2 antennas on Earth and triangulate their position. This is what the Mars Landers do. In fact, one of the ways they are trying to reduce the uncertainty in landing area for Mars 2020 is to send this uplink later. Instead of sending it a couple hours before reentry, they want to do it ~30 minutes before. Then there is less time for errors to accumulate and the spacecraft can land more precisely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to illustrate how accurate this can be, Shackleton's failed Arctic expedition on the Endurance that became trapped in ice and the stuff of legend, was able to save themselves by an incredible feat of dead reckoning by their navigator.</p>
<p>800 miles across some of the most treacherous seas on Earth in the Southern Ocean, with hardly any appearances of the sun or stars to get their bearings, through storms and turbulent waves the entire time, was able to hit a tiny little rock of an island after 16 days at sea.</p>
<p>Not recommended, but it just goes to show the accuracy possible with this method alone.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually Worsley was able to take a decent number of sun sights with his sextant during the trip, in some ways an even more impressive feat from an open boat in those waters.
