			<div class="markdown"><p>The menstrual cycle actually evolved to shed infertile or non-viable eggs from the lining, apparently. I was curious so I looked it up. Humans are the only species to do this, though, and I don't really know why, since other species have similarly taxing pregnancies. (The idea is to get rid of any misfires before the body spends too much energy trying to grow it, since pregnancy is long and difficult on the body and it doesn't want to waste that)</p></div>		</li>
