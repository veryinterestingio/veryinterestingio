			<div class="markdown"><p>It's mostly made of heavy elements, quite similar to Earth's core, just way more massive. The rockier part of the core is surrounded by a thick layer of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallic_hydrogen" target="_blank">metallic hydrogen</a> due to the immense pressure of the environment. Of course most information pertaining to the inner structures of other planets are mostly educated guesses because as it turns out, they are pretty difficult to examine closely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. It’s the same as the atmosphere, pretty much, but it becomes a liquid and then a solid under pressure. The same way that water vapor (gas) turns into rain (liquid) and then into ice (solid) if you keep applying pressure. Except in the gas giants’ case, it’s mostly hydrogen. Interestingly enough, we don’t know precisely what the structure of solid metallic hydrogen looks like at those temperatures and pressures. We have theories, but we obviously can’t see in there, and we can’t recreate them on earth.</p>
<p>It’s also possible that there’s a little bit of solid elements in there, like rock or metal. They would have sunk to the center over time and solidified, and there was obviously some of that flying around in the early solar system to make the rest of the planets. But we know it can’t be a lot of it — i.e. there’s no hidden earth-size ball of rock down there — because we can measure its density and composition indirectly via gravity.</p>
<p>Metallic hydrogen is pretty trippy stuff. It’s an obscenely good conductor, so as it sloshes around down there, it generates enormous magnetic fields. The magnetic field of Jupiter is the largest structure in the solar system outside of the sun’s, and is about 150 times wider than the planet itself.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's actually what impresses me the most. We can create shit hotter than the core of the Sun, but can't create enough pressure to form metallic Hydrogen.</p>
<p>Without knowing that in advance, if someone asked me which was possible and which wasn't, I'd guess the opposite.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The article you linked mentions tectonic forces, hydrothermal vents, and the presence of silica which points to liquid water interacting with rock.  So I don't think they believe the moon is made entirely of water.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The E ring is mostly made of ice droplets, but among them are peculiar nanograins of silica, which can only be generated where liquid water and rock interact at temperatures above about 200 degrees Fahrenheit (90 degrees Celsius). This, among other evidence, points to hydrothermal vents deep beneath Enceladus’ icy shell, not unlike the hydrothermal vents that dot Earth’s ocean floor.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's more that to have the mass to be considered a planet, it also has the gravity, and therefore pressure, to get elements to either phase change or start fusion. Not sure if there are any elements that can have their solid phase beyond the pressures that are found in the center of a gas giant. </p>
<p>Maybe a planetoid? Are there even gas planetoids? Would that then even have the gravity to hold the gasses together?</p></div>		</li>
