			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds exactly like human language learning and communication. Babies are born with the physical ability to produce all human sounds. Most of baby talk is just babbling and as they hear more language around them, they drop the unused sounds leaving just the sounds for what will become their native language spoken by their caretakers. &quot;Caretakers&quot; and not &quot;parents&quot; because if a baby is adopted internationally or their nanny/babysitter speaks a different language, the baby will pick up language from the new caretakers and not (just) their biological parents. It's why United States family can adopt a baby from Russia and the baby grows up to speak English and not Russian.</p></div>		</li>
