			<div class="markdown"><p>I think an important issue that goes undiscussed too often is the looming demographic transition in the developing world. We need to make sure the social norms change before modern medicine penetrates, or we’ll have a global baby boom the likes of which have never been seen. The planet can’t support the population of the developing world quadrupling over the next century.</p>
<p>I think the reason the issue isn’t discussed is that any viable solution requires the temporary cessation of medical aid to developing nations, which sounds like a monstrous thing to do. We want to feel like we’re doing the right thing in the moment, even if it’s harmful in the long run.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The actual problem is those developing countries becoming developed and wanting to use as much resources as an American or European. Take China for instance it wasn't a big deal when they had 900 million people living on less than a dollar a day. But now that those 900 million people are buying cars and wanting to eat beef and shrimp every day like Americans its killing the ocean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>China is already developed, there’s nothing we can do about that now. I’m referring to countries in subsaharan Africa for the most part, along with a few in SE Asia and Central America. </p>
<p>The potential baby boom would be disastrous even if they continued consuming resources at their current per capita levels, so it’s a stretch to say the “actual” problem is them wanting to live like westerners. It certainly doesn’t help, but it’s not the only problem. The looming population explosion can’t be ignored.</p>
<p>Regardless of which one you think is the bigger problem, we can’t allow presently developing countries to develop and grow their populations in the same way western nations and China have. It’s not fair to them, but the alternative is an ecological and humanitarian disaster, so something has to be done. </p>
<p>I can’t think of any way to reduce their desire to live like westerners do. That problem doesn’t seem to have a solution. The population boom could be prevented by ceasing food and medical aid to those countries, so there is a solution to that one. It’s just not a palatable solution.</p></div>		</li>
