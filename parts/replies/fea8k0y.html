			<div class="markdown"><p>As many fun features they pack into phones cameras, this is the one feature that they pretty much cannot put in there. You need a longer lens, it's just physics. This is a shot I took with my crappy Canon 700D with a cheap 55-250mm zoom lens: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/Gs7ipX7.jpg" target="_blank">https://imgur.com/a/Gs7ipX7.jpg</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>Maybe it doesn't point out of the flat side of the phone? That could be an idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stretch out your arm, thumbs up. Close one eye and cover the moon with your thumb. You‘ll see the moon‘s diameter is just half of the width of your thumb. That puts things into perspective. You tried to take a picture of an object half the width of your thumb.</p></div>		</li>
