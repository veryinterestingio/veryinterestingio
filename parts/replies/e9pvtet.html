<p>I still use Jerry Chow's 2010 thesis for reference - Chapters 3 and 4 have helped me so much. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe you can answer this question: have quantum computers been deployed for practical applications yet, or is it still theoretical and R&amp;D?</p>
<p>More clearly, if I was a large firm, could I buy a quantum computer today that would out perform a leading enterprise server?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quantum computing is still in R&amp;D phase, and speedups of quantum algorithms over classical ones remain to be seen experimentally. Additionally, quantum computers are not expected to outperform classical computers <em>in all tasks</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! A buddy of mine is na√Øve and fell for a scheme where the guy claimed to be using a quantum computer to beat the market.  I tried to convince him that I could achieve the same results with my time machine, but he wasn't THAT gullible. </p></div>		</li>
