			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically this. If you're a professional CEO (not a founder of the company), this isn't your first job. Learning never ends, but you should have ceased such failures earlier in your career. The board is saying that relegating BEVs to the niches that are the i3 and i8 (one looks like a child's toy and the other barely has any battery range) was a mistake beyond what a professional CEO should make. This probably isn't the first mistake the board thought he made, just the one that he's getting dismissed over. You don't air your dirty laundry out unless your have to (such as justifying a CEO's dismissal).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But a bad outcome doesn't necessarily mean the CEO is doing a bad job overall, or even that they made a bad decision on that one particular issue. You can do everything right and still lose. Firing the CEO is more often about managing external perception than is about putting the best person in the CEO position.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While true, I don't think this is the case here. ICE OEMs have messed up pretty big by ceding the &quot;looks like an actual car&quot; BEV market to Tesla. If BMW were pushing electric cars that looked similar to an M3 with the same results, that would be another story. Being outplayed is one thing, but not even trying is another story. While hindsight is 20/20, you had a massive government subsidies with real demand, from people who don't want to pollute anymore, that the CEO shunned. Not all approaches are equal, and it's better to risk new blood with a good track record instead of a known fool in the driver's seat. The benefit that an executive can bring alone is limited, but the CEO can completely tank the entire company alone.</p>
<p>If you disagree, I'd like to point you to the stock valuations of BMW and Tesla. Right now, Tesla is worth about 85% of BMW. A 16 year old company, with a laundry list of missteps, has just about caught up. Most of its value came from the past 6 years, which the current BMW CEO has largely presided over. If you think Tesla is overvalued, well, BMW would rather be overvalued at nearly twice its current stock price than not.</p></div>		</li>
