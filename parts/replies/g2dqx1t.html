			<div class="markdown"><p>Makes sense. Just today I found a lot of frogs hanging out side the lunch trailer's AC. Condensation was dripping in one spot attracting flies. These frogs hopped a 100yds from the nearby state protected lake to eat these flies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw a bit on QI that said that the disgust we feel towards cockroaches is mutual. If we touch them, they furiously clean themselves. I'm not sure a cockroach could feel as disgusted by me as I am of it, but idk</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, in South Australia there's large cockroaches that flies. I saw one coming near me on the ground, I tried to slowly walk away but he charged into my head and face with those loud wings while I ran for my life. I'm never going to Australia after this experience ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here is a nightmare fuel memory for you. I was in India, on a bus, it was an overnight bus. We stopped at a roadside tea stand with toilet area for people to get off/get tea/whatever. The lights on the bus were off as many were asleep. We could feel flies or something and kept swatting but it didn't seem to do much. My friend turned on his super low battery flashlight to find the fly - we saw cockroaches, everywhere. Small ones. Covering the chair in front, to the side, on the floor, on us.. You remember that scene in Harry Potter where Ron is sort of cry/screaming about the spiders? That was us for about an hour.</p></div>		</li>
