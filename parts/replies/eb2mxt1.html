			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would terminal velocity of the raindrop be slower than that of a skydiver?  If anything I'd think the raindrop has less wind resistance and would fall marginally faster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Less wind resistance, but not less proportional wind resistance. Volume goes up cubically with radius increase, while surface area goes up quadratically. You can't make a direct comparison, because rain drops and humans are a different shape, but you would expect mass and hence force exerted due to gravity to go up faster than surface area aka wind resistance. Barring something that catches the air and makes simple calculations not accurate, larger objects of roughly the same density should have higher terminal velocities than raindrops.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The terminal velocity of something falling through fluid is the speed at which the force of drag up matches the force of gravity down. Objects of different densities and shapes fall at different speeds. <em>In general</em>, larger objects fall faster, as there is more mass behind each square meter of frontal area.</p>
<p>A human hitting the ground at terminal velocity will die. A cat might be injured but is likely to survive. A mouse has nothing to worry about, and an elephant would explode.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wind resistance is a function of area and mass is a function of volume. Both rain drops and humans have about the density of water. As size scales, area increases as length squared, while volume and mass increase by length cubed. Because of this, the ratio of weight to wind resistance increases as size increases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to figures given elsewhere, the terminal velocity difference is about 51 m/s â‰ˆ 183 KPH.  If kinetic energy increases by the square of velocity, then (183/100)^2  = 3.3 times more energy in each impact.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why you avoid freefalling through clouds.  They look so cute and soft and fluffy until you're going through them.  That's when you remember your old science teacher telling you that &quot;clouds are ice crystals held aloft by air currents&quot;. After landing, every bit of exposed skin area looked (and stung) as if it had been sand-blasted.  Only made that mistake once....</p></div>		</li>
