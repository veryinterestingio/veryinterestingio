<p>I'm picturing chickens in bulky pressure suits.  Not graceful, majestic!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't actually remember... I thought it was Harsh Mistress, but reading the Wiki article about it (and searching the text) I'm not finding the passage I'm remembering, so I think it might not even be Heinlein.</p>
<p>I kind of remember it being more a mystery novel involving lasers being shot off lunar mirrors to kill people inside the habitat (spoiler alert)?   But again, maybe I'm conflating multiple stories here.  </p>

<p>I bet you could make some massive buildings on the moon with the low gravity. If the whole building could be pressurized, you could definitely fly around inside. (maybe not without a battery or something)</p></div>		</li>
