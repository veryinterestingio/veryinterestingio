			<div class="markdown"><p>A better analogy may be switches.     If you flip the light switch on in your room, that light will turn on.  But if you pull the breaker to that whole section of the house, the light will turn off.   But as soon as you flip the breaker back on, that light will come back on since the switch for it is still on.   </p>
<p>The wording isnt as fluid (pun intended) but this may make a little more sense?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is usually how I describe it, but SSDs I think use capacitors (I know some do) so the pool of water analogy may be more accurate (capacitors stay charged until drained even without power).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>‘Electricity’ means a macroscopic electron drift or current (<em>movement</em> of charge) due to an applied voltage, as may be provided from your mains. That’s the pumping. Electric charge isn’t that (it’s the water on its own). It’s just electrons chilling (or rather <em>not</em> chilling, if we are speaking in a positive sense). You and I are full of electrons and other charged particles all the time (though we do have currents going on within us). This is about a particular distribution of charges being sustained or ‘trapped’. But a large scale current isn’t being applied. That would <em>change</em> what is being stored. So no, it isn’t due to electricity as such.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent question! That's absolutely true of related forms of memory, flash is like that picture, but with a pressure gauge hooked up to the bottom. You can read the pressure (voltage) without touching the water (charge) since the read process only measures it indirectly. Volatile memory is leaky enough that it needs to be topped off occasionally. </p>
<p>To get a little more technical, you're reading stored voltage with a specialized FET (field effect transistor). In a FET, the electric field near the gate pin controls how well current can flow from source to drain; unlike a BJT (bipolar junction transistor) which needs an input current to control main the current flowing through the transistor. Even then, a conventional FET memory circuit is still a little too leaky to last very long. Flash memory uses floating gate MOSFETS, which is a super specialized form of FET. In a floating gate MOSFET, the gate pin is isolated so charges have a really hard time making their way in or out of the gate pin (basically the tank that you're reading the pressure from doesn't really leak). When you want to change the stored value, you have to put a strong enough electric field near the gate pin that electrons tunnel through the insulator to get in or about. It's like shooting a fire hose into the air to fill the tank, and sucking enough air down that you get some water too. Or like you're blasting/sucking the water straight through the walls of the tank.</p></div>		</li>
